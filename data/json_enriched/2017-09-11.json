Unfortunately, other attacks have also taken place outside the borders of the European Union and we are also close to the non-European countries which are subject to this barbarism. Today, 11 September, is the sixteenth anniversary of the attacks on the Twin Towers. In recent years, many countries have been victims of repeated attacks: yet, each of them strengthens our determination to fight terrorism together and consolidates our unity and strengthens our stubborn hope for a better world. We are proud and proud of our life, of our freedom and proud of our democracy, which we will defend without changing our way of life. We do not intend to bow our heads in the face of terrorism at all. But, unfortunately, today we must also commemorate other innocent victims who lost their lives in the last tragic natural events that hit regions of the European Union, Caribbean Sea countries and even the United States this summer, until yesterday of America.

One in three women has experienced at least one form of physical and sexual violence since the age of 15. One in twenty women has been raped. A woman dies every three days in France, following domestic violence. Behind these numbers are dramas and tragedies that have shattered the lives of many women and their children. Let me tell you a true story. A 35-year-old woman, supported by the SOS Femmes association in her department for several years, lodged a complaint against her companion for death threats in November 2015. The complaint was dismissed. Then, when she had started divorce proceedings, she was killed in November 2016 by her partner, who stabbed her with 24 stab wounds. Their 11-year-old eldest, who was present at the murder, tried to intervene to protect his mother and was injured. This is one of the realities of gender-based violence and, when this violence threatens half of our population, we must take all our responsibilities. This is what the European Union is doing by joining the Istanbul Convention. This is a strong commitment to protect women wherever they live in Europe. The Istanbul Convention is the first legally binding international instrument on violence against women. The convention pursues a comprehensive approach that combines prevention of violence, protection of victims and prosecution of those responsible. To eradicate violence against women, it is not only a question of combating the violence itself, but also a profound change in the mentalities of our society. This violence is rooted in a broader framework of discrimination and persistent inequalities between men and women. Even today, women are still confronted with sexism in the private and professional sphere, are more affected by precariousness and earn less than men, are less represented in political bodies and in corporate executives, and in the media or advertisements continue to convey stereotypes and degrading images. It is these deep roots, deeply rooted in our societies, that we must fight. There is no fatalism on my part in these remarks, but putting words into this violence and discrimination and realizing the extent of the phenomenon is an essential first step. We can act. I am thinking of education, the main driver of change in a society. From an early age, girls and boys must be educated in gender equality and respect for the dignity and fundamental rights of each person. Only education can sustainably instill new and fairer behaviors. I would like to add that this report makes it clear that denying a safe and legal abortion is violence against women, and I am not the only one to say this. The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women recently affirmed that denial of a safe abortion is a form of gender-based violence and may even, in some cases, amount to torture. Parliament continues to speak out against the reactionary and repressive initiatives of certain governments which undermine the right to dispose of one's body. If some people think they can decide for a woman, they are wrong. We are honoring here the exemplary struggle of thousands of European women, whether Spanish, in 2014, or Polish, in 2016. I congratulate them once again for their courage and commitment. It’s a message of hope. Mobilization citizen can bend the most conservative governments and the most regressive and degrading bills. I am proud to have carried this report so important against violence against women, half of humanity, I remind you. I warmly thank the co-rapporteur, Ms Corazza Bildt, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, who have done an admirable job on this dossier. But this is only the first step and there is still a long way to go. I will be particularly attentive to the implementation of the convention, because that is the real issue. The necessary financial and human resources are needed for these measures to have an impact on the lives of women. I therefore call on the Commission to present a comprehensive European strategy, with a legislative act on the prevention and fight against violence against women. It is urgent not to wait.

Today with our report we give a voice to the millions of women whose lives are devastated by violence, saying loud and clear: You are not alone. We care. We also send a message of support to all those committed to protect women and girls – authorities, civil society – and we pay tribute to their work and tell them that the aim, with the accession of the Istanbul Convention, of the European Union is to give them more tools, a better legal framework to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence, and protect victims. Violence against women is a terrible crime and should be punished as such. In Europe today, at home, women continue to be beaten, and often in front of their children. In public places women risk being harassed and raped going to a swimming pool, a music festival, a beach, and more and more young women are harassed and persecuted on the net. On social media it has become a global phenomenon. I think about Tiziana, a young woman who committed suicide because of spreading her intimate videos by her ex-boyfriend, and Maria Rashidi, disfigured with acid by her husband, who, like Lucia, had the courage to denounce him and became a women’s rights activists. Many teenagers are raped: too drunk to defend themselves, with friends taking videos and publishing them on social media, thinking it is funny. It is new forms of violence – revenge pornography, sex extortion, voyeurism. Violence is now trivialised and victims are mocked. Freedom from violence, dear colleagues, is a fundamental right, and the Istanbul Convention is the first and only international legally-binding act that criminalises violence against women and recognises gender-based violence as a breach of human rights and a form of discrimination. Let us be clear: we are talking about men’s violence against women out of jealousy, revenge, frustration, alcohol. Often they cannot accept women to be strong, independent, modern, making their own choices and daring to live them. Often the culture clash for families coming from other countries and young women who just want to live like their schoolmates, in a dress, in a western way of living is too strong for their own families to accept. Is there really any honour in killing a girl just because she has decided to take off her scarf? It happened in Sweden two weeks ago. She thought she was in Europe and she could be free. Violence against women is too often tolerated and seen as a private issue, and we need to ensure more convictions of perpetrators. The Convention provides for strict sanctions to combat impunity and extend measures to protect victims, such as restraining orders, shelters, medical and psychological assistance, prevention measures, training of officials, education programmes, responsible media and combating stereotypes. It recognises that, in order to eradicate violence against women, we need to improve equality between women and men, change mentality, combat sexism, and empower women. It is time to shift the guilt from the victim to the perpetrator. Women must feel that it is not worth going through the painful process of telling the terrible stories, the shame, the embarrassment unless there is a credible judicial follow-up. Member States have to criminalise by law gender-based violence and also ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. I visited shelters in Sweden, Italy, Malta, Greece, and many dedicated people who help women victims. More resources have to be given to them. I would like to finish by saying that I welcome the historical step forward of the EU’s signing of the Istanbul Convention in May this year.

Your interim report is forceful and ambitious and thus reflects the urgency to take more and concrete actions against this tragedy, affecting millions of women and girls individually and society as a whole, all over Europe. I am grateful to both rapporteurs, Madam Anna Maria Corazza Bildt and Madam Christine Revault D’Allonnes Bonnefoy, for the huge and joint effort made in preparing the document, informed by a number of hearings that allowed gaining better insights into the phenomenon and the many challenges, both legal and practical, in combating it. I would also want to extend my thanks to the Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) for the valuable input that the process received through the opinion adopted by this Committee. The Commission welcomes very much the report’s strong recognition of the Istanbul Convention as the best available to step up, together with the Member States, the European Union’s efforts in tune with our existing policy and legal framework and the Union’s international human rights agenda. Firmly rooted in international human rights instruments on gender equality, the Istanbul Convention is, on the one hand, the most comprehensive and holistic convention for the time being, and on the other hand, a highly pragmatic instrument. It requires precise actions to be taken and parties to be accounted for. Therefore, I am glad that the EU signed the Istanbul Convention in June as part of the Commission’s efforts in this year of focused actions to eliminate violence against women. The Commission will continue to push the progress towards the EU ratification in the ongoing Council discussions on the terms of conclusion. Still, let me recall the mixed character of the Convention, which includes areas that are not covered by Union exclusive competence. This will continue to raise difficult and sometimes sensitive questions that we will need to reconcile with the political ambitions that are widely shared with the vast majority of Member States. Beyond the strong support for the Union’s accession expressed in the report, we are also grateful for the many concrete indications on how to arrange the EU’s future implementation of the Convention’s obligations, both in organisational and substantive terms. We will give them thorough consideration. The report rightly emphasises the need to give particular attention to vulnerable groups to address their specific needs, such as female refugees, and to enable all victims to actually use support facilities, as well as the links between violence and economic dependence and empowerment and the related need to see our efforts to combat violence as part of our overall strategy to achieve full and genuine gender equality in the European Union. I would like to use this opportunity to inform you that this year, the annual European Commission colloquium on fundamental rights, led by first Vice-President Timmermans and myself, will be dedicated to women’s rights, and that violence against women is one of the key topics on its agenda. It will take place on 20 and 21 November. I am pleased that the parliamentary event on violence against women will also take place on 21 November.

Although this is an interim report, it is important for the European Parliament to reaffirm its firm and firm stance against violence against women. Violence against women is an endemic, deep-rooted social scourge that knows no borders, in Europe as in any other part of the world: women suffer daily abuse and violence, with devastating physical and psychological consequences. Statistics need to be updated every hour, every minute, every second. The European Union has made gender equality one of its founding principles but often women in every sector have to do much more than men to ensure their rights are protected and are, at the same time, strongly discriminated against in participating in economic life , social, political and cultural, as well as being under-represented in the various decision-making processes. If violence is added to these unfavorable conditions, the principle of equality loses all meaning. Dear colleagues, these reasons have guided my work in the eight years that have seen me as a Member of the European Parliament: I have participated in countless initiatives to ask for the accession of the European Union to the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women. The convention, through its comprehensive legal framework to prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence, will send a strong political message on the Union's commitment to combat this phenomenon. But since the European Union cannot claim the primacy of its right in this field, the repression of these discriminatory and violent phenomena, based precisely on gender, has so far been competence of the various internal rights, with inevitable repercussions on the level of differences, not only in terms of sanctioning responses to those who commit these crimes, but also in terms of support for women themselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "I know there is unfortunately a great deal to be said in these areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Madam President, for a long time we have been demanding the need to consider gender violence as a problem of public order, as a responsibility shared by the whole of society, and not a problem that must be solved in the sphere of the family or in the sphere of of the houses.

The binding legal act is an important addition to the existing treaties, norms and standards in the field of women's rights worldwide and should be seen as the golden standard.

As I was approaching Duisburg main station, a guy came up to me very suddenly from behind, without me seeing him, and grabbed me between my legs. I turned around – I was in complete shock and was outraged – and tried to run after him and scream and curse at him with only one thought in my head: that if I scared him enough, he would not do this to any other woman again in his life. After a couple of blocks, I lost him in the dark and I called the police. The police came straight away with three cars. They interrogated me and asked me if I was feeling fine, and whether I needed psychological support. They called for a search to find this guy and even took my jacket and my dress to find traces. I felt safe again. They brought me home and I felt that I was taken seriously at this time. I know that I owe this police reaction to the debates that we had in the last month around the Istanbul Convention. That is why I now want to give my thanks to all the women in this Chamber, and also in the Member States and all over the world, who have fought for this to happen. But still, even though I had this positive experience, there are tens of thousands of women who do not get this treatment when they are harassed or face sexualised violence. They still face being ridiculed and not being taken seriously. Without the millions of women who fought for this Convention and for other steps that were taken against violence against women, this would not have been possible. So without these pioneers and without documents like the Istanbul Convention, the fight against violence against women is still not a given. The fact that I could feel safe and that we are struggling to have every single woman in the world feeling safe needs to be our motivation to continue and to exceed the Istanbul Convention in its full scope and not to let one day pass without fighting against violence against women. So we need to take this step now. This will certainly not be the last step, but a very important and historic step on the way to a society without violence against women.

Violence against women, whatever its origin or form, must be fought fiercely. The woman is what we hold most dear on this earth: it is she who gives life. No civilized society can tolerate the slightest violence against these women, against women all over the world. France, like all the countries of the European Union, fights daily against all forms of violence that affect women. If our leaders sometimes lack foresight on the new threats weighing on them - I am thinking in particular of radical Islamism which locks them in from all points of view - they are the only ones who have the instruments of criminal law to fight against this violence. . The European Union is by no means legitimate to accede to the convention and even less to ratify it. Only sovereign states can and it will not have escaped your notice that only 14 out of 28 member states have. How can you not interpret your request for ratification as a new attempt to override the opinion of the people and as the establishment of a supra-state decision-making process? Indeed, once ratified by the European Union, the Istanbul Convention can be imposed on States which do not wish to ratify it. It was for show; let's get to the bottom of it. If the text of the convention and your justification for ratifying it were good, we could have rethought the way to proceed and focused on the root of the problem: violence against women. Why do some Member States rightly refuse to ratify a convention aimed at combating violence against women? Certainly because they are aware of your faults communitarianism and the ideological aspect of this convention. Once the convention has been ratified and finally imposed on all member states, any criticism of - I quote - sex, gender, race, color, language, religion, fortune, birth, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, migrant or refugee, political opinion, opinion simply and national or social origin will be condemned. Your text is not intended to concretely protect women victims of violence. It aims above all to establish communitarianism. The only thing these communities have in common is that they will be oppressed by the culprit of all evil: the white male, straight, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic and so on. Ladies rapporteurs, because at no point in your text you mention it, I would like to end by emphasizing the danger that weighs today on European women threatened in their body and soul by hordes of uncontrollable migrants . Unfortunately, the news regularly gives us sordid examples and this danger owes its existence only to the suicidal migration policy that you support.

That's shocking. It happens everywhere, in all walks of life, in all age groups and in all Member States. Yes, and it has become socially acceptable again to make fun of women in a sexist way. It is well known that everything begins with words. The Istanbul Convention is an attempt by the international community to put a stop to these tendencies: It clearly states that violence against women and domestic violence represent a violation of human rights and should be prosecuted accordingly. The European Parliament has campaigned for this in all phases and has always worked to ensure that we are ready today. It would probably have taken longer without our involvement. And one can rightly complain that everything takes so terribly long. But it is important that it doesn't stop at Sunday speeches. And it's primarily about implementation, it's about ensuring that existing law is actually implemented. The resolution of the LIBE and FEMM committees points in the right direction. It shows how to proceed. It is particularly important that appropriate education and awareness measures are taken. Surely it cannot be that young people experience violence as “cool”. The aim is to raise awareness among the state bodies such as the police and the judiciary.

In this regard, I would like to mention the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights last March, with which Italy, one of the first Member States to sign and ratify the convention, was declared in default in protecting a victim of acts of domestic violence and therefore ordered to pay compensation. By this I mean that the mere act of ratification obviously cannot by itself stop the violence. Instead, a synergy is needed between the legislative and judicial systems, involving law enforcement and assistance services. Justice must be friendlier to women and therefore must be swift and certain. It is also necessary to implement the economic resources of all the structures in charge of assisting and helping women, also and above all in smaller centers, where it is even more difficult to report the violence suffered, especially if domestic.

Religious violence against women in parts of society, which is shaped by Sharia law, is not only a fact, but is unfortunately increasingly not even prosecuted by our courts. Honor killings of women of the second and third generation of migrants are often carried out in full agreement and with the consent of the family and their clans. The number of unreported cases of child marriages is increasing rapidly: They are concluded abroad and mostly helplessly approved by our authorities. I wonder where our much-invoked European values ​​are. Or when I think of New Year's Eve 2015/2016 in Cologne as an example and then of numerous Austrian and German cities on New Year's Eve, where there was massive sexual assault on women, then this clearly shows this dire development: namely, the contempt for western European image of women by a growing part of the fundamental Islamic population - not least due to the mass immigration of 2015. I believe the Union is increasingly blind and inactive here and ignores these socio-religious problems. Increasing the gender budget would not help us much. The vicious circle of silence and the vicious circle of loneliness must be put to an end. Violence against women, I agree with you, of course, is not a private matter. Sexual assaults and abuses cannot be excused by referring to tradition, custom or “one has a different culture”.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 37, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Carlos COELHO", "mepid": "1892", "text": "- Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT on all her intervention in this fight and all the colleagues who raised their voices.

Half of the Member States of the European Union have not ratified the Convention and we should ask ourselves why this is so. The definition of gender as stated in this convention assumes that a man is not born as male or female, but that his “gender” is a matter of his personal choice. This is contrary to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which says that gender refers to two sexes - male and female - which is to date the only international legally binding definition.

But we have to continue what we are doing and I am convinced that the accession of the EU to the Istanbul Convention is an important step forward. This is the way that we can better join forces – the EU and the Member States – to come up with a truly efficient and balanced mixture of preventative measures and repressive measures. I want to emphasise that yes, we have to speak also about repression because we speak about crime, we speak about the need to come with an efficient response from the side of the law enforcement authorities in the Member States and to better protect women and children. The Istanbul Convention and accession to the Convention will give us, among many other new things and opportunities, a better way of collecting data and of analysing the root causes of violence against women. Through that we will be able to better understand the role played by women’s economic dependence and this will encourage us to do more in this respect. What is the impact of the passivity of our society? We see that part of our society thinks that it is normal to beat women, that domestic violence is something we cannot eliminate, that violence against women is something that the victims in many cases deserve. This is unacceptable and we have to convince all our society that this is not normal. We will understand better how to assess the influence of alcohol because this is not discussed very often but we see that this is also a big issue. We will understand better how to encourage the victims to go and report to the police, how to get them to trust more the institutions which have been established and which are in the EU to help the victims, because still we see that only about 15-20% of the victims report such violence. We will understand better how to achieve better law enforcement, and here again I speak about criminal law in the Member States. We have to better understand and come up with appropriate action to address violence stemming from bad traditions and so-called culture, which was also discussed here. No culture can be the excuse for violence against women and children. We should do much more to explain to young boys and girls that this is not normal to accept violence, that it is not normal that their fathers beat their mothers, in many cases. We will understand better and we will be better able to measure the trend, because you see that in European society violence is on the rise in general, and we see this trend online. We see the rise of violence against women and bullying and sexual harassment. We see this trend and we need to be able to better measure and to come up with the proper reaction. I strongly disagree that this is an ideological issue. I cannot understand how somebody can look at it from this point of view because violence is a crime, unacceptable according to the law. Murdered women are often victims of sexually-motivated crime. What is ideological about our effort to eliminate this from Europe? I must say in reaction to what Mr Niedermüller said, yes, I am worried about the development in some Member States which are looking at Russia as an example of the way forward. In Russia there is a law which says that the first blow in domestic violence does not count. This is not the way the EU should go in the 21st century. Very often when I speak about how to combat violence against women I have in my speeches the horrifying figure of how much it costs. Some of you mentioned EUR 230 million a year. I am always embarrassed to mention this figure because this is not about the money, this is about the life and health of women and children.

I thank Christine and all the other shadow rapporteurs. Together we are saying: stop violence against women. We share this common goal: this report is about achieving and increasing more, stronger tools. Our report is a wake-up call to the Member States to do more. The time has come to move from words to action. Member States have to overcome their reservations and speed up the EU’s accession and ensure a broader scope, not only in terms of cooperation in justice and criminal law, asylum and non-refoulement. Some points raised by colleagues: cooperation in criminal law is an EU competence foreseen by the Lisbon Treaty. We already have tools at EU level to deal with serious crimes, trafficking, sexual abuse, protection of victims, and recently even the directive to combat terrorism. I would like to join the call to the Commission to propose a legislative act on violence against women as a way to strengthen our capabilities. I also understand, colleagues, the concerns and the controversy surrounding the word ‘gender’. You know how much, throughout the process, I reached out with genuine goodwill to clarify, bridge the gap and leave no misunderstanding. A definition of gender-based violence, in the Commission, according to the Council of Europe, is ‘violence done to a woman or a girl, just because she is a woman or a girl.’ It is not an ideology; it has no hidden agenda; there is definitely nothing against Christian or family values. I do ask the Commission again to clarify, together with the Council of Europe, this misleading interpretation and engage in dialogue with the Member States on the issues that prevent the full ratification and implementation. And I fully support the work of the Council of Europe GREVIO, but they should speed it up. My last point, Mr President, raised by colleagues, is the issue of migrants also having rights and duties, and having to respect our laws, and religious culture never being an excuse to oppress women. Respect for women should become a social norm, but we can never stigmatise migrants for violence in Europe. Women and girls on the move are actually victims of violence – the slavery of our time. Let us, colleagues, have a special focus on children and continue to put pressure on the Member States.

In the EU, direct CO2 emissions from aviation account for approximately 3% of the total. With the anticipated growth in air traffic, emissions in 2050 are expected to be seven to ten times higher than in 1990. This is according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and their projections. Clearly such a growth necessitates a policy response. In this Parliament we have taken the view that we must reduce the carbon impact of the growth in air travel. We all know the history of how we arrived where we are with ‘stop the clock’, so I do not intend to expand on that, but I do want to emphasise Parliament’s commitment to working with ICAO to find a mutually acceptable position.  To this end, during 2016, I led three separate delegations from Parliament to ICAO in Montreal. This represents an unprecedented level of commitment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and we were very pleased to see an agreement in October 2016 to establish an offsetting system to deliver carbon neutral growth in the aviation sector. As a consequence, the Commission was required to adopt a proposal for a regulation amending the 2003 Emissions Trading System (ETS) Directive with respect to aviation and this was presented earlier this year.  Since then we have moved at a fast pace in Parliament with a view to reaching an agreement between co-legislators before the end of this year. Under the EU ETS aviation provisions – they have never applied in their original international scope due to legal challenges by third countries on the applicability of EU legislation to their airlines – only intra-EEA flights are fully covered.  In its proposal, the Commission extends this derogation beyond 2017 and there is clarity about the new ICAO offsetting scheme and how it should apply to international flights when it enters into force in 2021. Moreover, the Commission text includes a review clause requiring it to report to Parliament and the Council on relevant developments in ICAO’s work and, if appropriate, propose to amend, delete or extend the derogation. In my report I fully support the Commission’s approach, namely that we await progress on the global market-based measure (the GMBM). It is untrue and misleading to imply that my report does not take this position. As the rapporteur, I have proposed to augment the original proposal by adding a time limit on the latest derogation, aligned to fit with ICAO’s own decision—making deadlines. This reflects legitimate concern over the GMBM and whether it will deliver on its commitment to ensure carbon neutral growth from 2020.  At present, based on the current negotiations within ICAO – and they are very current and going on as we speak – progress on the offsetting provisions has been painfully slow, with some parties – and I mention China in particular – now objecting to ICAO’s role in setting the rules for the GMBM.  I believe it would be remiss to make a decision on the future of the ETS in support of a GMBM that is, for the time being at least, vague and imprecise in its framework. A time—limited derogation is therefore required to maintain political pressure on the Council, and indeed the Commission, to develop a long—term regulatory solution. We must learn from the issues encountered with previous iterations of the legislation and provide the sector with much needed investor certainty as soon as work is completed on the GMBM’s reporting provisions on the transparency and the environmental integrity of the offset registry.  The Environment Committee’s report also provides for the designation of revenues generated by auctioned allowances to climate finance, aircraft design and fuel-efficient technologies, plus a schedule for the Commission’s review report and what it needs to include as a minimum, as well as stressing the need for enhanced transparency of ICAO’s work in preparing and implementing the scheme. The report carries over amendments pertinent to the aviation sector in the wider ETS Phase IV proposal, including an increase in the number of auctioned allowances, provisions already voted on in this House.  For all these reasons, I think it is vital that Parliament pursue the time limit on the derogation. Details of the scheme from ICAO are not well enough advanced to be able to say with any certainty that they will be exactly as we currently see them. ICAO is a large international organisation with almost 200 member states and their internal negotiations are not yet complete. I do not believe that Parliament should be complicit in undermining our own negotiating position and recommend that we vote accordingly.

I appreciate the hard work of the rapporteur Ms Girling on this proposal and would like to thank her for her efforts. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their valuable contributions and their support for a swift and a smooth process. Aviation greenhouse gas emissions are growing sharply and clearly have the potential to put at risk the achievement of the climate targets we committed to in Paris two years ago if they are not adequately addressed. The European Union has taken the lead in addressing these emissions by covering them under its Emissions Trading System and is also working hard at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for effective global measures. Precisely, this Commission proposal we are debating today follows the adoption by the ICAO Assembly in October last year of a resolution on the so-called CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme), a global measure to offset aviation emissions beyond 2020 levels after many years of efforts and following up on the Paris Agreement sealed a year before.  As we already recognised, this was an important and welcome first development to address aviation emissions globally, despite being below the European Union ambition. We must acknowledge, however, that a lot of work is still needed to make CORSIA operational by 2021, namely, agreeing the CORSIA rule book in the form of standards and recommended practices presently under negotiation in Montreal and then the adoption of national measures for its concrete implementation. The Commission proposal duly takes this dynamic context into account. First, to facilitate the operationalisation of CORSIA, it maintains the intra—EEA scope for aviation from 2017 onwards. On the other hand, the proposal foresees a new review once there is more clarity as regards international developments for the operationalisation of the global scheme, namely, ICAO rules and how they will be implemented. And finally, it contains an empowerment to adopt delegated acts on monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions in order that the European Union is ready to implement CORSIA in that regard. I want to remind you all of the imperative need for swift progress on this file, paving the way for a final text before the end of the year. If the amendment to the Directive does not enter into force by early 2018, the full scope, covering all flights to and from third countries, will kick off again, and this situation will be problematic.  I would like to underline as well that, in our view, extension of the intra-EEA scope, combined with a review, will allow the European Union to rightly deal with the situation we will face in the coming years. On the one hand, we need to facilitate international developments and get ready to implement CORSIA. On the other hand, we will have to discuss the future rules for the European Union ETS in a context where CORSIA becomes a reality.  I am glad to see that the report you are voting on today shares this basic approach of continuing the intra-EEA scope, to then undertake a new review once there is more clarity on international developments. Let me, however, provide some comments on two key aspects of the rapporteur’s final proposal which raise some concerns on our side.  First, I would like to warn against an automatic return to the full scope right after 2020 in the absence of a new review. That threat could create difficulties with third countries which are now positively involved in ICAO negotiations and are a priori committed to CORSIA implementation. Let’s face it. ICAO has been given little time to complete the negotiation process and it will need to be followed by domestic implemented measures.  We in the European Union are well equipped since it will have to take place through the ETS, but others have much more to develop domestically. So one cannot exclude some delay in the operationalisation, but this would not by itself be enough in our view to trigger an automatic return to full scope and thereby lose years of efforts in the ICAO. In addition, the automatic snap-back to full scope as soon as in 2021 would put the European Union in a difficult and time-constrained situation again when we undertake the necessary review, making it more difficult to duly take into account and discuss all the intricacies of the post-2020 period.  Even in the best case scenario, let us remember that compliance with the so-called ‘pilot phase’ obligations will only happen in 2024, at least if all goes as planned and there are no delays. We may need, therefore, some time to have a clear picture of how CORSIA performs and delivers. We have to bear in mind as well that in the context of the future review we can always decide to go back to a wider scope or cover certain routes to third countries in the light of the international situation at that moment. But this is something that would deserve appropriate analysis and decision at the right time once we know whether and how CORSIA is implemented. My second comment is on the rules for the period up to 2020. We understand the willingness to strengthen the system and bring it closer to the regime for stationary installations. That said, our view is that these aspects should be addressed in the next review, taking due account of the need for aviation to contribute its fair share at European Union level. Anticipating this now could be premature. In that context, we welcome the amendments aiming at better framing the review. We believe that this is the right way of addressing some of the concerns over the future regime. The Commissioner is encouraged by the quick progress achieved on this file and is confident that an agreement on this proposal could be reached this year. I look forward to continuing to work with you on the ETS aviation proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion.

The Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) has supported for many years a single, global emissions scheme. It is imperative, Commissioner, that the EU allows time for the ground-breaking International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) negotiation discussions to be concluded. As we know, constructive talks are already underway and it is vital that countries such as the US, China, India and others are included as they are major players in this field. I would note that the US can still be part of CORSIA as neither the aviation nor the maritime sectors are included in the COP. To avoid duplication and excessive bureaucracy, the global scheme must include all international intra-EEA and domestic flights. To date, as you know, more than 70 countries have voluntarily signed up to the scheme, which between them emit nearly 90% of aviation CO2 emissions worldwide. We believe that all future revenues should be ring-fenced by Member States, and must be reinvested by an R&amp;D project, such as Single European Sky, Clean Sky, SESAR and others.

In the last few days we have unfortunately had another sad occasion to talk about climate change. It cannot be said that individual natural disasters are directly caused by climate change, but the floods in South Asia and the hurricanes in the Caribbean and the USA show that we have a problem here, because all serious researchers say: Such events increase when we are not doing anything about climate change. And now they say when it comes to air traffic, that is only two percent or, in the EU, only three percent. But first of all, the proportion is growing, and secondly, you have to put that into perspective: if you add up the emissions of the 129 countries that committed themselves in Paris - and that includes the member states of the European Union and other industrialized countries - then you get there to the same value as for international air traffic. So we have a problem here, and that's why we have to tackle it, preferably internationally. But this Parliament said a few months ago on CORSIA and said: This is disappointing, it is not yet what we need to really tackle the problem. But to restore the original area of ​​application now would destroy this delicate plant and would also not be feasible. I would therefore like to thank Julie Girling for her work and for what I consider to be a balanced report in many parts. We as the EPP would like to make this even more balanced. For example, with Amendment No 36 we tabled a compromise between ENVI on the one hand and ITRE and TRAN on the other. And I ask my fellow Members to follow the EPP line, and then we will have a good compromise. Finally, a word on Amendment 47: This is about Brexit. Of course we don't want a hard Brexit. We want Great Britain as possible remains in the internal market, definitely in the ETS.But unfortunately we have to be prepared, what you are hearing at the moment is not so positive.That is why we want to prepare for Amendment No 47 and ask you to support us there too.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 86, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Seb DANCE", "mepid": "124952", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to also join in thanking Rapporteur Girling for the excellent work that has taken place amongst all the groups.

As we speak, the results of climate change are hitting the Caribbean with unprecedented force. The central question today is of course: how do we judge the ICAO decision to tackle the problem of climate change? Is it the strong and decisive step of the aviation sector to freeze its emissions globally at 2020 levels and compensate for all additional emissions, or is it a cunning attempt by the aviation industry to buy more time and to accommodate unlimited growth in the future? I think it is neither of the two. My judgment is that it is a promising step forward, but at this stage, it is still limited to an intention. It is based on a resolution, and in the coming years it will be implemented on a voluntary basis. Rules on the global trading registry, criteria for offsets and monitoring of emissions still have to be agreed and implemented by participating countries. It is clearly promising, but at a very early stage. A lot of work and conviction is still necessary to make it a success. Political pressure will be greatly needed, and the question is whether that is by a time limit on the derogation or an indefinite limit on the derogation.

This is for those who say that we have to take our time, and to the Commissioner who said: ‘well, let’s see how we judge the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) progress.’ In 2012, we had already said that it would fall within the scope of the ETS. Then we were promised by ICAO that there would be a global deal in 2016. Yes, that global deal is there, but we have not seen anything yet on how it will work. It is carbon-neutral growth, so that is far from being enough for implementation of Paris. For those who say that aviation is not falling within the scope of the Paris Agreement: that is nonsense, because the Paris targets are economy-wide. Every sector has to work, and until now we have had discussions on many sectors that needed to deliver, aviation was always out and they are still out.  What we are seeing now is that it is finally time for ICAO to live up to its promises, but then they really have to make sure that their so-called compensation projects are really compensation and not just fake, as the case could be. In that sense, it is about time for aviation to pay for its emissions like all the other sectors. We have given them enough time, and now we are going to do it again until the end of 2020?

Political pressure has been mentioned by many of you – Ms Girling, Mr Lange, Mr Gerbrandy, Mr Eickhout, amongst others – and it is our intention to keep an ambitious position in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The outcome of ICAO does not fully meet European ambitions. An offsetting mechanism was not Europe’s first option for aviation and we would have preferred a carbon-trading system. But the ICAO process is a complex one and an offsetting mechanism was the maximum our international partners were ready to accept. We are very well aware of the weaknesses of international credits. However, we are working hard in ICAO to define robust eligibility criteria for emission units so only those that deliver real and additional reductions can be used under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). We have nevertheless to give CORSIA an opportunity to deliver, and some implementing rules which are still being finalised from several aspects such as monitoring, verification, transparency and eligibility of units or alternative fuels are key for ensuring environmental performance. We need to know the final features of the scheme first and then see whether and how it is implemented by third countries before carrying out a final assessment. As foreseen in our proposal, we will come up with a new review at a new time when there is more clarity on the operation of CORSIA. In that review we will address the post-2020 situation in detail. There was a very specific remark made by Mr Zoffoli related to non-CO2 gases from aviation and their impact on climate. Climate impacts from aviation’s non-CO2 gases are relevant. However, we will still need some research to better know how they operate and what the magnitude is. NOx emissions, water vapour or contrails may have different effects that could result in warming effects, but the magnitude depends also on the altitude or atmospheric conditions. That makes it also difficult to quantify their impact and to address them through market measures. In any case, we remain committed to continue studying the effects of those emissions and assess measures to address them in the most effective manner. I would like finally to thank all of you for taking this important step in Parliament which provides crucial political momentum for this proposal.

I think that is the case here, despite two very clear points of view. There is a broad consensus on the need for climate change action in the aviation sector. That is clear. Nobody stood here and said that we should do nothing. The main bone of contention seems to be the timing of – and indeed the confidence in – the ICAO process. So for those of you here who say that we should be cutting ICAO some more slack – and there do seem to be a number of ambassadors for ICAO here with us today – let me just say this. ICAO have known since 2008 that the EU wants to take action and we have been waiting for them to catch up. We have been doing exactly what we have been urged to do today: not leading too fast and making sure that there is time for details to be sorted out. We have been doing that since 2008.

Do not underestimate their ability to procrastinate. Please do not throw away our leverage. We have to hold onto it. It would be – and I use this term which I hear all the time in the UK – an act of self-harm to do so. Please, I appeal to colleagues, do not do it. It really will not get us anywhere.

Tonight we will be talking again about Europe's contribution to combating climate change. It is about the European contribution to the implementation of the Paris climate protection agreement - all of this in the light of an American president who has denounced the same and in the light of the events of the last few days. Forests play a key role in climate protection. Sustainable forest management is absolutely positive. Put simply: the forest concerns us all. What has happened since Paris? We have started to implement the Paris Climate Agreement, to bring it to life. The forest and its enormous contribution to combating global warming play an important role in this. That is why we are debating LULUCF here and tonight. Behind this abbreviation there is an accounting system for the CO2 uptake and release in forestry and agriculture. What contribution does the forest make? In order to be able to reliably display the contribution made by forests to climate protection, serious and robust accounting rules for CO2 uptake and release are necessary. Last but not least, as a pioneer in this area, Europe has a very important role to play as an international model. This is the only way we can demand the same from other countries - for example Brazil and others. The EU is under special observation - especially with regard to the World Climate Conference in Bonn in November this year. In the LULUCF area there is no potential for reduction, on the contrary, there is enormous potential to counteract climate change. The performance of our forests is absolutely great and must therefore be communicated positively. Active and sustainable forest management must be designed in such a way that it is good for the forest, for the climate and, last but not least, for the forest manager. This law must not demonize that. Especially by far-sighted ones and responsible management, our forests have grown to an area the size of Portugal in the last 25 years. That's nine million hectares after all. Why does the forest have a double positive effect on the climate? As a tree grows, it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and stores the carbon. Overall, our forests absorb ten percent of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the forest supplies wood to strengthen the bioeconomy - wood that is used, for example, in building houses for furniture and in energy generation. Now to my report: As has become clear, I expressly welcome the proposal by the European Commission, but I have made some changes, in particular to the establishment of the so-called forest reference value. I changed the reference period to the years 2000 to 2012, changed the role of the Member States in relation to the Commission, built in flexibility accordingly, doubled the credits for the forest industry and, above all, now tabled a plenary amendment that tries to integrate the reference period with the future policies adopted Member States to agree. I believe that this is a balanced compromise that deserves a majority in Wednesday's vote. I would like to thank everyone: the Commission, the staff, the shadow rapporteurs, for the intensive and good cooperation over the past few months, and I am now looking forward to the discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 111, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a pleasure to be here today in the plenary on the LULUCF proposal. This is an important initiative to implement the European Union commitments under the Paris Agreement and to contribute to the domestic European Union 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. The European Council’s guidance from October 2014 states that the EU target is ‘an economy-wide absolute reduction from base—year emissions’, reaching ‘at least 40% domestic reduction’ and covering all of the EU’s emissions. Contribution from land use and forests in reaching the long—term climate mitigation objectives is critical because of their potential for anthropogenic removal of carbon from the atmosphere. Forests alone currently cover more than 42% of the European Union land surface and have a huge potential for climate change mitigation through additional sequestration and storage of CO2 and through the potential to substitute fossil-based energy and materials. This debate and the vote this week show that the European Union is serious about its international climate commitment under the Paris Agreement. By doing so, Parliament is also making swift progress on one of the key legislative priorities of the Union: under the Joint Declaration of the European Union’s legislative priorities for 2017, the three institutions have agreed that the 2030 climate action proposals are given priority treatment in 2017. I appreciate the hard work of the rapporteur, Mr Lins, on this proposal and would thank him for the excellent cooperation. Many of the key elements of what you are proposing for vote in this House are in line with the Commission proposals, notably on the need to ensure the robustness of the accounting rules, in particular for forestry, and the sustainable management of forests. This is encouraging, as – like in the Commission proposals – this maintains a careful balance between the need to respond to an increasing demand of biomass availability and climate mitigation objectives. I also note your efforts to further strengthen the environmental integrity of the framework by introducing additional safeguards. Let me offer a few comments on the key aspects of the rapporteur’s final proposal. First, the report adopted by the Environment Committee retains the main principles of the Commission proposal on the construction of Forest Reference Levels. However, it modifies the reference period to a more recent one – 2000 to 2012. This period would include policies promoting increased harvesting in the benchmark and risk hiding real emissions of forest biomass. We should instead be incentivising sustainable forest management and we are open on how to address this challenge. However, the use of a more recent reference period risks compromising the environmental integrity of the LULUCF accounting framework. Second, we understand the concerns of some over the proposal’s language on management intensity, especially that of harvests. The Commission proposal is a way to acknowledge that the management intensity of forests must vary, in accordance with the national characteristics of the forest. If forests become older, more trees will reach maturity and increased harvest may be needed. The Commission proposal acknowledges that the future forest dynamics need to be captured in a forward-looking, projected forest reference level and does not fix the harvest to that of the past. The Commission has, for example, even shown that a harvest increase of up to two per cent may be justified in the projected forest reference level, averaged across the European Union. Third, we must also consider this treatment of biomass emissions vis-à-vis the other legislative proposals. Emissions from combustion of biomass under the ETS and the ESR are zero rated. If instead the accounting of biomass emissions is done downstream in these sectors, the administrative and technical burden would be extreme. We need therefore to be pragmatic. A credible, robust approach compatible with the other pillars of the policy is required. Fourth, I note with interest the proposal to give more visibility to harvested wood products. We see that this aspect of LULUCF is positive, not only for the climate, but also for jobs and the economy. That is why it deserved a special place in our proposal, as the only carbon pool with specific rules and a specific article. Fifth, I welcome the specific improvements enhancing environmental integrity, such as the progressive inclusion of wetlands in the accounting scope, as of 2026, and the safeguard discussed of ensuring that the Union’s forest sink does not decrease, compared to the 1990 to 2009 average. Lastly, I note that the report closely tracks the Commission proposal in respect of agricultural land accounting. We are pleased to see that a proportioned and balanced approach seems to have been found in determining flexibility towards the Effort Sharing sectors. The Commission fully supports the efforts of Parliament and the Council to agree on the ETS and non-ETS proposals before the end of the year. On the ETS file we are in trilogue negotiations, and I welcome the renewed efforts to progress there. I look forward to continuing to work with you on the LULUCF proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 112, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Florent MARCELLESI", "mepid": "26146", "text": "Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, after one of the hottest summers in history, the macro-Indians and the current hurricanes, let's face it: we must be ambitious in our fight against climate change.

We had immense difficulties with regard, especially, in relation to the reference period. We maintained a division almost until the end, although with agreement on most issues.

But it is precisely because sustainable forestry is already making a contribution to climate protection.

The absorption capacity is largely due to forests.

That is why it is so important that LULUCF enables forest management that, on the one hand, ensures the maintenance and development of carbon dioxide-absorbing forest resources, and, on the other hand, does not limit those branches of economies that depend on forestry.

A recent work published in Nature describes a process of acceleration of the release of CO2 from the soil, as a consequence of the greater activity of microorganisms, stimulated precisely by the increase in average temperatures. Researchers estimate that by 2050, at least 55 billion tons of CO2 could be released from the soil not foreseen by the emission scenarios.

According to Eurostat, the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and beyond have raised the level of forest management. Croatia was not able to achieve a higher level of forest management in its entire territory, but only in the territory that it could fully manage. Namely, from 1991 to 1998, due to the occupation of part of the territory, due to the Homeland War that followed, and the process of peaceful reintegration, Croatia could not manage its forests. We are still feeling the consequences of the Greater Serbia aggression today due to the remaining mine resources. Croatia has so far invested over 680m euros in demining mine suspected areas. That demining work was indeed intensive, but there are still 425 km2 left, and it will not be over before the middle of 2019.

I appreciate your commitment to maintaining the European Union’s role as a path-breaker in the area of international climate action.  Following the debate I would like to clarify two issues. The first one relates to what Mr Brannen said. It is correct that the Commission proposal mentioned the term ‘intensity’. However it was never meant to be a static historical value. Forest management will have to flexibly adapt to the age—class structure of the forest and this means that the intensity will not necessarily stay constant over time but might change in a forward—looking forest reference level. The second one relays that the Commission is very much aware of the specific situation of the forest-richest Member States. They have a particular potential for a flourishing bio-economy and this can help in replacing emissions from many sectors, especially through harvested wood products and also biofuels, while at the same time maintaining, or even raising, the forest sinks. This is very much appreciated and will be acknowledged in the accounting system. Finally allow me to state that discussions on the two non-ETS proposals have progressed well in the Council and the technical work is nearly finalised. I would like to thank you for taking this important step in Parliament, which provides crucial political momentum for this proposal.

Thank you for the lively and controversial discussion we have had over the past hour. I would like to comment a little on a few requests to speak. On the one hand from colleague Brennan, but also from colleague Hautala. I believe that we are at least partially wrong if we - put simply - are of the opinion that less logging means more climate protection. This is definitely not what science has brought to me over the past few months. No, it's about a smart approach, it's about the question: When is the best time to cut wood? Because it is clear that a tree can absorb more and more CO2 for a long time, but then reaches a zenith and can then absorb less from this point in time. To put it a bit more pointedly: A national park, which is primarily created to ensure more biodiversity, is definitely not a forest that protects the climate, but on the contrary: In simplified terms, one can say that a national park is, in the long run, a climate polluter, because of course it can absorb less CO2 in the long run. And then bioeconomy: the Paris climate protection agreement also clearly states that we have to increase this. So that means we have to try to get more forest. It is also about the question: which age group? There are different situations in the Member States; the commissioner presented it. That means, if in doubt, I can significantly expand my logging, but still have a sink effect, even a higher sink effect in the long term, if I cut the right age group. In this respect, it would be right and good to support the EPP amendment in plenary on Wednesday and thus achieve a realistic approach. And then, when we have a majority here on Wednesday - which I would like - it will be the Council's turn.

It is a cornerstone of the European Union's action plan to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

The legislative proposal to address greenhouse gas emissions and removals related to land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 framework for climate and energy policy is broadly in line with the European Council conclusions of 23-24 October 2014. The starting point is therefore in line with the policy framework set by the Heads of Government and State. On the road to achieving the Paris climate targets, it is very important that the LULUCF sector adheres to the so-called A “negative balance ban” to have only a neutral effect on the 2030 -40% emission reduction target in the worst case. However, at the level of detailed rules, I would like to draw attention to the provisions on the accounting of managed forest areas. The reference levels should be set in such a way that the base management period is as close as possible to the current data, reflects a country's forest management trends and does not limit the future forestry policies of that Member State. The European Commission should not be given the right to arbitrarily override the forest reference levels set by the Member State, but should also take into account the opinion of experts, as in the case of reviews.

First of all, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation. In part it was a difficult birth, but in the end we had a strong majority in the AFCO committee for this report, and I hope that we will continue with that here in plenary. It is important to deal with the question of democracy in the European institutions. Democratic institutions need two things: strong participation and the ability to make decisions in the interests of the majority while respecting fundamental rights and freedoms. In more and more areas, democracy depends on the fact that we can only establish decision-making ability at European level internationally. The ability to make decisions is no longer just national when we see that more and more questions are ultimately global or at least continental. It is therefore crucial that we take the citizens with us on this path to more European and international democracy. And for this we also have to ask ourselves the question of participation, because only through both together - participation and the ability to act - can we achieve legitimation. Europe has already achieved great things in many areas in order to show that democracy with strong participation and transparency is possible internationally and not just nationally. We already show a lot, especially here in the European Parliament, but there is less about us in the newspaper. That is why our effective transparency and accountability are not yet optimally developed for many citizens. And we should aim to get the most out of what is possible in terms of transparency, accountability, and integrity. That is why our report makes some wishes to the Commission: We want the rules on lobby transparency not only to apply to the Commissioners and the highest officials, but for other employees. In the area of ​​trade policy, we want what was started with TTIP to finally apply effectively to all trade contracts, so that there is more transparency. In expert groups, the minutes should also present minority positions. We need a European legal framework for whistleblowers, and finally, when it comes to assessing conflicts of interest in the Commission, the Commission should no longer determine its own judges; instead, in the proposal for a new Code of Conduct, we need independent judges this question. And last but not least, we would like a proposal from the European Commission so that we have strong transparency and participation rights for all EU agencies and not just for a few, as is the case today. But when we make wishes to the Council and also to the Commission, then we should also look at ourselves critically. What does not work is, as unfortunately some colleagues would like us to demand strong lobby transparency from the Commission and the Council, but say to ourselves: everything here has to be based on voluntariness. On the contrary, we need full transparency here in Parliament, also in the eyes of the citizens. And that should ultimately at least apply to everyone who has a role here - that is, as rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs or committee chairmen. They should show the citizens who they were talking to, as is normal in Canada. Why is that not possible in the European Parliament? The Commission has led the way; we as Parliament should follow suit. We have a good opportunity to make that clear when we vote on Thursday.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 162, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "György SCHÖPFLIN", "mepid": "28135", "text": "   – Madam President, this report has been a long time in the making, meaning that, as shadow, I have had very fruitful engagement with Mr Giegold, to whom I give my congratulations.

The Juncker Commission has committed to lead by example when it comes to transparency. At the very beginning of our mandate, the College committed to high transparency standards. This lies at the heart of the Democratic Change priority in the Political Guidelines for this Commission. Being transparent about the way European institutions work, including how they interact with interest representatives, is essential to ensuring public trust. The Report recognises that the Commission is a very transparent public administration. Let me give you four examples of recent improvements. Firstly, as far as transparency of interest representation is concerned, since December 2014, Commissioners, Members of their Cabinet and Directors—General have been publishing information on their websites on the meetings they have with lobbyists. Information on more than 14 000 meetings has been published to date. The rule ‘not on the Transparency Register, no meeting’ applies as well. These were simple but major and unprecedented steps forward, which illustrate the high standards that we apply. Secondly, we have made registration in the Transparency Register a requirement in order for stakeholder organisations and individual experts representing a common interest to be appointed as members of expert groups advising the Commission. Thirdly, we have boosted transparency in trade negotiations. This is essential to ensure the legitimacy of European Union trade policy and public trust, as the report rightly recognises. Fourthly, the Commission’s Better Regulation policy also contains a series of important new transparency features with open public consultations and other opportunities for feedback at each stage of the policy cycle. For the first time, the public can provide feedback on draft delegated and implementing acts. So the Commission has led by example in terms of transparency, and we believe it is now time for other institutions to make a similar effort so that we can together strengthen the transparency of European Union law—making, which is a shared responsibility of the Parliament, Council and Commission.  This is why the Commission has presented a proposal for a mandatory European Union Transparency Register, in the form of a draft interinstitutional agreement covering the Parliament, the Commission and, for the first time, the Council. We welcome the adoption of Parliament’s negotiating mandate in June. A first tripartite political meeting took place on 6 September 2017, and we look forward to the start of the formal negotiations. The objective is to have the highest standards in place in the three institutions for their interactions with interest representatives. The Commission is of the view that meetings of interest representatives – including meetings with MEPs – should be made conditional on these interest representatives being in the Transparency Register. If all three institutions adopt the ‘not registered, no meeting’ approach, which the Commission already applies, registration will become a precondition for exercising lobbying activities vis-à-vis EU institutions. This is why an interinstitutional agreement is the most pragmatic and efficient way to achieving a mandatory Register. It would be a major step forward towards the transparency that citizens rightly expect. I would also like to share some first observations about other key points raised in the report. Regarding ethics, the Commission’s Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for staff in their relations with the public reflects the values of service, independence, responsibility, accountability, efficiency and transparency, to which the Commission as an institution is committed. The Commission strongly supports the objective of protecting whistleblowers, underlined by the European Parliament. The results of the recent public consultation and a study will enable the Commission to take an informed decision on the need for further horizontal or sectorial action at EU level. As far as the work of agencies in providing scientific advice for policymaking is concerned, the Commission supports their approach to effectively preventing conflicts of interest, while maintaining their ability to access the best available expertise. Finally, I would like to reassure you that the Commission will examine carefully all the proposals for legislative and non-legislative initiatives put forward by Parliament in this report and will express its opinion in the formal follow-up procedure following the adoption of the report. We look forward to continued good cooperation between our institutions, so that, together, we can reinforce further the transparency and integrity framework of the European institutions.

I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal for a new space strategy and the shadow rapporteurs for the really excellent cooperation on this not unimportant subject. There is unbelievable potential for all of us in space, which must be used wisely. Space is not far away, but now affects our daily life. A current example for those who do not yet know: Copernicus data is currently being used for the hurricane disaster in the Caribbean and Florida in order to be able to provide better help on site. But there are also many other areas of application, such as climate change, monitoring CO2 or methane emissions, agriculture, fishing, large construction projects - for example, the bridge between Denmark and Sweden was supported, among other things, with data from European satellites so that the both ends of the bridge actually meet. Modern traffic systems are supported, including the navigation system - for which we are currently still dependent on the United States - but also connectivity, the development of remote regions for a high-performance Internet, and even coping with the refugee crisis: all of this can or can be better managed can only be realized with support from space. This requires a clever strategy of what and how to invest in which areas. The Commission's proposals are on the table. We discussed our report in Parliament and further refined and expanded the proposals. We need broad application of data from space in the European Union. We also need to promote it - both in society and in the economy. Communication about this has to be improved as well as the corresponding training, because for many it is still completely unknown what possibilities the space projects of the European Union offer us at all. The existing projects must be continued and expanded. We must make better use of the opportunities that Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus offer, not only in the social sphere, but also in the economic sphere. In traffic management on water, on land and in the air, data from space could be used to a much greater extent, but it is also possible to use this data economically in the development of new applications in the field of startups and in small and medium-sized companies . The SMEs must be supported accordingly, and if necessary we must also take legislative action. Local authorities should also be encouraged and supported more strongly to take advantage of the EU's space activities - for example in urban development, transport planning or civil protection. The EIB could finance such projects, but the Structural Funds could also play a bigger role. In these tasks, it must be ensured on the one hand that our space factor is globally competitive and that it is treated fairly on the market, which affects, among other things, the financial resources of our programs. In the future, too, we need a European budget for the space policy that cannot be reduced - on the contrary: satellites only have a limited lifespan and public investments are currently much higher, for example in the USA. However, efficient, pragmatic cooperation between the EU, ESA and the member states and the efficient use of European programs, such as the Horizon research program, are also important. The space programs are civil programs, but there can be useful synergies, for example with the European action plan for defense and in the fight against terrorism. Of course there is also security important for the systems in space.Increasing space debris, an increasing number of large and small satellites, but also cyberattacks can cause great damage.We have to be more active here.For a peaceful use of space we need a strong EU and good international ties.The cooperation between the Commission, the Council, the European External Action Service and ESA is therefore of great importance.Parliament will accompany this and asks the Commission to provide a concrete roadmap for the individual program parts and to develop a communication strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 175, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "- Madam President, I also welcome the European Commission's proposal in the space development strategy.At the same time, I want to say that the agency that deals with this development is based in Prague.I think that the technologies we use, which have their source or origin in the universe where they operate, so their use is really everyday, affect our lives, as the rapporteur very rightly said.I like the way in which the report raises the issue of start-ups.And not only start-ups, but also small and medium-sized enterprises and the use of these technologies by these recipients.I would very much like to appreciate that the rapporteur has emphasized the role of municipalities and cities and regions in planning their development and using these technologies, which have their source in space.I think this is a very innovative approach and I would like to thank her for it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 176, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that we will approve tomorrow contributes to the elaboration of a space strategy for Europe, a strategic sector of fundamental importance, although often ignored by public opinion.

Last October the Commission adopted the Space Strategy for Europe. It is the first comprehensive strategy in this sector at European level. We sent a clear signal: space is a priority for the Commission, and the Strategy represents a clear ambition to make Europe a leading actor in space. We are therefore glad that the report to be adopted supports this level of ambition and goes even further in some respects. The report fully endorses the vision of the Commission and puts on the table several very concrete and constructive suggestions in relation to the four priority objectives of the Strategy: maximising the benefits of space for society and the economy, and the creation of a European market for space-based applications; fostering a competitive and innovative European space sector and a new space approach in Europe; ensuring Europe’s autonomous and secure access to space; and strengthening Europe as a global actor. The implementation of the Strategy has already started and is already delivering benefits. All our space programmes are operational. The latest Copernicus Sentinel 2B satellite was successfully launched and the data is already being used, for instance, to direct rescue teams during the recent earthquakes in Italy or the follow-up to hurricane Harvey in Texas. Galileo’s initial services went live last December. The market uptake is the key to success. Leading chipset companies are producing Galileo-compatible products and, at present, already 13 models of smartphones can work with Galileo signals. EGNOS has also demonstrated its added value: today, 424 procedures for aircraft approach and landing have been developed at 288 European airports, allowing passengers to easily access regional airports. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking, or SST, support framework started in July 2016 to monitor debris in space to protect European critical space and ground infrastructure, paving the way towards less dependence in this domain. This is a good start, but we cannot stop there. This year, and the next two, will be crucial. We are committed to implement the actions announced in the Space Strategy, and our intention is to use the same inclusive process as the one we used for the preparation of the Strategy. Our priorities are clear. First, on the market uptake, several actions have started to foster space-based applications in relation to Copernicus and Galileo. Second, we need to boost space start-ups, for instance through discussions with the European Investment Bank. The Commission is ready to look at different options to increase the efficiency of space research spending, including by exploring the options of possible public-private partnerships. Third, we need to prepare the continued evolution of Copernicus and Galileo. This starts by an evaluation of what has been done so far. Fourth, the synergies between the security and the defence dimension need to be reinforced, for instance through the link with the European Defence Fund. The work on the GovSatCom initiative and on the reinforcement of the SST will take this dimension into account. Fifth, the autonomous access to space needs to be guaranteed, and we are working on a smart strategy for launchers. Finally, we do not forget the governance aspects and the need to cooperate closely between all European actors, in particular with the European Space Agency. We take this very seriously. These priorities will be likely reflected in legislative proposals in the coming years. But the future will also depend on the budgetary aspects. Adequate financing and resources are necessary to meet the current and future challenges. As the report rightly outlines, space applications serve many European policies and actions: space is not a cost but an investment. Let us work together to ensure that Europe benefits from a true return on this investment. Let us work together towards achieving a strong Europe in space – a domain where no single European actor can succeed alone.

In particular, we must offer SMEs the possibility of making better use of spatial data to develop services and concrete applications. This will require an ambitious budget for research, for infrastructure and for space programs, Galileo and Copernicus in particular. Finally, we urgently need to train young Europeans in the specific skills required by the space sector.

Most of the goods we consume today are the result of a combination of various operations from all corners of the world. Sometimes for the best: complementary research, innovation partnerships, resources and raw materials that must be sought in a respectful manner. Sometimes for the worse: cheap labor, unprotected, environmental destruction, tax evasion. These operations are often coordinated by international companies through contractual partnerships or multiple subcontracting. The European Union, as the world's leading exporter and importer of goods and services can - and I would even say must - use its trade policy as a real lever to make these global value chains tools for development. sustainable for all and thus contribute to a fairer and more equitable globalization. Currently, the lack of transparency and the dilution of responsibilities throughout this process increase the risks of exploitation of workers, the non-respect of fundamental rights and promote unfair competition on a social level, on an environmental level, but also on a fiscal level. This report also takes place in a context where European trade policy is the subject of strong criticism from citizens who demand a fairer and more transparent globalization. He therefore calls on the Commission to take a whole series of measures to make global value chains more accountable and transparent. To name but a few, I will target, for example, the inclusion in trade agreements of a binding but also enforceable \"sustainable development\" chapter, as well as the anti-avoidance clause. tax and tax evasion. There is also the taking of initiatives inspired by the legislation on conflict minerals or the company's duty of vigilance within a binding duty of vigilance framework as set out by the OECD, or the establishment of a labeling system that guarantees a production method that respects international labor standards and / or environmental standards. I will cite, for example, the initiative taken by Italy today regarding the labeling of the origin of tomatoes produced in a respectful manner. Many other important elements can also be found in this report such as the initiatives and the role of the private sector, multilateralism and end-of-life support. This report is the result of long negotiations between the different visions of how to master this globalization. We have found, it seems to me, a good balance in the search for a common goal, which is to make trade a tool for emancipation for all. One of our colleagues recently quoted the wise words of Simone Veil, who said: \"The search for compromises must lead us towards a solution higher than the particular position of each one\". This report, in my opinion, illustrates that research. I thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Ruas, here present, for having indeed found the compromises which could satisfy us all.

The Commission shares with the European Parliament concerns and goals regarding sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda, both of which are central to many European Union policies, including the trade and investment policy. The European Union policy on corporate social responsibility and responsible business conduct is implemented through initiatives by businesses and by their stakeholders, complemented where necessary by adequate regulatory measures. I would like to recall that corporate social responsibility is mostly a voluntary process, and enterprises are responsible for the impact they have on society. Let me just briefly recall some of the many actions we take in the area of global value chains. As regards European Union trade and investment policy, recent European Union trade agreements contain rules of origin that support the integration of the industry in the global value chains. In all trade negotiations, the Commission is promoting provisions on public procurement and intellectual property rights. In this context, we aim at developing solid procurement tools against corruptive practices and promoting sustainable procurement. These agreements also contain provisions on corporate social responsibility and responsible business conduct, together with binding commitments on core labour standards and international environmental conventions which are subject to dispute settlement. We also work with the OECD in developing due diligence guidelines and on their implementation. Under the unilateral Generalised Scheme of Preferences, corporate social responsibility is indirectly addressed via the requirements and dialogues on labour standards and environmental conventions.  And as regards the gender dimension, the Commission is developing further its trade-related policies. Following the Gender Forum hosted by the Commission earlier this year, more will be done on promoting gender equality and integration into bilateral and multilateral instruments, such as the trade negotiations with Chile or the WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2017. Also, as regards other policies, the Commission takes numerous actions linked to global value chains: there are capacity—building and outreach programmes which help developing countries to promote reforms for effective enforcement of social, environmental and labour standards. Support is given to European Union small and micro enterprises, taking on board the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Commission cooperates closely with the International Labour Organization on decent working conditions in global supply chains, but also on occupational safety and health, social dialogue, child labour and forced labour in supply chains. With regard to jurisdiction rules, work is done within the Hague Conference on Private International Law, and we are negotiating a worldwide convention on recognition and enforcement of judgments by indirect jurisdiction rules with third states. The European Union also has legislation in place for corporate social responsibility and responsible business conduct. Let me give you just two examples. The 2014 Non-Financial Disclosure Directive for large European Union companies requires companies with more than 500 employees to disclose information on policies, results and risks concerning environmental aspects, social and labour-related matters, respect for human rights, anti—corruption and bribery issues. And the 2015 Anti-Money Laundering Directive puts in place rules that reinforce the vigilance by banks, lawyers, accountants and other professionals as regards, among other things, the identification of beneficial owners of companies and trusts.  We are addressing all these sustainable development issues – and many more – on a regular basis, and the Commission will continue to work closely with the European Parliament on them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 191, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The point is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, September 12, 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 192, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the Milan Zver report on continuing and distance university education in the framework of the European lifelong learning strategy (2016/2142 (INI)) (A8-0252 / 2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 193, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Milan ZVER", "mepid": "96933", "text": "Rapporteur. - In July, the Culture Committee adopted a report entitled Academic further and distance education as part of the European lifelong learning strategy with 24 votes in favor and only one against. I would like to highlight the fruitful cooperation with almost all political groups. Obviously, education connects, especially when it comes to topics as good as the two I bring together in the report. It is not particularly emphasized that education and training is a mirror of society. It contributes not only to the maturation of individuals, but also to the formation of human capital and society in general. Education has been high on the European agenda for many years, although it is widely known to be part of the sovereign policies of its members. The European Union has been promoting the quality and efficiency of school systems in the Member States for many years. Therefore, it has prepared a series of mechanisms that make education more comparable and of better quality, as well as a series of programs that financially support education and training. Let me pay special attention to the success story, which we call Erasmus +, but we will talk about it in this plenary. The concept of lifelong learning is based on the realization that in a modern dynamic, complex and technologically increasingly demanding society, full of risks, it is necessary to have lifelong education, be it formal, informal or casual. In the report, I emphasize the need for further academic education in the field of vocational education and training. All those who have successfully completed school must have access to additional educational pathways on which participants can further fulfill their abilities. Colleagues, poor access to educational opportunities can lead to less competitive people in the labor market, problems in private life, permanent passivity, exclusion from the social environment and, as can be seen in recent years, violent radicalization, especially of young people they are vulnerable in risky circumstances. Access to education is therefore a standard that must be enforced everywhere, but this is not the case in practice. Many have this kind of problem, e.g. young mothers find it difficult to reconcile their family, perhaps even work, responsibilities with educational ones. People from the lower classes find it difficult to afford the desired study, especially if it is too expensive. Someone from the peripheral regions also finds it difficult to afford to study at desired university destinations that are not close enough. Even for individuals who are classified in the group of people with special needs, participation in the classic t. i. residential mode of study is often impossible. That is why distance learning is so important in providing easier access for all, which is one of the most important goals of education and training in general. In short, distance learning can improve accessibility for all, without discrimination based on country, region, social status, age or gender. Distance learning also significantly reduces costs for the provider and the participant. Thus, distance learning also enables greater personalization of studies, as it is less uniform and more adapted to the needs and potentials of the student. In doing so, we are helping to increase efficiency and reduce early school leaving, which is still a major problem in Europe. The process of digitization is also unstoppable in education, especially in distance learning. In this context, the assistance of the European Union in the development of a single and friendly digital platform is also very important. digital classrooms.

On 30 May, we published an education package, which contains actions spanning from early childhood education and care to higher education, and which includes a strong focus on both digital and lifelong learning. The package takes account of developments and issues that have a direct impact on education – such as globalisation, digitalisation, diversity and exclusion – and considers how best to support people of all ages in developing the skills that they will need to thrive both personally and professionally. Many of the actions are very relevant to the recommendations in the draft resolution. The Commission Communication on ‘School development and excellent teaching for a great start in life’ starts from the assumption that high-quality education for all will help Europe achieve its economic and social objectives while fostering the personal and professional developments of European citizens.  I would like to thank you for highlighting the importance of Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 for enhancing lifelong learning, and for the call to bridge technological gaps between educational institutions across Europe and to connect schools to ultra-fast Internet, thus addressing the digital divide and ensuring equal opportunities for all students.  I would also like to thank you for your acknowledgment in your report of the work done through the eTwinning and School Education Gateway platforms. In order to improve learning outcomes, inclusiveness and equity in school education, the Commission plans to further promote participation in those online platforms. Further actions planned of particular relevance include a digital capacity self-assessment tool based on the Digital Competence Framework and called ‘Selfie’, which enables schools in the European Union, on a voluntary basis, to self-evaluate where they stand in relation to common criteria on the effective use of technologies for digital age learning, and how they can further improve. In addition, through Erasmus+, we will support improvements in school-level education in science, technologies, engineering and maths by promoting best practice in developing links and cooperation between higher education, research, businesses and schools at European Union level. I would also like to highlight three initiatives within our renewed European Union agenda for higher education that are relevant to your draft resolution.  We will develop and implement a digital readiness model to help higher education institutions, their staff and students to implement digital learning strategies and exploit the potential of technology. We will provide support through Erasmus+ for higher education teachers, doctoral candidates and postdoctoral graduates to develop pedagogical and curriculum design skills, including in digital learning. Also through Erasmus+, we will promote the development and testing of flexible and modular course design. Let me also mention the Commission’s support for research and innovation projects under Horizon 2020, developing ICT applications for education and training, making learning more effective, engaging and collaborative. We are also conscious of the importance of youth work in supporting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in developing digital skills and competences. The Commission welcomes, therefore, the reference to recognising competences gained outside the formal education system. Last but not least, we should emphasise the important role of Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 in supporting innovation in all sectors of education, and for people of all ages.  For the next three years (2018-2020) Erasmus+ will implement the ‘Digital Opportunity Scheme’, supporting internships to develop digital skills. Through our Horizon 2020 stakeholders, as well as through the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, we have been mobilising companies to offer more internships in this field, strengthening Europe’s innovation capacity.  One of the EU’s most successful programmes, Erasmus+ contributes to promoting growth and jobs, developing skills and promoting European values and social cohesion. Over the last 30 years, it has had an impact on the personal and professional lives of more than nine million participants, within and outside Europe. Among others, it funds eTwinning, promoting cooperation between schools through distance learning. There are clear and strong messages at the highest political level regarding the crucial role of Erasmus+ in supporting the goals of the Rome Declaration, specifically ‘a Union where young people receive the best education and training and can study and find jobs across the continent’.  The recommendations within this draft resolution will provide us with much inspiration in our continued work to provide the best possible support to people of all ages on their lifelong learning journey.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 202, "date": "2017-09-11.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The point is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, September 12, 2017.

The topic of e-learning is very important in Europe. It gives a lot of opportunities to people, regardless of their age, sex or social status.

Working mothers might face difficulties juggling their family responsibilities, work and education. Furthermore, people with specific needs finds it hard to participate in traditional education.

Lifelong learning is not only a mandatory part of every human life, but it is highly integrated into our traditional educational system. Since it is imperative by today’s standards to hone ones knowledge, experience and skills, the educational system has to acknowledge rapid changes in circumstances and adapt accordingly. Poor access to education can be a cause for uncompetitive workforces, social exclusion and even violent radicalisation. With the help of e-learning and distance education, even people who cannot access classical education because of insufficient funds, disabilities or other hindering factors are not being excluded from the learning process.

The time for buzzwords is over. I have lost count of how many times I have read in the position papers buzzwords like ‘streamlined’, ‘innovative’, and ‘imaginative solutions’ for the borders of the United Kingdom, but without any details of what these solutions would look like. This is bureaucratic speak for ‘we haven’t a clue’. The onus is on the United Kingdom to come up with something substantive and workable, that does not put a hard border back on the island of Ireland. The United Kingdom made a decision to leave; now it must solve the problem it has caused for Ireland.
