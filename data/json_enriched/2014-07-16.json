The first challenge he mentioned was the shocking level of youth unemployment, which he sees as a source of desperation and hopelessness that constitutes a threat to our democracy. Those are very strong words. As we all know, they are perfectly warranted, mainly, but not exclusively, in respect of the countries and regions of the eurozone periphery, which have been affected by a dramatic rise in youth unemployment in recent years. The Commission has been adamant about keeping youth unemployment at the top of the EU agenda and launched an unprecedented range of measures combining policy and financial support.  I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support both in terms of bringing about the Youth Guarantee and of ensuring adequate resources from the European Union budget. Under the Youth Guarantee, all Member States have committed themselves to ensuring that all young people under 25 receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, or an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. The Youth Guarantee is a major structural reform, as well as a key social investment.  In order to support the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, the Commission launched a European alliance for apprenticeships and put forward a quality framework for traineeships. All 28 Member States have now submitted Youth Guarantee implementation plans as requested by the European Council. I welcome the efforts made by the Member States to put in place the Youth Guarantee schemes. I recognise that this is not an easy task, as it requires strategic reforms.  The Commission has assessed the national Youth Guarantee implementation plans as part of the 2014 European Semester. The analysis shows that progress has been made across the board. However, there are a number of challenges, including strengthening the capacity of public employment services, providing quality offers, reforming education and training systems, and reaching out to inactive young people. Altogether, 18 Member States received country-specific recommendations focusing on one or several of these points I have just mentioned. A total of eight Member States were invited to act more decisively to implement the Youth Guarantee. Making the Youth Guarantee happen requires that all available resources are there to get started as quickly as possible and achieve concrete results, already in the short term. The European Social Fund, with more than EUR 10 billion every year in the 2014-2020 period, is the most significant source of funding for implementing the Youth Guarantee. In addition, the European Council has agreed to launch a Youth Employment Initiative targeting young people aged between 15 and 24 not in employment, education or training – the so-called ‘NEETs’ – who live in the regions most affected by youth unemployment. This is a dedicated financial tool worth EUR 6.4 billion which directly targets individuals and supports the implementation of the Youth Guarantee schemes.  The initiative should focus on job-creating measures, including well-targeted wage subsidies and recruitment subsidies, apprenticeships and traineeships. It can also support activation measures such as job search guidance and assistance, as well as further training.  The Parliament and Council agreed to frontload the Youth Employment Initiative resources so the EUR 6.4 billion are committed in 2014 and 2015 rather than over the entire period between 2014 to 2020. Parliament also agreed to allow Member States to claim related expenditure from 1 September 2013. This means that the Commission can reimburse the Member States once the relevant operational programmes are adopted. In addition, when a Member State chooses to programme the Youth Employment Initiative under a dedicated operational programme, the Commission can approve it before the adoption of the partnership agreement, thereby speeding up implementation. Where do we stand now? France and Italy have presented such dedicated operational programmes. The Commission approved them in June and July respectively. As a result, EUR 1.5 billion, or a quarter of the total allocation, has already been committed. In addition, 11 out of the 20 eligible Member States have officially submitted operational programmes covering youth-employment-initiative-related actions. Seven Member States have not yet done so.  Last Friday, the Commission organised a seminar to support Member States in accelerating the programming and practical implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative. On this occasion, the Commission clarified outstanding issues regarding the programming of the Youth Employment Initiative and had bilateral technical meetings with the Member States. Following the seminar, I am sending a letter to ministers, encouraging them to ensure swift completion of the Youth Employment Initiative programming. The Youth Employment Initiative, together with the Youth Guarantee, should be a reality on the ground as a matter of urgency. We cannot afford to delay the implementation of such a crucial initiative. The Commission encourages Member States to continue their efforts to ensure swift implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative. The Commission will continue to assist them in this endeavour and, at the same time, we also have to continue developing the macroeconomic framework in order to ensure that fiscal and monetary policies become more supportive for growth and job creation in all countries and all regions of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 15, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "f'isem il-grupp PPE. - Iva, għandna sitwazzjoni mhux feliċi fl-Unjoni Ewropea.

I have a very difficult question for the Commission but first let me greet Commissioner László Andor, who has done a great deal in a very difficult situation. Commissioner, you fought for job creation, you fought for social investment: investing in people is the right way to invest in Europe. Lastly, you launched the Youth Guarantee.  Now the situation is as follows. In spite of many efforts, the unemployment rate remains very high in Europe, particularly the youth unemployment rate. Beyond that we have divergences, economic and social divergences, between regions and Member States, which never existed in the past. So something is deeply wrong in Europe. I do not believe there is a future for Europe if there is no future for young people in Europe. This means that we need to have a much higher ambition as regards tackling this problem. My question is therefore very simple. Based on your experience and what has been done so far, which stronger instruments should we have in the European Union to tackle and reduce youth unemployment and stop these economic and social divergences? These divergences are undermining our European ambition, our European project and our European cohesion. We are losing the win-win game we should have in Europe.  So my question for you, Commissioner, is what ideas do you have about that? What is the stronger instrument we should be building together in order to come before our citizens with a convincing response?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 17, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Anthea McINTYRE", "mepid": "111011", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, may I take the opportunity to welcome you to the chair and encourage you to keep people to their speaking times. I will try to do my best.  I am really pleased that our first proper session of this Parliament is concentrating on this really important issue of youth unemployment – or youth employment if you want to be positive – and I would like to thank Commissioner Andor for his words.  It is indeed encouraging that Mr Juncker has put job creation as his top priority, but we have to recognise that it is not the Commission that creates jobs, it is not Parliament that creates jobs, it is not even the Member States’ governments that create jobs. It is businesses that create jobs. SMEs create 85% of new jobs across Europe. So our job must be to create an environment where businesses can grow and can create jobs, and businesses will only create more jobs and recruit more people if the economic environment encourages growth: if they can rely on a qualified workforce, if labour markets are sufficiently flexible, if labour costs, including wages, are in line with productivity, if social protection systems make work more attractive, and if regulation is proportionate and evidence-based. We have seen a trend towards more skill-intensive jobs – almost 90% of the jobs expected to be created and become vacant by 2020 require medium or high qualifications – and Europe’s education and training systems are not adapted to the business skills needs that we will need in the future years. We need a better supply of science, technology, engineering and maths skills, the stem subjects, and those are currently not going to match the increasing demands of business. There are encouraging signs and companies are bringing jobs back.

Before the election youth unemployment was the biggest issue for many groups and unfortunately it still is: with 7.5 million young Europeans between the ages of 15 and 24 not in employment, education or training, and 6.8 million in the same situation between the ages of 25 and 30. At European level we have a number of instruments. We have the Youth Guarantee, we have the Social Fund, we have the Youth Employment Initiative, the Quality Framework for Traineeships, the European Alliance for Apprenticeships and of course the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation. I suppose in many ways it is too early to really assess the progress made by most of these instruments – for example the Youth Guarantee or the Youth Employment Initiative – but I think it would be fair to say that so far progress is slow and uneven. In this context I think we need a renewed effort from the Commission to encourage Member States to immediately set about the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. I mean, after all, this is supposed to be a flagship project for European Union policy and if we are really serious about its implementation we need to take action. Obviously I believe youth unemployment needs to be a specific objective within the European Semester and also measures to combat youth unemployment. I am happy that it is included in the country-specific recommendations and the national reform projects and that must remain a priority. I believe too that the Youth Guarantee should be extended to young people under 30. However we also have to deal with the supply side as well as the demand side and in this context we need to ensure easier access to financing and simpler rules for setting up new businesses. However in many countries, like my own, Ireland, many SMEs are already overburdened with debt. It is not simply a question of easier access to finance – small businesses do not want to take on new borrowings and there is a problem with adequate working capital – so they are caught in a bind. Some mechanisms have to be found to deal with the overhang of debt, otherwise many SMEs will struggle and are doomed to fail.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 19, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   Ms Harkin, thank you for your kind remarks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 20, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Inês Cristina ZUBER", "mepid": "111589", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, how long have we been here, we have been here, discussing, regretting, listening to commiserations, promises of everything to be done to solve a problem that is leaving young people of an entire generation without the possibility of planning safely and dignity your life project? It is important to understand what has changed since then: little or nothing. 23% of young people in the European Union are unemployed, and in some countries, such as Greece and Spain, more than half of young people in these countries are unemployed. In several countries like mine, for example, attempts are being made today to manipulate the statistics, omitting that a slight decrease in this statistic is also due, rather, to the untied bleeding of immigration, to the growing number of young people who are forced to leave their country, which only finds an equivalent if we go back to times of poverty several decades ago when we had fascism. And also omitting that those jobs that are created have very precarious employment links, which are replaced ... work with rights for work without rights. Now we have to know the following: how is this Youth Guarantee program different, is it different from all the other programs that have existed before? Occupational and internship programs that did not give any perspective on the future, but that have existed for several years. So, how is this program different from the ones we all already know? And, if we really want to end precariousness, one of the wounds that most compromises the present and future of these young workers ...

During the election campaign, we heard incessantly how much should be done to get the problem of youth unemployment under control in the European Union. My group will make this issue one of the most important priorities in the upcoming legislature, not only because it will deprive millions of young people in Europe, but also because, in the long term, it will lead to European societies and the European Union itself falling apart. For years, young people in Europe have been told about austerity policies. It is said that one has to consolidate public budgets in order to make new employment possible. In addition to the aforementioned social consequences of this policy, even the term “austerity” is wrong. Is it economical to pursue a policy that, according to a Eurofound study, takes away 153 billion euros from the EU member states every year? Is it economical if this money is wasted because not enough is being done in the fight against youth unemployment? This money and the half-baked support will not be enough to solve the dramatic problem of youth unemployment. We therefore demand, among other things, an end to the blind austerity policy, which primarily affects young people in the field of education and labor market policy, and instead invest in the future of young people. We call for a meaningful implementation of the Youth Guarantee with more support from the European level, as is also proposed in the joint resolution. And we ask that, in the face of many other demands that will be decided in the resolution together with many Members of this Parliament, these words are finally followed by action. Because the question of whether or not the European Union will be able to solve the problem of youth unemployment in the next few years will point the way for the entire integration project. If we fail, we lose a common future and an entire generation. But if we can work together to master this challenge in solidarity, it will be a first step towards a socially just and stable European Union.

We need to make sure that there is more funding after 2016. And we need more European solidarity, for example when it comes to co-financing. We Social Democrats also call for standards in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, the establishment of binding targets for combating youth unemployment within the framework of the European Semester. In addition, we also need European minimum standards for good work, for good apprenticeship positions and good vocational internships. Wage and social dumping is not the solution to youth unemployment.

The youth unemployment rate in the EU is still too high. I am glad that this problem has been recognized in this home and that there is a consensus on how to solve it as seriously as possible. Unfortunately, however, we have not yet reached a consensus on measures that would be effective and beneficial for all Member States. On the contrary, I think we are going in the wrong direction by trying to find a universal solution, without taking into account the specificities of each of the Member States. From the perspective of poorer members, youth mobility is a disastrous solution that only improves statistical indicators in the short term. For example, if Germany needs workers, while in some member states a lot of young people are sitting without a job, then logic dictates that they look for happiness in Germany. This is certainly good for Germany, but it is disastrous for the poorer members who thus travel towards economic and demographic collapse. If we want a healthy Union of Sustainable Economies, we need to approach this problem at the level of the individual Member State. First of all, we need to work on further connecting the education system and the real sector so that young people can meet the needs of the labor market after graduation. I also consider it crucial to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit among young people and make it as easy as possible to start private companies. Europe today offers countless opportunities to young people.

Thirdly, it does not address the fundamental problem, namely the EU's austerity policy, which is creating even more youth unemployment. EU austerity policies mean, for example, dismissal of civil servants and higher retirement age. It helps to create even more young unemployed people. Of course, that is also the reason why we are proposing a radical change in EU policy. We demand that the EU's cut-off line be stopped, and at the same time we must recognize that the labor markets are vastly different in the various EU countries. The solution is to give member states the opportunity to find solutions themselves - without forcing a unification.

What else to expect? Do you want a generation conflict? Do you want all young people to go elsewhere than in Europe to find an El Dorado that does not exist at home? Young people today are experiencing a real social hazing. The most striking thing takes place when entering the labor market, in this period of transition which is lengthening, notably with internships; internships which are neither recognized nor remunerated and which are truly an adjustment variable for this youth. Youth unemployment distresses young people but it also distresses families. Since 2008, they have been subjected to the double penalty, even though they are the first victims of the financial crisis and its consequences. The austerity implemented by the Member States is pushing them even further into precariousness. Is it normal that 30% of 15-27 year olds live below the poverty line? We should all be standing in this hemicycle to say no to that. It's intolerable! Youth really should not be this adjustment variable for the economy. So you are all talking about debt.

They have forgotten that decisions should be taken at the level closest to the citizen. The challenges facing each of the Member States are varied and different. In my constituency of the North-East of England, almost one in four young people are unemployed. We have the highest levels of youth unemployment in the UK. Our manufacturing industry, which was once the powerhouse of the region, has been decimated. It is European Union legislation which is preventing us from being competitive once more. Competitiveness is what drives economies forward; it is what is needed to prevent jobs going overseas. In the UK we need to learn from other countries; we need to learn from Germany that there should be no stigma attached to manual jobs. We need to learn that young people should be taught to take as much pride from vocational as from academic routes. Most of all we need an education system that reflects the needs of industry and 21st Century society. The free movement of workers, which means uncontrolled immigration, causes a massive problem in the UK. That principle might have worked when all EU countries had similar standards of living but, when we have Member States with a minimum wage of 80 pence an hour, migration to the UK becomes a big issue. It causes wage compression and it means experienced workers from other countries are able to take UK-based jobs and deprive British young people of their first step on the career ladder, and what we do not need is misguided European Union intervention.  As the President of the EPP’s Youth Wing, Costas Kyranakis, has said, the Youth Guarantee Fund is not working. The measures push short-term employment and short-term internships but, when only 9% of interns actually go on to get the job, this is not effective. The International Labour Organisation has said it is ineffective. The Youth Guarantee has come to mean guaranteed failure. Sometimes the answer is not more Europe. The answer is for countries to work together, for national governments to innovate, for us to learn from each other, to learn from best practice and to learn from the many charitable organisations which have a phenomenal success rate in getting young people back into work.

This policy is first and foremost to support the European Social Fund for the youth guarantee, which constitutes the backbone of our policy by 2020. The initiative for youth employment - and I have heard a lot of confusion this morning - is just the tip of the iceberg. The 6 billion euros is the front loading we obtained so that in 2014 and 2015 there are immediate policies that are put in place by the Member States for young people. Obviously, the Heads of State and Government were much more inclined to communicate on the subject than to hold the Turin summit, as Karima Delli said earlier.

This applies to many Central and Eastern European countries, for example, over 2 million mainly young people left Poland after 2004. Were it not for this emigration, unemployment would have been much higher. However, the departure of young people deepens the demographic crisis, contributes to economic and political stagnation, and takes away the dynamics of these societies. In addition, emigrants most often work much below their qualifications, often in unworthy conditions, inconsistent with the standards of a given country. The motive for emigration is also the willingness to start a family that young people cannot afford in their own country.

I have already said this to Mr Juncker at a meeting when he visited our group and met Members who are fighting for sovereignty and democracy in the EFDD. We love Europe, which is a beautiful continent, but we are against this terrible Union. We really want to work together with other countries in Europe, of course, but not in this way, and we do not want to lose our own sovereignty. Every day we see national powers being transferred to Brussels; it will not take long before we have no say any more about our own future. The United States of Europe will be a fact, with Sweden as a province. In Sweden we have 25% of young people out of work. Why is this happening? The European Council has come with its Youth Employment Initiative. That EU strategy is a real failure; it was set up to support young people not in education, employment or training in regions with a youth unemployment rate in 2012 of above 25%. There are very large disparities between the youth employment rates in different regions. For example, in Spain and Cyprus the rates of youth unemployment in December 2013 were 54.3% and 40.8% respectively. In Greece, the youth unemployment rate for November 2013 was 59%. In Sweden it stands currently at around 25%. The problem is that most of the EU funding allocated to addressing youth unemployment will be allocated to countries with a much higher youth unemployment rate than Sweden. So we are the backyard and we can pay for the other countries, which is totally unfair. As have I said already, solidarity is very easy when other people’s money is involved. Youth unemployment is today again an item on the agenda of this House. Again we have recommendations on how to tackle youth unemployment in the EU. Again we are trying to make it easier for young people to move to jobs or training and to have EU support for quality standards for traineeships and apprenticeships. Well, let me explain something: it does not matter how many times we put youth unemployment on the agenda, and it does not matter if we add another EUR 300 billion from Mr Juncker to boost growth and jobs – the EU will not succeed. Our taxpayers already contribute the role of the money to the EU and now again Mr Juncker wants to have more money for his first top priority as Commission President. More money for what? More money to create jobs, which is pure Communism and shows that Mr Juncker was running away on the Communistic highway even before being elected.

In my country, Greece, unfortunately, the European funds and programs related to tackling youth unemployment are managed by the government as they see fit. Young people who manage to get into a program will get their money back in almost a year, because the government, instead of using the money of European taxpayers for the purpose for which it is available, withholds it and presents it as a primary surplus. Instead, it raises unemployment with continued layoffs as demanded by the Troika and international moneylenders. In 2014, an additional 6,500 new redundancies were announced in the public sector, while in the private sector, collective redundancies were released. We call for a reassessment of funding criteria and for more funds to be made available to the countries of the South, which have been hit hardest by the economic crisis and austerity policies. This will help reduce youth unemployment so that they do not have to look for work in other countries. The responsibility for rising youth unemployment lies solely with governments that do not use the money of European programs aimed at growth to provide solutions and opportunities for young people for their future jobs.

We have to counter the trend towards de-industrialization. Young people need support for small and medium-sized companies. They are the job engine in the EU with over two thirds of all jobs.

Over the last few years, it has been talked about at length in the European Union. We are seeing how in some countries the personal option to emigrate has become a generational obligation, unfortunately. The alarm over the lack of hope and the present for a continent where young people cannot find work is the condemnation of its future. That is why we established the Youth Guarantee - to which we dedicated 6 billion euros - which is now beginning to be applied in some countries. I come from the country that has the dishonorable taste of being the country with the highest youth unemployment rate in the Western world: Spain. More than a quarter of the resources of the Youth Guarantee will go to this country: we will see what is going to be done in our country with that money. Unfortunately, we believe that the use will be absolutely fraudulent, using the resources in bonuses for public procurement - something that we know does not work. It is one more tool of the internal evaluation strategy, which causes you to end up firing your parents to hire your children with public subsidies from the European Union, the latter being able to be fired in turn after six months without returning those aids. That is what is happening in our country. And, furthermore, we know that, as deficit targets are met and spending is also accounted for in those deficit targets of the Youth Guarantee, we find countries with more unemployment that have these deficit targets, which is absolutely counterproductive. We have to find an answer to the following question: what is the scale of this problem? During the last few years, in the economic crisis, we allocated between 600 billion and 1.6 trillion - it depends on the calculation - to rescue the financial system.

The European Union also has programs such as Your first EURES job, programs within Erasmus +, it has cohesion policy funds, namely the European Social Fund, which should be used for job creation. But efficient and rapid use of these funds and programs is required. At the moment, we are still witnessing a paradox: we have unemployment, but we also have job vacancies to fill.

Sufficient resources are necessary for each of them and a European control of their effective application. Second: we must start from education and its adequate relationship with work in the immediate environment of each young person, but also with the promotion of mobility and the real existence of a European economic and labor space.

Despite more than 23% of youth unemployment, nearly 4 million jobs remain unfilled due to a lack of knowledgeable and skilled workers. Appropriate reform of education systems as part of the common European strategy for improving education, which we keep talking about and unfortunately doing nothing about, should be the first and fundamental step towards improving the situation on the labor market. The Union should focus on the development of a dual education system and the creation of structures for early personalized career counseling. This will allow for a more conscious choice of the educational path and subsequent professional career. The youngest children should be provided with access to education and the acquisition of the widest possible initial stock of knowledge, so that the future will be able to re-qualify much faster and easier when the labor market changes. Investing in youth pays off. Promoting mobility can also significantly increase the employability of young people.

With regard to my speech at the European Council of 26 and 27 June on the issue of youth employment in Europe, everyone knows that the arrival of young people on the labor market is each year more thwarted: thwarted by unlimited globalization which places both young graduates and young people without qualifications in a situation of unfair competition in the face of the loss of market share of European companies, and in particular of small and medium-sized companies, which are by nature job creators, and thwarted by uncontrolled immigration, the most visible reflection of globalism which plays down wage levels.

As the Commissioner mentioned, as many as seven countries have not yet drawn up plans to implement the Youth Guarantee. Youth unemployment can no longer be described as a problem of lack of education or unskilled skills alone. Training, appropriate and early career guidance, and high-quality education for the labor market are, of course, part of the solution, but job creation, the other side of the problem, must be high on the European Union's agenda. Another important problem is discrimination against young people in the workplace. Even after getting a job, young people are discriminated against and exploited, which makes statistics on poverty and social exclusion among young people unjustifiably high in our Europe.

The EU should continue to support the Erasmus and Erasmus Plus training exchange programs, which will lead to a more focused and efficient workforce, which in turn will attract employers. The free movement of labor and services can only work if people speak foreign languages ​​at a communication level, so they need to be encouraged to do so. The European Union should also pay more attention to the disruption of rigid family structures and corruption, which will enable young and competent people to reach relevant positions that are now inaccessible to them. However, the current paradigm in the approach to motivating young people also needs to be changed, not only to teach them \"study a lot, get a job in a company and you will have a lifetime\", but they need to be encouraged to move creatively in a small business.

Going a step further, I also advocate the use of contributions from the European Social Fund, the ERDF and the EAFRD, which are essential for the sustainable inclusion of young people in the labor market.

Some of us also said that it was going to be an open door to precariousness when we renounced the fact that it was a European system, that is, with general rules to be fulfilled by all States. This debate is much more: this debate has to do with the labor reforms that the Commission, within the framework of the European Semester, has promoted to generalize the loss of rights and the reduction of wages; This debate has to do with the lack of guarantees in labor mobility so that many young people who are leaving their countries also receive guarantees and equal opportunities. This debate also has to do with the pockets of fraud that exist in all States with work grants, which we are unable to stop. Therefore, Commissioner, when we talk about youth employment, we have to be aware that employment is more than a right recognized in our rules: it is the umbilical cord by which a citizen feels or does not feel part of a society.

The fight against youth unemployment has to be much more than an apology invoked in party struggles. It requires reasoning, commitments and partnerships from different authors.

We must also look at our industrial policy to create employment for young people who want to work with their hands, in order to prevent the lower educated from being displaced by the higher educated in the labor market. Our young people deserve a future perspective and therefore a larger budget than the current six billion euros, a higher age limit than 25; this should be raised to 30.

Reforming our education and training systems is a very important element of that programme – that has been mentioned by the Commissioner here this morning – and I think it is something we really need to concentrate on.  In a recent survey of eight European countries, one third of employers said that the lack of skills among young people is causing major businesses problems in the form of cost, quality and time. Almost 30% of employers reported that a lack of skills was a major reason they did not fill their vacancies. And employers from countries with the highest youth unemployment reported the greatest problems due to skill shortages. Youth unemployment is not a new problem for Europe and we should note it. In 1995 it stood at 21% and since then it has not gone below 15%, so it is an institutional issue. A critical reason that youth do not get the skills that employers need is that education providers, young people and employers do not understand one another. They operate in parallel universes and they rarely interact. So we need to change the structure of how we teach young people skills. We need to focus on giving them the skills that the market needs, and that they are able to respond to what employers really need so that we can be sure that our young people have sustainable jobs. I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that this is a focus not just in my country but across Europe as well.

First of all, I note with great satisfaction that the youth guarantee - the \"Youth Guarantee\" - is a reality, a satisfaction, because it is a measure adopted also starting from an initiative of my party, the European Socialist Party, and of YES, the young European socialists. For this result, we must also thank the commitment of Commissioner Andor, who engaged in a difficult context for this measure. For this reason I ask the Commission to strengthen the monitoring tools for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in the Member States. We cannot accept that what has been painstakingly achieved in Europe will then get bogged down at the level of implementation. It is a luxury that the young people of Europe cannot afford. As other colleagues have also said, I also believe that it is essential to broaden the available base of resources and gradually extend - as Juncker also said yesterday - the extension of the guarantee up to thirty years. The second point I want to make is that young people in Europe are certainly the most mobile generation and it is therefore important to complete the mobility of the workforce, especially for young people because it is a basic condition for the functioning of the single market. In light of this, I ask the new Commission, and therefore I hope it will be possible to discuss again in the future with the new Commission, to promote new measures to support the mobility of young European workers, for example in relation to pension rights.

Yesterday morning, the newly elected President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, rightly said: “The crisis will not be over until the problem of high unemployment in Europe - especially youth unemployment - is resolved. Since 2008, youth unemployment in the Union has risen steadily up to 50% in some countries. The initiative's funds have been available since September 1, 2013. So my question to you, Commissioner Andor, is: how can it be that the European Commission has only accepted the programs of two countries so far? And how can it be that it took five years for something to happen at European level? Youth unemployment has been rising since 2008, and the initiative was only adopted in 2013. How can we work more effectively here? Wouldn't it also make more sense to increase the age to 30? At the beginning you mentioned the seminar in Brussels. Could you perhaps reiterate what has been said by the experts and what evidence has been withheld that could help accelerate programs, projects and initiatives in the Member States? Because in my opinion this is one of the biggest problems. Then I would like to point out this best practice in how Europe works. Austria has already been mentioned. In Luxembourg, too, the project officially started in June this year, and although unemployment is not that high in Luxembourg, it is still important to get work, school and orientation at the roots and find a solution here.

Many devices would make it possible to reduce youth unemployment more quickly, like those implemented in France since the coming to power of François Hollande. We make young people, who are the future of Europe, our priority. For this to really be a European priority, the budget must follow and the general austerity policy must end. Concretely, we continue to ask to increase the youth guarantee to 21 billion euros and to extend the measure to beneficiaries up to 30 years. The Commission and Mr Juncker must take stock of this issue. Strengthening vocational training at European level is also crucial. The Erasmus + program must be extended to apprentices and the Leonardo program must be strengthened. The recognition, at European level, of the professional experience given by internships must go faster. We must even go further - mobility being an important factor for the employment of young people - by defining a common framework for internships and vocational training.

Any measure that can reduce unemployment, which gives young people the chance to do an internship, a practice, is welcome.

An unemployed young person in Europe does not want a new unpaid internship, but wants a stable, well-paid job that will give him a perspective, to be able to start a family, to be able to buy a house. The reality is that jobs are created primarily by the private sector: entrepreneurs, SMEs, small family businesses. We believe that it is our duty as politicians to provide the private sector with an economic framework in which it can trust, be able to invest, a strong, competitive economy. This will generate stable and well-paid jobs in the long run. Europe needs reforms.

I would like to reassure you that the Turin Youth Employment Summit has only been postponed to have the full new Commission in office. However, the unemployment rate is rising among young people and so we need to tackle two main challenges. The first is that the Youth Guarantee with its 6 billion in the next few years will increase to at least 21, as we have already asked, and that it is not only a response aimed at a specific target of young people, namely the supply chain for training orientation, apprenticeships and work, but also an opportunity for Member States to reorganize the network of services, opportunities and incentives and the reform of apprenticeships also in higher education, that is, it must become a new active labor policy.

I expected, ladies and gentlemen, that this would make us more condescending in order to demand practical measures from the competent Commissioner.

Because the time is short and the discussion itself was quite long, I will try to be brief but also concrete. I agree with everyone who stressed that the European Union needs to do more for economic growth and job creation overall, not only focusing on the young generation but on the entire labour market. However, we have reasons, strong reasons, to develop measures and reforms targeted at the young generation, improving school-to-work transitions in the European Union, because young people have been disproportionately hit by the consequences of the financial and economic crisis, and as is well known the youth unemployment rate is more than twice as high as the overall unemployment rate in the European Union. But our starting point is that Europe indeed is quite diverse. It is also very imbalanced. There are some countries which have been performing quite well and we have to help others learn from the good performers – this expression has been used widely in this discussion, including by Mr Arnott. Indeed the good examples of Austria, Germany and other countries where there is not such a great gap between the overall unemployment level and the youth unemployment rate need to be studied and if possible taken over. This applies to the various forms of dual training, apprenticeship models, but also how the public employment services function in these countries, and I strongly believe that good social dialogue and social partnership also contribute to finding the right solutions and the right ways forward. The Youth Guarantee is not a one-size-fits-all policy. The EU agreed on some key principles and parameters which can be delivered if the financial backing is also provided. But the Member States themselves are developing their own national Youth Guarantee schemes in close cooperation with the Commission, and also paying attention to each other. Questions have been raised concerning specific countries, such as Spain or Italy where the situation is indeed much more serious than in some other cases. The Commission is paying close attention to these countries. I myself before the end of this week will be going to Italy to attend the informal Council and next week once more to Spain, and these missions allow for comparing notes with the governments about progress with the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. This implementation does not entirely depend on the EUR 6 billion financial instrument, because this is a top-up fund to supplement the European Social Fund resources and the national resources that also have to be used. Almost all countries are still spending the ESF allocations of the previous period that ended last December. So because of the financial factor there are no delays. In fact those who have any kind of questions were given a good explanation of how to use these financial resources in March, which all the Ministers received, and some countries take advantage of the European Investment Bank bridging finance facility to accelerate funding to youth-related measures. This is of course not sufficient if we look at the very severe imbalances inside the eurozone. I agree with those who stressed that there is indeed a link between the EMU imbalances, and that is why we do not just have to monitor these imbalances through a scoreboard which includes youth unemployment and inactivity, but also to continue working on EMU reform and consider options for counter-cyclical fiscal capacity. This is what the Council will also discuss later this week in an informal setting in Milan – what options exist. The age limit has been discussed. Member States – and this needs to be known – Member States are allowed to go to 30 years if they opt for this. However, the Commission has been encouraging all these Member States first of all to focus on the generational cohorts under 25, to introduce the measures – very important reform measures – to support and improve school-to-work transitions, whether on the education and training side or on the labour market side. And once this is successful for under-25s obviously there should be no reason to refrain from going to a higher age bracket. This is not only a supply-side question – this is my answer to Mr Schwab. Skills are very important. Supply-side measures are important but the Youth Guarantee also has to be able to intervene on the side of the demand for labour and supplement the missing demand in many cases, especially at a time of recession. The Commission has been working very closely with the Member States and also checking how the funds are used and how the reforms are prepared. It is not only a matter of personal visits which I made in pilot cases in the city of Évora in Portugal, or Ballymun in Ireland, or the Extremadura region in Spain where there is a regional Youth Guarantee scheme already in place. We also use the European Semester to assess and provide feedback to the Member States and we cooperate with the ILO and the OECD which are also involved in technical advice. It is true that the Turin meeting of Heads of State and Government has been postponed but the Italian Presidency keeps youth employment and the Youth Guarantee among its priorities and the attention of the Heads of State and Government remains very important. So the Youth Guarantee is a major flagship initiative. The Commission is working with the Member States and other stakeholders to implement it, but this is of course not a substitute for the right macroeconomic policies or industrial policies which will help generate economic growth and jobs in the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 120, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "Motions for resolutions to be tabled pursuant to Rule 123 (2) of the Rules of Procedure will be notified subsequently.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday 17 July 2014.

It is extremely important to keep public finances in good order - this is how investments come to the state. And investments are what create new jobs. In Estonia, the government debt burden is the lowest in the European Union and Estonia has been a fairly attractive destination for foreign direct investment. In addition, both general and youth unemployment in Estonia is lower than the EU average. Nevertheless, the relatively high youth unemployment is also a significant problem in Estonia. I firmly believe that education is the best way to fight unemployment. In Estonia, there is a strong correlation between unemployment and the level of education - the unemployment rate is lower among people with a higher level of education.

But because states are in debt, they can’t use this tool, so they have to dance in a heap and try to find ways that can lead to results without tax cuts. However, real recovery can only be expected from tax cuts and the consequent economic growth. Unemployment among the under-25s averages nearly 24 percent in EU countries.

For example, citizens in Croatia, which is in the process of excessive deficit, currently \"pay\" the price of non-membership in the eurozone, so due to exchange rate differences, rates for housing loans and other types of lending are often extremely high.

"date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Della Vedova Benedetto", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President-in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have asked the Council and the Commission to make a statement on the situation of payments in the EU budget. This is an issue directly linked to the budget negotiations underway this year. The Council recognizes the existence of a specific problem relating to invoices, overdue payments, in particular in the area of ​​cohesion policies. Such payments, like all others, must of course be made. Obviously, it is in the interest of the Council that no Member State has to deal on its own with the consequences of a problem which risks leading to an increase in national budget deficits. But there is another important aspect in relation to the budget which concerns the ways in which to achieve a correct balance between two different kinds of interests. On the one hand, we must respect the commitments we have made, and on the other we must take into account the need to ensure that the EU budget reflects the requirement for individual Member States to fully respect the deficit targets set in the Pact of stability and growth, a requirement which is primarily a European obligation. It is true that last year we agreed on the annual budget ceilings from 2014 to 2020 in the Multiannual Financial Framework, but these ceilings do not constitute expenditure targets. Rather, they must be assessed annually in the context of the economic situation of the Member States and the possible impact on national budgets. This Parliament together with the Council approved a legislative package three years ago which lays down the basic rules that impose such budgetary discipline on the Member States. Therefore, the EU budget requires careful planning. Requests from Member States to create sufficient margins below the ceilings are made to try to control unforeseen or unexpected financial needs. Therefore, I strongly hope that we can avoid a debate in which we try to divide the European Union between good and bad, those who want to spend generously and those who first of all want to save. We're all in this together. We want to use and invest the EU budget in the most effective way to stimulate innovation, growth and jobs. At the same time, we must bear in mind the budgetary constraints within which we find ourselves operating. The experience of the last two years shows that the Council is always willing to respond to proposals to cover justified and urgent payment needs. Last year we approved an amending budget of € 11.2 billion. Why did we ask that it be divided into two parts? To ensure adequate monitoring of changes in payment needs, but also to assist national budgetary authorities in adjusting to the resulting additional financial burden. This year we will participate in the same spirit in the discussion and negotiations on the draft amending budgets that are on the table, as well as on the draft budget for 2015. Although the backlog of payments in the area of ​​cohesion was very high towards the end of the year. last year, it decreased significantly from 23 to 10 billion euros in the first half of the current year. We are evidently going through a transition phase between the accumulated bills at the end of a programming period and the start of a new period where a certain amount of time is required for the implementation of programs and for these to be fully effective in terms of economic leverage. We should take advantage of this situation rather than risk our negotiations failing. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our national economies and the need to promote growth in investments require an EU budget that is designed and implemented in the most effective way to deliver results. The Italian Presidency is ready to spend all its energies to achieve this goal.

The discussion is indeed timely, as both branches of the budgetary authority are engaging in discussions on the amending budgets for 2014, requesting additional payment appropriations, and on the 2015 draft budget. Over the last few years, the budgetary authority has effectively followed a two-step approach whereby, first, an artificially low level of payment appropriations was authorised in the budget with the understanding, reflected in a recurrent joint statement, that a supplementary amending budget might be needed in the course of the year once implementation provided compelling evidence that more payment appropriations were needed. We saw this in 2012, when an amending budget of EUR 6 billion was adopted at the end of the year, and again in 2013 when, thanks in particular to the determination and support of Parliament, an additional EUR 11.2 billion was eventually made available to cover outstanding needs. This approach in agreeing the budget in successive stages makes the budgetary process almost unintelligible and undermines the EU’s credibility. The EU budget should serve to implement our common priorities. This must be taken with seriousness and realism, addressing all the foreseen needs in the knowledge that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) provides the tools to address unforeseen needs should they arise.  The Commission proposals for the 2015 draft budget and for amending the 2014 budget reflect a responsible and realistic approach but again, realistically, they will only lead to stabilising the overall situation. The new MFF provides for enhanced flexibility, not least thanks to the determination of Parliament. The Commission has consistently made it clear that the overall payment ceiling defined in the 2014-2020 MFF would require the implementation of specific and maximum flexibility, and that it would make use of available flexibility instruments as provided for in the MFF Regulation if and where needed.  This is what the Commission did in late May this year by presenting draft amending budget No 3, with a request to use the remaining margin under the payment ceiling – some EUR 700 million – and the activation of the contingency margin mechanism for an amount of EUR 4 billion. Such a request is justified by the payment shortages experienced in several programmes and by a number of unforeseen circumstances, including a higher than expected pace of implementation in cohesion policy, which led to an unprecedented level of unpaid bills at the end of 2013 to be covered with appropriations in the 2014 budget. For the 2015 draft budget, the Commission proposes to make full use of the payment ceiling agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework. Combined with a careful management of resources these measures should curb the global growth of outstanding commitments and provide the means to address our obligations stemming from previous years’ commitments.  Let me take this opportunity to give a face to this problem. It is not just about ministries or universities or even Member States as such, getting money back later than expected. In many programmes, for example in research and innovation, we have small private companies that have valid contracts and have performed their agreed work and incurred the agreed costs and now could face a situation in which the Commission simply cannot pay them in time. The Commission will have to mitigate these risks. In this context, the risk of SME bankruptcy will be one important factor to consider. These proposals are also a key condition to kick-start the new investments in infrastructure, innovation, growth and jobs needed for the new period 2014-2020, precisely in line with the strategic priorities for the Union as agreed by the Heads of State and Government on 26 and 27 June. Developments on the revenue side should greatly facilitate the solution. Exceptional additional revenue from fines stemming from the enforcement of competition policy will accrue on the EU budget in 2014, meaning that the additional payments requested for 2014 will be at virtually no cost to the Member States.  At the budgetary trilogue last week, Parliament and the Council had a first opportunity to exchange views on the Commission proposals for the three amending budgets for 2014 and for the 2015 draft budget. The Commission is doing everything within its powers to address a difficult situation. We can only hope that the Council and Parliament will soon reach agreement on a sustainable solution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 196, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, to speak of expenditure on payments is to refer to investments already made in favor of innovation, research, the promotion of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the promotion of employment . These expenses are legally incurred with the agreement and at the request of the Member States. Beneficiaries are young people, small and medium-sized companies, researchers, universities, local authorities. It is not acceptable that these expenses already incurred do not have sufficient amounts to be paid. It's not about saving here, it's about paying what you owe. In cohesion policy alone, we have more than 23.4 billion euros of expenditure already made, for which there is no financial availability. All studies show that cohesion policy makes a positive contribution to all 28 Member States and its 272 regions. In addition to infrastructures, we are also talking about support for young people, training, innovation, research, environmental protection and sustainable growth. The European Union institutions must be exemplary in terms of their commitments. Payment expenses are commitments assumed and already made. Not paying means, in addition to not respecting commitments, a breach of solidarity with the Member States and regions that are in greatest difficulty. The Council must work together to resolve the payment problem. Failure to do so is to act against oneself, it is to lose authority and credibility.

It could appeal to the credibility of the European Union and to the need for our partners to trust that we will meet our international commitments; or compliance with the agreements of the European Council, which, at its last meeting, for example, agreed on the need to invest and prepare the economies of the member states to meet transport, energy or telecommunications needs. But honestly, these appeals have never been of any use. We have given them reasons and we have given them figures and the Council has continued to act as usual: not paying and cutting money. I am glad to hear the Council acknowledge that we have a problem; but it has just agreed on the level of payments for 2015 and has cut the European Commission proposal by 2 billion. I honestly don't know what your plan is. I don't know if they have it. I don't know if you think that by not tackling the problem we will solve it, and that is why I would like to hear from the Italian Presidency, which we trust to solve this problem, the proposal of a package of measures to put an end to the problem of non-payments. And I'm going to give you a few ideas. First: to approve the amending budgets, to reduce this debt by 4.7 billion euros. Second: work now on a review of the financial framework to be able to raise these maximum payment limits. Third: definitely promote this high-level group and work on new own resources for the European Union project. Fourth: to draw up a proposal for financial instruments to mobilize resources to be able to invest in the long-term investment plan that the Union sorely needs. And fifth, for example, to draw up a proposal to exclude the national contribution to the European budget from counting the deficit of the countries, and thus relax the tensions suffered by national finances. We have given you reasons, figures and even solutions, but if you need more examples I will give them to you. Because behind these unpaid bills there are municipalities, there are small companies that need their money back, and there are also NGOs. I will finish, President, with one last example: humanitarian aid programs have been paralyzed and 400 Iraqi families do not even have money to eat.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 198, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Bernd KÖLMEL", "mepid": "124824", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mister President! We are talking today about the EU's outstanding debt obligations, which have reached a level that is a matter of great concern. The current payment budget of the EU is 135.5 billion euros, and now the budget is to be increased by 4.7 billion euros for payments through a supplementary budget No. 3. Of this, 4 billion euros will be accounted for by additional revenue, which the Member States will ultimately have to raise. For example, Germany has to pay 668 million euros for this amount. Although these funds are to be credited to future budgets, according to the draft supplementary budget not immediately as planned, but only in the budget years 2018 to 2020. This shifts the burdens into the future and significantly limits the budgetary sovereignty of future parliaments. Can the Commission guarantee that it won't need more money in 2018? I would like this information. In addition, z. B. provided in the supplementary budget to make these payments for so-called unforeseen expenses. But every year there are unforeseen expenses. It is also noteworthy that this expenditure is partly necessary because it is determined in this way by EU regulations. For example, with the ESF, the pre-financing rate for a particular measure was set almost ten times as high as usual. That alone has led to additional spending of 99 million euros. But if these expenses are deliberately brought about by regulations, are they unforeseen? We say: no. We, the ECR, oppose budget increases through the back door.

The May 25 poll made it possible to measure its full extent. Each public actor has a duty to be exemplary by staying away from hypocritical and unsustainable practices. From this point of view, the European Union is jeopardizing its authority due to the explosion of \"remainder to liquidate\" (RAL) and the alarming increase in unpaid bills. The RAL, this practice justified by the time lag between the authorization of commitment and the realization of the corresponding expenditure, reached an unprecedented level of 222 billion euros on December 31, 2013. The Council must align its promises and its acts. Any complacency in the matter activates a fatal gear. For lack of courage, the gap widens from year to year and comes a time when delinquencies accumulate. As of December 31, 2013, the invoices due reached more than 23 billion euros, in sharp acceleration: 5 billion at the end of 2010, 11 billion at the end of 2011, 16 billion at the end of 2012. Undoubtedly 26 billion at the end of 2014 if no corrective measures are taken. . This situation is outrageous. At the start of the legislature, we must resolve this drift because it contradicts the principles that we intend to ensure that the Member States respect in terms of the sincerity of their public finances. The Commission has just sent us three draft amending budgets which will reduce the pile of unpaid bills by 4.7 billion. Unpaid bills affect NGOs for humanitarian aid, field hospitals in the Middle East, students deprived of Erasmus grants, researchers in need of funding, and local communities deprived of resources. The account is not there. In this context, the alternative is simple. Either we reduce the commitments and proceed to strict trade-offs by giving priority to investments for the future, competitiveness and employment, or else the Member States accept an additional contribution covering unpaid debts. Although not liquidated, this share of costs should be entered in the budgets of the Member States. It is futile to imagine that waves of fines would be enough to alleviate this debt. I am impatiently awaiting the new own resources, but I doubt that we are on the eve of their collection and, in any case, this European taxation should be offset by the reduction, by the same amount, in the weight of the levies compulsory levies levied by Member States. We must act without delay. The European Union is not intended to get into debt in a sneaky way. Finally, of course, the post-electoral review of the multiannual budgetary framework will have to sanction the end of this ubiquitous system. Our heads of state and government can no longer make promises on the back of the European budget without providing the corresponding funding. I am thinking of the youth employment initiative announced in 2013 for an amount of 6 billion euros. Stop hypocrisy. The image of Europe in the eyes of our fellow citizens is in question.

Recently, I have learned, for example, that the European Union is not like the Lannisters, that the European Union does not pay its debts: they tell me that it owes more than 24 billion euros to the Member States and that, year after year, the The Commission and the Council are engaged in 'beating around the bush', as they are doing here today. This has really surprised me. You see, I come from a country to which the Union, through the troika, has been invited in very non-transparent and very undemocratic ways to change the Constitution to put the payment of the debt to the banks ahead of any investment in people's social rights. With the votes of the socialists and the popular, this reform was effectively carried out in a country that was living and is experiencing a humanitarian emergency, with millions of poor, unemployed and evicted. Seeing this situation, one tends to think that paying the debt must be something very important, something sacred, perhaps the eleventh commandment. Then you find out that the Union owes more than 24 billion and thinks that, being new, there must be something that you have not understood well. This double standard is too spectacular to be true.

This is not the first time that the EU Commission warns of empty coffers and payment defaults. This year, however, it is particularly alarming because the payment defaults appear much earlier than in previous years. The Commission is putting off a mountain of payments. We have just heard the number: 221 billion euros. The annual budget is around 135 billion euros. This shows how big this problem is. Where does it come from? One major reason is that the Council was not ready to make the payments it had promised. As a result, payments and open invoices always had to be carried over into the next few years. So the problem just keeps getting bigger. I find the Council's behavior in disregarding promised payments irresponsible. Last year the Commission had to carry over 23.4 billion into 2014, and now we have a gap of 4.7 billion. A supplementary budget has been registered for this. I urge the Council to move here. Now we still have surpluses from 2013, and with amendment budgets 2, 3 and 4 we could now find a solution that would cost the Member States only EUR 105 million. But I think it is much more crucial that we not only keep looking at what ad hoc possible solutions there are in terms of crisis intervention, but that we have to come up with more structural political solutions, and that means that we need a revision of the multiannual financial framework.

However, I would like to make one thing very clear: either the management of the European budget changes or we will find ourselves in this situation once again.

We deplored this during the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework and every year we fight against further cuts by the Council in budgetary years. Member States are now prisoners of their austerity choices. Worse, for several years we have been faced with a \"Council of bad payers\", in a mechanism that borders on the absurd. Member States underestimate their billing, postpone their payments and deny their signed commitments with the European citizens we represent; a narrow and faltering ambition where their contribution to the Union budget becomes an adjustment variable, even when it comes to long-term investments. Since 2010, we have been in increasing tension with each financial year and today, the European Commission is proposing a third amending budget to the tune of 4.7 billion euros, of which around 4 billion would be made up of the new system introduced by the MFF , the contingency reserve. First year of existence of this patch and already an unforeseen one! Is this not proof of the lack of sincerity on the part of the Member States in the Union's budget negotiations? At the same time, the Commission is proposing two other amending budgets, this time to the credit of the community. In the end, this should only bring the Member States' contribution to around one hundred million euros. And yet some oppose the application of this new device. This payments crisis is therefore neither minor nor one-off. It is a symptom. The symptom of a sick Europe. The symptom of an outdated budget system bordering on the absurd. The European Union must endow itself with new own resources, no longer depend on blackmail from the Member States. We European Socialists, for example, have long been in favor of taxing financial transactions, but we will have to go further. We must make our budget, its expenditure and its revenues, a political instrument of sustainable growth, cohesion and social justice. This crisis is also the symptom of the failure of the austerity policy. The same Member States which advocate budgetary virtue multiply contortions and writing games so as not to apply the policy that they themselves have decided! Yes, of course we need serious budget! And this seriousness should be states that pay their bills, that do not endanger thousands of companies, associations, public authorities in Europe. It should not be this unbearable austerity which destroys the European social model and condemns the States of the Union to half-measures in the face of the most important crisis that our continent has known for 70 years. This payments crisis is above all the symptom of a Europe sick with its ultraliberalism, this organized and willed disappearance of public power, this absolute and unreasoning faith in the market. We wait for private investment like a Messiah who never comes! Yet Europe needs investment. To support the economy, to fight effectively against unemployment, especially among young people, to prepare the essential green growth. And for that, a strong and sovereign public power is needed.

Every euro that is taken from the European Union is a euro taken from research, it is a euro taken from education, small businesses, agriculture, innovation, cooperation and research and that is why the commitments that States hiring in Brussels must be honored, out of respect for other countries certainly, but above all out of respect for citizens, out of respect for those who, thanks to the support of the European Union, are trying to restart the economy of our continent. I want to remind you once again that the EU budget is an extraordinary, formidable investment tool. The investments that, in its absence, the member countries would never, ever be able to finance. And unfortunately, the recent negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework have reduced the overall amount compared to the previous period, and this has happened for the first time in the history of the Union.

And not just that, but unfortunately the payment nightmare of the European Union is also such that it will not go away even if we manage to solve the acute cash-flow crisis. But we have to start somewhere. So the first thing that should be done is to mobilise all instruments available to cover the shortfall. Every year we commit ourselves to a certain number of programmes. So we all agreed to a certain total of bills – and now those bills have to be paid. This can only be done by temporarily increasing the level of payments as far as I can see. But as I said, this alone does not get us far. As the total sum of outstanding commitments keeps rising year after year, there are only painful answers left – given that we genuinely want to solve the budget crisis. As I suppose we do. Ironically, the post-financial crisis position of the Council does make sense in the way that we can spend only what we can afford to spend. But it is ironic because Member States were there when commitments were made. So, if we want to be logical in building a better Union, we first have to answer our own call. After, but only after, that has been done, can we reduce the level of payments. The level of commitments we can, and perhaps should reduce cautiously.

That is why I insist on the fact that the issue must be settled politically. Many of us, during the electoral campaign, have provided education on the usefulness of investing in the territories and the need also to take future investments out of the convergence criteria. Indeed, we will not be able to revive employment without a policy of major works, in particular infrastructure. The Structural Funds have this vocation. It will be necessary to add an infrastructure fund which will have to be greatly revalued. I am elected from a rural and agricultural constituency and the use of the ERDF and the EAFRD, in fact, associated with ambitious infrastructure policies make it possible to win twice. They contribute both immediate activity but also prepare the future of the movement and attractiveness for our regions.

Many in the House appreciate the Council because it has put a lot of excessive activity on the part of the Commission and parts of Parliament in their place.

The Council must now do its part and at least temporarily increase payments. But the Commission must deliver too. Incorrect expenses can be recognized earlier and punished more severely. The recovery system should be speeded up. I call for the N + 3 rule to be revised. Some Member States have to learn that European funding is not a never-ending story. And last, but not least, we have to ask ourselves the question much more whether European spending doesn't have to be linked to European added value. Instead of the watering can principle and waste of subsidies, we have to focus much more strongly on regional and agricultural policy. That also helps to save money.

I think the reason for today’s situation is clear: starting from a few years ago, it is a result of budgetary negotiations which provided payment appropriations at such an artificially low level, so low that it prevented us from being able to pay legitimate bills. This must be stopped and it can be stopped, provided that the Commission proposals for the draft amending budget for 2014 and the draft budget for 2015 are adopted by the budgetary authority as proposed. What the Commission asked for is observance of the agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework. That means the possibility to use payment appropriations at the level of agreed ceilings, and the possibility to make full use of flexibility mechanisms. If we do not stabilise the situation now in 2014 and 2015, then it is indeed going to be difficult to have a sustainable budget in later years. We cannot afford to kick the can down the road again and again. We cannot accumulate unpaid bills. This is why the Commission proposed the three draft amending budgets for 2014, including a contingency margin, and a draft budget for 2015 at the ceiling level. This is the call for today: to stop the snowball effect. The Commission is indeed concerned by the position that the Council is taking in relation to payments, but it hopes that negotiations will allow for common ground to be found, to provide the financial means to fulfil the Union’s legal obligations in 2014 and 2015. The Commission will continue to monitor closely the overall situation, and budget implementation, and will provide all necessary information to Parliament and the Council. It stands, of course, ready to participate actively in any interinstitutional meeting to take stock with a view to addressing outstanding needs. The Commission counts on the commitment of both the Council and Parliament to work constructively in a continuing dialogue on payments, with the objectives of addressing the 2014 payment shortages and avoiding the recurrence of artificial under-budgeting in 2015 and the following years.

The conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in June expressed the Deep Concern of the European Union, condemning the attacks carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In Iraq, a Sunni rebellion has broken out not only by ISIL, but also by several other Sunni armed groups, including neo-Ba'thisti and tribal groups. ISIL, along with armed militants, now poses a more immediate threat in Iraq than in Syria. This organisation, with its foreign fighters swollen, poses a real risk to Iraq's neighbours, such as Lebanon and Jordan, and also to the European Union. The current deterioration in the security situation in Iraq stems from both internal and external factors. Without a doubt, the crisis in Syria has allowed ISIL to gain a base and a starting point in the region for the creation of the so-called \"Islamic State\" on Syrian and Iraqi territory.  However, the causes of the recent insurgency are not limited to the expression of a terrorist ideology. The motives of most armed militants are to be found in the discontent that the Sunni community has had for more than a decade with the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. Among the reasons for discontent are the arbitrary application by the Government of Iraq of 'deba'thisation' policies, inertia in providing for the basic needs of Sunni communities and human rights violations perpetrated by the security forces. We have seen these problems exacerbate this year in the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi in Anbar province, where protests by the local Sunni population against government policies have resulted in violent clashes between Iraqi Shiite-dominated security forces and local tribes. This situation has provided ISIL with an opportunity to settle on the ground, as shown by the full-blown offensive conducted on Iraqi territory in June. The speed and effectiveness of that offensive has, however, taken the international community by surprise. All political and religious leaders in Iraq share a responsibility to address the underlying causes of these tensions. The Iraqi Government, in particular, is called upon to play a moderate role, avoiding excesses in both rhetoric and action. A tragic corollary of security conditions is the humanitarian aspects. Today, a total of two million Iraqis have been forced to flee their homes. The European Union has serious concerns about the development of this humanitarian crisis and the massive internal exodus of civilians fleeing the fighting.  The European Commission, through ECHO, has so far allocated EUR 12 million for humanitarian assistance actions. These funds are intended for Syrian refugees and Iraqi citizens displaced within their own country. Furthermore, the European Union is coordinating its actions with additional donors and international agencies, and I would like to commend the efforts that the European Union services and international agencies are making in very difficult local circumstances due to the dispersion of displaced persons throughout Iraqi territory. The EU keeps up to date on the situation, adapting relief actions to developments on the ground. Another consequence of the terrible crisis in Iraqi territory concerns the Kurdistan region. Iraqi Kurdistan has unilaterally announced in recent weeks that it intends to hold an independence referendum in the autumn. Let me stress that Iraqi Kurdistan is a model of stability throughout the region and has been an essential interlocutor of international actors, particularly in response to the humanitarian situation in Iraq. This cooperation deserves to be rewarded.  However, we believe that unilateral movements towards independence do not help to overcome the situation in Iraq and could risk being a problem for Kurdistan itself. We have called on all parties to seek a solution to this and other disputes in the Iraqi Constitution, which, if fully implemented, can provide answers to many of the Kurdish demands. The transition that began in Iraq more than a decade ago, which has always enjoyed the support of the European Union, is a difficult process. Despite the many setbacks over the years and although today the prospects of an Iraq finally routed on a path of peace and stability are under threat, recently there have also been positive signals. The elections of 30 April saw a turnout of 60% of those entitled, despite the difficult security conditions. The European Union has sent a mission of election experts to Iraq to monitor the electoral process and report on what has been observed. According to the experts' conclusions, despite some problems that should not be hidden, in particular the exclusion of a significant number of Sunni voters in Anbar province due to violence, the conduct of the elections was satisfactory. The turnout for these elections, which took place a few weeks before the Sunni insurgency, demonstrates the commitment of Iraqi citizens to democracy and unity in Iraq. In addition to security, the most immediate challenge in Iraq today is the ability of moderate political leaders to advance the political process. That is the message we have sent to those leaders in recent weeks. The early formation of a new government following the legislative elections on 30 April is a priority issue. The appointment of the President of the new Council of Representatives yesterday 15 July was a step in the right direction. A President of the Republic will now have to be appointed to allow a prime minister to be appointed and the government to be formed. The new government will have to seek dialogue with all the communities that make up Iraq, including the Sunni community currently excluded from the national political process that triggered the insurgency. Without an inclusive approach and effective dialogue, Iraqi society will not advance on the path to reconciliation.  As The High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton has repeatedly said, the exit from the Iraqi crisis is primarily a political solution, which must also lay the foundations for a security response. On the other hand, excessively harsh security measures are likely to feed sectarian discord and cause further suffering to the Iraqi people. The European Union stands ready to intervene in any way deemed useful to facilitate political dialogue, complementing the actions taken by our international partners. Despite the seriousness of the situation on the ground, the European Union continues to provide assistance and support to Iraq wherever possible, in particular in the planning and implementation of development assistance. This is a sign of the European Union's continued commitment to Iraq and is part of a joint action to make Iraq more stable by promoting governance capacities and supporting the provision of basic services. This assistance will include further support for rule of law promotion measures to follow up the work of the EUJUST LEX mission. In the light of the new security situation in Iraq, EU experts are also considering possible ways of supporting counter-terrorism actions. However, the fight against terrorism in Iraq must respect the principles of human rights and international humanitarian law. The European Union rejects the view that human rights violations would be an inevitable or necessary price for security. The European Union is also working to promote cooperation between Member States on the problem of foreign fighters, at their own request.

It took this dazzling advance of the jihadists and the establishment of the Islamic State after the capture of Mosul, to take the measure of the political and military disaster in Iraq. So, of course, we can of course constantly recall - as a Frenchman, that's easy for me - the serious mistake that was committed in 2003 by the American invasion of Iraq. This is the historical aspect, however, it does not advance the debate much today, because a lot has happened since then. Since 2011, we have focused, more or less rightly, on the chaos in Syria and this has hidden the gravity of the situation in Iraq. It is very simplistic today - as we read or hear it too often, including in this assembly - to see the deterioration of the situation in Iraq only as the consequence of the civil war in Syria. Let us not forget that Faloudja was taken by these jihadists more than six months ago. Let us not forget that these jihadists, the Islamic army, has its deep roots in Iraq, that its leaders are mostly Iraqis. These jihadists thrive on the carelessness and sectarianism of the Iraqi government, which threw into the arms of these terrorist groups the Sunni tribes who had hardly rallied to the government in 2006-2007. They also thrive on the decomposition of an Iraqi army that has been equipped and supposedly trained at great expense for years and whose armaments, today, fuel terrorist stocks in the region and elsewhere. Europeans must therefore ask themselves today about support for the Iraqi authorities. This support should not be unconditional, but linked to governance that truly integrates all components of Iraqi society. Support must also go to solutions which defend the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, not to its communal break-up. We must also question the more than ambiguous links - and I am polite - between radical Sunni groups and certain state and non-state actors in the Gulf, because these groups with which we have had a lot of leniency are today threats not only to the region but to our own security. Finally, let's not forget that the killing of the Jewish Museum in Brussels on May 24 was perpetrated by a French jihadist, Mehdi Nemmouche, who passed through the ranks of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and I would like us to have a thought for the victims of this slaughter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 230, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Ana GOMES", "mepid": "28306", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Still barely recovering from decades of oppression and the illegal American invasion in 2003, Iraq has again regressed to unbearable levels of barbarity, with the advance from Syria at war by the ISIS terrorist forces that proclaimed the Islamic State of Iraq and the Get up and continue torturing, raping and killing civilians, destroying heritage and any sign of modernity. Other countries in the region, such as Lebanon and Jordan, are under threat from ISIS. The sectarian policies of the Government of Al-Maliki that contributed to the disintegration of national unity in Iraq by refusing to respond to the legitimate needs and complaints of the Sunni minority and other minorities and vulnerable groups, stoking inter-religious rivalries, to the extent that Christians have almost disappeared from the country. The bloody crackdown on protests by Sunni populations by the predominant Shiite armed forces in Anbar province illustrates the opportunities offered to ISIS terrorists to gain ground between the Tigris and the Euphrates, with the support of Sunni tribal leaders and former members of the Baath Party. Al-Maliki has lost credibility and support in the Shiite population itself, has to withdraw and make room for a new government of national unity, has to listen to the calls of the international community, without which Iraq will not design a path to security. All major international and regional actors, starting with the United States, Iran and the European Union, must focus on their shared interest in a stable, united and inclusive Iraq. The April 30 elections can produce a national salvation consensus that integrates, with a new government, all major ethnic groups and protects minorities and prioritizes national reconciliation and ensures basic services to a bloodless population. The European Union, for its part, cannot continue to divest politically in the region. It must mobilize to mediate conflicts in the Middle East and foster dialogue between all communities in Iraq, helping them to build governance capacities. It has to dialogue with Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are central players in stabilizing Iraq and ending the war in Syria, and it has to promote the resolution of the conflict between Shiites and Sunnis. Other strategic countries like Turkey must be involved in the process. And as pointed out, I agree with colleague Danjean, as pointed out in the European Parliament's resolution tomorrow, the European Union must warn the Gulf countries to refrain from continuing to sustain, directly or indirectly, the war economy of extremist groups. , sectarian and terrorists, such as ISIS and others. The European Union must direct humanitarian aid to the thousands of refugees and displaced persons and must use the European Union-Iraq Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to include cooperation in the fight against terrorism, ensuring that it is actually done in the respect for the principles of human rights and the rule of law. It is no wonder that all Iraqis seek refuge in the other Iraq, which works in the Kurdistan Region, which, despite the inherent serious deficit in fundamental rights and freedoms, has become an example of development, security and stability in the country. The recently announced initiative to organize a referendum on Kurdistan's independence is understandable, given the breakdown of power in Baghdad. However, the process of unilateral independence, although peaceful, will not contribute to the stabilization of Iraq and may endanger Kurdistan itself, given other acute sensitivities in the region. It is still possible to look for alternative, constitutional solutions for a Kurdistan that remains part of Iraq. Finally, Mr President, the war in Syria, the risk of terrorist disintegration and terrorist control in Iraq, make us have to make our citizens understand that European security is also at risk. There are thousands of European extraction jihadists fighting on the ground. We have to demand cooperation from our intelligence and security services to avoid the repetition of tragedies such as the one that has recently claimed innocent victims at the Jewish Museum in Brussels.

His regime, which has enjoyed a parliamentary majority since the 30 April elections, has been aided – unfortunately – and abetted by Iran as part of its own wider regional hegemonic aspirations.  As part of the al-Maliki sectarian approach, Sunni Arab tribes in Iraq’s west have faced discrimination and thousands of innocent civilians have been killed, particularly in Anbar province, in the name of prosecuting a war against terrorist jihadi elements linked to ISIS. In so doing, Baghdad has driven a desperate Arab Sunni community, including secular former supporters of Saddam Hussein, into an unholy alliance by teaming up with ISIS to fight government forces. Meanwhile, the autonomous region of Kurdistan has pursued its own destiny of democracy, secularism and prosperity. Thus we now have three increasingly divergent entities that are jeopardising the territorial integrity of Iraq and one that has offered fertile ground to jihadi terrorists spilling over from the conflict in neighbouring Syria.  ISIS, sadly, is now very well financed by Gulf States and it has captured oilfields and looted money from the central bank and is fully militarily equipped, but it must now be stopped in its tracks. It has now declared an Islamic caliphate and is imposing a barbaric form of extreme Sharia law on the local populations and minorities’ heritage, including Christians, and it is being joined by hundreds of EU, including United Kingdom, citizens as fighters who are being radicalised and brutalised by their experience and pose a serious security threat when returning to their home countries. Finding a solution to this cannot come too soon and we must now look to both international and regional forces that can offer some support. The brave Kurdish Peshmerga, i.e. the Kurdish army, has been very successful in wrestling control of the Kirkuk oilfields previously in the hands of ISIS and securing the Kurdish region’s immediate borders and protecting the Christian minorities of the Nineveh plains. Kurdistan has announced a referendum for independence unilaterally, which I think is very understandable and something that western powers after the First World War promised them in the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 and may now soon become an inevitable reality.

The Islamic State (IS) was able to grow in Syria’s war circumstances with the toxic help of certain Gulf State actors. The Islamic State grew in a climate of sectarian politics fed by respective Iraqi governments not doing justice to the pluralism of the country. The post-Iraq war instability and damage, and broader problems of a social, economic and political nature led into a very explosive scenario we are looking at now. Now the illegitimate claims of the caliphate by the Islamic State, mass executions and the imposition of Sharia law are against universal human rights and they must end now. But we must also be realistic about the Islamic State, not give it more weight than is proportionate. For the entire situation in Iraq we need a political situation and the sovereignty of Iraq should be respected. The call for independence of the Kurdish region is understandable but also potentially invites a more explosive situation that will benefit no one at this point. We know that IS has a number of European fighters and recruiters and the danger they will present too when they return to our societies should not be underestimated.

I don't want Durão Barroso to get revenge, but I do want international humanitarian law to reach him, for the Law to settle the alleged crimes of the promoters of this aggression and invasion. As a result of this intervention and occupation, we currently have a destroyed and destabilized country, divided into ethnic and sectarian quotas. The clear example is the current government, a government that uses a national army as a sectarian militia, as when it launched it against the protests of 2011. We must condemn all interference: distant, that of nearby countries, but also that of fundamentalist terrorism , which some support in Syria or Libya. The European Union has the opportunity to initiate a new foreign policy, promoting a conference within the framework of the United Nations, with the participation of the Arab and neighboring countries, so that the Iraqis will endow themselves with a new Constitution; all Iraqis, without ethnic or sectarian distinctions, so that everyone can decide their future, that of the country and that of its natural resources, which, I remember, belong only to them.

I remember myself marching through the streets of Glasgow protesting ‘Not in my nameʼ in advance of the illegal invasion of Iraq by the coalition of the willing. This motion takes some account of the other lifetimes cut short or blighted since that deep act of folly. According to the UN there are just in central and northern Iraq 1.2 million internally displaced persons and 1.5 million persons in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The scale of the tragedy is as paralysing as the complexity itself. But in our role as a European Union, as well as remembering how we got to where we are – and there should be no corner where we do not shine that light and no person we do not hold responsible for their actions – we have surely to try to attempt to plot a way out of the nightmare. In that effort I will limit myself to three points within this discussion: the role of the Kurds, the role of Iran and the role of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, though I do endorse the rest of the resolution, which I think has a lot to commend it and I commend the the spirit of cross-party working across this House in its production. On the role of the Kurds, in recital F we note the actions of the Kurdish regional government in taking control, as Mr Tannock drew our attention to, of additional territory and we stopped just short of criticism of those actions. I think that is the right form of words. I think that is as realistic as it is pragmatic. In recital G we acknowledge the limited success that the Kurds have had, and they do deserve credit for it in providing a safe haven and the burden that the many refugees they have cared for represents. But in point 11 of the resolution we remember our own principles. Any constitutional changes must, and I quote: ‘respect and uphold an inclusive process in respect of the rights of the non-Kurdish minorities living in the province’. This process will need to be supported by outside, by ourselves. On the role of Iran and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States in points 8 and 9 we call – and I think this is quite crucial – on the international community, especially ourselves, to facilitate a regional dialogue on the problems facing the Middle East and to include all significant parties. Iraqʼs neighbours cannot be viewed as distinct from it; they are actors within the conflagration under way and must be part of its solution as well as part of its current problems.

This has been nothing short of scandalous. With scant consideration for the obvious failings of the Sykes-Picot Agreement nearly 100 years ago, we poked this hornet’s nest with a very sharp stick before embarking on regime change. Most would agree that Saddam’s treatment of the Iraqi people, not least the Marsh Arabs and the Kurds, underlined his warped approach to humanity. However, I believe that the second Gulf War was fought on the premise of preparing for victory and not, as has now been proved, for life after that victory. Yes, the senior Ba’athist elements in Iraq had to be removed, but what followed was the greatest foreign policy failing of modern times, namely the US-led decision to dismantle the Iraqi army after the fall of Saddam. At the stroke of a pen, this Sunni-led army, with vast combat experience and access to an immense arsenal, was side-lined. In a short space of time, this led to the birth of the militias and the bloody insurgency. Those militias have now become the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or their allies. The Iraqi Prime Minister, whose role is to unify Iraq, has achieved exactly the opposite. Nouri al-Maliki has shown himself to be completely unfit for purpose, underlining a terrible lack of character judgment on the part of Western leaders. As Iraq stands on the brink of splitting into three, al-Maliki still clearly ignores the Sunnis and the Kurds, so the world holds its breath and prays. The British Independent newspaper reports that around 1 500 British Muslims have fought alongside ISIS. EU open borders mean that terrorists can move into Europe and make their way to any part of the continent, potentially to wage terrorist campaigns. Late last year the UK Borders Agency complained that EU rules banned them from collecting data on travellers within the European Union, data which the intelligence services could have used to spot security risks. ISIS has looted USD 400 million from banks and financial institutions in northern Iraq, making them the world’s richest terrorist group. This conflict could destabilise the whole region and, by extension, the world. The threat of ISIS must be a stark warning to us all. When decisions are to be made, they must be made with as much input as possible from across the Middle East, via the United Nations and by the authority of the United Nations alone. Britain mistakenly went to war in Iraq, too, because of Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossier’, and the world has become a far more dangerous place as a result. One hundred and seventy-nine brave British service personnel made the ultimate sacrifice and many more have suffered both physical and mental scars which they will have to carry for the rest of their lives.

The question is how was it possible that some groups of terrorists were able to take control of large parts of such a country within a few weeks? I think the responsibility lies with the Iraqi Government too. In the past eight years the al-Maliki government has failed to form a coalition which would encompass all sectors of Iraqi society. Instead the Sunni community has been marginalised, the Kurds have been denied meaningful participation and there has been increasing reliance on Iran’s support. As a result al-Maliki’s government has crucially weakened its support in the north of the country and weakened also the motivation to oppose the terrorists. I think the key to the solution is to form a new government of national reconciliation which should extend the hand of cooperation to moderate Sunnis and also Kurdish leaders. The EU should use all available means and press the Iraqi political forces to achieve this end. We call also on the Commission to extend more humanitarian aid than the recently increased sum of EUR 12 million. There are almost 2 million internally displaced persons; a fresh wave of half a million refugees has left Mosul and 86% of them are in immediate need of housing and core relief items. The Kurdish authorities especially, who have to host the bulk of refugees, need assistance. Finally, I am very much worried about the fate and future of the Christian communities in Iraq whose numbers have decreased by two thirds in nine years. More than 300 000 have been left facing continued harassment and persecution. Actually it is the Christians who do not resort to violence; who are vital in restoring dialogue, building bridges and mediating conflicts, providing healthcare and education to all people in need. In fact they perform an integrating role in a sectarian society and it is in our common interest to help them.

According to the United Nations OCHA there are an estimated 1.2 million internally displaced people in central and northern Iraq and we should place on record our welcome for the additional EUR 7 million that the Commission has allocated in humanitarian assistance.  Individual stories such as the brutal killing of 18-year-old Mahmoud Redha and his 44-year-old uncle Zainal by Islamic state fighters whilst on their way to work must bring home the level of violence faced by civilians on a daily basis. I join the President-in-office in calling for respect for human rights and for international humanitarian law by all sides. According to a report by Human Rights Watch on 12 July, the Iraqi security forces themselves appear to have unlawfully executed at least 255 prisoners over the past month in apparent revenge killings. These deaths must stop. Europe itself cannot advocate our agreement to promote democracy, human rights and good governance in Iraq and then fail to act when these objectives are put under grave threat, not least because of the real problems of foreign competence, as well as the threats posed by failed states within the region. Much time can be spent debating the cause of this crisis but what is certain is that the Sunni minority in Iraq have felt unrepresented. I hope today’s appointment of Salim al-Jabouri as the new Sunni Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament will help to address the disenfranchisement felt by Sunnis and to ease the tension. On the Kurdish issue we cannot fail to also draw attention to the tension between Baghdad and Erbil which worsened on 11 July when Kurdish ministers announced a boycott of the Iraqi Government after Prime Minister al-Maliki made comments that Kurdistan was harbouring terrorists and suspended flights to Erbil. The conflict in northern Iraq has led hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee to neighbouring Kurdish areas administered by the Kurdistan Regional Government, but recently the KRG has restricted access to the areas under its control to non-Kurdish Iraqis fleeing the violence. Within Amnesty International and as someone who has consistently acknowledged Kurdish political and civil rights, I call on the KRG to allow access to those fleeing the conflict and to engage in dialogue with the Iraqi Government. Moving forward, the Iraqi people in their millions chose their own leader in al-Maliki but the delay in forming a government has been a disaster and poses a real danger for the future of Iraq. It is right that Parliament now calls for the Iraqi Government to focus on unity and we urge all political leaders, especially the Prime Minister, to make sure that an inclusive government representing the diversity of the Iraqi population is formed as a factor of urgency.  Finally, noting the clear link between the rise of IS and the Syrian civil war, I call for the regional dialogue to address the problems facing the Middle East, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, and in those discussions to make a reality the EU’s offer of assistance to help promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 254, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Bas BELDER", "mepid": "4507", "text": "It is remarkable that the present resolution does not mention the role of candidate country Turkey in the turbulent developments in Iraq.

Come on, we've seen it happen in recent years: the Christian minorities made up 5% of the population ten years ago, now 1%! Structurally bullied out of the country. Radicalized groups carried out attacks. It should come as no surprise what is happening now. But apparently that attack in Brussels was necessary to shake us up. I agree with you, the first response must be one of humanitarian aid. I too welcome - and we are doing it in the resolution - the extra five million that will bring the total aid this year to 12 million. Secondly, we as Europe must very quickly identify the security consequences of the radicalization in Syria, Iraq, and the actions of ISIS, and limit the risks. The responsible ministers made a start on this last week, but that start is far too casual. For example, a register must be established at Europol that structurally maps all returning Jihad fighters in Europe. That register should not be voluntary, but mandatory. So many further steps need to be taken there. Third, we must support the reasonable forces in that country. Constructive political parties, ethnic groups, but also rational religious communities.

These are places where people from different backgrounds come together. If the country wants to have a chance, we must further encourage these kinds of meetings and also support them financially.

However, as has been reiterated here this afternoon, we must not forget the serious risk of decomposition that the country is experiencing due to the armed intervention of the group called Islamic State and the territorial tensions of recent times. Finally yesterday, as I said before, the Council of Representatives reached an agreement to appoint a new President. It is a modest first step towards ending the impasse, the political blockade that Iraq has been experiencing since the April 30 elections. I hope that as soon as possible an inclusive, broad-based government, representative of the different communities of the country, will be formed. It is precisely this extreme political divide that it serves for those who want to destabilize Iraq and end the hope of peace and prosperity in the country. The European Union must continue to encourage a process of national political inclusiveness and continue to support the unity, territorial integrity and independence of Iraq, as expressed by the Council of Ministers precisely at its meeting on 23 June. We do not want the fragmentation of the country. The rise of that armed group called the Islamic State, and its implantation both in Syria and now in Iraq, threatens to exacerbate the decomposition of this country - and also of the region - in various territories controlled by different armed groups. And this group, the former EII, is not only a terrorist group, it is already a true terrorist army that poses a threat of a regional and global dimension. We must work with all the countries of the region to help support the internal stability and unity of the country. In addition, none of them should help the territories adjacent to the border between Iraq and Syria to become what Afghanistan was in the 1990s.

I would like to begin by expressing my support for the motion for a resolution that Parliament has to consider today. One of the places mentioned in the resolution is the Assyrian city of Karakosh, where the church bells rang for worship half a millennium before Christianity came to my country, Sweden. However, the sound of church bells in the city on June 25 this year signaled something completely different than worship. Now it was a desperate warning to the population and only a few days later the city was emptied of its population. The families and families who lived for generations in the city were forced to leave everything - to stay was not an option when the execution patrols from Isis advanced. In the neighboring city of Mosul, the church bells did not ring at all the following Sunday. For the first time in 1,600 years, no Sunday service was held in the city. Madam President, there are increasing reports of bloody suicide bombings against churches or Christians being murdered by fanatical jihadists. In the face of such a situation, the outside world cannot be passive. In the short term, Isis' progress must be stopped and a national unity government established. When an Iraqi delegation of church leaders visited us here in the European Parliament a week ago, they emphasized the importance of supporting democracy development and security. The EU and the EU Member States must assist here. The situation demands that we help each other across the party lines.

Regarding the first point, I still believe that it is necessary to underline the responsibility for a political solution, which is that of the politicians, in particular those who were elected in April, to the House of Representatives. They must take responsibility for the future of this state and its citizens. It is clear today that Iraq cannot recover without a real political and interfaith dialogue. As for my second point, the European Union's commitment must continue to be that of providing assistance to more than 1 million displaced people and 1.5 million people in need of humanitarian aid. Today, this must be done in good coordination, in particular with the UN, but above all by ensuring the promotion of political dialogue in the region. Finally, I come to my third point on which I will insist the most. We must not limit ourselves to reacting only to the humanitarian situation. The regional dynamics of the situation in Iraq must receive our full attention. The expansionist agenda of the Islamic State terrorist group, if pursued and carried out, is a threat not only to Iraq, Syria, but also the entire region down to Jordan. We must also be fully aware of the regional conflict that awaits us, including the possible overlap of tensions between Shiites, Sunnis, Arabs and Kurds. Let us be well aware of the serious consequences that such a development of the situation would have in the region, at the gates of Europe.

The European Union pays the attention that I believe you have rightly requested to this issue. Iraq was discussed in the Foreign Affairs Council on 24 June, with a conclusion, and a new discussion on the issue of Iraq is planned for next week in the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 July. Among the issues that you have raised, which I believe are of common commitment, is that of the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq as essential elements for building a prosperity that benefits all citizens and promoting stability in Iraq. region. The gravity and drama of the situation do not escape anyone, of course. In the initial interventions of Mr Arnaud and Mr Gomez there are the reference to the idea of ​​a bound support and the point of an inclusive and unitary governance within this Constitution or in any case a governance that allows to resume the ranks of a transition towards democracy. The theme of human rights, referred to in several interventions, is a theme that historically, but also in this case, is at heart in the attention of the European Union, including the point recalled by several interventions on the freedom of the Christian faithful in the area. . This is also why we need a new inclusive and legitimate Iraqi government and we as the European Union are moving on this issue and on this level. I also wanted to respond to two specific requests that have been made regarding the issue of chemical weapons. Intelligence sources confirm that these are not usable weapons. The situation is certainly disturbing in the current chaos, but it is also necessary to stick to the known facts. As for the allegations that have been raised against Turkey as a country for ISIL funding, we believe that a clear distinction and distinction must necessarily be maintained between suspicions, rumors and facts and between funding that may have come from radical private sources. and the government, in this case of Turkey. It is a distinction that must be clearly maintained. The European Union is working with the Gulf countries to identify and block the sources of funding for ISIL and other terrorist groups.

What is happening in Iraq shows that no conflict is encapsulated within a country. It also proves the maxim that no leader can govern stably without broad public support. Last but not least, Europe has a moral obligation to continue to support Iraqi society. The main conclusion is that peace in Iraq inevitably goes through peace in Syria. I therefore call on the EU, in close cooperation with the international community and especially the Arab states, to work actively to end the violence in Syria. European support for the Iraqi security forces must also continue in order to ensure stability in the country. At the same time, the Iraqi government must unite, not divide, society.

The Israeli reaction followed intensified rocket fire from Gaza, in turn in reaction to the Israeli \"Brother's Keeper\" operation to find the killers of three Israeli teenagers kidnapped in the preceding weeks. Operation \"Protective Edge\" has already caused the deaths of over 213 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and more than 1,400 injured, victims of hundreds of Israeli air strikes and bombings on the Gaza Strip and the launch of hundreds of rockets from Gaza to Israel. Thousands of Gaza residents have been displaced and more than 40,000 Israeli Ground Forces soldiers along the Israeli-Gaza border have been mobilized. The humanitarian situation in Gaza, already very serious before these last hostilities, is deteriorating by the hour. The UN has launched an appeal for a \"humanitarian pause\" in the clashes to allow the population in need of relief to be reached. The European Union and all the other leading figures in the international community, including the UN and the United States, have intervened to deplore this spiral of violence. The EU expressed its extreme concern at the rapid deterioration of the situation and strongly condemned the indiscriminate firing of rockets at Israel by militant groups in the Gaza Strip. The European Union deplores the growing number of civilian victims of the Israeli operation, stressing the fundamental importance of the safety and security of all civilians in Palestine as well as in Israel. We strongly urge all parties to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid further victims and restore calm. We urge the neighboring countries to make every effort to bring about an immediate cessation of hostilities. Hamas has not accepted Egypt's proposal for a ceasefire, but if there is still a chance to agree on a truce, the opportunity must not be lost. High Representative / Vice-President Catherine Ashton from Vienna, where she is leading the Iranian nuclear negotiations, is in constant contact with the parties and encourages a ceasefire. The Italian Foreign Minister and the German Foreign Minister are in the territories between Israel and Palestine in these days. In her numerous contacts with Secretary of State John Kerry and her European counterparts, Catherine Ashton has sought to ensure that the international community, with the European Union first, takes care of the immediate needs of the people of Gaza. In this extremely worrying context, we continue to think that direct and substantial peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians are more necessary than ever to find a lasting solution to the conflict. All claims must be stopped and Israel's legitimate security concerns, as well as the situation in Gaza, must be taken into account. As part of this process, which we hope will resume soon, it will be important not to lose sight of the fundamental issues and factors behind the recent failure of the US-backed peace talks and the recent spate of violence. Let's say it as it is: the unwillingness to make the difficult choices necessary to achieve peace is the cause of the failure of the last round of negotiations which, in turn, has created the void now filled by the violence we are witnessing. As if that were not enough, recent events coincide with dangerous developments across the Middle East - we were discussing them until a few minutes ago - which pose serious threats both to the European Union and to its direct partners and neighbors in the region. The EU is convinced that the deterioration of the regional context makes a solution to the conflict based on the coexistence of two states more necessary than ever. The EU also believes that the only way to stem the violence and resolve the conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and that matches the aspirations of both sides. A reality based on a single state would be incompatible with these aspirations. Madam President, honorable Members, Israeli and Palestinian leaders must be persuaded to take the bold and courageous decisions needed to end the current spiral of violence and resume negotiations. Rest assured that the European Union will do everything it can to help achieve this goal.

It seemed to us difficult to come up with a short and clear text which brought together all the political groups. Finally, we have a text and even if, in the end, only the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), ECR, S & amp; D and the ALDE group will support the common text, for having participated in the negotiations, I can see that there is still a broad enough agreement on the ideas of force to react to the escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine. For the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), it is important to recall what brought us to the present crisis, namely the kidnapping and brutal murder of three young Israelis, on June 12, followed by the death of a young Palestinian on July 2. We can, of course, only condemn in the strongest terms these revolting acts and express our compassion with the families of the victims. Likewise, we are all extremely concerned about the renewed violence that has followed. We call for an immediate end to the attacks that are causing all this suffering. This implies that Hamas ceases its rocket fire at Israel from the Gaza Strip. As we have said several times in the past, Israel has the right to defend itself against attacks that indiscriminately target civilians. All parties must fully respect international humanitarian law. The only way out of the present crisis is obviously not violence and we support all diplomatic initiatives aimed at achieving a de-escalation of the conflict through a ceasefire. From this perspective, the Egyptian initiative presented on July 14 is welcome and represents a step in the right direction. And taking note of the acceptance of this proposal by Israel, we must insist that Hamas accept a cessation of hostilities. Finally, I would like to say that, despite our differences, we are all united by a common goal, that of ensuring peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians.

I reiterate today the serious concern of my group about the new escalating violence between Israel and Hamas and the rising number of Palestinian and Israeli civilians wounded in the huge logistic centres which have been destroyed due to the attacks. Yes, we strongly call for all further targeting of civilian populations to be avoided and for an immediate ceasefire followed by negotiations. The death of children and innocents is simply unacceptable to each and every one of us. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) informs us that 55 installations have been damaged since 1 June 2014. In just the past 24 hours, six UNRWA installations were damaged, five schools in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, and one health centre in the middle area of Gaza. In this incredible context rockets are probably still targeting Israel today in an indiscriminate manner and air strikes continuing to hit different locations in the Gaza Strip, and the main and the most devastating question is: how could or should this round of violation be stopped? I do not believe that this war is serving either the Israelis or the Palestinians but it can serve Hamas groups and all other radicals who are fighting to recover their full influence over the Gaza Strip. I also believe in the Israeli Government’s sincere desire for de-escalation and ceasefire, and for starting the peace negotiations, as they demonstrated yesterday by accepting the ceasefire proposed by Egypt. The region is extremely unstable today and confronted with serious unrest. The crisis between Israel and Gaza is the last thing we need and the most dangerous as it could inflame the whole region in a dramatic context. The repercussions on the Palestinian territories and in southern Jerusalem, but also in the neighbouring countries, are of serious concern. This is why our role, our European Union’s role, which should be constant and strong, lies in mediating and calming the tension. Unrest in the Middle East has lasted for too long and it is time to end it right now. But the European voice is still too shy and too ineffective ...

In order to achieve its political goals, it does not shy away from targeting the people of Gaza.\" In short, Hamas is terrorizing the Palestinian citizens of the Gaza Strip with its persistent missiles on the state of Israel and its citizens. It is not without reason that Hamas appears on the European list of terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, insiders estimate that Hamas still has some 6,000 to 7,000 missiles. Enough to continue the fight against Israel for weeks. Which brings me to the crucial question of who is actually the supplier of Hamas's advanced missile arsenal and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The answer is simple: the Islamic Republic of Iran. Council, you, High Representative, were recently at the negotiating table with Tehran. Mind you, without Iran's funding, armaments and training, the current terrorist threat from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah in the Middle East would not be possible. What horrors await the region if you, on behalf of the international community, do not clearly stop Iranian support for terrorist organizations in the region! A country that supports such organizations financially and materially cannot credibly claim to only have a civil nuclear program. The Middle East is already on fire! With Israel in immediate danger.

As a first-time Member, and like many of my fellow Members I presume, I came here with a certain level of idealism in the sense of believing that benevolent intentions and political wisdom may be able to produce such statements or resolutions and that action may result from them. I am afraid the joint resolution is not such a text, and I regret to say that I was present at the negotiations yesterday. I may be a bit of an idealist but at the same time I am not naive. I know that in cases of escalating violence you had better tread very lightly in order not to exacerbate the situation. That is true. But, in this case, walking on tiptoes resulted in an empty resolution text: that is the considered view of my group and it is also my view. I do not call into question the motives of the major parties in trying to write a brief text focusing on de-escalation, and trying to strike a balance and to make the possibilities of de-escalation at least meaningful, but the excessive pruning eliminated almost all content. We regret to say that we cannot vote for an empty shell of a resolution. First of all, the text fails to mention almost anything related to the EU. Whenever the EU appears in this text, it appears tangentially. If we agree that the EU should play an influential role in the region and all its adjacent regions, then this text gets dangerously close to an abdication of responsibility. We tried to rectify that with an amendment that we tabled to paragraph 6. Secondly, the text fails to mention a number of facts that my colleague has already listed.

We stand solely for two peoples, the Palestinian and the Israeli, who both claim the right to existence and a normal life for their children. We stand up in defense of innocent civilians, of the weakest who too often have the sole fault of having inherited a painful history, of living near a disputed border, of crossing the wrong road at the wrong time. We still take sides with those who believe that the atrocious crimes committed on four boys - Eyal, Gilad, Naftali and Mohammed - demand justice and not infinite and useless revenge. An eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind. Wise words, words of an enlightened man, words of Mahatma Gandhi. While I am speaking to you, the bombing continues on one side and the launching of missiles on the other. The actions of a few extremists are paid for with the desperation of entire families. It is useless to hold trials, but the disproportion of the forces involved is evident. More than 200 dead and over 1,400 injured, including women, disabled people and children. Four children died because they played soccer. Some bombs call them smart but they certainly feel no mercy. The Gaza Strip is left to itself. The risk of a humanitarian drama for nearly two million people is just around the corner again. Its inhabitants now depend almost exclusively on UN aid for food and medicine. Tens of thousands of displaced people are fleeing aimlessly because the crossings to Egypt are open only for the most seriously injured. We could turn our gaze elsewhere, make assessments of mere political opportunity, think that the Mediterranean, the sea that surrounds my country, is enough to separate us from those unfortunate lands. But if the European Union aspires to be a global player on the international stage, then this is precisely the occasion to demonstrate that with a single voice it can and wants to live up to its ambitions, because the Mediterranean is not the moat of a medieval castle, but a bridge between civilizations for millennia. I therefore ask you to use all our courage to prevent the negotiation agenda from being dictated by opposing extremisms, because the only extremism we can accept is that of dialogue at all costs, that of peace based on equal rights and equal dignity. . Finding an agreement between the parties, starting with the Egyptian proposal for a lasting truce, and then helping to design a future in which two free peoples of two independent states will finally coexist in harmony. These, in my opinion, should be our two objectives, as a Parliament that has the burden of representing democracy in Europe. This is what millions of people around the world expect of us, that we can for once put aside the reason of state and embrace the state of reason with conviction.

According to its charter, this Islamic organization has only one goal: to destroy all Jews in Israel. This violence must end immediately. Israel has adopted Egypt's proposal for a ceasefire. Hamas has rejected this in order to be able to sow even more death and destruction. Obviously, we are dealing here with unscrupulous murderers, with terrorists who are incapable of listening to reason. That is why two measures are needed to end this escalation and this terror: 1. Although Israel is reticent, it deserves the support of this Parliament to eliminate every terrorist in the Gaza Strip. The country derives this right from its duty to protect its own citizens and the Palestinian civilians who are now being used as human shields by these unscrupulous killers. 2. Hamas gives hefty salaries to terrorists if they succeed in murdering innocent Israelis. It is very likely that much of this money comes from the European Union. With this support from the EU, not a peaceful, prosperous society has been built, but a terror state is being created under the watchful eye of the Palestinian Authority. Its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, does not take any responsibility or action. Whether this stems from unwillingness or impotence is completely irrelevant. This EU funding must stop, and immediately! Today the bombs fall on Israel, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow they will fall in Strasbourg, London, Amsterdam or Brussels. The attacks on the Jewish museum in Brussels and on the synagogue in Paris warn us of this. Israel has been burdened by Islamic terror for far too long. We have a historical, moral and cultural duty to support the Jewish people and I request that the Commission move forward as soon as possible towards a solution whereby the Palestinians return to the land that was previously known as Palestine, but which we now know as Jordan.

Resolution is a first response. Cease firing immediately and reopen the terms of the peace negotiations, but perhaps some more courage is needed. We must evaluate some mistakes that have been made by Israel, both in not recognizing Al Fatah's rapprochement with Hamas, and in the settlements of the settlers who continue to move forward and are the cause of so many problems. And then Europe. What does greater protagonism mean? We are among the first and largest financiers of the Palestinian Authority and represent the largest market for Israel.

This is the reality of Israelis today, a reality that no government in the world would tolerate without reacting. Neither Berlin, nor Madrid, nor Rome, nobody! The fate of the Gazouis is tragic. They are the hostages of a terrorist movement which, for ten years that it has the power in Gaza, has no other agenda than the destruction of the State of the Jews, it is in the charter.

The Israeli army which protects its civilians and asks those in Gaza to flee or the Hamas which calls on the population not to move and to act as a shield?

The mostly densely populated civilian areas of the Gaza Strip - from there they are fired at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan and many other Israeli cities. For the first time ever, long-range weapons are used. The people in Israel spend an average of 15 seconds to escape from the rockets in the protective cellar. For days they have lived in fear in order to bring themselves and their families, their children, to safety. Rocket alarms every minute. I'm not sure how the guns get to Hamas. But I am convinced that it is sometimes supported by EU funds ...

A unity government was formed in Palestine in April, but the president of that unity government was unable to go to the Gaza Strip. Abu Mazen did not go to the Gaza Strip. Why? Because he's afraid of Hamas. It seems to me that there is little unity and little government there. Then three teenagers are kidnapped. Hamas did not distance itself from this kidnapping and murder. Then there was a terrible murder of revenge, the perpetrators are on trial in Israel. Over 1,300 rockets have landed on Israel since July 8th. Frédérique Ries said it: no country in the world can accept it, no country can tolerate it! None of the countries in which we are elected would tolerate a thousand missiles hitting our territory! What are the Israelis doing? They fight back, they fight back hard. But they are trying to obstruct one of Hamas' paths, namely that of human shields, by warning people: “We know the weapons caches are under schools. We know the arsenals are under hospitals. Go, leave these buildings! ”And yes, you can move around in the Gaza Strip, it's not that small either, dear Ms. Auken. Then a ceasefire will be reached under Egyptian mediation. Egypt has been a difficult partner lately, but they mediated here and this ceasefire is accepted by Israel, but not by Hamas! Yes why not? On the contrary, Hamas proclaims: “No, we are intensifying this fight!” What, for God's sake, is Hamas' goal if not aggression, terror and the annihilation of Israel? The way out is obvious: Hamas must accept the ceasefire. But beyond that, Hamas must finally accept Israel's right to a secure existence. Only when the threat to Israel is gone will the Israeli hardliners, the Israeli hawks, who also exist, be deprived of their arguments, and hopefully this will bring us closer to a peaceful solution at some point.

Six million Palestinian refugees without the right to return to their homeland, two and a half million of them in 25 camps with miserable living conditions, 450,000 settlements in the West Bank and 100,000 in Jerusalem, 750 km of wall up to 12 meters high, 350,000 destroyed, thousands dead and apartheid conditions.

That's right! Call the opposing parties for a ceasefire. That's right! However, if the responsibilities of the two parties are fundamentally different, then adopting a so-called balanced resolution, which the majority here wants, is simply hypocrisy. The UN Secretary-General has stated that he feels responsible for the Palestinians, who have long been deprived of the sense of freedom and dignity they have otherwise deserved. We need to make clear Israel's responsibilities and, if necessary, achieve sanctions with a view to finally achieving an independent, autonomous Palestinian state.

It has been said that the situation is fraught with complexity and I believe this discussion has borne witness to this. It is also true that, as has been said a moment ago, this debate is similar to other discussions that I have happened to witness and participate in in this very House, as a Member of the European Parliament. But I believe that precisely for this reason, because the issues remain these, not only should not be lacking but the commitment of the European Union in particular must be reinforced. It is of the fundamental interest of the European Union to support the process towards peace and democracy in the entire Middle East region and to help end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which, until resolved, will continue to undermine the peace and security that is just around the corner. of the European Union and, perhaps not directly, also to be one of the causes of what happens inside the borders of the European Union. He was recalled several times in the discussion preceding the attack right in the heart of the European institutions, at the Jewish museum in Brussels. The episodes of violence in southern Israel and in Gaza, occurring in an extremely unstable region, reaffirm the urgency to work towards this goal. Events show that there will be no definitive cessation of violence or lasting peace as long as the aspirations of Palestinians for statehood and sovereignty and those of Israelis for security are both met through a negotiated global peace based on the coexistence of two states. Together with its partners from the international community and the region, the European Union will continue to appeal to Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas to end the violence, resume negotiations and work with renewed determination to resolve the conflict.

With the Rome Statute, the world has consolidated its historic commitment to prevent and discourage the most heinous crimes. Activating this promise of justice towards the victims of the crimes contemplated by the Rome Statute is a moral imperative and, at the same time, an essential contribution to peace, security and well-being in the world. Today the International Criminal Court is the pivot around which the international criminal justice system is articulated and an important tool for placing the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of international importance before their responsibilities. The EU, as is well known, is part of a solid tradition of firm support for the International Criminal Court. We believe that the international community finds in an efficient court an indispensable tool to combat impunity and promote an international order based on the rule of law. The International Criminal Court will remain an important priority for the European Union in the years to come. We therefore very much welcome today's plenary debate on the crime of aggression. The active involvement of the European Parliament in this important issue for human rights and international justice is crucial. With the Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held in Kampala, Uganda, from 31 May to 10 June 2010, a milestone was set by offering States, international organizations and representatives of civil society present in Kampala a forum in to reaffirm the determination to promote the Statute and take stock of international criminal justice, but not only. The Kampala Review Conference also marked an important step in consolidating the International Criminal Court as an effective tool by which the international community brings to justice those criminally responsible for crimes covered by the Rome Statute when national judges are unable or unwilling to prosecute them. . The Review Conference adopted important amendments to the Rome Statute, including the definition of the crime of aggression and the conditions under which the International Criminal Court can exercise jurisdiction in the matter. The amendment must now be ratified or accepted by the States parties to the Rome Statute. Provided that a sufficient number of ratifications are made and that a two-thirds majority of States take a decision to do so after 1 January 2017, the International Criminal Court will be able to exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. As this Parliament is aware, all Member States of the European Union are parties to the Statute and some have even already ratified the Kampala Amendment on the crime of aggression. In others, the ratification process is, on the other hand, in the final or in any case advanced phase, while still others have indicated that they have no intention of ratifying this amendment for the time being. As it is not itself part of the Rome Statute, the European Union cannot ratify the amendment. However, with the facilitation offered by the European External Action Service, the Member States of the European Union exchange information and, where appropriate, coordinate on the progress of the ratification process. Our common goal in this process is clear: to further strengthen the Court to fulfill its mandate. The Rome Statute is a promise made to the victims of the worst atrocities in the world, the promise that they will get justice, the promise that, seeing the guilty faced with their responsibilities, the affected communities will be able to leave behind the violence in favor of peace, illegality in favor of the rule of law. Few of us could have predicted, ten years ago, that the Court would establish itself as the pivot of all discussions on the fight against impunity. Few of us imagined, ten years ago, that the court would be able to prosecute crimes committed in fifteen countries spanning three continents. But many have worked on this objective and welcome the results achieved, including in parliaments and also in the European Parliament. Today's debate on the crime of aggression illustrates once again how, under the Rome Statute, the Institutional Criminal Court continues to play, together with national judges, an essential role in guaranteeing justice to the victims of the most heinous crimes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 361, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Andrzej GRZYB", "mepid": "23785", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - We have had the opportunity to listen to current information on the functioning of the International Criminal Court many times, in particular in the Subcommittee on Human Rights.

The Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute define the notion of the crime of aggression, which is to fall under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. For this to happen, these amendments must be ratified by at least 30 countries. So far, as we point out in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow, 14 countries have ratified them, including 8 Member States of the European Union. I hope that soon there will be more of these countries, including my country, Poland, which is already at the final stage of work on the ratification during the ratification procedure. The crime of aggression is an invasion of another country, but also its shelling, blocking its ports. Aggression can be carried out both by a regular army and by supporting irregular armed forces on the territory of another state. I am convinced that if these amendments had entered into force a few years ago, perhaps we would have avoided at least some of the conflicts that have occurred since then, and thus, most importantly, we could have avoided a lot of human suffering and the tragedy of many nations.

It was recalled by the Honorable Della Vedova that tomorrow is the World Day of International Criminal Justice. I believe that it is a symbolic day that marks the anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the International Criminal Court. I think it is a day also imagined as a time to reflect and act on the suffering of those who are still victims of atrocities, genocides, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression of one state against another, but also to spread the fight impunity for these crimes and celebrate progress in the field of international criminal justice. My view is that Kampala was a historic conference. The revision of the Rome Statute has opened a new path and we must be able to follow it to the end. On the occasion of this conference, the member countries of the International Criminal Court, after almost a decade of discussions, reached an agreement on the shared definition of \"crime of aggression\" as an offense of the state, for years a source of discord in international law. After numerous reviews and high-level meetings, a long way has been made. But there is still much to be done because the dramatic events in the international context of recent times - I am thinking of Ukraine, as I am thinking of the debate we have just had about Israeli and Palestinian issues - show with great force that a lot is must do on the level of the effectiveness of international criminal law. It was recalled that several countries have already ratified the Kampala amendments and many have begun their national procedures. Even if these are long and complex, I believe that it is essential to find a positive outcome as soon as possible. Now we think that remembering the historical importance of this compromise is a duty, as is re-launching European and international attention on the crime of aggression as an offense and on the Kampala compromise, which defines it, providing for the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. about this crime.

Aggression is historically considered the most important crime of international law. It also often creates opportunities or even an impulse to commit further international crimes, such as war crimes, the crime of genocide or crimes against humanity. The international community needs a universal legal definition of aggression, because unfortunately we do not have one. The London Conventions of 1933, which formulate such a legal definition, bind only about 10 countries, including mine - Poland. Unfortunately, only in the relationship between them. On the other hand, the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of 1974 No. 3314, which is universal in nature, like any resolution of this body, is not a legally binding definition. The adoption of the Kampala amendment to the ICC's statute will therefore create a new quality, equip this court with the possibility of punishing perpetrators of aggression and give us a legal definition that will be binding. At the same time, it will be adopted in the target model by a significant part of the international community. Let us not forget, however, that even today, on the basis of universal jurisdiction, the perpetrators of the crime of aggression may be punished by domestic courts, not only their own, but also by ad hoc international criminal tribunals, established after committing the crime of aggression or other international crimes.

The world’s history in general, and Europe’s in particular, is full of dark pages of wars, aggression, destruction and other unfortunate events. Did we learn any lessons? Did we do everything possible to prevent that happening again? It does not look so, even though we have just commemorated the start of World War One and are about to meet the 75th anniversary of the start of World War Two. At the same time we have to salute all international efforts to close legal loopholes that still exist in international humanitarian law and the Rome Statutes by criminalising the crime of aggression. We have to agree that this can be done only by undertaking all possible measures, by accepting necessary legal frameworks for naming the illegal use of force which manifestly violates the United Nations Charter. In 2010 the states parties, including all EU Member States, adopted the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute which establishes the International Criminal Court. The above-mentioned amendments mainly provide for adding the crime of aggression to the list of crimes falling under ICC jurisdiction, thereby completing the ICC jurisdiction and deterring Member States from illegal use of force. It is against those who are willing and ready to challenge the peace and security of others.  Here I should make clear that the Kampala amendments do not cover cases of self-defence or a UN Security Council mandate. By now eight EU Member States have ratified and completed procedures for enforcing the Kampala amendments; it is good but not enough. 2014 is a crucial year to encourage states to start and continue the process of ratification of the amendments, given the long time that ratification of international instruments requires in many countries. The existing momentum should be fully used to push for ratification now. The resolution we are debating tonight explicitly calls for an EU common position around the issue.

The review conference for the International Criminal Court in Kampala in 2010 passed by consensus the proposal to prosecute war of aggression as a crime in the future. The International Criminal Court has so far been responsible for the prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide and is now also supposed to punish the crime of aggression. The prerequisite is that the type, gravity and scope of the act of attack constitute a manifest violation of the UN Charter. For these crimes, however, not ordinary soldiers should be prosecuted, but people who are actually in a position to direct the political and military action of a state.

So far fourteen states have ratified, including eight EU member states. And all EU member states that have not yet ratified are called upon to initiate this immediately. On September 1st of this year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the attack by Nazi Germany on Poland, a war of aggression that led directly to World War II - with all the resulting crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Nuremberg war crimes trials also ruled on the crimes of war of aggression, among other things, and I would like to quote from the opening speech of the US chief prosecutor Robert Jackson in November 1945: \"But the last step, to prevent recurring wars, which are inevitable with international lawlessness, is to hold statesmen accountable before the law. And let me make it clear: this law will initially only be applied to German attackers. But it does include, and if it is to be of any use, it must condemn the attack of any other nation, not except those who are now in judgment here. ”Waging war of aggression is not an ordinary crime. As the Nuremberg War Crimes Court ruled in 1946, it is the greatest international crime of all because it includes the collective evil of all other war crimes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 367, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Ignazio CORRAO", "mepid": "124856", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, José Ayala Lasso, when he held the position of High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, said that a man who has killed one person has a better chance of being tried than one who has killed 100,000. . This affirmation, sadly real, should make us reflect on the reasons that have slowed down the process of consolidation of the principle according to which no, and I stress no, type of aggression can be accepted and tolerated today. This Parliament, the only elected body in the old continent, will not have the legislative competence necessary to impose ratifications on the Member States, but it can certainly play a role of fundamental influence. With the Kampala conference, a shared definition of crime and the act of aggression was reached, tracing a parallel defining path of both the state's offense and individual crime. It is certainly a step forward, but the prevention process could and should have already been completed. The European Parliament already in 2011 welcomed the adoption of the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute and asked the Commission and the Council to induce Member States to ratify them and introduce them into their criminal systems. Unfortunately, at the moment only eight states of the Union have done so. The inertia of the other winds - including Italy, alas - is in no way justifiable. There are twenty out of twenty-eight states that are represented in this hemicycle and have not yet ratified the agreement. What does this mean? Do we or do we not want to react firmly to the acts of aggression and human rights violations that are unfortunately on the agenda? Giving the International Criminal Court the possibility to intervene on the crime of aggression would constitute a real deterrent to put an end to the rampant impunity towards those States and those subjects who act in disregard of human rights, jeopardizing peace and safety in the world. Dear colleagues, I hope that the Kampala amendments on the crime of aggression will be ratified by the missing states and come into force as soon as possible.

It is a very good omen, for the new legislature, that we are addressing a subject which is at the heart of our concerns for the defense of human rights. The European Union has always been an ardent supporter of the International Criminal Court and in the previous mandate, we accompanied, through our resolutions, the developments linked to the Kampala amendment process, as well as the efforts aimed at strengthening the Court. and to ensure the universality and integrity of the Rome Statute. The adoption of the amendments on the definition of the crime of aggression marked a turning point in the development of international criminal law by completing the system of protection set up by the Rome Statute. However, to be able to activate the Court's jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in 2017 will require a decision by the Assembly of States Parties after at least 30 States Parties have ratified, ideally before the end. of 2015 the Kampala Amendments. So far, only fourteen States Parties have ratified these amendments, including eight Member States of the Union. We are therefore far from the mark and we need a common coordinated action at European level to promote the ratification of the Kampala amendments and their integration into national legislation.

Today we are debating a resolution calling on all Member States to do something they should have done a long time ago, namely to ratify the Kampala Amendments. Why is that so important? This process would further develop international criminal justice and thus strengthen its scope and binding force. So far there have been four offenses under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. However, until now the International Criminal Court has failed to develop jurisdiction over crimes of aggression. The Rome Statute, on the basis of which it was established, does not have a detailed definition of the facts. For this reason, members of the military and political leadership elite cannot be held responsible if they initiate an act of attack that violates the prohibition of force in the UN Charter. As things stand at present, these groups of people cannot be held personally responsible if, for example, they order unlawful invasions, bombardments, the blockade of ports or the deployment of armed gangs, or if they make their territory available for such actions. When you hear that, you can clearly see some of the incidents of the last few weeks. The crime of aggression is only defined through the Kampala Amendments, which were passed after lengthy negotiations. We also already know the requirements that are required for how many states would have to ratify it. It is actually very regrettable that so far only eight EU countries have completed this process. Other Member States are taking part, including my home country Austria. I would like to point out one more point: after all, crimes are punished primarily because they have a deterrent effect. Crimes of aggression are crimes of conduct and the crime of aiding and abetting is explicitly excluded. So far it has often happened that the perpetrators were punished, but those who ordered the crimes went free. This unjust reversal of guilt will be broken by the amendments to be ratified. They send a clear signal to those responsible that they are aware of their leadership responsibility, because crimes of aggression may no longer go unpunished in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 370, "date": "2014-07-16.json", "name": "Ana GOMES", "mepid": "28306", "text": "I am very honored to be among the promoters of the resolution that the European Parliament must adopt tomorrow in this matter. The entry into force of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court on the crime of aggression, defined and approved by the States Parties in Kampala, will allow the foundation of a system that effectively penalizes the illegal use of armed force and that opens the possibility of accountability perpetrators of violence against territorial integrity and independence between States Parties. The introduction in the field of International Criminal Law of the definition of the crime of aggression is a civilizational advance necessary to strengthen the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, but also vital to mark the relevance of the United Nations Charter and to strengthen the binding character of the decisions of the Council of UN Security. The crime of aggression inaugurates a new era in the jurisdiction of the Court. If the jurisdiction of the Court has hitherto focused on crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, against individuals and peoples, criminal jurisdiction over crimes of aggression allows States to be held criminally responsible for the use of unlawful and unsanctioned military force United Nations Charter, namely with implications for the right to self-defense. This is a fundamental civilizational step towards the establishment of a true collective security order. But for that to happen, the deterrent effect must work, we must invest, the European Union must invest politically in the ratification of the Rome Statute of the ICC and in the amendments approved in Kampala by all the States that have not yet accepted jurisdiction of the Court and, in particular, those who are our partners in the framework of various cooperation agreements. It is also necessary that the mechanisms for activating jurisdiction provided for in the Kampala amendments to the Court's Statute be used and that the Security Council undertakes responsible action in line with the United Nations Charter. Given the enhanced powers in the matter that give the Security Council the right to determine whether or not a given event constitutes an act of aggression punishable under international criminal law, which will inevitably raise the bar by which the Prosecutor of the Court can or not investigating an aggression case, then it is vital that the five permanent members do not embark on a strategy of purposefully delaying the work of the Prosecutor in order to guarantee themselves an immunity and their allies. A position taken by the Security Council is fundamental in this matter, in accordance with the objectives stipulated in Kampala.

As a concrete example of support, I will mention the European Union's commitment to the universality of the Rome Statute and to promoting a better understanding of the mandate of the International Criminal Court. The EU continues to do its utmost to advance this process in third countries, in particular in regular human rights dialogues with over forty countries, with systematic campaigns of diplomatic initiatives around the world, with the organization of local or regional seminars on issue, with the systematic insertion of a clause on the International Criminal Court in agreements with third countries - as it was mentioned above - or with financial support for civil society organizations active in promoting the universality of the Statute.
