Addressing you here in Strasbourg is all the more dear to me since this city occupies a special place in the history of European integration. I am fortunate to be part of a generation that has not experienced the Second World War and the post-war years. The European Union has brought to our countries the longest period of peace ever known on our continent. Living in peace may seem commonplace, but believe me, peace is never trivial. Europe is an old continent made up of countries and regions rich in culture and history. The diversity of its heritage makes the beauty of this Europe. And the European political architecture must take account of this diversity. The fact that the European Parliament is meeting in plenary in Strasbourg, one of the three capitals of Europe, alongside Luxembourg and Brussels, is also symbolic in this regard. It was at the Strasbourg European Council in December 1989, a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that the leaders of the time, such as Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, took control of the fate of Europe of the cold war, laying the foundations for European reunification, going hand in hand with the German reunification. I refer to this period in the late 1980s, a time when the world experienced great upheavals. At the said Strasbourg Council, the call was made to start us towards the European Union. This call seems to me always topical, especially at a time when the world is again undergoing great changes. I am thinking in particular of the unpredictability of some of our partners, but also the risk of a loss of European competitiveness in a globalised world. Our continent needs to be more united in order to protect citizens and chart its future. The conclusions of December 1989 still seem to me to be valid. I quote from this excerpt: 'It is in the interest of all European States that the Community should be strengthened and accelerated its march towards the European Union'. Thirty years later, let us speed up again our march towards the European Union. And let's accelerate it especially by taking into account the expectations of our citizens. Let us make our Union stronger and able to respond to the challenges we face today. In this context, citizen dialogue must be cultivated. Citizens' consultations, proposed by President Macron, are valuable opportunities to engage citizens and identify their concerns, hopes and expectations. Luxembourg is among the first countries to accede to this initiative. I myself launched the first consultations on April 20. I call for action by all Member States to meet the expectations of our citizens. But if this unity cannot be found when action is required, I would point out that in the Treaties we also have tools in the Treaties that enable us to move forward to many, namely the possibility of acting within the framework of enhanced cooperation. Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall kicked off to welcome European nations from which we have been artificially separated since the end of the Second World War, the refugee crisis in 2015 and the British referendum held a few months later are events that call for new momentum. I am convinced that the successive events that have taken place in recent years — the Arab Spring, the war in Libya, the refugee crisis, the increasing insecurity in the Sahel region and, above all, the war in Syria, not forgetting the terrorist acts in our cities — mark a turning point which requires a stronger Union's action European. Like our predecessors, we must arm ourselves with courage and take the necessary decisions in the face of these challenges, in order to maintain a Europe politically and economically strong, free and open to the world. In the aftermath of the last global conflict caused by exacerbated nationalisms, my country chosen, together with its neighbours, to be one of the founding countries of the European Union. This historic opportunity has allowed us to have a perspective on Europe which is that of a State which has taken part in the evolution of the European Union over time. For us, the choice of Europe has, at every stage, been dictated by our convictions: the choice of a European State which defines its national sovereignty also through — or even thanks to — its membership in the Union. And I am very proud that the latest polls have shown that Luxembourgers are the ones who love Europe most. Today, paradoxically, populist forces invoke only national sovereignty to ensure the salvation of Europe. It is precisely the European Union that protects our sovereignty more than ever in a globalised world. Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union provides added value to European citizens, in countless instances improving their daily lives. However, one of the greatest challenges the Union faces today is the fact that these advantages resulting from a country's membership of the Union are simply taken for granted. It is therefore not a coincidence, in my view, that so many UK citizens living in my country have been applying for Luxembourg citizenship since the Brexit referendum. Many others have apparently been doing the same in other Member States. These applications for citizenship by British citizens are proof of the huge added value of the public goods and services created by the European Union, which these citizens do not want to abandon: most obviously, the four freedoms. Sehr geehrter Herr President! Unsere Bürger verlangen ein weltoffenes und tolerantes Europa, in dem jede Frau und jeder Mann die gleichen Chancen hat, unabhängig von Religion, Hautfarbe oder sexueller Orientierung. The European Union dazu beitragen können, Germany for the globalen Probleme unserer Zeit zu finden — Probleme, welche die europäischen Nationalstaaten alleine nicht mehr schultern könen. Ich denke yesterday unter anderem an den Klimawandel. The Verhandlungen zum Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen haben gezeigt, dass die EU eine treibende Kraft sein kann bei der Suche nach Lösungen zu globalen Problemen. In general Fragen der Nichtverbreitung von Massenvernichtungswaffen kann die EU eine tragende Rolle einnehmen, wie die letzten Wochen gezeigt haben. Genauso verlangt die sich weltweit ändernde Demografie sowohl global als auch europäische Antworten. Fragen der Migration of 21. Jahrhunderts sind keine nationalen Fragen. Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass die Europäische Union eine, ja sogar die Antwort auf diese globalen Herausforderungen darstellt. Nur eine europäische Antwort kann die Sicherheit und das Allgemeinwohl unserer Bürger auch im 21. Jahrhundert gewährleisten. In addition to the work of Einsatz der Europäischen Commission and Insbesondere von Kommissarin Malmström für einen freien und offenen Welthandel im Einklang mit den Regeln der Welthandelsorganisation begrüßen. Unsere Bürger wollen teilhaben am Wirtschaftswachstum and auch am Wohlstand. The Weltwirtschaftslage ist positiv moment, das Wachstum hat sich in allen EU-Mitgliedstaaten eingefunden. Deshalb ist the richtige Zeitpunkt, um die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Europas zu stärken. The europäische Binnenmarkt ist in diesem Zusammenhang eine Grundvoraussetzung, damit unsere Unternehmen global wettbewerbsfähig sind und das vor allem auch noch bleiben. The Euro ist wiederum eine Grundvoraussetzung für einen gut funktionierenden EU-Binnenmarkt. Deshalb ist on strategischer Bedeutung, the Vertiefung der europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion weiterhin voranzutreiben. Freitag haben die Finanzminister der EU, on business in Luxembourg, to the Bank of the Bankenunion, to finance finance and so die richtigen Weichen gestellt zur Vertiefung der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion, zu der der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion, sich die Staats- und Regierungschefs im nächsten juni verpflichtet haben. From the Euro and the Binnenmarkt to the city of France, and in gleichem Maße bedingen sich auch die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion als seiten der gleichen Medaille. The Vertiefung of EU-Binnenmarktes ist deshalb auch weiterhin eines unserer Hauptanliegen. Hierbei denke ich vor allem an die Schaffung eines digitalen EU-Binnenmarktes. En wäre inkohärent, auf der einen Seite eine europäische Umsatzsteuer für Internetunternehmen anzustreben, wenn wir andererseits noch nicht einmal über einen einheitlichen digitalen eu-binnenmarkt verfügen. Ebenfalls sollten wir kurzfristige Zwischenlösungen vermeiden, die dauerhafte Beschlüsse noch schwieriger machen. Um Missverständnissen vorzubeugen: Ich befürworte eine faire Besteuerung der Enjoy the Internetunternehmen. Nur sollte eine solche Besteuerung auch im Einklang mit der Notwendigkeit der Erhaltung und der Verstärkung der globalen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der EU sein. Deswegen scheint mir hier die Zusammenarbeit mit der OECD sehr wichtig zu sein. Was on the Diskussion zur Besteuerung von digitalen Unternehmen, den sogenannten gafas, auch zu denken gibt, ist der Umstand, dass eine große Anzahl dieser Unternehmen ihren technologischen Ursprung in Ländern außerhalb der EU haben. Wir reden übrigens oft über steuerliche Harmonisierung in der Europäischen Union. Der Binnenmarkt benötigt sicher eine gewisse Harmonisierung, auch im steuerlichen Bereich. Was mich sorgt, ist allerdings der Eindruck, dass das Wort “Steuerharmonisierung” seit Jahren and für Gesprächspartner oft gleichlautend mit dem Wort “Steuererhöhung” ist. Sollten wir im Steuerbereich — wenn wir schon harmonisieren wollen — nicht im Interesse der globalen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und der Steuerzahler der Europäischen Union auch mal über Steuersenkungen reden können? (Beifall) Und glauben Sie mir, ich rede hier keinem Steuerdumping das Wort, aber die global Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Europäischen Union liegt mir sehr am Herzen. The augenblickliche Diskussion der Besteuerung von Internetunternehmen zeigt aber auch, dass wir mehr in Innovation and in die Finanzierung von start-ups investeren müssen. Volkswirtschaftlich gesehen sind in einem gemeinsamen and offenen europäischen Binnenmarkt die Defizite der einen die überschüsse der anderen. Ich befürworte keine Vergemeinschaftung der Schulden oder notleidender Kredite, aber ich bin mir in einem gemeinsamen Markt unserer Verantwortung for the Allgemeinwohl auf europäischer Ebene bewusst. Ungleichheiten zwischen den einzelnen Partnern im Binnenmarkt sind auf Dauer der notwendigen volkswirtschaftlichen Stabilität in Europa auch nicht förderlich. Mr President, I would point out that Europe is not limited to its common market. To paraphrase Jacques Delors, “we do not fall in love with the common market”. At the same time, we must also work towards a European social model, which promotes upward social convergence among the Member States. In this regard, I welcome yesterday's plenary vote following the agreement reached last March between Parliament and the Council on the revision of the directive on the posting of workers in the internal market. This is an important step forward in the fight against social dumping. Similarly, I hope that agreement on social legislation for the road transport sector — legislation which allows for upward social convergence while taking into account the specificities of this sector — can be reached before the end of this legislature. I also welcome the proposal of the President of the Commission to create a European Labour Authority with a view to strengthening cross-border cooperation and the fight against fraud and abuse. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a strong European economy and monetary union can generate jobs and tax revenues to finance modern European models of social protection. The deepening of economic and monetary union must, however, not be limited to budgetary aspects alone. Strengthening competitiveness and productivity at European level, as well as the establishment of a genuine European Innovation Area, are factors of convergence which, in the long run, I am convinced, will facilitate joint budgetary management. A Europe that is competitive, prosperous and open to the world will be the best guarantee of the protection of the European social model. Any deepening of economic and monetary union will sooner or later also require enlargement of the euro area. The Union Treaties provide for the accession of all Member States to the euro, with the exception of two of them. The adoption of the common currency is therefore an essential legal principle in the implementation of the Treaties. However, we must act without haste, lessons learned from recent years, and ensuring the productivity and competitiveness of all euro area member countries. The next multiannual financial framework must therefore reflect the need for economic convergence by focusing more on innovation, among other things. In this regard, I welcome the Commission's proposals, which provide a good basis for discussion. I am also pleased with the attention given to the Erasmus programme. Mr President, I am fortunate to be part of this “Erasmus generation”: when I was a student at the Faculty of Law in Nancy, I spent an Erasmus stay at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I was able to discover subjects that I did not know before, but this Erasmus stay opened my eyes especially to Europe's contribution to the daily lives of each of us. I can only recommend every student to make an Erasmus stay, because it is really an exchange and experience that is worth it. In the same vein, without wanting to go into detail, I also believe in the added value of the Cohesion Funds. I think it is time to reflect in a spirit of solidarity on the best use that can be made of these funds. I think it is important to ensure that cohesion funds are used even more transparently, in accordance with the rule of law. Mr President, before discussing the expectations of our fellow citizens regarding the Union's external action, allow me a parenthesis about its internal organisation. It is obviously legitimate to discuss this internal organisation, a federal Europe, a Europe of parties and the division of powers between the institutions. I do not hide from you that I am a little puzzled about institutional debates. These discussions, however important they may be, do not enthusiasm our fellow citizens. And if we feel that this is what passionate them outside, we are wrong. Institutional change must be linked to the pursuit of concrete political objectives, which meet the needs of citizens and also to their aspirations. It is precisely this concrete added value that must be the key thread for institutional change. Here, let me say, I have difficulty understanding — and I discussed it again last night with one of your representatives — the position of the “Spitzenkandidaten”, the top candidates, without having any transnational lists. I know your decision, Mr President, but I hope you will come back to that one day. (Applause) For me, we started backwards: we have “Spitzenkandidaten” without transnational lists, whereas the “Spitzenkandidat” should be the “Spitzenkandidat” of a transnational list. Mr President, the citizens that you and I represent expect the Union to contribute to their safety and security from internal and external threats. Our internal challenges in numerous policy domains, it seems to me that the largest crises were imported from outside the European Union. The refugee crisis was triggered by a worsening security situation in the Middle East and the Sahel region, to which the wars in Libya and Syria have contributed. The dramatic events of summer and autumn 2015, when hundreds of thousands of refugees have been fleeing war on a scale not seen in Europe since 1945, are obvious evidence that no European nation state is able to cope with such tragedies on its own. In that respect, I deeply regret the opposition by some EU Member States to carrying their share of the burden in a spirit of solidarity. In the age of globalisation, European solidarity is even more important than it was before. By the way, in any relationship, solidarity is a concept that should not be qualified. We need to stand together in solidarity and not try to introduce concepts like flexible solidarity, which at the end of the day will result in a reciprocal lack of solidarity. (Applause) Denn, wie heißt es doch so schön in Goethes Faust: “Nichts Bessers weiß ich mir an Sonn- und Feiertagen, Alles ein Gespräch von Krieg und Kriegsgeschrei, Wenn hinten, weit, in der Turkei, Die Völker aufeinander schllander agen. Man steht am Fenster, trinkt within Gläschen aus, Und sieht den Fluss hinab die bunten Schiffe gleiten; Dann kehrt man abends froh nach Haus, Und segnet Fried and Friedenszeiten. “Diese faustische Passage illustrated by the Wandel der Zeit. Die Türkei, Syrian, Libyan, der gesamte südliche Mittelmeerraum sowie Russland oder die Ukraine sind in der heutigen globalisierten Welt unsere direkten Nachbarn. Diese Länder sind weder “hinten” noch “weit weg”. Es sind unsere Nachbarn, und nur eine global, einheitlich aufgestellte Außenpolitik der Europäischen Union kann hier auch Einfluss nehmen. Nationalgrenzen verlieren in diesem Zusammenhang ihren Sinn, oder anders ausgedrückt: Eine national luxemburgische Grenze kann nur an den EU-außengrenzen beschützt werden. Die Bürger verlangen zu Recht Taten. Frontex ist von größter Bedeutung — nicht, weil ich the EU-außengrenzen schließen will, sondern weil ein starker europäischer Grenzschutz zur Sicherheit der Europäischen Union und der Wahrung unserer Werte unabdingbar ist. Auch hier begrüße ich die Finanzierungsvorschläge der Kommission. Ich bin überzeugt, dass die europäischen Bürger bereit sind, eine europäisch guaranteerte Sicherheit an den Außengrenzen auch mitzufinanzieren. Sicherheit ist genauso wie die Reisefreiheit und die Freizügigkeit ein gewichtiges europäisches Gut. Reisefreiheit at the Schengen und der Schutz der Außengrenzen bedingen sich gegenseitig. Mehr Europa und größere EU-budgets, welche auch die nationalen Budgets entlasten, sind hier stark vonnöten. Yesterday year dieser Stelle begrüße ich auch ausdrücklich, dass jeder EU-Bürger überall auf der Welt den konsularischen Schutz go anwesenden europäischen Konsulate genießt. Mr President, the 2015 migration crisis showed that the European Union must redouble its efforts, not only to secure its external borders, but also, in general, to strengthen its policies in the external dimension, such as foreign affairs, defence, development cooperation, without forgetting a policy common asylum and immigration issues. Only through the joint implementation of national sovereignties will we also be able to ensure our own sovereignty. Let us have the same courage as our predecessors in 1989, when they started to reunify Europe, and let us jointly ensure our security and that of our borders. I am also convinced that we will all spend less together if we put our efforts together, because of the efficiencies and synergies we can achieve. The same principle applies to the defence. Luxembourg is a country which is fortunate to be surrounded today by friendly countries, from which there is no threat to its security, quite the contrary. In its history, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg cannot be suspected of wanting to push the Union in a direction other than supporting peace. We believe in the virtues of multilateralism and international law, diplomacy and development cooperation. Like other countries, Luxembourg has also experienced more difficult budgetary periods in recent times. Some immediately said that the budget for cooperation could be reduced. Why want to help outdoors when you still have problems inside? My Government has decided, like the previous government, that even in more difficult times, the budget for cooperation, which is spent on the poorest in the world, is one per cent that is well invested. When we wonder if we are going to eat hot or cold, some mothers wonder what they will be able to eat their children for a week. While we wonder what we are going to do, some would simply like to have a future and prospects. This per cent allows young people who, today or perhaps yesterday, have or did not have a prospect for the future, to have a job and have optimism for tomorrow. So, we defend this development policy, and I regret that at international level, and sometimes at European level, when the red 'Bic' is to be released, the cooperation budget is the first target. It's popular, but believe me, it's not good. (Applause) Mr President, also believe that I am convinced that it is in the interests of the citizens of the Member States of the Union to do more to achieve closer cooperation in the field of external relations. In this context, I am arguing in particular in favour of rapid work of permanent structured cooperation launched on the sidelines of the European Council of 14 December 2017. In the same vein, I believe that cooperation should be deepened in the field of foreign policy. The aim of the European Union must be to speak with a stronger voice for peace, which is a fundamental value, because war is the denial of human rights. Because of its history, Europe must be a bulwark against dictatorship and barbarism. European values, as we have enshrined in the Treaties, are, moreover, the fundamental consensus among the Member States. They are our foundation in our relations with the rest of the world. Finally, I remain firmly convinced that cooperation also remains a bulwark against the root causes of insecurity. A broad concept of European security must include cooperation and development. I have talked about our common values, but I cannot conclude my speech, Mr President, without mentioning the importance I attach to freedom of the press, an essential component of our democracies. In the past year several dozen journalists have been murdered, two of them in our Union itself. This is a situation that concerns me to the highest degree. It is important for the European Union to continue to defend and promote freedom of the press. Mr President, let me — you have seen, I have spoken to you in French, German, English — (The speaker spoke in Luxembourgish) I have just spoken the other language we speak in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which is our national language, Luxembourgish, to thank the six Luxembourg MEPs who defend the position of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in this Europe. We are not the largest Member State, but believe me, we believe in our Europe. In conclusion, let us accelerate our journey towards Europe with confidence and boldness. Our world is changing and the European Union is the best guarantee for our collective sovereignty and the fulfilment of all our citizens.

Once again, I would like to congratulate your President for having taken the initiative to invite a Prime Minister after the other to this plenary in order to discuss major issues in Europe with the colleagues of the European Parliament. That's something which has to be welcomed, because the dialogue between governments and the European Parliament is as important as the dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament. I'm invited each and every time to respond to the Prime Minister visiting us, and I must repeat myself by saying that the differences are not as deep as they seem. Würde ich in diesem konkreten Fall dem Premierminister Luxemburgs, den ich sehr herzlich hier begrüße, widersprechen, würde ich mir selbst widersprechen müssen, weil er in der Substanz genau das gesagt hat, was die Kommission und auch der President denkt. Es tut gut, zu sehen, dass die luxemburgische Regierung voller Begeisterung hinter den Aktionsplänen der Europäischen Commission steht. Das musste mal deutlich gesagt werden, das ist heute passiert. (Beifall) So I cannot contradict the Prime Minister of my country because, in essence, he told you what the Commission is trying to convey as a message. Therefore, I will be very brief. Yes, within a year the Europeans will have elected a new European Parliament, of which no one, of course, knows the composition of which is yet. It will be different from today's one, which gives me some concerns. Therefore, I would like us to sign up together in fake — and I know Xavier does so with me — against the galloping populism we are witnessing in Europe and in all countries, including my own. But as Luxembourgers are wise men and women, the movement is not a moving movement, but a content and “contentable” movement. Ich würde gerne einige Punkte yesterday erwähnen. Weil wir uns heute in einem Jahr mit einem neuen Europäischen Parlament auseinanderzusetzen haben, denke ich, dass jetzt der Moment gekommen ist, wo die Regierungen auch klar und deutlich Farbe bekennen müssen. Wir haben im Juni einen Europäischen Rat; sleeps wird es um die Vertiefung der europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion gehen. Hätte gern, dass die Regierungschefs sich etwas deutlicher zu Wort melden, wenn es um diese Vertiefungselemente der europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion geht. Der luxemburgische Premierminister hat dies heute getan — aber nicht flächendeckend und nicht vollumfänglich. Die Frage ist: Wollen wir — ja oder nein — ein europäisches Einlagensicherungssystem in Etappen einführen? Ich bin überhaupt nicht der Meinung, dass dies hopplahop von heute auf morgen geht, aber man muss sich prinzipiell in diese Richtung bewegen. (Beifall) In Sachen Steuern: Ja, ich bin auch für Steuersenkungen. Man sollte das im Übrigen auch in Luxemburg tun. (Heiterkeit) Ja, ich habe das mehrfach gemacht! Ich habe 19 Jahre gebraucht, um Fehler zu machen, andere haben kürzere Zeit zur Verfügung. Aber in Sachen Steuerpolitik and was die Internetriesen anbelangt, geht es ja nicht um Steuersenkung oder Steuererhöhung, es geht um Steuergerechtigkeit. Es kann nicht so bleiben, dass die Internetriesen 8% Steuern bezahlen, während die kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen im Schnitt 30% bezahlen. Das ist eine ungerechte Steuerlandschaft, and die muss korrigiert werden. (Beifall) With regard to foreign policy, I agree broadly with the Prime Minister. However, I would like governments, following recent events, to agree on a simple principle. In terms of foreign policy, in order to be effective — and Xavier argued for Europe's effectiveness — we must make our decisions by qualified majority. We cannot lead the world if we stay on the principle of unanimity. It will not work. On behalf of the Commission, we have proposed to ask the European Council to decide henceforth, in certain sectors, by qualified majority. If only one Member State goes through Europe's diplomatic route, Europe is blocked and we are ridiculous when we at UN level and in other international fora claim to play a leading role. I demand a qualified majority in matters and I have no doubt for a moment that the Luxembourg Government, for the reasons which Xavier has put forward, will accompany us on this path, which I know is not easy. Mr. Speaker, these are a few things I wanted to add to the Prime Minister's remarks. I would like to say, as a Luxembourger that I am, that I remain and will be forever, that Luxembourg has played a peacemaking role in Europe. It does not have the means to do otherwise, but Europe is part of the Grand Duchy's State reason and I am grateful to the Prime Minister for continuing on this road.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": " Mr President-in-Office of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats). Welcome to the European Parliament. It's good to have the Luxembourg voice here. Luxembourg is a strong advocate of European integration, founding member, and you can say: a small country, but a great European. This is Luxembourg. And that's why welcome. Luxembourg has also had in the history of the European Union and still has a lot of influence today. You thanked the six MEPs. I would also like to join Jean-Claude Juncker, who is at the head of Europe as President of the Commission. The former leaders, such as one of the founders of Europe, Joseph Bech, and Jacques Santer, of course, have also been strong figures who have taken Europe forward. And Luxembourg, of course, lives Europe: with more than 40% of citizens from other Member States living in Luxembourg, it is probably the most European country we have in Europe today. Therefore, welcome! I would like to highlight one point directly from your speech, which was also taken up by Jean-Claude Juncker: we are talking about tax cuts, and the liberals typically clap here, but we only have tax reduction debates in companies. We are discussing this because there is tax competition, because companies today decide where they pay the lowest taxes, and therefore go to the state where they pay the lowest taxes. But the people who do not make so much use of the mobility of the internal market, the workers and those who pay VAT, who go to supermarkets, unfortunately, cannot benefit from these tax reductions. That is why the point made by Jean-Claude Juncker is absolutely correct: it is not about general tax cuts, but about tax fairness. The question is that corporations pay exactly the same contribution to our state as others. (Applause) I would like to highlight two issues today. Prime Minister, we are discussing with Heads of State or Government every week. That is why I have always set out to accentuate two things in this debate. Today, because you are here as a Luxembourger, I would first like to talk about the rule of law, because you are the home of our European Court of Justice. Walter Hallstein said: European integration was not created by military strength or political pressure, but by a binding legal idea. Europe is a community of law. We should bear in mind the revolutionary idea that the law of the strongest does not apply to the law of the strongest, as has been normal for centuries on this continent, but that the promise is that European citizens will be able to practise and live their lives on the basis of the rule of law. This rule of law also establishes prosperity, is part of our European way of life, and today it is challenged by the long process that we have partly, by the economy that sets its own rules — we were presented on Facebook last week — by the deprivation of responsibility from the rich — keyword Tax avoidance — by the question that sometimes there is weak political backing for legal institutions, and of course the problem of corruption. Law must never follow power, but must always limit power. That is the principle behind this, and we need to look more closely at our rule of law. We may need common thinking about how we train lawyers, a common understanding. We have to consider that the conditionality proposed by the Commission is a right step in the right direction. The rule of law must have a price in the future if it is not respected. And the rule of law must not become a political issue between parties, but must be monitored neutrally, for example by the ECJ. The second issue that I want to pick out today is a topic that you too have raised — a topic that must worry us all very much, namely the work of our media. Freedom of the press in the state, the media, is just as existentially necessary for the future of Europe as the judiciary. That is why we need to look at the drama of the situation. It is unbearable that in the 21st century Daphne Caruana Galizia, Ján Kuciak and yesterday in Ukraine Arkady Babchenko were murdered, apparently in the exercise of their service, namely the task of upholding the free media. We are facing huge challenges. I just want to pick out two. One is the digital challenge. We must prepare ourselves, including our services, to strengthen the state structures in order to take up the fight against fake news and disinformation and against the hatred that we are experiencing there on social media. We are still too under-equipped there, we need to create transparency. I want to know the algorithms that Facebook, Twitter and others use to prioritize messages or gut backwards. And we need to discuss how to ensure diversity of opinion. On television, newspapers and radio, there are laws that regulate that all parties are given a decent place in the election campaign. Why do we not have these laws for digital media today? There too, it must be regulated that everyone has a fair chance of getting in touch with citizens when the election campaign takes place. And we may also need regulations to ensure that citizens are informed by the state in times of crisis. Last but not least, the classic media, publishers are disappearing, they are increasingly losing strength, financial strength, they are being taken over by Russian investors, by others who have political interests and do not have publishing interests. That is why we need to discuss the transparency of media ownership. We need an annual report on media independence — including in Hungary, so that there is no doubt that we need this strengthening in all the states of the European Union. We need common standards and perhaps also consider whether we can strengthen the public media even more. These two points are necessary, they underline the European principle today. But we need to strengthen them again so that the future of Europe is guaranteed.

I am Portuguese and I could tell you about a happy story, which is the relationship between our two peoples, but I am here to speak on behalf of the Socialist and Democratic Group. First of all, I would like to tell you that your commitment and Luxembourg's commitment to the European project are highly appreciated. You have just demonstrated it again in a very clear way. Luxembourg is not only at the crossroads of Europe, it is also the cornerstone of European integration. This vocation is known, respected and highly appreciated. I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the state of Europe and its future. It is true that we have had a difficult time, a period of crisis, and today we have a more positive feeling. But what is happening in Italy now shows the fragility of our situation and shows that Europe, as it operates today, has serious failures. This is the situation Italy is experiencing, lacking hope in the future, with a sense of asphyxiation, because we have not been able to manage the migration crisis together and because we have not really overcome the crisis in the euro area. This has resulted in an explosive combination, with regions under great migratory pressure and, at the same time, a very high rise in unemployment. Therefore, Italy is faced with a very difficult choice: to accept Europe as it is, with its shortcomings, or take a step towards the precipice, in other words, exit the eurozone or even the European Union. However, one cannot put a country in front of an impossible choice. The only way out of this impasse is to make Europe work much better for its citizens. That is the issue. Prime Minister, there will soon be a decisive European Council. Everybody knows that. There will be both the reform of European migration policy and the response to the euro area crisis. Therefore, the first question I ask you is whether we can count on you to live up to the situation. Because, in two days, the European Commission will present a proposal aimed at supplementing economic and monetary union on the budgetary pillar. It is certainly good to make progress on the pillar of Banking Union, but that is not enough, because Economic and Monetary Union must be given a real budgetary pillar that supports investment, which supports economic and social convergence. We cannot continue in a situation where, on the one hand, some of the euro area members do not have a real chance to invest in the future and where, on the other, Europe as a whole has a problem of underinvestment in the future. So my question is: can we count on you to make progress on this issue, knowing that we must not only create an embryo of budgetary capacity, but also play with the financial leverage of the European Stability Mechanism, which was to be put in a Community framework? This is our preference. I have another question. While it is true that Europe is facing a situation of underinvestment, it needs an ambitious investment strategy driven by the sustainable development goals and commitment to the social pillar. But this requires a Community budget that is up to the tune. However, we may not have it due to lack of resources. So my last question is: with regard to resources, is it not time to take a step towards own resources which should include not only the Commission's proposals but, in our opinion, a real digital tax? We must make progress on this point. We can no longer accept that our internal market will be used by large companies without tax commitments. Therefore, Prime Minister, we expect you to take a courageous step, because without a Europe that works better, the Italian case risks staining oil. This is our concern.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Hans-Olaf HENKEL", "mepid": "124823", "text": " Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. It is not as good as Europe is portrayed here. The European patient is ill, and before a doctor recommends therapy, he first makes a diagnosis — and this did not happen this morning. I fear that the recipe for more Europe adopted this morning will give the European patient the rest. The dramatic increase in right-wing populist, far-right parties is also the result of too much Europe. And Brexit — for me the biggest catastrophe in recent years — is also, at least indirectly, a result of too much Europe. It is a good thing that you are going to point out that the British all want to be Luxembourgers now — but, Prime Minister, I would have expected you to point out what this means for Europe, that there is a country here that is as tall as if 9 to 10 other European countries were leaving Europe at once. The state crisis in Italy is also a consequence of too much Europe — at least the euro. You pointed out that the internal market is somehow related to the euro. I'm sorry, this is nonsense. The economic development of non-euro countries over the last 20 years in the EU has been much better than the development of the countries that have the euro. “Buongiorno”, one can only say. There is no country in Europe at all that suffers from a one-size-fit all currency as Italy. Prior to the introduction of the euro, Italy was still a country with a 6% global market share. Today, this share has shrunk to 3%. The country is overindebted and youth unemployment in Italy is an absolute disaster. While Italy is suffering from a currency that is far too strong in its view, German industry is experiencing a huge export surplus due to its view far too weak currency. Prime Minister, you rightly pointed out that, fortunately, you were not influenced by the turmoil of war and post-war — or you did not have to experience them. It was different for me: my father stayed in the war, we were bombed out twice, and I am glad that we have had peace in Europe for over 70 years. But this has nothing to do with the euro. That's because of the democracies! There has never been a democracy that has attacked another. That is what we have to cultivate — but not the euro. Quite apart from the fact that Germany is not in a state of war with the non-euro countries, I would like to point out what the euro is doing at the moment: anti-German slogans are currently being used in Italy. Why? It is quite clear: because here the euro repeatedly forces the potentially largest creditor — Germany — to regulate the potentially largest debtor — Italy. Mrs Merkel was not elected by the Italians. After Greece, Italy is now clearly showing that instead of subordinating different economic cultures to the needs of a single currency, we should ensure that one currency corresponds to different cultures. Instead of constantly trying to tell Italians how to remain competitive in the world market, we should leave it to them to decide whether they do it with labour market reforms, with devaluation or with a combination of both. The last elections in Italy clearly show that more and more Italians see it that way. In response to the question by the two Italian Members of this House, Marco Valli and Marco Zanni, ECB President Mario Draghi referred to this — and I quote now: “In the event of a withdrawal from monetary union, Italy will have to settle all its liabilities with the ECB beforehand.” Italy's exit from monetary union, but at the same time it also suggests a solution to the Italian problem: if you leave monetary union — and I say this as a German — Italy should also receive financial support, and that would be a long overdue balance sheet adjustment for us. Finally, a sick Italy in monetary union is not as good for everyone as a healthy Italy with its own currency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": " I remind you that we must conclude the debate at 11.30.

When there was no European Union, there was authoritarianism, despotism in Europe, fascism in Europe, Nazism in Europe between the two World Wars. And it is since we have the European Union that we have guaranteed democracy in the European Union. That is what we have achieved. That we have achieved. (Applause) And I am very glad that the Prime Minister talked about press freedom and values because at the moment there is a problem in Europe, let's say it: values are threatened. We are outraged at the assassination of journalists in Malta or Slovakia, but then we must be consistent, Manfred, we must dare to react against states such as Mr Orbán's Hungary, such as Kaczynski's Poland and Malta and its corrupt political system. We must dare say that it's enough, that it's not that, to be European! That is where the source of our problems lies. We must have the courage to say so, to stop the Orbans of this world, the Kaczynski of this world and those who think that a corrupt system, like Malta, is a good system to fuel a country's income. Thank you for this vision, Mr Bettel, which we hear from time to time, but not enough, in this chamber. Above all, thank you for the role Luxembourg plays, because whenever we need to find a compromise to find, Luxembourg is there, together with my country and others, to try to find solutions to move forward, while sometimes it is the big countries that pose problems, let us say so too. Mr Henkel spoke about Italy. It is not that the Italian crisis is exceptional. In any case, this is not the first time that there has been a crisis in Italy, Mr Henkel, it already existed before the euro, the political crisis in Italy. There are also political crises in other countries. See Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany. The formation of a government in these countries has nevertheless taken some time in the past more or less recent. The real problem I want to stress here is that whenever a political crisis affects an important Member State of our euro area, it immediately turns into a crisis throughout the euro area. Interest rate differentials are widening, deficits are rising, banks are struggling, and ultimately the economy and confidence collapse. Why? Why, when there is a problem in one of the Member States of the euro area, especially if it is a large Member State, why are there problems at the euro area level in general? But for the simple reason that our single currency, our monetary union is unfinished! That is the reality, Mr Henkel: monetary union is unfinished. Indeed, the euro is the only currency in the world behind which there is only a monetary authority, the European Central Bank, but no political authority and no budgetary authority. This is the real problem! It is from this point of view, Mr Henkel, that we must analyse the Italian crisis. The reality is that we manage monetary union with an intergovernmental contract between the 19 euro area Member States, and when there are political problems in one of these Member States, all other euro area Member States are automatically affected. We must therefore break this logic, and to break this logic, we must not go back, Mr Henkel, we must go ahead! And moving forward, this means that we must implement and put into practice what all the reports of the OECD, the IMF, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the European Parliament recommend, namely that a government for the euro area, fiscal capacity for the euro area, a finance minister for the euro area must be implemented and put into practice. and that there is a need for a full banking union and a parliament. And that is my second message, Mr Henkel: why we don't have it; it is absolutely needed now, and I ask Prime Minister Bettel and the President of the Commission to make that the first priority. That does not mean that the Member States do not have to do their homework. What you are saying is true. Between 1970 and 1996, in fact the competitiveness of Italy was as good as that of Germany, and their export figures were as good as those of Germany. But it is not because they entered the euro, because they did not make the reforms that were necessary, because in the past they could do devaluations of their own currency — and that is no longer possible. Are you defending devaluation as the way to avoid reforms in a country? Who is paying? Mr Henkel has no problem with it — his income is sufficiently high, he has no problem — but ordinary people with pensions, with savings: their income is reduced and they are paying the price for devaluations. So that is not the solution. The solution is reform, and what Italy has to do is what France has started to do — reforms, reforms — and then Italy will be saved. That also means solidarity in the European Union, from north to south. Germany has to accept the proposals of Emmanuel Macron and of the Commission on the reform of the eurozone. Mr Scholz, your Minister of Finance, has to follow Mr Schulz and not Mr Schäuble, if I can say it in one sentence, and there also has to be solidarity from the south with the north. If tomorrow there is a trade war with Trump, we have to be behind German industry, even German cars. When I was young I preferred Alfa Romeo, I have to tell you, to BMW, but nevertheless I think we have to stand in solidarity. That is my message, and that is also the message, dear Xavier, that we want to hear from the Council. Start — this is the most important thing — the reform of the governance of the eurozone, certainly now that the problems have also started in Italy.

The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has always shown a strong commitment to the European Union, and the speech you have just delivered here confirms this commitment. In particular, we share your idea that peace is not trivial and that it is never definitively achieved. We really share the idea that the definition of our sovereignty is increasingly being built through and through the European Union. We also share this idea of a free, strong and open European Union and your willingness to accelerate its construction rather than slow it down. A few days after the entry into force of the famous General Data Protection Regulation, I would like to remind everyone that it was under the Luxembourg Presidency that agreement was reached on this pioneering text, which, moreover, was put on track by former Commissioner Viviane Reding, also from Luxembourg. And you will allow me to claim the pride that it is a green minister of your government, Félix Braz, who concluded the negotiations with Parliament's green rapporteur, our colleague Jan Philipp Albrecht. We are also pleased to note that, like your Irish colleague who opened this round of debates in January, your government has moved forward the values of equality and, in particular, women's rights. This is all the more remarkable given that within the European Union some Member States want to go back in this area. I am also pleased that your government has given the ecological transition a greater place in public policy. I would like to stress the positive role played by Carole Dieschbourg at the Paris climate conference. Very logically, on the climate front, your government supports the position of the European Parliament, which is much more ambitious than that of the Council and the Commission. On this ground, you engage Luxembourg in renewable energies, but also in a spatial planning policy that respects our common assets: soil, air and water. Similarly, while the Grand Duchy has been the unglorious protagonist of the LuxLeaks saga, I am delighted that it is now supporting the draft European directive on the protection of whistleblowers, which are so essential to our democracy. And you see where I am going to come because, as European ecologists, we are globally proud of the European and national achievements of the government in which our Luxembourg friends work, there remains a big black spot that separates us: taxation. Since the 2013 Offshore Leaks revelations, a litany of scandals have revealed how the world's largest companies and fortunes evade and defraud taxes. Of course, the Grand Duchy is not the only player in this senseless tax competition between Member States and Europe against the rest of the world. But it is difficult to deny the responsibility of your country, especially alongside its neighbours in the Benelux. The European Commission has made no mistake in recently pinning Luxembourg for its aggressive tax practices. Our wealthy Belgian families know something about it, who have housed no less than 48 billion euros in your country by creating mailbox companies there. And many of our Red Devils, our footballers, did not hesitate to transfer a large part of their advertising revenue to Luxembourg to benefit from your regime, far too lax, in terms of intellectual property protection. The Grand Duchy's European tax action is also largely disappointing. When your finance minister does not play the clock to delay the introduction of a tax on digital giants, he is failing to block initiatives in favour of the interests of the European taxpayer — those taxpayers, as Manfred said, who do not have the opportunity to play one state against the other — in particular the introduction of a public reporting, country-by-country, for multinationals or the implementation of a common consolidated corporate tax base. In short, your opposition in principle to any form of tax harmonization, citing the fact that this would mean a reduction in the taxes, at a time when multinationals almost do not pay for it — we are talking about an increase in taxes, indeed, and it is necessary and justified — is unworthy of a country that claims to defend the European project. I would say that from the country with the highest per capita income in the entire European Union, I think that Europeans could wait for a hand outstretched rather than a closed fist. Prime Minister, I would like to conclude by dedicating my speech to Camille Gira, your Secretary of State for Sustainable Development, who passed away on 16 May. He has been a pioneer in political ecology in your country, in particular by transforming his village of Beckerich into a showcase of ecology, with 100% renewable energy, but above all with unprecedented citizen participation. Its model of ecological transition by citizens has inspired many green agents across Europe. He will miss ecology and we will miss it.

I must say, however, that I am rather disappointed by your superliberal speech, because people's real question is really not how well multinationals are doing. The real question of people is: who have the power in Europe? Are they the Heads of Government, is this Parliament, or are they the multinationals and the large financial institutions? If you look at the developments of the last few days, weeks, in Italy, you can see that the financial markets also have a lot of political influence. When you say 'reduce tax', we see that the multinationals still have a great deal of influence on you every day. And it is surprising that the President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, has given us the good advice on tax avoidance, because in view of the previous discussions — and Mr Juncker's personal involvement — we had a different expectation. But he's right. It is precisely on this point that the citizens of Europe are extremely concerned. If you, as Heads of Government, allow yourself to be led entirely by multinationals, by large financial institutions, by banks, what can you expect? Then people start to become anxious, then they are indeed victims of extreme groups, especially on the right side. I think there is a factor that I haven't really heard you about at all. That is the growing inequality in Europe. Okay, in Luxembourg, income is high. But I can tell you that in many Member States, inequality between haves and port ots is increasing on a daily basis, and they see that in the European Union there are stories — like yours — that we need to reduce taxes on multinationals. How do you think that would happen in the difficult neighborhoods, in the cities? How do you think that will happen to young people in southern Europe who do not have a job? How do you think that happens to elderly people in Greece who have barely retired? That is hard language, it is a language that undoubtedly plays into the hands of populists in Europe. The European Union has a task here: to combat inequality, as organisations like the OECD say, as organisations like the IMF say. If you do that, if you, as Heads of Government, take your responsibility there, then you will do the best, including with a view to the European elections. I think there's a few things to do. You're not the only one. We have in the Netherlands a Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, a good friend of yours, who has had to admit that the dividend tax is being abolished under pressure from the multinationals. A measure which no one understands, which does not do any good to the economy, but which benefits the friends elsewhere in the world of the shareholders and the multinationals that represent it. This means that ordinary people are with higher VAT and have little and less social benefits. And then Mr Rutte says, like you, that taxes are reduced. I would like this to be a subject in the Council of Heads of Government and that, instead of serving multinationals and banks, the citizens of Europe and especially those who are struggling to return to the centre. You will then be a European, and otherwise you will simply be an extension of the multinationals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Laura AGEA", "mepid": "124811", "text": " on behalf of the EFDD Group. — (IT) (IT) (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, Mr Juncker, this series of debates on the future of Europe is likely to become something else, a debate on the past, failures and the mistakes that led the EU to collapse. If we go on like this, if you go on like this, there will be nothing left to debate. One thing is for sure: Europe's future will have to be very different from the present. Just these days a founding country, Italy, is experiencing dramatic moments. We were close to realising a dream, but we could wake up inside a nightmare. Nearly twenty million Italians, in elections on March 4, rewarded two political forces that would give birth to the government of change. Our goals are a law against corruption, putting hand to golden pensions, taking power away from lobbies, eliminating privileges, putting citizens at the centre. But this seems to not be possible: a well-orchestrated palace maneuver, with the complicity of many, from finance to strong powers, is preventing the birth of government, and just in these hours it would like it replace with an unvoted, unelected government, and that won't even have the confidence of Parliament. I ask you: is this democracy? And all this has happened with the complicity of the EU. You tried it in every way and at all levels. How can we not remember the warnings and threats of the European Commissioners? What a shame! What a misery! Even yesterday, Commissioner Oettinger told a German TV, except later apologising, that the markets will teach Italians how to vote for the right thing. You got it right: markets will teach how to vote. We are outraged and upset, and it must not be a German Commissioner to say how Italians or other European citizens must vote, either today or ever. I say it again, what a shame and what a misery! But you see, we're not even surprised. On the other hand, this European Commission has done everything but the interests of the citizens, as Mr Juncker clearly shows, its history. You have put us through as modern barbarians inside the walls of Rome, like those who want to destroy the European Union, get out of the euro, drown the markets. No, that's not the case! Yet, I address you, fellow Members, our work here in Strasbourg and Brussels is clear and evident in everyone's eyes. We tell you this clearly, once again: we do not want to destroy the European Union, nor the euro, nor the markets. Is Europe's future at risk? Yes, and it is not because of our fault, but because of this present bankruptcy that you have built. And come out of these palaces, listen to the cry of the citizens, do not be deaf, it's up to you to do your homework. Where are the eurobonds? Where are the tax transfers between surplus countries and those in deficit? And the unacceptable surplus on the current account of Germany and Holland. I take advantage of the presence of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Bettel. Why are there still tax havens in the eurozone? The present which is not working asks us to Europe, but the future must be — the citizens ask you — the future will be Europe if we call into question those treaties that see it succumb, if let's re-discuss austerity, crazy immigration management, big trade deals that hurt citizens in favour of multinationals. The Europe of the future is not the one that cuts citizens' pensions with one hand and with the other increases by 6% those of the European institutions. The Europe of the future respects the popular will and does not allow the vote of citizens to be trampled by the rating agencies, banks or the special interests of some State. Yes, it's true, you still won today. Enjoy these moments! Courage, liberists, go celebrate with the sneer and ignorance of the first of the class. You see, it's only a matter of time, and then the government of change will be born in Italy, and then more will be born across Europe.

We see it in the elimination of the freedom of speech and the demonisation of political opponents and the acceleration with regard to the EU army. We see it in the acceptance of state violence against the people of Catalonia and the opposition against democratic governments of Poland and Hungary and the sabotage of Brexit. We see it in the creation of an enemy image of Russia and of the United States of America, a long-standing ally. These are all rearguard actions of a union which already failed. Turning the EU into a Soviet-style empire will not avert its inevitable end, and it’s already showing widening cracks. It’s a union that consists of irresponsible liberals in the west and of realists in the east; of dictating money-suppliers in the north and suppressed receivers in the south. It’s a union of happy migrants that profit from our welfare state and miserable citizens who are just good enough to pay the bill but are silenced about their grievances. This union creates more problems than it solves. We have seen a debt crisis, a migrant crisis and now a crisis in political freedoms. What started as a project to progress peace through trade has deranged into a suppressive, totalitarian instrument of a globalist elite. The last fundament off this bankrupt union is the unlimited printing of money by the European Central Bank. Imagine the shock when Italy was about to install a eurosceptic government, and there again the EU showed its ugly face of dictatorship. It denied the Italian people their rightful government. This union that has sold his soul to investors in the Middle East cannot last and should not last. Turkey is turning into an Islamic society and Erdogan is overturning the achievements towards a secular state. Journalists, professors, military personnel are being jailed. Christian property is being seized. Genocide is being committed on the poorest part of the population. And firmly stands the EU to protect? No, not the values of human life, not the freedom of the secular state and rule of law. No, it stands firmly to let Turkey become a member of the EU. In the UK, Muslim grooming gangs have abused hundreds of children. They were abused, raped, some even killed, and although the authorities knew about it, they were reluctant to act – and when it finally blew out in the open, they tried to cover it up. In Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, hundreds of young girls are victim of grooming gangs – and where is the protection of our children? Where is the outrage in the EU? It’s not there. The EU does not and will not protect our children; instead it sacrifices them. The EU elite welcomes these child rapists and still does. Honest and strong men like Tommy Robinson are silenced and thrown in jail to be murdered by inmates. That is the true character of the EU. The EU has no right to a future. The EU has no future.

The European Union is trying to drown out any different views that support national policies by baptizing them populist, eurosceptic and extreme. What happened a few days ago in Italy is essentially a coup d'état with the support, if not the guidance, of Berlin and Brussels and dissolved the last pretexts that the dominant political class has been trying to keep. No, Commissioner Oettinger, the markets will not teach Italians how to vote. You, who are appointed and not elected, must learn to respect the verdict of European citizens. It seems that democracy is only good when the citizens do not decide to turn against your wishes. Today Italy is simply the last link in this long chain of anti-democratic interventions by the Union. We all remember the unacceptable and clearly blackmailed attitude of the institutions against Greece, against the will of the Greek people, as expressed in the referendum of July 2015. We also remember the ongoing attempt to overthrow Brexit, as well as the pressure that many are trying to turn into sanctions against Poland and Hungary, simply because the people decide differently from the plans of the Brussels nomenclature. With behaviour like this, you can rest assured that the days of the European Union in its present form are numbered and you will bear the burden of your responsibility.

Yes, we have already had more glorious times, and I must tell you that Brexit is a cost for all of us. As for wanting to condemn voters for the choice they made — and that is the same thing for Italy — would be a second mistake on our part. The British chose Brexit. I regret it, but I have to respect that choice. The Italians voted for what they voted, it wasn't my favorite choice, but I have to respect it. To condemn this choice and say that they have been wrong, that we want to teach them and that we, as Heads of State or Heads of Government, you as the European Parliament or as a Commission, must tell them what they have to do is not understand them and push them even more towards the extremities, whereas it is towards the center that it is necessary to try to bring them back. Yes, as Luxembourg Prime Minister — a position that has a longer life than in Italy, which is going to have its fourth Prime Minister in five years, while Jean-Claude Juncker has held this post for 19 years — I think we simply have an obligation to show what works as well. I have experienced Brexit, I have experienced the situation with Greece, I have experienced the refugee crisis, I have experienced situations for which, it is true, we have not been able to find solutions right away. Someone said this in this chamber about the crisis of immigrants and refugees: yes, we need a common solution, we need a common immigration policy. We will not find a solution as long as we believe that everyone needs to do their individual calculation and solve this problem individually. We have to do this in common. Some say that Europe is over. Let's stop doing the siren of the national thinking we'll come to a solution. This will not be achieved at the national level; only together can we do it. Mr Henkel referred to the fact that there was never a war. Today, in Ukraine, we have a conflicting situation that is still tense. Whoever thinks that Ukraine is settled, is wrong. But the only document, the only text, the only commitment I have today is that of the Normandy format, drawn up by the European leaders around the table. They were the ones who obtained commitments from the Ukrainian and Russian side. Without the European Union, I do not know where Ukraine would be today. So let us stop saying that without Europe there would be no peace. At the time, in 1945, who would have thought that 12 years later, in 1957, we would be around a table and that we would create something or want to build something together? I would like to remind you that Ukraine is right next to the European Union and does not know peace. Mr. Lamberts, let me begin by thanking you for the tribute you paid to Camille Gira — it is true that it was a shock to all of us — who was Secretary of State in my government, who had a heart attack while presenting his most important text in his legislature, which was environmental protection. For those who did not know it yet, I would like to say that the choice of the Greens to replace Camille Gira has been on your neighbour, who will leave your assembly and with whom I am already looking forward to working in my government. You and others here spoke of Luxembourg as a tax haven. Have you seen the legislation that has been drafted over the past four years? Have you read the OECD reports? Have you read the European Commission's reports? Look at the texts opposite and you will find that today's Luxembourg is no longer on a blacklist of international institutions, that Luxembourg is considered compliant, that we have done what we had to do and that the directives that had to be transposed in the field of transparency, exchange and collaboration have been transposed. For those who don't know, I want to send them a note with all the texts and all the efforts that Luxembourg has made. And let me also quote the latest studies carried out by the European Commission: 'The Commission takes note of the positive step taken by Luxembourg'. In this regard, we can mention the next transposition of a directive which will, if necessary, increase the effectiveness in the fight against aggressive tax planning structures, etc. If you think that these are mailboxes, come and see companies in Luxembourg, especially those of more than 2,000 or 3,000 people who are work in the digital sector. Mr President, I think it was Mr Lamberts who said that the Luxembourg Finance Minister was blocking some progress. We don't block to block, believe me! GAFA is not a Luxembourg file, far from it! Let us not forget that tomorrow Britain will no longer be in the European Union. It is very good, today, to make short-term calculations and say that yes, it is great, such a company leaves London and will move to Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dublin or Luxembourg. We look forward to it. But I do not want Britain tomorrow, or already today the United States, Asia or Hong Kong to become shelters for companies leaving or leaving Europe, because Europe applies taxes that do not exist elsewhere. Therefore, let us act at the OECD level. We know that the OECD is working on this, so let us have the tools we want, but at the widest possible level. Nobody talked about the financial transaction tax. Nobody touched on this topic today. If some want this tax, let them apply it. In Luxembourg, we are not against this tax, but let us apply it at an international level. Let's stop wanting to penalize our own continent! Europe is between Asia and the United States, two blocks that are our direct competitors. So let's do something on our side for our attractiveness, for our industry, for our economy, for our finances. Therefore, I want to tell you that Luxembourg fully agrees — and everyone has said it here, be it Jean-Claude Juncker, be it you — to impose the GAFA. It is not acceptable that companies do not pay taxes. We are the first to say they have to pay for it, but let us try to prevent them from going elsewhere on this continent tomorrow to escape tax and our country from losing jobs and tax revenues. Mr. Weber spoke about the rule of law and freedom of the press. These are fundamental elements of our European Union. If we believe that freedom of the press or the rule of law are ancillary, would we reduce Europe to what? Just finance? Just to the economy? Just free trade? In 1957, the basis of the European Union, which I described to you earlier, was to want to bring peoples together, to get closer, to have values to share. These values, they were not pecuniary, they were also human. I know that there are discussions at the European Council level, and you will surely have some here about the Structural Funds. Should the Structural Funds be linked to this point as well? I just want to warn you. If it is done only in a certain country, its leader will say: “I no longer have Erasmus grants, I no longer have aid for farmers, Brussels has decided”. Do we not risk provoking a reaction that will be contrary to what we want? In other words, the leader of this country will have even more ease, in his capital, to explain to his farmer and student, to the one who hitherto received European aid, that he will no longer have them because “Brussels” decided that it was not in line with what they, the Brussels-people with whom he has nothing to do, have in mind, because a particular beneficiary does not fit into the scheme imposed by 'Brussels'. I'm a supporter of other systems. When something doesn't work, it's because our rules are not good. We see today that Article 7 does not work because we need unanimity. If they are two, there will always be one that will support the other. I think it is better, in this case, to tell the politician who arrives at Brussels will not have the right to vote at the next European Council. Or we have to find rules that hurt politicians, those responsible, so that they themselves say that, given their decisions, given the state of the situation in their country, that they are punished, but not their people directly, because we risk strengthening the anti-European sentiment among this population. As far as the rule of law is concerned, I know that the European Commission has threatened to refer the matter to the Court of First Instance and the Court. I hope that this is not going to happen, and I trust Frans Timmermans to continue explaining to the countries concerned that the rule of law is something very important to us. A number of parliamentarians talked about social Europe. We are not talking enough about social Europe. It is a Liberal who tells you that. There is not enough talk about social Europe. One of the causes of Brexit, one of the causes of the rise of some anti-European parties, is that citizens feel that Europe is not touching them. That is why we must explain today that, thanks to the Posting of Workers Directive, we are trying to create a more social Europe with a number of points. You know that President Juncker is very committed to social Europe. I am very pleased that in Gothenburg we had a meeting with European leaders to make progress on this issue. Forgetting social Europe would be as serious as forgetting that we have a Europe of values. We need a social Europe as much as a Europe of values, a democratic Europe. Someone also talked about foreign policy earlier. Europe must have a foreign policy if it does not want to lose its place on the international stage. As a continent, it represents the most important economic force in the world. But I have the impression that we have complexes. If a continent says something, we, as a European continent, are reduced to react. We do not anticipate. European foreign policy is essential if we have the ambition to make ourselves heard on the international stage in this area. I think that the move to majority voting will be necessary. Today, any country can block any progress. If we are unable to agree, it is not possible that 500 million citizens will be deprived of a common position because one country has decided to block. Today we are caught in vice. The greatest fear of our citizens is insecurity, it is Iran, it is what is happening in Syria, it is what is happening around us. If we ourselves are unable to have a common position and say what we want to do, we have already lost all the place we intend to have in a debate dealing with the stabilization of international relations. With regard to investment and reform of the euro area, we believe it is important for Parliament to play a central role, particularly in the redesign of the euro area. But to say right now that we need a euro area minister or not need one is the same as institutional issues, nobody asked me about it. What matters right now is having a euro working. Mr Henkel criticised the euro, but I think that without the euro our situation today would be more delicate. But we agree on an analysis, Mr Henkel. If Italy is doing well economically, it is good for all of us. If Italy is not doing well economically, it is not good for this country, but it is not good for any of us either. In any case, I would like to thank you for this first round of questions. Again, those who think that they have before them a Europhile who finds everything perfect, who lives in a dream or who imagines that everything is going well are mistaken. I have very diverse origins. Most of you don't know. I have a Russian grandmother who was Orthodox, I have a Polish grandfather who was Jewish, I have a Luxembourg grandfather who was Catholic and a French grandmother who was an atheist.

Following the announcement of the UK's exit from the European Union at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, we have a series of debates on the future of Europe with the participation of the presidents and prime ministers of the Member States. We hear about many ideas for sanctioning our organization — most often technical ones. But you need to pay attention to the basis, which is the foundation of the European Union. It's no doubt the Christianity that the founding fathers alluded to — Robert Schuman, Alcide De Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer. Today we only hear about the Communist-Altiero Spinelli, who demanded the liquidation of nation-states. And the other thing — democracy. The talk was about internet companies.

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the many speakers who have asked questions about Luxembourg, and in some cases I will allow myself to answer them in telegraph style. But I missed one topic because very few Members have raised it, is digital. Some have talked about the future or questioned the challenges of the future, but very few asked me about the digital strategy at European level. But it will be a challenge, which today is economic, but it will be a social challenge tomorrow if we are not ready to make efforts at the level of the digital single market and if we do not reduce the divide in the digital market at European level with 28 legislations, 28 regulators and a common market that does not exist at this level. Tomorrow will be digital. I remember, when I was in the presidency, some MEPs asked me whether it was a chance to seize or a danger. It is a chance if we are ready and it is a danger if we are not. And we'll be ready only if we manage to make this deal at twenty-eight together. Mr President, some Members have told me about Schengen and the situation in their country in this regard. I support them in their efforts to join the Schengen area. I think they have a willingness to access free movement. But on the other hand, I must say that we currently have — both at enlargement and Schengen level — prerequisites which must push us to move forward quickly, so that these countries arrive in an area where the rules we give ourselves work. Today we do not have a common migration policy. For someone who is in the Schengen area, we do not have a rule, everyone has their own rules. So I would like to see people quickly come to have rules that work to explain to people that this Schengen area works. Because if the message is right, we enlarge Schengen, we enlarge the European Union, but if we don't try to make it work better, I do not know if the message will be properly understood. But we must, as soon as possible, open the Schengen area to these countries, as I have just said. Mrs in't Veld spoke about institutional issues. Do not take it wrong, Mrs in't Veld, but believe me, citizens are making fun of whether we have a finance minister or whether the President of the Council and the European Commission is the same. They don't laugh! Today they want to know how security works, whether tomorrow they can get a job, whether they have rights in their country, freedom of the press, freedom of expression. But institutional questions, whether we have transnational lists or not, is a bubble in Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg. Be aware that it is really not the daily concern of most citizens and that they have other questions and expectations of the European institutions than to wonder how they will work tomorrow. We'll have to do it. And I think if we are more efficient, we will work better. But to believe that this is a priority is, in my opinion, not the right direction. We talked about the rule of law, and one Member of the European Parliament also talked about the Structural Funds. As I said earlier, I believe that linking the rule of law to the Structural Funds is likely to have an opposite effect. By stating that if the rule of law is not respected, the Structural Funds will be cut, we risk having on the backs of farmers, students, industries and workers who are working and who, today, can benefit from the Structural Funds. If we tell them “We will cut them tomorrow”, we will push them to the extremes, which will say “Brussels and Strasbourg have decided that we will not receive anything anymore”. I therefore believe that we must find more effective mechanisms that work, and, in fact, above all, punish politics rather than at the end, the citizen, because we would only reinforce him in his idea that Brussels and Strasbourg decide for him. You talked about Brexit. For Brexit, I hope we move forward. I had made a little description to explain how Brexit worked, starting by remembering that at the time they were in the family, They were in but they wanted to have a lot of opt-outs. Now they are out and they want a lot of opt-ins. It's reality. I think what's important is above all to keep a level playing field. It is not that we want to sanction Britain, but if today we tolerate cherry picking and Britain can choose the benefits without the constraints, without having certain obligations, we will favour a situation in which every state can say: I, too, want a Europe like Great Britain. Therefore, we must have common rules and we must tell Britain that we cannot have just one without having the other. Whistleblowers, we talked about them. Luxembourg is one of the first countries to have legislation on whistleblowers — it was already in 2011 — and the recent ruling of the Court of Cassation confirms the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Some have talked about taxation. As I have told you, Luxembourg has made considerable efforts and the negotiations on the common base — some have also raised the question of corporate tax — within the Council are still very far from over. Many technical issues remain to be clarified, and we are also constructively involved in this work, particularly with a view to determining the impact of these two proposals on national budgets. You cannot say “We do it” without knowing what the impact will be. We need to have all the necessary information. But what has been very important for me is to know that substantial progress has been made in combating aggressive tax planning also at the internal market level. We are talking about social dumping in Europe, but we must also talk about tax dumping. I am the first to want to stop a race down where the challenge would be to know who will have the lowest rate in Europe. How do you want us to explain to our fellow citizens that some companies always pay less taxes? Earlier, Mr Weber talked about citizens. Of course, if we give citizens the impression that a society is not paying taxes when they have to pay taxes, we will once again provoke them. This will lead to a breakdown of politics, which will lead to political crises that we ourselves will have caused by accepting tax dumping. On the other hand, one of which is very little talked about is environmental dumping. Today, together with the United States, has decided to leave the Paris Agreement. Perhaps one day it would be useful to discuss the criteria for environmental lists and to draw up a black list of states that do not meet the criteria that are our heritage at home. Some people have said in this chamber — I think it was Mr Lamberts — that heritage is not bought in a supermarket. It's a common heritage. We speak “social”, we speak “tax”, but we often forget that there is environmental dumping today, because some countries do not want to comply with certain rules for economic reasons. Some have asked what my visions were for youth. I told you earlier, it feels like everything is granted. We have a problem at the political level. I often hear many politicians say that all that is going well is thanks to them, but when something goes wrong, it is Brussels's fault, when they forget that Brussels is themselves. They are the ones who sit on the Council, it is their country that sits on the Commission, it is their MEPs who sit in the Chamber. They forget that since the Treaty of Lisbon, national parliaments have more power. It is so easy to say, when it's wrong, 'it's the fault of... it's a directive, it is a regulation, it is Brussels that imposes it on on', whereas Brussels is Mrs Merkel, Mr Macron, or myself, it is the MEPs of their country and they are the Commissioners. But it is easy to reason as if Brussels was a bit like an alien with whom we have nothing to do with, and Brussels decides for us. You know, without wanting criticising colleagues in Britain is very hard, when we circulate a message from Monday to Saturday saying that we do not like Europe, to ask people on Sundays to vote for the European Union. I come back to the question of young people. They are the cornerstone of the European Union. We must ensure that young people are once again passionate about Europe. Erasmus is an important element. When I go to a school and talk about Europe, I explain that I knew the borders when I was a student in Thessaloniki and went to Turkey, or to the country whose capital is Skopje, or Bulgaria. At the time, there were borders that I did not know as a Luxembourger. As a Luxembourgish, I took my car, I didn't even know if I was in Germany, France or Belgium. I didn't ask myself that question. Today, a young person no longer knows that there were border crossings. He only knew the euro. He travels without a passport. He leaves without the need for Form E 411, the form we had at the time for medical care. Today I have rights abroad, I can go to study in another country, I can get married there, I can give birth, vote, work, retire, I can live in a Member State other than mine. I no longer pay roaming fees when I am abroad. All this is acquired. Today, young people do not realize that it is people who are at the root of all this. Recognition of diplomas is also one of these achievements. So let us remember what we have managed to build since 1957. Today, let me say again, the European project — which some here have criticised — is above all a peace project. Who would have thought in 1957 that we could put French and Germans side by side? That those who were killing each other a few years earlier would want to build a joint project? So, Mr President, I will put all my energy at the service of this European ideal. We have the impression that everything is granted, but believe me, rights, freedoms, peace have nothing obvious, nothing easy and nothing acquired.

I am referring to Colombia's entry into NATO — the only Latin American country to achieve it — the trade agreement concluded with the European Union, but above all, the historic peace agreement that you, President Santos, managed to conclude with the FARC after more than half a century of conflict. This earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016. The European Union has always supported the peace process politically and economically. This will continue to be the case in the future. The first round of the presidential elections, held last Sunday, took place for the first time without violence. This is very positive. The European Union must be more present and contribute with investment and economic diplomacy so that no steps are taken backwards, to continue on the path of peace, economic growth and poverty reduction, because the stability efforts made by the Santos Government and the Colombians are at risk because of the worrying situation in Venezuela. Colombia, like other countries in the region, was facing the largest displacement of people ever recorded in Latin America; there was a risk that the situation would worsen and a real refugee crisis would be reached. The European Parliament therefore called for urgent assistance to the countries concerned and announced that it would send a delegation to border posts to assess the situation.

Last Sunday, just three days ago, the first round elections were held in Colombia to elect my successor to the presidency of the Republic. There we were accompanied by a multiparty committee of the European Parliament — made up of eight MEPs — and a mission of electoral experts from the European Union, who were able to verify the vitality, plurality and transparency that today characterize Colombian democracy. Two candidates obtained the majority of the votes, and among them Colombians will decide on June 17 who will preside over the nation's destiny until August 7, 2022. These were not ordinary elections, as were not the parliamentary elections last March. These are the first elections, after more than half a century, that we have without the threat and interference posed by the internal armed conflict with the FARC guerrillas, the largest and oldest in the Americas. They were also the safest, most transparent elections, with greater guarantees, with more observers, and most importantly, with the greatest participation in our history. Even my most staunch opponents say it. Seeing Rodrigo Londoño, formerly alias “Timochenko”, former FARC commander and today head of his political party, voting for the first time says it all. (Applause) That, ladies and gentlemen, makes a big difference, and that is why this time the candidates' discussions focused on issues such as education, health, pensions, citizen security or taxes, and no longer — as had happened for so many years — in the absurd war we were suffering. I am not here to tell you that Colombia has already achieved complete peace, because it is not the case. There remains the threat of a last guerrilla, much smaller than the FARC, the ELN, with which we are currently holding peace dialogues in Havana, and there are also organized crime groups dedicated to the dire drug trafficking business. But the achievement of the FARC's demobilization and disarmament, and its constitution as a political party — without prejudice to the fact that its leaders and principals must submit to a transitional justice process — has fundamentally changed our country's outlook and perspective. And whoever my successor is, this progress towards peace is definitive. It's irreversible. Not only because our own Constitutional Court ordered it, but because it is the word committed by the Colombian State. It is also a commitment to the international community. Never in the history of the United Nations, for example, had the Security Council unanimously adopted so many resolutions in favor of a process. Because, as Secretary General Guterres said at the last assembly, Colombia is the only good news the world had today. But it is irreversible especially because no one wants to return to the horror of war. Ladies and gentlemen, in a world where intolerance and confrontation between societies and nations remains a constant one, it is great news that in Colombia — a country with more than 50 million inhabitants and all the potential to make a positive contribution to humanity — an armed conflict has been brought to an end that left more than 8 million people victims and more than 270 000 dead. In a world where some continue to privilege the arms option over dialogue and coexistence, it is good to be able to tell you that the weapons that so many Colombians wielded against Colombians are now being converted into monuments to peace. Because without peace there is no society that can achieve real development. A little more than two weeks ago, in the convent of Assisi in your country, Mr President, in Italy, I had the pleasant opportunity to hand over to German Chancellor Angela Merkel the lamp of peace bestowed upon her by the Franciscan community, which protects Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron of peace of the Catholic Church. A recognition of high symbolism that I also had the honor of receiving the year 2016. And that day I recalled — as I would like to recall here today — the legacy of coexistence that the European Union represents for the world. Well, the Norwegian Committee summed it up when it granted you Europeans the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012: it said that its most important achievement — that of you — has been the successful struggle for peace and reconciliation, and for democracy and human rights. In this, Europe has been an example, and that example must continue to illuminate the path of humanity. Because only peace and reconciliation, only democracy and respect for human rights can counter the harmful influence of nationalism, fundamentalism, racism, populism and intolerance. (Applause) And I cannot imagine a better scenario than this to thank the European Union and the nations that make it up for their determined and permanent support for our peace process, and for this complex phase that we are now facing, which is that of the post-conflict. We are accompanied by the European Union in the search for the supreme good of any society, such as peace. And we greatly appreciate the work of your special envoy Eamon Gilmore, not only during the negotiation process but also now, in the implementation phase of the agreement. A year and a half ago, in Brussels, the European Union Trust Fund to Support the Post-Conflict in Colombia was created, with an initial capital of €95 million. Some 62 million euros have already been committed to various projects, such as the case, for example, the Nasa indigenous community in the south of the country, which already exported, thanks to this contribution, its first container of coffee to Europe. Or another project, for example, for smallholder farmers in areas recovered from conflict, who have been able to achieve bio-certification of their products, thus increasing their income by at least 15 per cent. The European Union has also offered €400 million of reimbursable cooperation through the European Investment Bank. And it has committed another €85 million in cooperation programmes for humanitarian demining, for sustainable development, for the fight against climate change, innovation, technology, education, human rights... Look at this very encouraging fact: thanks to the end of the armed conflict with the FARC, and to cooperation international that you are giving us, Colombia went from being the second country with the most victims caused by anti-personnel mines to today and the tenth. And we're going down. We have 673 municipalities planted with anti-personnel mines and we have already been able to declare 225 — the third part — as mine-free. You can't imagine what this means for the peasants of those sidewalks, who can now travel their land and work their plots without fear! And we hope to reach 2021 as a totally mine-free country. This is how we are moving forward — with difficulties, of course, but with firm step and with the European Union — in the construction of peace that follows the signing of the peace agreement. Because it is one thing to silence the rifles and stop bleeding and stop the deaths resulting from the conflict. And another, even larger task, is reconciliation of hearts and ensuring opportunities for progress for millions of families who suffered the consequences of violence. Only in this way can a stable and lasting peace be consolidated. And for this purpose you, Europe, have been a great ally of Colombia. Thank you for your accompaniment! Thank you for your support! Our country offers the international community, in retribution, a successful model of the peace process. In a world full of unresolved conflicts, Colombia's peace process has become a laboratory that can be useful in attempting solutions in other scenarios. Ours was a sui generis process because it was not limited to establishing the conditions for the end of the armed confrontation — as is the usual — but focused on asserting victims' rights, the rights to truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition, and implementing — and this is very important — development in the areas most affected by the conflict. That is, more than an end of war pact, it was a pact of humanity and development, a fairer, more inclusive development that focused on the victims of that war. The peace agreement establishes a comprehensive system for the fulfillment of victims' rights, including a Commission for the Clarification of the Truth, a Unit for the Search of Missing persons and a transitional justice system that — experts say — is a model for the world, being the first time that a peace settlement has been made under the umbrella of the Rome Statute. And, in any peace process, one of the most difficult aspects is to harmonize society's demand for justice — that is, sentiment — with society's desire for confrontation to stop. The eternal dilemma between justice and peace! Our challenge was to achieve a transitional justice system that would guarantee maximum justice without sacrificing peace, respecting our Constitution, respecting our international treaties, such as the Rome Statute. And I think we've made it. Colombia is now warning a new dawn, a much better future without the burden of armed conflict. But we know it's just the beginning of a long way. In addition to the implementation of the end-of-conflict agreement with the FARC — which is in itself long and complex — we have another challenge ahead, an immense challenge: building peace in the minds and hearts of Colombians, who are used for so long to hate and disqualify the adversary. We are grieving by the murders of social leaders, human rights defenders, representatives of victims, ex-combatants, which have occurred after the signing of the peace agreement, and I would like to assure you here that the Colombian State is committed to clarifying these cases and to curbing this situation. We created — and it is working — a National Guarantee Commission, which I myself chair, to coordinate actions to protect communities and their leaders among the various institutions. Forty per cent of the cases reported to the Office of the Attorney-General have already been clarified and we are determined to continue to make progress to punish those responsible and that no more murders occur. That is today our greatest challenge as a society: to learn to recognize the other, learn to live together within the difference, to learn to process disputes without violence, something you — in Europe — have made positive progress in. I am optimistic, because I know that the values of unity, love, tolerance, compassion are more powerful than the countervalues of fear, hatred, revenge, exclusion. This is a universal truth, applicable not only in Colombia, but throughout the world, for example, in the fight against terrorism or managing the migrants' crisis. I said that when I received the Nobel Peace Prize and today I want to repeat it in this emblematic auditorium of a continent that has given the world a lesson of unity within diversity. Human beings have to understand that, beyond all differences, beyond all nuances, in the end we are one people and one race: of all colors, of all beliefs and all preferences. Our people, ladies and gentlemen, is called the world. And our race is called... humanity! (Applause) I cannot fail to refer to a problem that concerns us all: drug trafficking. The Colombian conflict would have ended much earlier without the fuel that was meant by the illicit drug business. This cursed business is behind violence, corruption and crime almost all over the planet, and we have to recognize that the so-called “war on drugs” — which has been declared in the United Nations itself for more than half a century — we have not won nor are we winning it. I say this as a representative of a nation that has perhaps been the biggest victim of this bloody business, which took away our best soldiers and policemen, our best judges and journalists, great political leaders. The way in which the war on drugs is being waged is equal or even more harmful than all the wars that are being fought together in the world today. That is why not only is it indispensable, but it is reasonable to change our strategy. We need to find ways to hit more effectively the strongest links in the drug trafficking chain, the big mafias, those who launder assets, those who produce inputs, rather than continue to chase farmers or addicts themselves. There are more people in U.S. prisons for drug-related crimes than all those in Europe's prison population. Anti-drug policy with an exclusively punitive and repressive approach has failed. Until we find more effective common strategies, the drug business will continue to undermine the health of our young people, the morale of our societies and the governance of our countries. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have come to Strasbourg, to the seat of the European Parliament, to share with you the reality of Colombia and to thank you, heartily, for your support for our present and our future. Between Europe and Colombia, there are increasing ties and fewer barriers between Europe and Latin America. August will mark five years since the implementation of the EU-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which has benefited our economies and strengthened our trade and investment ties. And I also want to thank and acknowledge the big step taken in exempting Colombians from the Schengen visa requirement, which has contributed to more tourism, more business, more integration between Colombia and Europe, and more dignity for Colombians. I give you only this fact: while in 2015 340,000 Colombians traveled to Schengen countries, last year more than 550,000 did so. That is the world we want: a world with more bridges and fewer walls, a world of solidarity where friendship flourishes, where cooperation flourishes, a world of open arms and hearts. And speaking of cooperation and integration, this afternoon, in Paris, I will sign with the Secretary General of the OECD, in front of President Macron, the agreement that protocol the decision of this organization to admit Colombia as its thirty-seventh member. (Applause) This is a very important achievement, which I share with the European nations that endorsed and supported our income, and that will ensure that our country meets the highest standards in governance practices, economic and social policies. We are also the first Latin American State to become that category called 'NATO's global partner', which tomorrow I will also formalize in Brussels. And I give my successor, in just over two months, a country without armed conflict with the FARC; a country with less poverty, with more equality, with more jobs, with more and better education, with a health system that now has universal coverage, with much better infrastructure, and a country committed to taking care of our extraordinary biodiversity . And how good to be able to leave this legacy! And I conclude by recalling Robert Schuman's words in his famous 1950 declaration: “World peace cannot be safeguarded without creative efforts comparable to the dangers that threaten it.” In Colombia and in Europe we are making these “creative efforts” and that is why I am here today, before you, to ratify our willingness to work, to work for peace, but above all to say thank you, thank you very much! , to the generous European people.

I quote figures from Irish agriculture from last year, where cattle and sheep farmers were entirely reliant on the payment for their income. What that means is that if they didn’t have the payment they would be working for nothing. It’s a very stark reality, and therefore we do have to press that the budget for agriculture is not slashed in the coming review of the Multiannual Financial Framework.  Added to that, we want to support young farmers. One of my concerns is that the young farmer payment goes to the landowner from whom the land is rented and not directly to the young farmer.

So the cake is bigger, but still we have less for the two most important areas.  So why? Well, the answer is that priorities are changing. What used to be core common policy – feeding the population – has been replaced with a common policy on defence. The budget Commissioner, Gunter Oettinger, was at least open as to why agriculture was to be cut when he said that there are more important areas.

This is an important issue which concerns not only visas and residence permits, but also the broader issue of European citizenship. The granting of citizenship and long-stay visas by a Member State falls under national competences, and as a consequence, these matters are not governed by EU law. However, the consequences deriving from decisions by one or more EU Member States frequently have an impact on all the others. Therefore, I would like to thank you for drawing the attention to this topic. Third-country nationals who benefit from a citizenship or residence-by-investment scheme, commonly referred to… (Disturbance in the Chamber) …as golden visas, are usually entitled to reside, live and work in the territory of the European Union Member State granting the permit. At the same time, they can also benefit from the Schengen area residence permit and the citizenship of the Member State. Fundamental privileges and rights are attached to the European Union citizenship and residency permits in an EU Member State. The golden visa programmes matter because they might offer the possibility of misuse or are sometimes perceived as potentially weakening the fight against corruption in the European Union and its neighbouring countries. For this reason, when defining national legislation, each Member State should not only take into account international and Union law but also the essence of EU citizenship and its inherent value. The protection of European Union citizenship is our joint responsibility, shared among all Member States and institutions. The European Union, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have already expressed their views about these developments. In your resolution of 16 January 2014 on EU citizenship for sale, you called on Member States to recognise and live up to the responsibilities they hold in safeguarding the values and objectives of the Union. Let me also recall that, in its conclusions on the EU citizenship report of 2017, the Council addressed this issue. It invited all Member States to act in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation and respect the limits set out by the Court of Justice when granting or removing nationality. It is also very relevant that the Commission announced its intention to produce a report on national schemes granting EU citizenship to investors. The Commission is expected to describe current national law and practices as well as its action in this area and provide some guidance for Member States. This report could help us to have a better overview and understanding about existing practices. It will also help the Council to revert to this issue if necessary. I am looking forward to hearing from Commissioner Bulc on the subject. Let me conclude by restating the obvious. Member States are solely responsible for defining the applicable rules in this area, but because of the rights conferred by EU citizenship, we all care. EU citizenship is not and should not become a tradable commodity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 119, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank you for tabling this debate today. It covers issues that go to the core of EU values, of EU citizenship, and of the duty of sincere cooperation inside our Union. The Commission takes seriously the need to safeguard the essence of EU citizenship. While it is for each Member State to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of its nationality, this must be done in full respect of Union law. Member States should award citizenship in a spirit of sincere cooperation with other Member States. This involves fully recognising that the conferral of their nationality means conferral of EU citizenship and the rights and advantages this brings with it. EU citizenship is the entry door for the internal market. If one Member State does not apply the necessary security and criminality checks, then this can affect all of us. It is for Member States to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to counter security risks. They must also apply rigorous criteria to identify and then combat criminality and corruption. With these points in mind, I can assure you that the Commission is closely monitoring citizenship investor schemes in the EU and their applicants. In the 2017 EU Citizenship Report, the Commission announced that it would publish a report on national schemes granting EU citizenship to investors in 2018, and we will do so in autumn. As regards golden visas, in the absence of harmonisation at EU level, the Commission has no competence on the issuing of residence permits or long-stay visas for investors. Member States are competent to set the procedures and conditions of entry and stay for third-country nationals who wish to invest in the country and stay for longer than 90 days. The effects of such residence permits are largely confined in the granting Member State. They do not entitle the holder to reside outside the issuing Member State, and the short-term travel possibilities are limited to up to 90 days in any 180-day period, in line with Schengen rules. The issue is, however, being analysed in the context of the Commission’s fitness check of the legal migration legislation. The results should be made available in the second half of 2018. Where allegations of fraud and criminal activities arise, it is for the national competent authorities to investigate, be they law enforcement authorities or judicial authorities. The Commission has no competence to intervene directly on allegations of fraud or criminal activities, except in cases where the EU budget is affected. Member States must diligently conduct those investigations, including by applying the provisions of EU law on the prevention of the use of the Union financial system for the purpose of laundering money. I know that many of you are concerned about the possible link between citizenship-for-sale golden visa schemes and money laundering. These schemes indeed may be a factor that facilitates the injection of illicit money into the licit economy of the Member State. Thanks to the efforts of Parliament, the new Anti-Money Laundering Directive includes a specific provision addressing the need for better screening of applicants to national schemes for granting long-term residence or citizenship to investors. This specific provision requires all obliged entities, including banks, members of the professions or wealth managers, to pay close attention and perform enhanced due diligence checks when they are dealing with a third-country national who applies for residence rights or citizenship in exchange for capital transfer, purchase of property or government bonds or investment in corporate entities in that Member State. The Commission now expects all Member States to comply with the new rules as soon as possible and will monitor the implementation of the Directive. Integrity and the fight against corruption in Member States are key priorities for the Commission. As I have already set out, while the Commission has no competence to intervene directly on allegations of fraud or criminal activities, we expect national authorities, be they law enforcement or judicial bodies, to tackle this vigorously. National anti-corruption policies are monitored at EU level. In the framework of the European Semester, the Commission is closely following the functioning of the Member States’ judicial systems, their fight against money laundering and their fight against corruption. All Member States are subject to an ongoing assessment of their general anti-corruption policy landscape and anti-corruption efforts. In March 2018, corruption was indeed identified in several countries. In the Country-Specific Recommendations published on 23 May, recommendations on corruption-related issues were proposed for the following countries: the Czech Republic, Malta, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy and Latvia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 120, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "f'isem il-group PPE. — Il-popli li li nirrappreżentaw huma massba dwar in-nuqqas ta' sigurtà, il-kriminalità u l-- asil tal-flus.

According to Transparency International, such practices are carried out by at least 11 Member States of the EU, and that is of great concern. Golden visa programmes are not exclusively a national matter, but an EU matter too. We talk about the safety of the Schengen area and our citizens. How can our Member States justify on the one hand refusing to accept a single refugee fleeing war or persecution, whilst on the other being more than willing to give citizenships to potential criminals who bring a lot of money through investments, without knowing what their real background is? EU citizenships should not be for sale. Most systems for obtaining golden visas lack transparency and accountability, especially in the decision—making process. Lack of control risks potential money laundering practices and links to criminal financing for such investments. The EU must ensure that residency and citizenship by investment schemes do not undermine the EU core values of freedom, security and justice, nor threaten the principle of sincere cooperation between the Member States. We strongly call on the European Commission to prepare proper legislation on obligatory reviews of investors and provide very clear criteria for obtaining such golden visas.

Who really peeled off in these countries the issue of such Schengen so-called golden visas or temporary residence permits or passports? It is usually peeled off by a relatively narrow circle of people connected with the financial world in these countries, albeit with the development of real estate, and they earn in reality an overvalue that does not belong to them, because not only property is sold for investment purposes, but also the entrance to the Schengen territory or the British Commonwealth. And this is what many people here, in this building, like the classic Marx, who calls it a superficial value, so a thing, a value that doesn't actually belong to these entrepreneurs. By contrast, investors who come inside the European Union with these, being both owners of this money, and often merely representing or trustees, do not come with pure purposes. And all of this in general contributes to both money laundering and corruption in the European Union, and all these processes that are among them are undesirable in the European Union. Special cases are then that you sell citizenship. This not only changes the attitude to European Union citizenship as a value, but also actually makes it possible to find ourselves in a situation where we suddenly find out that there are Maltese or Cypriot citizens who actually get on US sanctions lists and cause us problems, also developing business in another European Union in the country.

The first thing I was going to say was that if I were – let’s take a random example – a Russian oligarch and I had some criminal money that I would like to park somewhere, then I would be really delighted to hear the response of the Council and the Commission here today. Because while we are very busy building ‘Fortress Europe’ for people who want to come here to work, we’re actually rolling out the red carpet for certain other people who want to come here, get residency permits and citizenship for themselves and for their family. This is not just about state facilitated corruption and money—laundering, and I repeat that – state facilitated corruption and money—laundering – as that’s what we’re talking about, but we’re also talking about importing a security risk. I don’t even need to mention what’s going on in Moscow—on—Thames, where Russian oligarchs are bumping each other off apparently, but we’ve also seen that there is a very real risk for people who are investigating this, like the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, and also like whistle—blowers who are exposing these practices, because – let’s be honest – this is just a big scam.  This is not just in some countries that were mentioned by you, Madam Commissioner, which got a red flag near their names. Even in a country like mine, we have so—called investor schemes and it all looks nice at the front door. But if you look at the back door there’s one big weak spot and that’s the screening of the applicants, because we know that we are dealing with countries of origin which are known for their corrupt systems. How are we going to verify if the candidates are legit, if we can trust them, if the money is not criminal money? How are we going to verify that this is not serious?  Therefore I very much agree with the proposals by Tanja Fajon. We do need European standards, European rules. We need a common scheme. And we do need the European Commission to bring forward legislative proposals, because I don’t want to hear anymore ‘we have no competence’. You know, you’re legislating in all sorts of areas, concluding agreements where there is no legal basis either. And this is a very serious matter because there are people here who buy passports, not on the black market but legally from governments. I’m very curious to hear from the European Commission, because you say you are closely monitoring the situation and there will be a report in full, but I really would like to hear a little bit more about it, because it’s become a very, very urgent matter since the situation in Malta last year.  We also need more transparency from the Member States because it’s just not acceptable anymore, with everything that’s going on, that Member States are saying ‘oh no, this is a national matter, we’re not giving out any information on this’. This is about people coming into our European Union, getting EU citizenship, benefiting from all the rights that EU citizens and EU residents have. We have a right to know. So the argument that this is a national competence to cover up criminal activities is simply not good enough anymore. We need harmonised rules. We need harmonised standards for the screening procedures. We need more transparency. We need more information. But, finally, I also think that we need to stop applying double standards because, as I already mentioned, people who want to come to the European Union to work are treated like criminals, and those who want to come here and park their criminal money are received like kings. If you’re an EU citizen affected by Brexit, for example, because you happen to live in a country that you do not have the citizenship of, then you’re in big difficulty, but if you’re a Russian oligarch, or a Chinese oligarch, then you’re fine, if you have money.  We need to stop applying double standards. This is something that we cannot explain to our citizens anymore. Our citizens don’t care about national competence or EU competence. They want to know that EU citizenship is for EU citizens and not for criminals.

Many examples connected to illicit financing, especially coming from Russia, certainly support this claim.

EU passports should only be issued to applicants who have spent sufficient time in a Member State and can demonstrate that they are integrated in its society. We should not treat the EU like a supermarket, where passports can simply be purchased.

I very much welcome the fact that we are having this debate today. She's overdue, and this is the right moment. Possession of citizenship increasingly decides what life a person can lead. Anyone who is supposed to be members of a nation has now become part of often shameful political debates. For various reasons, people are being robbed of the opportunity to stay permanently in other countries, even if this would be necessary for reasons of political persecution or economic hardship. This debate is being held loudly. Yes, in some Member States, defence seekers has become a political business model. At the same time, another practice was quietly established: people can very well find permanent stay, you just need to have the necessary financial resources. Almost half of the Member States have such programmes. The layout is different, but the principle applies everywhere: it is not the need that decides, but the financial capacity. All the barriers created by individual Member States against immigration are suddenly devoid of purpose, and the principles that have been invoked for them are suddenly no longer valid. This is scandalous. The fact that most states are still engaged in this matter offensively only makes things worse. These practices deserve European attention.

We have to make a distinction between residence and citizenship. If citizenship is granted, we may also have to make a distinction between national citizenship and citizenship of the Union, and we must say that citizenship quickly does not yet give access to European citizenship.

I think we should see that citizenship business has now become a multi-billion-dollar global market over which, in essence, no one has control.

But governments also promise tax benefits, access to the European internal market and social benefits. However, those who obtain EU citizenship in this way do not undergo any serious national security due diligence. This will also open the way to the European Union for people who want to leave their country, for example, because they are involved in money laundering, tax evasion or corruption transactions, or want to pursue such activities within the European Union. Since this is a complex and sensitive issue, S&D has already urged the Commission to look at this problem horizontally, in context and not just focusing on one Member State. It is true, of course, that there are procedural differences between individual Member States. In the vast majority of the Member States concerned, the state itself carries out this procedure, but in Hungary, for example, they gave the business into the hands of private companies specialised in this regard, which significantly increased the threat of corruption and security policy threats. This is particularly disgusting in the case of a country that does not want to accept any refugee while selling almost twenty thousand settlement bonds.

Under globalisation, direct investment is being sucked away from the smaller peripheral economies towards the centre of the larger economic systems. Through ‘golden’ schemes, smaller economies seek to attract investment to their territory by giving a personal stake in it to agents having some control over investment flows. Obviously these persons will have their reasons for joining ‘golden’ schemes – some acceptable and others not. We have hysterical claims even here by some who, whiter than snow, insist that this is an abuse of European citizenship and that it promotes criminality. The truth is that most states have practised, or now practise, some form of ‘golden’ scheme. Most do it in a non-programmed way, at least on the outside: the schemes lack rules; decisions are informal and announcements are hidden, so nobody protests. Do—gooders and parts of the international media attack only those countries like Malta and Cyprus which have open, advertised programmes. Speaking for Malta, the process of assessing applicants for its ‘golden’ scheme is extremely rigorous. I asked to see how it is done and I was impressed – and still am – by its rigour. Yes, mistakes may be made. When detected they are corrected. Whoever here knows to the contrary, let him or her submit cases, not wild accusations.

And then it is essential that the residence permit itself be subject to strict criteria, particularly from the point of view of examining the criminal record and, of course, the background of the people who apply for it. That has been done, so is communication to the European Union. But from that point on, we cannot enter into this drift that everything that is granting a residence permit and even, in certain cases, nationality, fulfilled the common requirements and conditions, is something that cannot be done by the Member States. It is interesting to note that many states that are doing nothing to welcome refugees are here invoking refugees to be against these programmes. This is the case of Holland, Mrs. In't Veld, where 20 of the largest Portuguese companies are registered, which then does not want the Portuguese State to have programs to attract investment, when the investment runs away all to the Netherlands that preaches austerity to us.

I fully understand their position and frustration and, again, thank you for your comments, but let me remind you that what the Commission can and cannot do on this topic is defined in the EU Treaty. Before I conclude, however, let me share with you some comments, and replies to your comments. First, on the corruption and security risks linked to citizenship-for-sale schemes, as I said, the Commission is currently working on a report on investor schemes, which includes all Member States. Let me repeat: all Member States will be included. It will describe the Commission’s action in this area. Let me be even more precise: the report will be based on a fact—finding study, detailed work for which is now underway. The study will look at both investor citizenship and investments residence, so—called ‘golden visa’ schemes. The contractor undertaking the study has been asked to look at the legislative framework, the security and due-diligence checks, the numbers of people involved and the schemes’ implementation in practice. On the topic of guidance for Member States, the Commission will issue some guidance to Member States on the question of citizenship for sale, together with the 2018 report on investor schemes. On the topic of legislative initiatives by the Commission, let me re—stress the following. First, the concept of residence has already been harmonised at EU level, following a sector-based approach, and covers the following categories: high—skilled workers, seasonal workers, students and researchers, family members through family reunification, intra—corporate transfers and long—term residence. Second, as competence on the matter is shared between the EU and the Member States, Member States currently remain free to regulate admission conditions and rights for categories of persons not covered under EU law, including self—employed persons, entrepreneurs and investors. So, what I am promising to you, honourable Members, is that I will share all of your concerns and positions with my colleagues responsible for this sensitive area.

I have listened to this debate with great interest. On Ms in ’t Veld’s call for more transparency and monitoring, I would like to say that there is no EU monitoring, strictu sensu, since the monitoring of agencies which offer assistance in granting EU citizenship or residence permits relates clearly to a national competence. However, in January 2009, the so-called EUDO Citizenship, an observatory within the European Union Observatory on Democracy, was launched. This observatory analyses citizenship laws and policies in Europe. It is hosted by the Robert Schuman Centre of the European University Institute in Florence and funded by the European Fund for the Integration of Non-EU Immigrants. Secondly, we expect a report from the Commission, which will describe current national laws and practices, giving us a better overview and understanding of this issue, as well as providing some guidance for Member States. Concerning the view expressed by Mr Deprez, I would like to reassure you: ‘Les États Membres vous écoutent, la Présidence du Conseil vous écoute.’ In the field of legal migration, only the conditions of entry and residence of certain categories of third-country nationals have been regulated at EU level. It is for the Commission to see whether there is a need to propose EU-level legislation also for other categories of third-country nationals. In conclusion, as I have already emphasised, the protection of EU citizenship is about our joint responsibility, shared among all Member States and the European institutions. I am convinced that this issue of granting EU citizenship or residence permits should continue to be followed, in order to raise awareness and possibly to curb practices that could be problematic.

Meanwhile, the use of the funds thus earned has a significant risk of corruption. It is no coincidence that gold visas are most in demand in countries where there is high political instability due to corruption and financial flows are difficult to follow, e.g. In Russia or China. The free movement of corrupt politicians and criminals is not only a national security risk, but also a financial risk and helps to erode democratic interests. I therefore consider it necessary to act more vigorous than at present. EU institutions need to closely monitor the establishment and reception practices of Member States. In addition, the Hungarian settlement bonds have a peculiarity compared to gold visas, that the settlers did not pay the settlement fee to the state, but mostly offshore companies. Hungary is the only country in which the establishment 'business' is loss-making, because most of the profits are transferred to unknown individuals, presumably political.

We have worked well and quickly, but above all well despite the tight times and I must say a very thank you to all my colleagues in the various committees, starting with the Environment Committee and all the Other Opinion Committees have worked with a great spirit of constructive collaboration to give a quick response to our citizens and we have achieved the objectives set. A very heartfelt thank you to everyone. On the other hand, Civil Protection is an exciting world. Once one comes into contact with this world he cannot forget it, he cannot leave it, because Civil protection means passion, it means competence, training, generosity, humanity. There are a lot of volunteers, thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands, if we look at the volunteers in all European countries. We must recognise that a great leap in quality had been made compared to Civil Protection as early as the last legislature, when we had moved from an ad hoc mechanism to this mechanism that we know now of precommitted means and capabilities, because we had learned our lesson from Japan. We know, and we must never forget, that even the most prepared country as Japan was could become, by the level of catastrophe facing, an unprepared country. And now we are here precisely to strengthen the mechanism which has shown some weaknesses, and for this I must particularly thank Commissioner Christos Stylianides who, as soon as the analysis has come out. highlighted weaknesses and room for improvement, it immediately moved to action with this proposal, so we will now have the ability to react more effectively, with the main objective of saving human lives. And we must say really enough tragedies like those we saw last year in Portugal, where 100 people lost their lives, because we had to recognise that when different Member States they face an emergency at the same time, solidarity between countries that exist now is not enough. The collective capacity of the European Union has found itself having to respond to 17 simultaneous requests for help, only being able to respond to ten and in some cases even with delays. Now, thanks to Rescue, the work done together, we can prevent situations like this from happening again. First goal I said saving lives, but our goals are so many because we want to prevent economic losses, environmental damage, protect our artistic heritage, biodiversity. This is our work, then we must always emphasize it, is done in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, because the responsibility remains with the Member States at all levels. That is why we have emphasised, in many points, the importance of local and regional authorities. Let's never forget that the first people responsible for civil protection are precisely the mayors.

Next week in my region, Veneto, and in a neighbouring region, Friuli Venezia Giulia, there will be some European Civil Protection exercises and, as Parliament, on this line I think we have proposed a very beautiful thing, an Erasmus dedicated precisely to civil protection.

It proves this Parliament’s commitment to the better protection of EU citizens, and a strong civil protection mechanism – a European mechanism – is our common priority. As I said when I presented this proposal six months ago, time is of the essence. There is no time to lose. The next disaster, unfortunately, is just around the corner. Thank you very much for your commitment. The Commission’s proposal aims to make the Civil Protection Mechanism better prepared and more responsive to protect European citizens, their livelihoods and our environment. Why do we want to do this? Because, unfortunately, the current system has reached its limits. We, of course, have achieved a lot through the current system, and I am deeply thankful to all the countries that have shown real, practical solidarity to others in times of emergencies. But disasters can strike at any time, with high frequency and high intensity. They can strike simultaneously in several of our Member States due to climate change. Climate change is making the challenge even bigger and more unpredictable. This is why we need to improve our collective preparedness and response. So, dear colleagues, climate change is not fake news. Recent deadly natural disasters, such as the forest fires in Portugal last October – Ms Gardini has already mentioned this – proved that voluntary assistance is sometimes impossible. What is our suggested solution? It is to create rescEU to strengthen the existing solidarity mechanism and to combine it with stronger responsibilities of each Member State. So it is not a revolution; it is an evolution of the current system. Prevention also begins at home. We need to support Member States in their efforts for better prevention, and the European Union solidarity element is strengthened by higher co-financing from the EU budget from the existing voluntary pool. At the same time, as a last-resort safety net, we create a well-defined set of EU capacities like forest fire-fighting planes and medical teams, hospitals, and so on. You have seen our proposal and worked on its details. I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Elisabetta Gardini, for leading discussions between various responsible committees, across different political groups, to come up with Parliament’s position – thank you so much Elisabetta – and, of course, also all the shadow rapporteurs and also the rapporteur from the Committee on Development (DEVE), Ms Zovko. My presence here today gives me the opportunity to thank you in person for your work, all of you. I am particularly grateful that you recognise the importance of the prevention and preparedness pillar – the second pillar of this excellent proposal. We need stronger prevention and preparedness activities if we want to address natural disasters in a comprehensive way. We need solid risk assessment and risk mitigation planning; flexible, innovative and adaptable risk management plans; and also even some corrective measures. I agree that the response mechanism must be efficient and workable in practice. It is therefore important that the Commission has a role of strategic coordination. This coordination is key. In an emergency time lost is lives lost. When disasters strikes, we need the authority to take rapid decisions on deployment of rescue capacities, in particular in cases of competing requests – and this is the most critical time. But when it comes to action on the ground, the Member State affected must be in control of operations on its territory. So there is no problem about subsidiarity regarding command and control. I know many of you have already expressed your support on other provisions, which are even more ambitious than the original text. Your report and interest in raising the point today in plenary demonstrate our shared objective of a strong ‘Europe that protects’.

Gender equality is a fundamental value of the European Union and therefore, in the context of the Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism, Member States must consider gender in all phases, from prevention to preparedness and response processes, because natural and human-made disasters, as well as environmental policies, affect men and women differently.  Colleagues, you will also be voting on this very important issue.

These emergencies have shown that the means available in the European Union are not sufficient when a disaster reaches very large dimensions or affects several States, and we have the example in forest fires in warm drought times. The European Union requires cooperation mechanisms tailored to this reality and to the new circumstances that can lead to conflicts or climate change. We therefore support the creation of a European reserve in addition to the Member States' resources, but without replacing them and provided that it is under the coordination of the European Union. It should also be borne in mind that some Member States affected by the crisis cannot be in a position to provide the means previously committed to the European Union Mechanism. Prevention efforts by Member States and their monitoring by the Commission should also be strengthened. The existence of this Mechanism should not allow the guard to be lowering in the Member States, either in the media or in prevention.

Unfortunately, however, in its present form, it cannot respond to the challenges of ever increasing natural disasters due to climate change. Already in this century we have experienced twice the worst floods in recent years. In 2017 alone, more than 200 people died from natural disasters. More than half of them died during deadly fires in Portugal, where no EU country could send aid. Today, ironically, we voted to activate the Solidarity Fund to make good the damage. The role of the European Union cannot, however, be confined to it alone. Citizens need Union support when they are in danger, and not just afterwards. For this reason, we welcome the European Commission's proposal to strengthen the mechanism by creating ResceU, a pool of last resort facilities, which will be activated when all national instruments have been exhausted and the other Member States cannot help. Aerial means of forest extinguishing, such as Canadair, which have been so lacking in recent years, are just one of the great possibilities that the mechanism should have. At the same time, the creation of ResceU is an opportunity to prepare for future dangers. At the same time, we should help Member States to strengthen their prevention infrastructures by setting up credible response plans. We must also provide the necessary incentives to strengthen the instruments they already have. The European Civil Protection Mechanism and ResceU do not come to replace national civil protection authorities, but to ensure that, even in extreme situations, where national capabilities are not enough, the European Union will be there to protect its citizens.

At that moment, Spain might have been reluctant to jump into Portugal, so there is a need for European action; that is very clear. Therefore, we are very happy with the proposal and that is what we will support. The slight problem with what we are doing now in Parliament – and that is why we were critical in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) – is that for the rescEU, we are now broadening the scope on what it should work towards, even going into the locations of terrorist attacks, etc. I find that dangerous, not because I am against it necessarily, but we know that this is going to be a tough discussion with the Council, especially with more northern European countries. Where I come from, they will be critical of this proposal.

Climate change is one of the great challenges we face in the immediate future and we could already say that we are fighting it, but we need to know beforehand and be able to prevent the consequences. Every year we have examples of disaster; last year, Doñana, Portugal — with even human lives that perished. Therefore, we have to work from this unity and coordination to avoid it. These disasters have also highlighted the need to work from greater efficiency and effectiveness. Member States alone are unable or unable to fight them in the necessary way. I therefore welcome this initiative and I would like to highlight two points in particular. I am aware that the Climate Change Observatory has not come out and I think it would be an important initiative, but there are other initiatives that can make us move forward and which I hope tomorrow will have the necessary support. We need a risk map that allows us to differentiate which areas face specific risks and thus be able to better prevent them, be they seismic risks or lack of water resources, etc. Ultimately, we can overtake the circumstances of each region, and also adapt and coordinate this with other mechanisms such as the Solidarity.

I completely agree with the vast majority of your remarks and, above all, thank you for your commitment to taking action as soon and as far as possible. This is quite important. But let me repeat once again that recent natural disasters and emergencies have taught us two important lessons.  Firstly, the need for more European solidarity in practice: tangible solidarity. That means enhanced response capacity where the European Union can add value. This is also quite important. Secondly – many of you focused on this – without proper prevention and preparedness, Member States will continue to suffer the consequences of natural disasters and emergencies. There is a clear need for more responsibility, and with my services and my colleagues here, we use this as a sort of slogan. Solidarity comes with responsibility. I think we have to focus on this. Self-reliance should not be taken for granted. We need unity in effort, and we need to be ready to act quickly and decisively. The European Parliament now has a key role in the process of adopting the revised Decision. I am happy to know that we are all working towards an ambitious solution. The European Parliament is delivering today on its commitment to move fast and decisively towards more protection for European Union citizens.

Sendai, well, we also mentioned it because we have to create more and more resilient territories and therefore prevention is a fundamental chapter that is very stressed here too. So the Commissioner has often said that we must also create new financial instruments, facilitate and unbureaucratise those that already exist precisely because we must first and foremost prevent. Civil protection must be more and more prevention. Where prevention has failed we must be prepared to fight back. Then Mrs Cabezón Ruiz is right, this is to do more Europe, but to make the Europe that the citizens like and therefore I really hope, as the Commissioner said, that the Council will allow us to continue to work with these rapid rhythms, so you have this tool right away because, as you said at the beginning, the next catastrophe could be around the corner.

Today, in fact, it is about tachomanipulation, so to speak, odometer fraud, which is a deliberate and illicit change in mileage. This phenomenon is more widespread within the European Union than we mean. Why is that? Firstly, because it is technically very simple. Secondly, because it is very favourable and because it is only considered a cavalier offence in many Member States, not as fraud. And this leads to the fact that up to 12% of all used cars are manipulated on national markets, and even between 30 and 50% are manipulated in cross-border trade. This will cause economic damage to the European economy, to consumers, of between six and nine billion euros. In addition to this economic damage, we must, of course, also deplore the fact that it is at the expense of road safety, but also at the expense of the environment. Why we in Parliament are quite Community here and have voted by a large majority in the Committee on Transport is because it would be quite easy to change and eradicate this situation throughout Europe. There is best practice, there are good examples, for example in Belgium the so-called car passport system, or even in the Netherlands this national car passport. In fact, at each visit to the workshop, at each main inspection, the mileage is recorded and transferred to this national database at each service, which ultimately means that every used car buyer in Belgium is allowed to request a certificate that ultimately provides information on the mileage. This would, of course, be the best way to tackle the problem at the root of Europe if it were to be cross-border. What do we want to do? We originally wanted a European database solution. But we moved away from that. And now it is the case that we want to have national databases in the Member States, which we then also want to network across borders — this is the most important issue on this issue, on this issue. And then the point is that we expect a legal framework to be established on how which data is collected and stored, when, and how to access it. Again: It should then be the case that the mileage is recorded every time you visit the workshop. This model is simple, it is cost-effective and quick to implement, and would save consumers eight billion euros in one fell swoop. We also want to think about the technical improvements at this point. The technical improvements are obvious. Even today, manufacturers already have the opportunity to use safe technology. There are so-called hardware security modules that could ultimately have a precise effect. They don't cost much either. The study shows that it would cost around one euro per vehicle. In the type-approval regulation, too, we already have an obligation that the data for the newer cars must now be transmitted to manufacturers. Commissioner, we now expect the European Commission — and there is no excuse for me and many in this House that there is no pretext for why we should not do this — and from the Member States, on your initiative, a legislative measure that ultimately translates tachorigulation as fraud. recognises that, and ultimately, legislation comparable across Europe will be created to tackle this problem. Finally, I would like to thank all my shadow rapporteurs for the constructive work they have done in recent weeks and look forward to the debate.

I absolutely agree with you. Odometer fraud is a long-lasting problem, and we need more effective solutions to fight it. It is also clear that we need to continue to work at all levels to protect our consumers and honest businesses from becoming victims of this fraud. Let me pick up on a number of issues in the report that are of particular importance for our current and future work. First, on the roadworthiness aspect. I agree with you that the cross-border exchange of odometer data is a must to enhance the measures against odometer fraud. Let me be very clear: we are ready to propose the necessary amendments to the relevant legislation as soon as possible. I am very pleased that your report also recognises the key role of Member States when it comes to additional occasions to check the odometer data. Indeed, the current roadworthiness regime has its limitations when providing means against odometer fraud. For example, the first test is four years after the first registration. More frequent checks are likely to reduce the possibility to cheat. However, going beyond regular inspections exceeds what is possible within the roadworthiness framework. The good example of Belgium and the Netherlands shows how important it is that Member States use their competences to introduce additional measures. The Car-Pass system, for example, seems a good example that others may consider following. The roadworthiness legislation has been in application only for ten days as I speak, and it is the very first European legislation to introduce measures which can fight against odometer fraud. Obviously, it is too early to evaluate the impact that this legislation has. On the second topic – the type approval aspect: EU legislation in force since 21 July 2017 includes already requirements for the manufacturer to effectively deter reprogramming of odometer readings. This has to be done by introducing systematic tamper-protection strategies and right-protection features. With the new developments on connected cars it will be even easier for manufacturers or independent operators to keep and provide information on odometer readings. While you can never entirely exclude the possibility of odometer tampering, the Commission will explore amendments to the legal framework to further reduce this risk as part of the monitoring of the implementation of this legislation. The third topic: as regards the consumer protection aspect, odometer fraud or tampering is a problem for buyers of cars in general. This means companies, especially SMEs and also other businesses, such as insurers and car-hire operators. It is also a risk for a very large number of consumers. About 25% of consumers in the Union bought a second-hand car in the last three years. In the European Union, consumers are protected against criminal fraud by specific national laws, and odometer fraud is usually committed by criminal gangs. However, we know that it is very difficult to prevent such fraud, and when the car has changed hands, often with payment in cash, it is too late. Consumers will most probably not get redress, because the vendor will have disappeared – even more in the case of cross-border transactions. On the other hand, when the car has been bought from a retailer, the consumer is protected by EU legislation on unfair commercial practices. However, it has to be enforced by the national consumer authorities. Therefore, it is vitally important that these authorities regularly monitor the practices of economic operators in the second-hand car market.

Thus, the correct assessment of the technical condition of the vehicle is influenced, which creates unfair additional costs for consumers, car traders, leasing and insurance companies, as well as manufacturers. It is also worrying to note that this phenomenon has serious implications for road traffic safety, as it is a cause which contributes significantly to the increase in the number of accidents. Virtually incorrect assessment of the technical condition of a car can have serious consequences for road users, putting their lives at risk. As a representative of Romania in the European Parliament, I believe that a quick solution must be found to solve this problem, especially since Romania, my country of origin, has become a profitable market for the sale of second-hand cars. Given that a large number of used cars sold across borders have the odometer handled, I believe that this phenomenon contributes significantly to the increased number of road accidents in my country. Under these circumstances, the European Commission must come up with strong measures to protect the lives of European citizens.

They were presented by my colleagues. Firstly, it is easy to traffic a meter; second, it is a theft; thirdly, this theft not only ruined consumer money, but puts their safety at stake and has implications for the market both new and second hand. However, solutions seem simple and inexpensive, at least technically, since they have already been proven, particularly — as has been said — in Belgium, with the Car-Pass, and in the Netherlands. Nine billion is a considerable volume, not taking into account, moreover, the side effects I have mentioned on safety in the new market and even on the car maintenance market. We therefore have a very big problem, which is absolutely established, the solution of which seems simple, and to which, oddly enough, the Member States which, for the most part, are not concerned, do not react. This is extraordinary, because it is one of the only offences not characterised by a number of Member States' courts. We can therefore be quite surprised at this position of the Member States and, for once, the Commission has the opportunity to find a solution to all European citizens. Europe's ways to shine are not so common with our citizens. I think, Commissioner, that there are simple solutions. The car manufacturers could be asked to do better, but we know that this will not be a definitive solution and that we will never be assured of the inviolability of the meters. I think, Commissioner, that all garage passages, as for the Car-Pass, do allow meters to be raised and that there is no need for an additional administrative mechanism, which is an incentive to be obligatory. I would simply say that the Commission should put in place a new instrument and not seek to improve existing instruments, and that this instrument is biblical simplicity.

In addition to significant damage to consumers, this widespread phenomenon also threatens road safety.

Thus, fraud can increase the market value of a vehicle from 2000 to 5000 euros, mainly affecting those who want to buy a car for small amounts. The situation is even more devastating for the Member States acceding after 2004 compared to the Western European average. We cannot allow our region to become a depot of cars that have already been scrapped in the West and show false numbers. We must do everything we can to ensure that this practice is eliminated.

For consumers, this is a big economic problem and also safety problem, because for the ordinary consumer, in general, that mileage driven by car is the main criterion on which the condition of the car is assessed. This has big implications for what kind of purchasing decisions consumers make, and we know it will have a negative impact on safety as well.

Of course, you have to wonder that the actions outlined in this report do not create extra bureaucracy, but we have good examples that records from which the history of the car can be reliably verified have been sought to organise nationally, either voluntarily or by force of authority.

I am sure that that will have a very positive effect on the market. Please inform all of your voters of the activities that have been done. Let me go through the major points again.  We now have new roadworthiness rules which oblige inspectors to collect odometer data, and they have been in force for only 10 days. I hope everybody in Europe knows that. We will assess the implementation, as required by the legislation, by 2020 and propose additional measures if we find that they are necessary.  Secondly, we have new type-approval rules that were set and adopted last year with new obligations for manufacturers to address the odometer fraud issue. The Commission plans to review their application and then decide on future steps if necessary.  Thirdly, cross-border data exchange is the next step. As I said before, we will now use the budget allocated by Parliament in pilot projects to prepare a proposal going in this direction. Beyond legislation, awareness-raising is essential. Member States must exchange experience and good practices, and this is what we promote in the Commission’s roadworthiness committee, which pays special attention to automotive topics.  So as you can see, there were four clear actions that we have taken just in the last few years.

First of all, thank you for the broad support here in the House for this proposal. Commissioner, let me be clear once again: yes, the last regulations we have carried out in recent years are a right step in the right direction. Only, this will not solve the problem of tachomanipulation. For example, in the road worthiness package, Article 16 states that the Commission should assess the feasibility, costs and benefits of setting up an electronic platform for vehicle information and the exchange of information. This is a 2014 directive, what has happened so far? Nothing! Nor will what you have described help if we fail to achieve what we have described as the next step, precisely the exchange, the interconnection between the Member States. What does all that is in the current regulations help if the data is stockpiled somewhere? No, they need to be networked so that anyone on site has the ability to access this data. Otherwise, all that we did is good practice, but it will not lead to the goal. That is why there is no reason not to do this, even economically. According to the study, this tamper-proof software costs just one euro per car. Well, that can't be the problem. Again, it's clear that we don't want any new rules. We only want to bring together the existing systems that have proved their worth at European level. For this we need the European Commission. There's no point in waiting until 2020 at all, because now — this is a low-hanging fruit — so these are things that can be done right away when the European Commission internally agrees on who is responsible. And if this step is taken, then all in all this will be a good solution. But just waiting until 2020 is no solution.

Unfortunately, vehicle mileage rigging is still a very common phenomenon that disrupts the proper functioning of the internal market and generates burdens for consumers, insurers and car dealers in the secondary market. It is estimated that 80% of cars imported for example into Poland have reduced mileage. Illegal reduction in the number of kilometres travelled increases the value of the car by an average of €3 thousand. We cannot continue to tolerate impunity and put citizens at risk of loss. My country, Poland, is today in a group of countries where such manipulations are prohibited and actions are taken to further reduce the scale of fraud.

On closer discussion, everyone starts to realize that tyres, all sorts of seals and, perhaps, plastics get older with age. This is true, but looking at the prices of used vehicles, we find that there are two almost equivalent factors that determine the price of the car, that is its age and mileage. In view of current estimates of the number of vehicles subject to national or cross-border trading, so-called mileage bottling is an absolutely fundamental problem. If up to 12% of the vehicles on the national market and 50% of the vehicles imported have been through odometer handling, this is a fundamental problem that deserves resolution at EU level. That is why I support proposals to create a linked database of all vehicles operating within the EU.

On 18 January this year, we took a very good decision, on a very good basis by the European Commission, on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and parental responsibility. I was very pleased with this legislative proposal, which was made, especially since some of the proposals I made in a previous report had also been included. That's a good law. There is greater legal certainty, faster decisions are taken, and this is very important, especially when it comes to custody issues. However, the European Commission's proposal has a very important catch, namely: it applies only to married couples. Registered partnerships are left out. And this is simply unbearable. Unbearable, Commissioner, because there are more and more registered partnerships in the European Union, and fewer and fewer people are making a marriage. Society is changing, lifestyles in the European Union are changing — but the European Commission has simply closed its eyes to it. This is ungrasp, and unfortunately it is a recast. For citizens who do not know what that is, this means that the European Parliament can only amend the articles that the European Commission has also amended. This means that we were not allowed to table any amendments on the scope. We, as the European Parliament, have not been able to ensure that this very law is also extended to the registered partnerships. And this, I think, is very backward, very backward by the European Commission. And look at your own numbers! Take a look at Eurostat figures collected by the European Commission: there are fewer and fewer marriages. More and more people are living in registered partnerships. Why should these people who choose a registered partnership not have the same rights, the same access as spouses? Why are the people who, after all, can already make use of the right to registered partnerships in 19 countries of the European Union and are in many cases even recognised for adoption excluded from this right, which is very good? That is why I also ask the European Commission: why did you not include registered partnerships in your proposal on Brussels II? Does the European Commission not see any regulatory requirements for registered partnerships in relation to Brussels IIa? Does the European Commission not see discrimination in the exclusion of registered partnerships? I say: yes, this is discrimination and you are actually the guardian of the Treaties of the European Union. In the Treaties, non-discrimination is one of the very essential points that we are discussing again and again. Will the European Commission intend to make up for this failure to exclude registered partnerships in the foreseeable future? If no, why? If yes, when? After all, this is also an important question, unfortunately, a great opportunity was missed. I am also very much looking forward to the comments made by my colleagues on the right of this European Parliament, who have tried to prevent this question to the European Commission from coming to plenary. And I find that intolerable: why do you not accept that people who have opted for registered partnerships do not have the same rights, even though it is already the case in our society. Commissioner, you are considered to be one of the progressives in the field of digitisation, as one of the cosmopolitans, as one who says: yes, we need to adapt our social order to the realities of today.

This proposal facilitates the resolution of cross-border legal issues in family matters and provides protection to children. Our proposal focuses on the shortcomings regarding parental responsibility matters. Parliament has also flagged these up in the past. They now require our urgent action. As Parliament has noted, we did not propose changes to the provision on matrimonial matters by addressing, for example, the possibility for couples to choose a court for divorce, or extending the regulation’s scope to same-sex couples or registered partnerships. The results of the public consultation undertaken by the Commission did not provide sufficient evidence to justify making urgent changes in the area of matrimonial matters. Our assessment was that it is not the right time to change these rules. The key objective of the Brussels IIa revision is to propose significant improvements for children facing difficult situations. These need to be addressed urgently. I am happy that Parliament and the Commission have a common goal. In cross-border cases we want to prevent children from ending up as hostages of long legal disputes. We also want to facilitate cross-border legal proceedings for families by various means, including by reducing the length and cost of procedures. Very importantly, both Parliament and the Commission want to provide the same level of protection to all children.

Mr President, the main objective of the European Union is to maintain the area of freedom, security and justice, and it is essential for this to have judicial cooperation, especially in family matters, in the European Union. That is why the recasting which we presented in January with the rapporteur, our colleague Tadeusz Zwiefka, as a compendium, a recast of all that cooperation in the field of family law, was a step forward in order to have greater legal certainty, so as not to have many gaps and many unnecessary delays and many confusion and, above all, became the cornerstone of such judicial cooperation. Uniform procedures were established with regard to separation, divorce, matrimonial nullities and also parental responsibilities in cross-border situations — which, as you know, are increasing. Thus, there was a free movement of decisions, judgments and documents, and also that there were no delays that always hurt the child, who must be the main object of that regulation. It is true — the Commission has said — that there are 19 Member States which have de facto couples regulated, but in Europe there are nine States that do not. And it is true that it is a growing reality: there are more and more children born to couples who are not married and there are more and more couples in fact. And that is why the question we are asking the Commission is: do you think that regulation of that reality would jeopardize that agreement which is necessary in order to have such cooperation?

Well, I think that having eliminated and not wanting to encompense within this jurisdiction, within the “Brussels bis” regulation, unmarried couples or couples who have not contracted a marriage because they chose it or because it is not possible in their country to contract a marriage — I think same-sex couples, same-sex couples — is an ethical state idea.

We must remember that the number of children of unmarried or same-sex couples continues to increase in the EU. It is distressing to see how the EPP and also the conservative, Swedish politicians in this assembly fight time and time again against proposals that would strengthen the rights of these children. On Monday, they even voted against this debate. Unfortunately, the new regulation does not include registered partnerships, even though 19 of the EU's member countries, including Sweden, already allow such partnerships or, as in Sweden's case, marriage.

The Brussels IIa Regulation on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and parental custody matters and on child abduction abroad is a regulation applied directly in all Member States. This means that the ruling issued in one country is applied in all countries of the Union. Since not all EU countries have an institution of registered partnership in their legal systems, but also politically, it is not possible to extend the application of this regulation to partnerships. We already have instruments of EU law that deal with the issue of the distribution of the assets of couples who have entered into a partnership, but this is a specific formula for enhanced cooperation that only a part of the Member States have joined. If the EC had compounded on the question, I believe that, unfortunately, the Member States would never have come to an agreement. With family law, unanimity is required. We are already seeing that, with — it would seem — important and supported by all changes, the Council is very slowly working out its position.

It is clear that our policies are geared towards the creation of jobs in the European regions. The Commission has presented an industrial policy strategy to help our industries to stay, or become, strong on innovation, digitisation and decarbonisation. Some regions benefit from globalisation and demographic change but others are struggling with this industrial transition process. The need to strengthen the abilities of local communities to cope with and adapt to social or economic change was also emphasised in our renewed industrial policy strategy. It is at regional level that the effect of the industrial transformation is greatest. That is why our industrial policy aims at empowering regions to benefit from the opportunities of industrial transition. In a single market, companies are free to establish factories anywhere in the European Union. Freedom of establishment is a basic principle of the Treaty and the Commission cannot interfere in such investment or disinvestment decisions by private companies. When it comes to location, it is also the role of the regions to provide an attractive environment for investment and growth. However, we are, of course, very vigilant if relocation decisions involve public funds. We are aware of the high political sensitivity of the few cases in which public funds are used to move an economic activity to another Member State, causing substantial job losses. That is why in the 2014—2020 period, we have strengthened the rules in the fields where the Commission can act: state aid and the European Union funds. We react immediately whenever we are alerted. The Commission has no power to interfere in companies’ reorganisation plans. Nevertheless, we urge companies to follow good practices on the anticipation and socially responsible management of restructuring. The European Union state aid rules provide safeguards to prevent Member States from using public money to incentivise the relocation of existing jobs from one European Union country to another. In addition, the European Union has several instruments to support workers’ employability in order to mitigate the adverse social consequences of restructuring, for example the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. There is a strict regulatory framework that imposes obligations on companies concerning the provision of information to, and consultation of, workers, in particular with regard to the opening of social dialogue in order to mitigate the consequences of reorganisation. Even more importantly, cohesion policy support from the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund is available in all European Union regions to mitigate its potential negative effects, and in the context of cohesion policy we have included additional safeguards to avoid those funds being used for delocalisation. I can assure you that, in the proposal for the new post—2020 regulations, we will include prevention of the use of funds to support delocalisation. Cohesion policy support can also be used for industrial transition, training and skills development as well as other measures to mitigate negative effects. The Commission has also launched pilot actions in order to work with a selected number of interested regions to master the challenges of industrial transition. One of these regions is the Piedmont region, the home region of Embraco. Other examples are Hauts-de-France and Wallonia. You surely remember the Caterpillar and other similar restructuring cases in these regions. We will support these regions with the aim of accelerating innovation uptake, removing investment barriers and facilitating reskilling and preparing for industrial and societal change.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 257, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Danuta JAZŁOWIECKA", "mepid": "96781", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President! One of the greatest European achievements after World War II was the creation of a single market within the Union based on freedom of movement of workers, goods, services, capital and entrepreneurship. Thus, one of the largest markets in the world was created, within which we build our shared competitive advantage. Member States differ in the level of socio-economic development, which has a translation into the level of remuneration and legal environment. In this situation, we will not avoid cases of de-ocalization in the Union. Of course, delocalizations also carry negative effects, mainly for workers and their families. This is the problem we should address first: it is important that the delegation decision is announced appropriately early and that workers have a chance of new employment. In the European Union, we have funds that serve this: the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. What, then, to do to make the delocation less? First and foremost, we should level the level of development in the European Union, which will follow the equation of salaries. We can achieve this through greater integration of the common market, greater exchange of goods and services and sensible investment of European funds. Member States should also create conditions suitable for business operators, a fair and sustainable social policy, a friendly legal environment, predictable and easy procedures, access to financing and development opportunities. Let's also remember that our main competitors are China, Russia or the United States. We must do everything to eliminate delocalization to third countries.

While we have been debating in this Parliament, because of the EPP who did not want to arrive at a resolution, for months, the Italian Government fortunately initiated procedures for which these days workers and these female workers are safe. But on the specific topic, you have to add two more fast things. One: we have a Europe that does a lot for industries, but does not have its own industrial policy, and above all fails to give an industrial policy with a social responsibility for companies.

This is a logical result of the fact that producers in Italy have much worse business conditions than in Slovakia. Therefore, the solution is not to blame Slovakia, but to think about Italy's competitiveness, the enormous regulatory burden, the taxes, the stability to which the new government does not contribute every year. And, of course, over public debt, which is the second highest in the European Union. These are the real reasons for the departure of producers from Italy. And one more negative factor has to be called openly, which means that the euro is too strong for Italy and the impossibility to compensate for the shortcomings in competitiveness by devaluing its own currency.

Let's see, that there is a displacement of businesses within Europe, whether we are European, if we believe in the single market, it is as if there is within a Member State. In my case it is as if one from Asturias goes to Malaga, and in the case of Italy, as if one from Turin, where my grandmother was born, goes to Sicily. Let's be serious. Either we believe in the single market or not. That said, business and workers' mobility is an inalienable right and an absolute instrument for prosperity and cohesion. If we try to stop this, if we try to put internal barriers, my gentlemen, Europe is over. Let it be known. Having said that, the characteristic of European society, of European democracies is that, in this absolutely free dynamic, there are obviously moments of space for workers, for businesses, and so on. Unlike other societies, we believe in cohesion and solidarity, and therefore we do everything we can to protect these workers, to help them at those bad times to get ahead again. That is the European model, not putting internal barriers. That's the record. One last thing I want to say: the allocation of resources must be respected. If not, Europe will not work and will never be competitive. Finally, we talk about Embraco. But Embraco is a model of the benefits of European mobility. We have created quality jobs in a more disadvantaged area, which was Slovakia, without, for the protection of workers, those who were in a more favoured area than Turin have been damaged.

Another effect is precisely the subject we mention, thus delocalization. And not only within the borders of the European Union, but also outside the borders of the European Union.

The decision to move production to another Member State is a strategic and managerial decision of that firm, which the State, and therefore the European institutions, should not in some way interfere more significantly. Undoubtedly, states can offer different incentives to firms to avert their decisions, but the final decision must be up to those firms themselves.

Ultimately, other workers and enterprises will relocate from these regions and the process continues, increasing the asymmetries across the EU.

Over the past years, our relationship with Turkey has faced many challenges, especially with the continued backsliding on the rule of law, democracy and human rights, particularly in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July 2016. The analysis in the Commission’s annual report on Turkey shows that the country continues to move further away from Europe. In the context of the mid—term review of IPA, we have proposed significantly to reduce IPA funding for Turkey on the basis of objective criteria, in particular the country’s lack of progress towards the EU and its low absorption capacity. I thank honourable Members for their support on this. We will reorient our assistance even more towards areas of higher priority – democracy and governance, the empowerment of civil society, the rule of law and fundamental rights. We look forward to the formal endorsement of this proposal by the Member States in the IPA Committee in July. In this current debate, it is important to emphasise that IPA funding remains a valuable instrument for the EU with which to underpin its relations with a breadth of stakeholders in Turkey. Turkey is a key partner and it is in our interest that this partner is stable and democratic. Recent thematic evaluations have also confirmed the relevance of IPA for longer-term reforms, despite important challenges in Turkey. IPA funds aim to improve Turkey’s modernisation and development and to provide support for a wide range of crucial segments of Turkish society and its development. We must use these funds in the most effective way. In its special report on Turkey, the European Court of Auditors concluded that assistance to Turkey is generally well designed and that projects deliver outputs. Nevertheless, it has also been rightly pointed out that there is much room for improvement. We take these issues very seriously and have already acted to address many of the report’s recommendations. We are focusing more on conditionality in our approach. For example, in the area of the judiciary we have halted several projects with the Council of Judges and Prosecutors due to serious concerns about the independence of that body. We have also taken steps to increase the share of funds managed directly by the Commission. Lastly, let me point to the fact that cooperation on home affairs and migration remains a top priority for both the EU and Turkey. This includes support for the development of an integrated border-management framework in line with EU standards and with full respect for fundamental rights and international law. The objective here is to prevent and combat cross—border crime. This involves the provision of effective tools for modern border surveillance systems. Let me reassure you that any equipment delivered for civilian purposes is used only for civilian activities and it is clearly defined and closely monitored. Therefore, concerning the armoured (the word in German is gepanzert) vehicles, some of the excitement seems to stem from the fact that they are referred to in the press as military vehicles, and are sometimes even confused with armed vehicles, which they are absolutely not. The fact is that, for example, any EU officials visiting the Syrian border drive around in armoured vehicles: so the Turkish authorities can do so, and I think this is understandable. This false debate also casually overlooks the fact that some EU Member States actually continue to sell arms to Turkey.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 285, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": " for the PPE Group. — Madam President, Turkey is our strategic partner, which is why we are troubled by government policy and the development of a situation where thousands of people, journalists, academics are still in prison.

I have to say that, looking at the severity of this topic, I do hope in your answers that we will get more specific. I also want to say to the EPP that this is not a debate generally on Turkey. This is a very specific debate on IPA funds that were used, and we are very concerned about what happened to those funds. Keep me in Dutch. Mr President, almost EUR 36 million: that is the amount that the EU contributed in 2011 to the purchase of armored vehicles in Turkey for more effective border surveillance. Let me make it clear that Turkey has sufficient reasons to monitor its external borders properly. We can all imagine it. But when the Cobra II vehicles were delivered in 2011, they were intended to be deployed at the eastern border. The war in Syria had not yet begun, no wall had yet been built on the southern border. In 2018, that situation has changed dramatically. In recent months, several reports have come from both human rights organisations and journalists that dozens of refugees have been shot at — sometimes with death — during an attempt to cross the Turkish border, partly with the use of armored vehicles. (The President interrupted the speaker because of a problem with the interpretation) The contract concluded in 2011 states that armoured vehicles may only be used for surveillance. If Turkey wishes to depart from this, it must seek written permission from the European Commission. Hence the questions to Commissioner Hahn, with the shocking stories of Human Rights Watch, among others: has Turkey asked the Commission for permission to equip the armoured vehicles with heat-sensitive cameras? Has the EU launched its own independent investigation into the findings? I don't hear that. And if not, do you intend to do so immediately? Indeed, the painful conclusion may be that the EU is implicitly co-responsible for very serious human rights violations on the Turkish-Syrian border. The fact that, at the request of my colleague, Mr Schaake and myself, all the political groups in this House have agreed to a debate on this subject shows how seriously we take it in Parliament. This really needs to get to the bottom of it. The resources of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) are intended to support a candidate country to adopt EU standards in a variety of areas. Funding armored vehicles from EU money — even if it does not have military targets — is questionable in itself, but if it also turns out that Cobra II is being used to prevent refugees from crossing a border by brutal force, then all the alarm bells go off me.

Nevertheless, Turkey remains an important partner, and despite some calls in certain quarters to do away with IPA funding altogether, I believe that this would be a step too far for now. But it must be kept under review, as also is the case with suspending accession negotiations for EU accession – that also must be kept under review, particularly in the way Turkey chooses to treat Cyprus.

I hope that IPA III will see a greater share given to the Western Balkans, (The President interrupted the speaker) which are in greater need and are much closer to EU accession.

So I am interested to learn from the Commission how much money the EU has, from 2014 until today, provided to Turkey, not just under IPA II, but basically broadly during those years. This would provide important context to the amount of money we spent. Secondly, we requested this debate because it was reported that the Turkish military has used EU-funded Cobra vehicles to shoot at and forcefully push Syrian refugees back across the border. Now, if confirmed, EU funds would have been illegally used and the EU could be indirectly complicit in human rights violations. So has an independent investigation into these allegations been undertaken and, if confirmed, what will be the consequences? Would Turkey only have to pay back the money or would parts of the accession funding to Turkey be suspended as a result? In other words, what kind of accountability mechanisms are there? Because what we know is that the Commission has often been hesitant to use conditionality. It took amendments from us in this House to the 2017 budget to make sure that funds to Turkey were decreased as a direct response to the significant backsliding of the rule of law and democracy. Freezing and redirecting funds should be a proper policy option. What is also clear is that there is a lack of transparency, monitoring and clarity on objectives when we look at funding. No one seems to know exactly how much money is spent, where, why and to what effect. The Court of Auditors – and our colleague mentioned this – drew similar conclusions in its May report and I am actually still waiting for answers to my written questions about this report.  The Commissioner is proposing new plans for EU pre-accession funding on 14 June as part of the broader budget package and of course we are happy in this House to push for making EU spending more transparent, accountable and effective.

Yesterday we talked about border controls at the internal borders. The context of the discussion was: in order to return to open borders within the EU, we must protect external borders against migrants and potential terrorists. While we Greens do not agree with that conclusion, we all in this House agree that the protection of borders must not be at the expense of human rights. We also have a major problem with the candidate country Turkey being given great financial support from the EU to align it with the EU acquis, and Turkey has also been supported to be able to take care of the immensely many refugees who have taken away from the war in Syria and which the EU wants to stop from reaching Greece.

Whether I'm successful with this, I don't know. First of all, these IPA funds. It is a miscalculation or incomplete knowledge to believe that this means that a certain amount is transferred to Turkey, and that is it. No, pre-accession aid is based on programmes, on certain projects that are agreed with us, which are financed and which are not paid until it is settled. Just so that's clear. It is also repeatedly confirmed by the European Court of Auditors and by other supervisory institutions that things are going well here. Just as a basic understanding once. Secondly, I believe I have heard just over 30 speakers who have mostly been critical to rejection of pre-accession aid to Turkey and have said that these pre-accession aid should be stopped. I can tell you that there are currently 26 Member States out of 28 which are in favour of maintaining the status quo — suspend or failing to pursue the negotiations — and to adjust pre-accession aid accordingly. Of the speakers who have spoken today, a single one from Austria, one of the countries — Austria and Denmark are the two — was in favour of ending the accession procedure. All 26 others are for the status quo I just described. As long as this status quo exists, pre-accession aid will also be available. What I did is that, in response to the request of the European Council, I made a proposal to adapt these pre-accession aid to the circumstances. And I can tell you that I have gone much further on this proposal than the budget that this House, together with the European Council for 2018, has adopted for Turkey. This House has agreed a much smaller cut with the Council than I have proposed. And I hope that you will also support my proposal for a reduction from 2018 to 2020. If I may follow your speeches, I can probably assume that. We have also often discussed in this House that Turkey has a significant part of society — and if we take on the result of the constitutional amendment referendum, that is about half of society — that has a different view than Erdoğan and his party. It has always been the view here in the House that this part of society should be supported, not least through appropriate measures by the European Union, for example in the context of pre-accession aid. In this sense, we are also trying — and have already done so — to divert the funds massively into the contribution to the promotion of civil society, and here also in the way that we move from indirect management to direct management, so that the funds are managed directly by our delegation, so that we can directly manage the funds. cooperate with civil societies to ensure that the funds are used properly. Now, perhaps to the actual occasion of this debate, I said in my introductory statement: it has also been the view — again and again — here in the House too — that Turkey should be supported when it comes to protecting external borders in order to stop illegal immigration or simply to limit the borders. control. For this purpose, financial support has been provided for the purchase of armored but unarmed vehicles. In English, this sounds similar, and possibly this has also led to this confusion. We have investigated matters on the basis of the allegations, and I can tell you here today that we have no evidence that equipment we financed was used to shoot at refugees. If you can provide me with evidence on this, I'm very happy. Our research, our checks have not provided any evidence. Of course, I cannot rule out the fact that one of these vehicles was also shot. It can also be shot from a non-armored vehicle. But what I want to capture is: we have been with EU funds do not finance tanks, but armored vehicles, which also provide the protection of civilian personnel in border management, just as used by our staff. I would ask you to take note of this. And I would like to invite you once again: if you have concrete evidence, evidence, I am more than grateful because, like you, I have an interest in clarifying things and once and for all to ensure that things have been used correctly. At this stage, with current knowledge, I can note that there has been no abusive use in this regard. As I said, we now have this status as far as pre-accession aid is concerned. I have proposed to cut them overall by about 40% for the remainder of 2018—2020. A large part goes to civil society projects and also to the completion of certain infrastructure projects, such as a railway link to Bulgaria, for example.

What we are looking at is whether or not we are delivering on the pledges we signed up to. What we are not debating tonight is whether or not we need gender action in our external relations. We had that debate two years ago and we agreed we needed a much stronger focus in this new programme, not just in development policy like the last Gender Action Plan, but right across our external relations: in trade, in our neighbourhood policy and in our global strategy. That is why I am pleased, Commissioner Hahn, that you are here tonight as well, because it is not just Commissioner Mimica who is involved, it is all our Commissioners, in external action. What did we find when we looked at how we are doing so far? It is, of course, early days. We based our work on year one of the Gender Action Plan, but I think so far, we are seeing some very positive progress. It is never easy to engineer cultural change, and to get gender action taken more seriously, that is what we need. We need to move away from the days when the gender responsibility was given to the youngest, newest member – often female – of our delegations in our partner countries. What we are seeing now is that it is now the clear responsibility of the ambassadors in our delegation, and of senior officials in our services, who are responsible for gender action, and they have to give an annual report to make sure that they can be held to account. So far, 81% of delegations of our embassies have submitted their gender reports, as have 22 Member States, because our Member States have also signed up to this plan. We have seen an increase in the number of projects specifically aimed at women, and we are also seeing that all projects have to have some form of gender screening. We have seen the creation of gender focal points and gender champions in our delegations, but I would like to see further progress inside the Commission’s headquarter services in Brussels as well, to see them focus more actively on this. We have seen some good practice in some embassies in some of our delegations, and we need a platform, a mechanism, to make sure the good practice and the good projects are exchanged. Of course, the real point of the Gender Action Plan is not about collecting data or nominating gender focal points; it is really about making positive changes to the lives of women and girls in our partner countries, many of which are some of the poorest countries on our planet. I saw one of these projects a couple of weeks ago in Uganda, where we met women and girl refugees from South Sudan living in refugee settlements, and they were receiving psychological support because they have been victims of conflict and victims of appalling sexual violence. I have seen the work we are supporting in the Panzi Hospital in eastern Congo, which is run by Dr Denis Mukwege, our Sakharov Laureate. It is also about supporting women’s political voice, like in Kenya, where I met a group of women – local councillors – who were receiving funding and training, funded by the EU. Yes, it is about giving women control of their own fertility, about our sexual and reproductive health rights, and allowing women and girls to make their own choices about what happens to their bodies. I think that women in our partner countries deserve the same access to family planning services as we expect in our own countries, and when I meet the women who are victims of sexual violence, and the girls – often 12, 10, 11 years old – they in particular need our support in this respect. Thank you, and I will come back with further comments later.

I want to initially thank the co-rapporteur, Mrs. Linda McAvan, for her valuable work and support during the drafting of this report, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs. Dear colleagues and colleagues, we all know that the principle of equality between women and men is one of the fundamental values of the European Union embedded in the Treaties on the Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and we work daily in Parliament to empower the role of women and to achieve equality between women and men. This Action Plan for Gender Equality was created on the basis of Parliament's recommendations focusing on changing the institutional culture of the European Union at the level of seats and delegations in order to achieve systemic change in how the European Union approaches gender issues as well as focusing on Transforming the lives of women and girls through four key areas. In the first year of action plan, a number of positive trends were noted. I welcome the choice of four thematic pillars, in particular ensuring the physical and psychological integrity of girls and women, promoting economic and social rights, empowering women and girls, strengthening their voice and participation, as well as the transformation of the institutional culture of the European External Service action. This report highlights that greater participation in both the public and private sectors is key to advancing women's rights and their economic empowerment in the economic sectors as well as the need for women's involvement and presence in new economic sectors that are important for sustainable development. We also stressed that it is important during the political dialogue to improve women's participation in education, economic activities, employment. In view of the early phase of the implementation of the plan, I support recommendations aimed at further improving it, but I note that it is too early to adopt a full impact assessment or to send criticism to the Commission. Furthermore, I am convinced that the report of the European Parliament should be strictly focused on the practical aspects of its implementation. At the level of the committee, as a co-rapporteur, I decided to invest a minority report or minority opinion, precisely because in my own report I could not support changes of ideological nature that largely go beyond the scope and purpose of this report, as well as unrealistic requirements regarding development European Union cooperation with third countries or excessive budgetary requirements. As a rapporteur from the European People's Party and as a strong advocate for women and girls' rights, I felt a responsibility to invest an alternative resolution which once again welcomes the positive trends of the Action Plan in the first year of implementation, support and make recommendations to the Commission and the Service for external action for further progress and the necessary steps. The text of the Alternative Resolution covers all areas of application as the original text of the report and does not ignore the problems we have in the field, but at the same time does not criticise the Commission only one year after the Action Plan for Gender Equality, putting a burden on EU taxpayers with extensive budgetary requirements, ideological aspects not directly related to the implementation of the action plan. Dear colleagues and colleagues, this report should not be a place for ideological conflicts, this report is a strong message from the European Parliament that the Union can and must, by its external action, influence the transformation of the lives of women and girls every day. I stand at my disposal for further answers to questions during the hearing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 322, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first thank, on behalf of my colleague Neven Mimica, the rapporteurs Ms Linda McAvan and Ms Dubravka Šuica, for their joint work and welcome Parliament’s report on the first year of implementation of the second EU Gender Action Plan in external relations 2016-2020.  Our evaluation of the first Gender Action Plan had been a useful guidance in the preparation of the second plan. Based on lessons learned, we wanted to address all the identified weaknesses, such as limited capacities to tackle gender equality and women’s empowerment issues in external actions, limited high level political support and coordination among the services and on the ground. This learning process will also continue in the implementation of our second Gender Action Plan.  The annual reporting requirement by all external relations services is an important tool in this regard and an opportunity to do things better together and more efficiently. Let me stress here that our second Gender Action Plan, covering not only development but also all external actions more widely, is mandatory for all Commission services working with partner countries, the European External Action Service, as well as EU Member States. The management’s commitment and ownership of the second Gender Action Plan is therefore crucial. This would be facilitated by the requirement that each report has to be endorsed by either the Head of Delegation or the relevant Director and headquarters.  We also need a strong political buy-in from the highest level, including Parliament. This is about understanding that gender is fundamental and a key driver in all sectors when it comes to sustainable development. All our staff must also be more sensitive to this across the board.  We also need adequate funding. The recent midterm review of the external financing instruments has been, as you suggest, a great opportunity to measure the scope of gender-sensitive initiatives in our development cooperation. Following this analysis, EUR 50 million has been reallocated to provide additional funding to this key priority in the period 2018-2020.  Our overall financial support to gender equality is increasing. From the data already available for the 2017 report, around 65% of EU Official Development Assistance (ODA) has been committed in gender-sensitive ways. This covers all sectors, from education and health, to agriculture, transport, justice and employment. This is a visible increase from 2016 when the percentage was 58% of EU ODA.  With regard to data collection and targets, it is now mandatory to measure the impact on gender equality of all EU-funded actions. A big effort has also been made to align the monitoring framework with the 2030 Agenda. The 2016 Gender Action Plan Report provided us with a solid basis for measuring quantitative progress made. The ensuing 2017 report will allow us to go even deeper in the analyses, also from a qualitative perspective.  Overall, gender analyses are increasingly informing our new initiatives. Awareness raising and training of Commission staff have also been promoted.  Finally, let me recall that last September, together with the United Nations, we launched an unprecedented Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls. The Initiative focuses on particular forms of violence against women and girls that are prevalent in specific world regions: femicide in Latin America, trafficking and economic exploitation in Asia, sexual and gender-based violence, including harmful practices, in sub-Saharan Africa, domestic violence in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Despite the large amount the EU has dedicated to this initiative – EUR 500 million – it will not be sufficient to tackle all forms of violence. So we have invited other donors to join forces with us.  With regards to the women, peace and security field, let me just underline that it is highly important when working in conflict prevention and peace building processes to integrate effectively a gender perspective in all operations and missions from the inception phase. This year we have been making an effort to harmonise reporting requirements and leverage as much as possible the coordinating mechanism at the country level.  I hope you will agree that we still have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver and I sincerely hope that together, by using all our voices, policy tools and financing instruments, we can indeed make a lasting difference.

The Daesh terrorists razed the region they lived in, Sinjar, and carried out a genocide against the Yazidi community. Nadia was taken as a sex slave. Kidnapped, tortured. But he managed to escape, and since then he struggles to achieve justice for his people. I am talking about Nadia because her example illuminates what Europe must do in the field at hand, at that crossroads between development, human rights and gender equality. The Union cannot deal with its own problems alone. We have an obligation to use our influence to defend what sets us apart: our values. If we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Nadia, it was because we have made her cause ours too. But it's not enough to do justice. Our first duty is to prevent the injustices suffered by women around the world. And that is what this report is about, Mrs Šuica, not about ideology. Of course, we must set an example, and to that end it is imperative that all Member States ratify the Istanbul Convention and incorporate its provisions into legislation. But getting involved also means providing funds, because without money all we say will be hollow words. One example of what we need to do is the Spotlight Initiative, by which the Union, together with the United Nations, allocates a specific budget against gender-based violence. And I'd add something else. We need a strong common foreign and defence policy, which will enable us to ensure stability in those regions where women are most vulnerable.

In our day-to-day work in Parliament, we talk quite often about the unsettled problems of women in the European Union, the pay gap and the pension gap, the pace of promotions, violence against women. Knowing the problems of citizens of the Union, which occur despite decades of equal legislation and despite the pro-nationality declarations of the great majority of European politicians, the more clearly we see and understand the tragedy of girls and women from developing countries where equality agendas are disregarded or non-existent at all, and women are treated like second-category citizens. Not only their rights, but often their lives are directly threatened. The European Union, being the richest and most equal political organisation, has a responsibility to use all available tools to initiate and support equality policies in third countries as well — and does so through the programmes evaluated today. In my opinion, the prerequisite for their success is the full integration of equality objectives in foreign policy by all its contractors, thus politicians, diplomats, officials, their associates, advisers and consultants.

The report adopted by the Committee on Development and the Women's Committee includes important recommendations for improving the second Gender Action Plan with regard to sexual and reproductive rights as a condition for equality and empowerment of women, the possibility of using abortion for rape victims in conflict situations, the rights of LGBT people and the Global Gag Rule, among others. We must have concrete objectives and activities, linked to a rigorous schedule, as well as a qualitative evaluation of data demonstrating the real impact of the measures implemented in the beneficiary countries. Otherwise, this gender action plan will be a mere tool for internal reporting. Everything we have advocated here reaffirms the European Parliament's position of a decade. That is why I do not understand the presentation of a minority resolution by the PPE, which eliminates many of these recommendations. The PPE accuses the report of being too ideological in the action plan. But isn't conservatism in the plan of action also ideological? Isn't that against equality? Doesn't it become a tool against women's rights? Does it not become another tool against the rights of LGBT people? What is the PPE's position on abortion in case rape? I do not believe that all Members of the PPE Group will see themselves in this position, not least because gender equality, as the rapporteur of the PPE has rightly said, is one of the pillars that underpin this Union. For us, defending equality and the empowerment of women in the world is a matter of justice. Tomorrow, our aim will be to keep the text as approved in committee.

More than a year has passed since the second EU Gender Equality Plan was implemented, which does not allow a fair analysis of the effects of its functioning. As the assessment is too early, the report presented is an extremely ideological document that treats on almost every point about reproductive rights, the Istanbul Convention or sexual minorities. My prespeaker talked about introducing reproductive principles as a condition for equality. What are we talking about? About the fact that abortion is supposed to be available at any point?

Improving consumption opportunities for women and girls and participation in the labour market is key to improving their health and financial position.

One in three is at risk of falling into poverty or social exclusion. More than 11 per cent, aged 15 to 24, are not in education, in employment or in training. The unemployment rate remains on average above 15 per cent and in some countries, such as ours, exceeds 30 per cent. And for the first time since World War II there is a real risk that today's young people will live worse than their parents. And I refuse to accept that this has to be the case. Last week the OECD published a report warning of the growing frustration of young Europeans and that this resulted in a rejection of institutions, which we are already seeing in several countries. Too many university students do not find employment or who chain one precarious job after another, without a clear future. Austerity measures taken in the context of the crisis have had a negative impact on citizens in general, but above all on the youngest, who have been the most affected by cuts in education, culture and social services. Europe cannot afford to disconnect its young people or their social exclusion. Nor, of course, waste your talent. We cannot overlook the potential and creativity of 90 million young Europeans. We cannot afford such a prepared generation not to participate actively in social and political life. It is imperative that young people feel listened and committed to strengthening the European project. It is essential that they have spaces for participation. This is one of the main demands of European youth, and therefore it is so in my report. I wanted to positively highlight European cooperation in the field of youth, the implementation of the structured dialogue to ensure youth participation, the method of open coordination and, of course, some of the proposals and political initiatives such as the 'Investing in European Youth' initiative, the new European Solidarity Corps and the Youth Employment Initiative. However, much remains to be done. And, for example, we need clearer links between the implementation of youth policy and all European programmes; an improved framework for transparency and monitoring of youth policies; a central coordination involving all relevant actors in different sectors; a strategy with better tools for youth policy. communication and participation and, of course, increased financial support from all programs. And, to achieve this, we have established four key recommendations in this report. The first is to give young people a voice, make it easier for them to participate in decision-making and policy development, so that their needs and ambitions are reflected and we also take into account the diversity that exists in European youth; we must explore alternative forms of participation both individually and collectively. The second recommendation is to reduce inequalities, ensure sustainable inclusion in the labour market and ensure a dignified and autonomous life for young people; further work must be made to ensure that job offers are of quality and consistent with their training. The third recommendation is that we need to pay attention to all key areas to ensure a sustainable future, from modernizing education to paying special attention to the mental health of young people. And finally, of course, a financial commitment; we cannot increase participation in programmes such as Erasmus or strengthen the European Youth Guarantee if we do not put the necessary funds; we cannot finance some programmes if we have to cut others; and of course, we cannot accept a cut in the European Social Fund, which is key to the acquisition of new skills for unemployed persons and, above all, in the fight against social exclusion. Commissioner, this gloomy future that I was talking about at first is not inevitable. Everyone here has a responsibility to change things. I hope that the new European youth strategy will contribute to building a better future for them. If we accept that our youth has to be one of our priorities, let us put every means at our disposal to ensure that this generation does not live worse than the previous ones.

Only last week, the Commission adopted its proposal for a renewed youth strategy, and you will be pleased to see that the key elements of the Commission’s proposal correspond closely to the recommendations made in your report. Let me first of all thank Ms Gardiazabal Rubial and the other Members of the Committee on Culture and Education, but also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We are grateful for your hard work on the report and your constructive recommendations. To prepare our proposal for the new Youth Strategy, the Commission spent a full year listening to young people to better understand their views on Europe. We held stakeholder consultations and carried out an in-depth evaluation of the current strategy. We also engaged in an open dialogue with you to make sure we could take your ideas into account. The Commission proposal is therefore solidly based on stakeholder opinions and evidence. The Commission proposes three main areas of action for our future cooperation in the field of youth. They are captured by the words ‘engage’, ‘connect’ and ‘empower’. First, ‘engage’ is about fostering young people’s participation in civic and democratic life. The biggest priority for me will be to reform the dialogue with young people. We want to make sure we make it more open and inclusive, less formal and rigid. The current format has achieved positive results. Since 2010, we have reached over 250 000 young people. But we agree with you that we need to reach out to a broader range of young people, including at the local level, and that we have to focus more on those young people with fewer opportunities. Young people who are struggling with disadvantages tend to be less active citizens and to have less trust in institutions. Let us try to change that. Second, the word ‘connect’ underlines our intention to bring together young people across the European Union and beyond. The Commission wants to foster volunteering, learning mobility, solidarity and intercultural understanding. For example, we want to build a policy framework for volunteering and solidarity activities, which will underpin the activities funded through the European Solidarity Corps. The Commission also agrees with you on the need to clarify and reinforce the link between European Union youth policy and the related European Union spending programmes. Indeed, we are proud that the Commission proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework places a strong focus on youth – the Commission is proposing to more than double the budget of Erasmus and the European Solidarity Corps. This is a clear sign. We are committed to investing in youth. We must be ambitious in this area: our young people deserve nothing less. We count on you to defend our proposals in the tough negotiations ahead. Third, the word ‘empower’ is about supporting young people through a youth work agenda. The focus is on quality, innovation, digitalisation and recognition of youth work and non-formal learning. We must ensure that the youth sector is ready to fulfil its potential in times of change. But this is not all. We want to ensure that young people are heard when decisions are taken across policy areas. We have taken on board your recommendation to better coordinate the different youth-related initiatives in order to make our youth activities more visible and improve their outreach. The Commission is therefore proposing to create the position of an EU Youth Coordinator inside the European Commission. This person will be a contact and reference point for young people across the continent. This unique position will be an important signal of the importance we attach to the young generation and help us enhance coordination and coherence. We also want to be much more transparent about what the European Union does for young people. To this end, we propose to track how much funding from the European Union budget is devoted to youth, looking at a wide range of programmes. Finally, we also want to introduce more flexibility. That is why the Commission proposal suggests that Member States set ‘national action plans’, translating European Union-level youth priorities into their own plans. Young people face quite different challenges in each Member State. National action plans can be most helpful in fitting specific national contexts. These are just some highlights of the Commission proposal for the new Youth Strategy. I am now looking forward to hearing your views and to discussing how we can best make this Strategy a reality as of 2019. Let us work together to make it as effective as possible, because we owe it to our young people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 359, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Svetoslav Hristov MALINOV", "mepid": "111027", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. — One of the most common cliches when talking about youth is that the future belongs to young people. This cliché is much wiser than it seems because it contains the hidden truth that the present does not seem to belong to young people, and indeed it is. Much of the decisions that are made in the present decide the future of young people, but they cannot be involved in making these decisions. I believe that one of the main merits of this report is that it listened to the maximum extent and reflected the maximum amount of voices of young people, their organisations in the European Union. And I think we need to be honest with these young people and openly tell them, “A lot of the key policies that affect your future, which are essentially youth policies related to education, the reforms needed for new forms of training, everything related to successful social integration , countering youth unemployment, actually depend on your national governments. We, at the level of the European institutions, summarize the experience, give best practices, raise the bar, set high standards.

But we also know that inequality has grown, poverty among young people has grown, and difficulties in accessing work have also grown. I think that having included in our report, for which I thank Mrs Eider very much, for having given the input that has been partly transposed, I recognise that, in the new strategy, is the meaning of this. our action, that is to consider young people more central in the social pillar, more central in the opportunities that will be offered in the various policies in a cross-party way, to have a coordination contact on policies for young people, and also provide national plans to verify their progress.

As a liberal, I strongly support encouraging young people to take an active role in public life. The structured dialogue between youth organisations and institutions in the EU and at national level needs to be continued and reinforced. It is very important to focus on improvement of the status of young people. In addition, we have to improve the quality of offers under the Youth Guarantee scheme, defining standards and improving the Member States’ monitoring, reporting and performing systems, to ensure that the funds from the European Youth Employment Initiative are being used as a supplement to national funds and not as a replacement for them. Lastly, the Member States must continue their efforts on national implementation and validation of the system and provide adequate funding for youth to acquire skills, including through non-formal education and training.

We constantly hear that young people are the future of Europe, that we need to invest in them, that they are a priority of the European Union. However, I fear that these beautiful fairy tales have virtually no real coverage. The reality is radically different. Youth unemployment continues to be very high, and a large number of young people accept jobs that are below the level of their qualifications, only to make ends meet. They continue to be the first victims of the economic crisis. At the same time, the European Union, which claims that young people are a priority, offers programmes targeted at young people such as Erasmus+, which, however, are available only to young people who have the appropriate financial capabilities. My question is what do we do for these young people who dream of going on Erasmus+ student exchanges but cannot afford for the simple reason that scholarships are small and their parents cannot bear such a financial burden. We constantly boast that Erasmus+ is the European Union's most successful programme, but unfortunately it remains inaccessible to many young Europeans. Here, again, we are talking about double standards, not equal opportunities. In the same line of thoughts, the assessment of the current European Youth Strategy shows that the European Union is making policies for young people without the involvement of young people themselves. Mr Cañete, you said that in the last year this European strategy has been drawn up with the participation of young people, but they say that 56% of them is not taken into account at all. I believe that in order to have a well-functioning and democratic Union, young people need to take part and their policies and their voice should be heard. Instead of encouraging their active participation, however — what happened with the European Youth Forum in Bulgaria was that these young Europeans were made to clap on command.

Following the financial crisis, unemployment results across the European Union were very negative. High unemployment affected not only young people, but also workers with more internship. Today, the labor market situation is much better. Unemployment in some countries is at below five percent and even there is a shortage of hands for work. Unfortunately, this significant improvement is very little for young people. It is worrying that still close to a third of young Europeans are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Among them, the unemployment rate in some countries is in double digits. Since 2010, the European Union Youth Strategy has been implemented, which is a continuation of previous years. But you can see that we need to raise the efficiency of the actions we take. The moment towards this is appropriate. The current strategy covers the period up to 2018. Additionally, we are at the stage of prioritization within the multiannual financial framework. I am extremely pleased that there is a chance to put more emphasis on young people's problems in the new EU budget and increase funding for programmes such as Erasmus+. I am convinced that the new strategy needs to be put on real and defined goals. Above all, we should focus on education, developing interdisciplinary skills, creating stable jobs for young people, developing entrepreneurship and supporting personal development.

It is the best way to share best educational practice between Member States, and introduce young people to potential new skills. Also, it helps to fight youth unemployment as well as strengthen a common EU culture.

Ecodesign, which we will talk about tonight, is an essential foundation of this. It is about taking into account all environmental impacts on biodiversity, on water, on soil, on air, on noise and, of course, on the energy consumed during the design of the product. Logical, I would say, since this phase of product manufacturing is responsible for 80% of environmental nuisances and 90% of the costs for producers. In 2005 — I was already rapporteur on the first framework directive on the subject — the objective at that time was limited and aimed solely at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency. Today, we can no longer focus solely on this issue of energy efficiency. Europe must change its paradigm and act for better use of resources and product recyclability, an ambition that has been widely shared by the members of the Committee on the Environment, who almost unanimously adopted my report on the implementation of the 2009 directive on 25 April. I would also like to thank all the members of the committee, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have had an excellent collaboration: Francesc Gambús for the EPP, Massimo Paolucci for S&D, Nikolay Brekov for ECR, Kateřina Konečná for the GUE/NGL, Margrete Auken for the Greens, Eleonora Evi for the European Union for the Greens EFDD and Sylvie Goddyn for ENF. I would like to point out that this is an assessment of the situation, an implementation report. The ecodesign requirements that apply to a range of energy-consuming products have borne fruit: I am thinking of air heaters, boilers, computers, lamps, televisions and household appliances in the broader sense. The numbers speak for themselves. The eco-design policy, coupled with, it must be said, the legislation on energy labelling, generates savings that are greater than Italy's annual energy consumption, nothing less than 175 million tonnes of oil equivalent. If we bring the analysis back to a level closer to us, that is to say to the consumers we are, this represents a saving of €490 per household per year on energy bills. Several studies by the UK authorities confirm this success, including a study published in 2015, which concluded that every pound sterling invested in ecodesign yields 3.8 times more to the British economy and that, therefore, it is indeed a profitable policy. However, this blue sky that I am drawing here, is still dotted with a few clouds. There are indeed a few flags, including unanimous criticism of persistent delays in the decision-making process. The Commission must therefore remedy this situation, Commissioner, and that is what we say in points 7 to 14 of our report. European manufacturers must be able to rely on clear deadlines for implementing measures. This is important for their strategy and for maintaining fair competition with non-European companies. But on the whole, the reasons for satisfaction are here and lead us, of course, to look further and to want, first, to extend ecodesign measures to energy-related products, which have the greatest potential for saving, such as solar panels, refrigerated containers and hand dryers. Secondly, we intend to rely on other criteria, different, additional criteria to set our requirements. This could be durability for our dishwashers, refrigerators, repairability — we have made a lot of emphasis on this — and the availability of spare parts, for example for televisions and so-called all-in-one printers. Also on this issue of the selection of criteria, we consider it essential that, in its work plan, the Commission find a solution — this has been an essential part of our debates — for mobile phones. I know it's not easy given the lifespan of laptops, on average from 6 months to 2 years depending on whether they simply die, or depending on whether they are out of fashion. Their environmental balance must also be improved. Indeed, I am convinced — I am speaking here as a user — that smartphones should be made with removable components, including the battery, and should be accompanied by clear information on their possibilities for reuse and recycling. There is also a need to improve market surveillance. The Commission considers that between 10 and 25% of the products regulated by the Directive do not comply with the ecodesign requirements.

One of the success factors of this policy framework is the way we go about establishing the requirements; through a robust and transparent process, with the close involvement of all stakeholders along the way. This has resulted in broad support for ecodesign and energy labelling from Member States, businesses, consumer organisations and environmental NGOs. The Commission is very pleased to see that also in this House there is strong support for a continued, and strengthened, implementation of this policy. Let me outline briefly what the Commission is already doing to improve its implementation. Firstly, as regards the decision-making process we are aware that the development of measures takes time. This time is needed to ensure a robust technical analysis and have a transparent process where stakeholders have many opportunities to comment on our work. Moreover, given the sensitivity of this policy in some quarters, the College has decided to strengthen political oversight. This includes, amongst others, political level scrutiny at different stages of the process and the adoption of measures in packages to underline the added value of this policy in terms of monetary and energy savings.  As regards market surveillance, Member States clearly need to do more to ensure compliance of products with ecodesign and energy labelling requirements. The Commission is assisting national authorities with this task, in particular by funding joint surveillance projects and facilitating exchange of information. The product registration database that we are establishing for energy labelling will also help in this respect. Another important way to strengthen ecodesign implementation is in its contribution to the objectives of the circular economy. In fact, our current ecodesign regulations already tackle reparability, durability and end-of-life aspects of certain products in support of circular economy objectives. But more can be done and your own-initiative report indicates many areas where improvements could be made.  The Commission is keen to explore various possibilities, and in fact the current Ecodesign Working Plan 2016-2019 makes a strong commitment to contribute to the objectives of the circular economy. Issues such as durability, reparability and recyclability will be examined in a more systematic way when proposing new regulations and when reviewing the existing ones. For example, we are investigating whether a reparability score for domestic appliances could be included in energy labels in the future. The core idea is to provide incentives to make products last longer and be easier to upgrade, repair and recycle.  This is not an easy discussion: for example, while a more energy efficient product directly leads to money saved for consumers, a product that is easier to disassemble does not necessarily have such direct benefits. Also, if there are circular economy requirements, it needs to be possible to check them. It is one thing to check how a product performs. It is quite another thing to check how it was produced, for example using recycled materials. The Commission is however convinced that these challenges can be overcome and that, together, we can enhance our existing policy framework to drive our markets towards more sustainable products and a truly low-emission, energy efficient and circular economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 400, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Francisco de Paula GAMBUS MILLET", "mepid": "125006", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Madam President, Commissioner, ecodesign is a fundamental step towards the new European circular and low-emission economy model.

In this way we will save damage to the environment and reduce manufacturing costs. The importance of ecodesign has meant that the vast majority of groups in Parliament have agreed on the measures to be taken. We have been aware that, in order to move towards a new way of production and consumption, it is essential to regulate all stages of the life cycle of a product. This report deals with the directive already adopted in 2009 under this title. However, almost ten years after its approval, we can not be completely satisfied with its implementation. We must learn from mistakes and provide stronger and more concrete solutions, which in turn are a powerful instrument against climate change. For this reason, we are convinced that the report presented today represents progress and progress towards the circular economy model, which will enable us to pollute less and create more and better jobs in Europe.

Designing products that are more sustainable, that use less energy, is clearly common sense. Therefore it is difficult to mount an argument against the concept of ecodesign, as I am sure some will try to do because if you look at some headlines on this you would think that this was all needless EU red tape, Brussels bureaucrats trying to tell us what sort of vacuum cleaners we can and can’t buy. Of course, it is not that. It is about helping people make better choices as consumers to buy products, whether they be televisions, whether they be coffee machines, whether they be laptops, that are more energy efficient, that are more sustainable, that been made in a more sustainable way.  It is key therefore that we make sure the most sustainable products on the market are also the most affordable products on the market. This must also be an issue of social justice as well as environmental justice. Key to this is the implementation, of course, and that is where I feel we need to see the balance of ambition with pragmatism. Whilst not directly referenced in this report, let me take the case of lights used in music venues and theatres.  If a specific exemption is removed, we will see energy usage of certain lamps. It would mean an immediate waste of existing equipment if that exemption was removed. Whole lighting rigs would need to be replaced, whole lighting rigs becoming obsolete when they could be used for many years. Data from UK Music shows that 35% of live music venues in the UK have closed in the last 10 years. Those venues face many challenges: business rates going up, rents going up, planning regulations. Any further increasing costs will present a real threat to music venues in the UK and across the EU. So I appeal to the goodwill and willingness of the Commission to work positively to reach a sensible compromise on this specific issue, and a way forward, so we can find a low waste, low energy and more sustainable economy and protect live music and arts venues at the same time, because that would represent good, positive, cooperative policymaking and I know that it would be music to the ears of venues across the UK and other Member States.

I would like to thank Mrs Ries for her good cooperation on the report. I am pleased that the rapporteur was open to arguments about, among other things, taking into account the specific role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which have less ability to adapt to the new requirements than larger producers. I also thank you for accepting my request that any extension of the scope of the Directive is preceded by an in-depth impact assessment, which should demonstrate the possible benefits of the new product categories being covered by these provisions. The introduction of eco-design requirements is a move in the right direction, and I believe that Parliament should support this initiative as it allows for more efficient use of energy. This translates not only to reducing harmful emissions, but also to increasing energy security. Unfortunately, some of the records proposed in the draft report are not a good option. The ethical aspects are of course relevant, but I think the ecodesign directive is not an appropriate place to address these topics. In turn, the provisions that talk about the responsibility of manufacturers for the entire lifecycle of products are too far-fetched.

I think ecodesign proves that it is a useful tool. We definitely see that in terms of the reduction in energy consumption and, of course, it also has a positive impact on fuel imports and in reducing emissions. So the policy delivers. I think that that is clear. Consumers also profit and I think that has also been underlined, even though we hear all the time that this is yet another dictate from Brussels. This also shows that we still have a bit of a problem with the mind-set. We hear that in the political debates, campaigns, and I think we need to reinforce and sharpen up a little bit our communication.  Ecodesign criteria should also, in my opinion, be broadened. So far, ecodesign primarily focuses on energy consumption, but that should not be the only criterion. I would say that we have to focus on our resource efficiency and therefore criteria like recyclability, upgradability, durability, reparability all have to be taken into account.  The scope of ecodesign should be extended. The sole scope of the Ecodesign Directive covers energy and energy-related products, but what about other product groups, for example ICT products, which contain a number of precious elements, or furniture, which definitely creates a large part of our landfill? Composition of products has the same relevance as energy consumption, in my opinion, and therefore ecodesign should be considered as a part of the circular economy, and that has been underlined. A last remark: priority, in my opinion, should be given to those product groups which have the highest potential. So there is work to be done, and I am sure that we will progress on that.

Ecodesign has brought real added value in terms of both energy and resource savings. Indeed, this is recognised by both the industrial sectors concerned, as well as by NGOs and experts from the Member States. The potential offered by the current directive should be fully exploited. All environmental impacts of the products in question should always be considered with regard to their composition, durability, dismantling, repairability and recyclability, already at the design stage. However, this is no longer enough for our increasing consumption and the resulting problems. It's time to think more over the subjects we use daily. This need shows up today and daily. Let's look at what crisis we are currently experiencing in terms of plastics. In doing so, so little would be enough. I am arguing here for the long term that it is a new reform, strengthening and fundamental expansion of ecodesign that is the right key to the development of the circular economy. The new text should apply to a far wider product portfolio, should be properly intertwined with waste and chemical legislation, and the competent authorities should have more competences with regard to compliance with the rules by processors and manufacturers.

Since 2009, retailers have been banned from selling tungsten lighting for domestic use, but they were still permitted to sell it for use in theatres and concert halls, which were exempted from the ban. Over the years, people working in the entertainment industry have approached manufacturers who were still making this type of light bulb, requesting that they continue production. However, the supply of tungsten lamps will now cease as the Ecodesign Directive will end this exemption. Not only that: the legislation will also affect most of the lighting used in this field. The effect of this legislation will be that, by 2020, theatres and other venues in the entertainment industry will no longer be able to purchase new tungsten lamps, while at the same time no suitable alternative will be available. This directive will have a negative impact on theatres and similar venues, especially smaller establishments that would be disproportionately affected.

The directive has been instrumental in improving energy efficiency across Europe, which everybody must welcome. It has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, has led to economic benefits for consumers, thanks to increased competition amongst manufacturers, and has provided opportunities for sustainable growth and jobs, including in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector. It is helping to eliminate the least-performing products in the market, significantly contributing to the EU’s 2020 energy-efficiency objectives. This is an area which is extremely important both to me, as rapporteur on the Renewable Energy Directive, and to my constituents. And, incidentally, both Commissioner Cañete and I will be back here at 8 o’clock in the morning for a four-hour trilogue on the same Renewable Energy Directive. Have a good night’s sleep, Commissioner! When inefficient incandescent light bulbs were phased out across Ireland, beginning in 2008, this saw significant reductions in energy usage and gradually lowered spending on light bulbs for our citizens. This has considerably helped low-income households who are at risk of energy poverty. I look forward to a time when products such as smartphones, which are sold in large numbers and replaced frequently, can be more efficient, and I support the Commission’s recommendations on this.

One understands that, when we have raw materials recycling, product recycling, we are going to a different era, an era that has real issues in relation to the control of the products themselves, their repairability and efficiency. Of course, all this needs to be labelled, the consumer channel itself needs to be updated and, through the marking, one can make the right choices. At the same time, however, consultation is also needed, because the transition phase is not an easy one.

I would like to address two specific issues that were raised in the debate. Let me start with the problems of theatre lighting, which has been raised by many Members: Mr Palmer, Ms Reid, Mr Gericke, Mr Marias, amongst others. I would say that for two years the Commission has been reviewing the ecodesign legislation for lighting. This also covers the application of exemptions, as well as the existence of suitable replacements available on the market. In December 2017, revision proposals were discussed in the Ecodesign Consultation Forum, consisting of representatives from Member States, industry, civil society and other partners. The Commission is receiving and analysing comments, including those we received in the context of the Public Consultation, which ran until 7 May this year. The Commission also met with representatives from the theatre and entertainment sector to discuss their concerns. The outcome of those consultations will inform the further development of the ecodesign requirements, including whether a specific exemption for theatre lighting continues to be necessary. Ms Reid, Mr Telička and Mr Kelly also raised the issue of ICT products. I would say that in the Ecodesign Working Plan 2016-2019 the Commission announced a more in-depth assessment of several ICT products with a view to their possible inclusion in the working plan, including gateways, base stations and mobile smart phones. The main reason for a specific assessment of ICT products is that it has proven very difficult to make a reliable estimate of their energy savings potential, given the uncertainty about future market developments. Moreover, for fast-moving product sectors such as mobile phones, questions have arisen as to the suitability of the ecodesign process for establishing minimum energy and resource efficiency criteria, because, as this process takes on average around four years, the risk is that requirements would be updated by the time they enter into force. The Commission has started this assessment, for example with a study that looks specifically at the material efficiency aspect of smart phones. Based on the outcomes of this assessment, the Commission will determine the best policy approach for improving the energy efficiency and wider circular economy aspects of mobile phones and other ICT products. I will conclude by saying that I look forward to continue working with the European Parliament to improve the implementation of this policy framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 415, "date": "2018-05-30.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": " Mrs Ries, you have already used your six minutes at the beginning of the debate, but I decided to give you another 30 seconds to conclude the debate.

It is clear, therefore, that Europe must be concerned about this. And with priority. Ecodesign should include more products and more criteria. The focus is now on energy consumption alone. We want to extend this to include sustainability aspects such as recyclability, use of recycled materials, recoverability, easy dismantling, availability of spare parts and regulations on rare or harmful raw materials. The minimum service life of products and warranty periods must also be in height. But the first step is to correctly apply the rules, and there again the shoe is wringing. The non-compliance is currently estimated at 10 to 25% of the products on the market. As a result, 10% of the possible savings are lost.
