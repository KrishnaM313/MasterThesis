A first topic is how, in today’s world, we as Europeans do more for our own security. The European Council will take stock of progress in a number of areas where we are deepening cooperation in security and defence.  The agreement we reached together on the European Defence Industrial Development Programme will allow the European Union to fund, for the first time, a programme on defence capabilities. We are also in favour of making headway on improving military mobility, and working to strengthen our resilience to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear-related risks and our capabilities to address hybrid threats. The European Council will also assess progress in the field of civilian CSDP, and leaders will provide further guidance on PESCO and our important cooperation with NATO.  As you know, migration is also on the agenda. Much has been achieved over the past years in terms of strengthening our overall migration policy, with tangible results on the ground. There is broad agreement on most elements of our migration policy, including better protecting our external borders and controlling illegal migration. As the Presidency, we have worked diligently on the reform of the Common European Asylum System to help bridge differences in approaches and develop concrete solutions. Intensive negotiations have taken place in the Council on the various proposals of this package. The Dublin reform remains difficult, but in most other files good progress has been made. The European Council will now look at the broader picture. To this end, President Tusk is currently conducting consultations with his peers. The June European Council will also be the opportunity to spell out our vision for an innovative and digital Europe in the years ahead, following the leaders’ debate in Sofia. Technology-driven innovation is increasingly shaping our lives. The pace and scope of change that the next waves of innovation will bring are unprecedented.  To play an active part in this global transformation, we in Europe need to do better when it comes to the way we generate ideas, turn them into business and help businesses grow on the global stage. We need to deepen Europe’s innovation capability and nurture, in particular, breakthrough and disruptive innovation.  As we reinvent the way we do things, we should also stay true to ourselves and to our values. This is not only true with respect to innovation, but also in relation to our digital endeavours. By creating an environment where innovation can thrive while guaranteeing high standards for the protection of users, we will foster high levels of trust in technology. The next Multiannual Financial Framework is a key tool to shape our common future. The European Council will discuss the future handling of the proposals concerning the MFF, including the timeline.  Turning to jobs and growth, the European Council will conclude the European Semester for 2018. It will also take stock of the leaders’ discussion on taxation held in March under the Leaders’ Agenda process. The European Council will also have the opportunity to address international developments, including the latest trade issues. As you know, the European Council is also expected formally to adopt the decision on the composition of the European Parliament, on which you will be voting tomorrow. Finally, the European Council, in terms of Article 50, will meet on the next day to review the state of the negotiations with the United Kingdom. In the margins, the Euro Summit will meet in an inclusive format. It will discuss measures on the Banking Union and to further develop the European Stability Mechanism, and will provide additional guidance on the way forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Before giving the floor to Vice-President Timmermans, I wanted to remind the Council that the European Parliament has been adopting a proposal for reform in Dublin for months.

I think I would be remiss if I did not start with what happened in Charlevoix. I’m not one to declare that the rules-based international system so carefully built up after the Second World War is now collapsing before our very eyes. However, it is the first time since 1945 that an American President has not seen it as an American strategic interest to work hard to ensure a vibrant and unified Europe and a robust transatlantic relationship.  This means that the EU needs to take its destiny more into its own hands and we should be confident about our ability to do so, because our foundations are strong. Our Union is built upon Member States that voluntarily and democratically decided to link their destinies and shape the future together. The basis for the shared destiny is a tripod of democracy, the rule of law and the respect for human rights. This is how one creates unity between big and small, how one creates unity in full respect of our diversity. It is in turn our unity that gives us strength globally to pursue better and more sustainable standards for everyone; to defend global trading rules; to boldly address climate change; to protect our citizens against geopolitical and/or geoeconomic challenges, and to better grasp the opportunities that globalisation has to offer.  And so, this month’s European Council comes at an auspicious time, and it is a good opportunity to show political will, decisiveness and unity. But we should look beyond the daily Twitter feed and also keep our eyes on the ball with regard to the work that lies ahead of us. Last December, leaders agreed to come back to a number of issues in March. In March, they agreed to come back to the same issues in June. While important decisions take time, we cannot postpone decisions indefinitely. The situation in the Mediterranean is a stark reminder that we cannot wish problems away. No fence is high enough and no sea is wide enough to render our countries immune to the greatest pull factor there is – the freedom, the prosperity and the stability of our Union.  In recent months, under the guidance of the Bulgarian Presidency, the European Union has shown what is possible when we are united and committed to finding European solutions. We agreed, for instance, on the difficult issue of the Posted Workers Directive, thanks in large part to this House. Equal pay for equal work in the same place will now become a reality for all Europeans. We made substantial progress on our digital single market with regard to the abolition of roaming and on clarifying and strengthening audiovisual media services or telecoms rules.  With regard to Brexit too, the EU is united. Our goal is to ensure we, together with our British partners, do as little harm as possible to either side and to work together towards an orderly process in the interest of all citizens in the EU and in the United Kingdom.  The European Council of June will take stock on a number of issues, in particular the question of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the future relationship between the UK and the EU. We still have three more weeks to go, and it is important to use this time to achieve real progress in the interests of all. Parliament, Council and Commission are working together to deliver.  In the next months, we also have to deliver on the legislative files we identified as our common priorities under the two joint declarations. From plastics to migration, from energy to transport, from the European Solidarity Corps to the European Citizens’ Initiative. We’ve promised this to the European citizens before the next elections. It will be our collective achievement. The joint declarations guide our work, so let’s stick to our commitments.  As we approach the June European Council, this then is the spirit and the approach that all leaders must take. United by our values, linked by our interests and concerted in our actions.  Das gilt auch für die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion. Denn je stärker diese ist, umso mehr verleiht sie der Union als Ganzes Kraft, was sich wiederum positiv auf den Lebensstandard der Europäerinnen und Europäer auswirkt. Deshalb ist es unsere Pflicht, den Euro zu stärken. Die Kommission hat bereits im Dezember ein umfassendes Paket vorgelegt, um unserer Gemeinschaftswährung zusätzliche Stärke und Handlungsfähigkeit zu verleihen. Wir haben außerdem vor wenigen Wochen konkrete Haushaltsinstrumente vorgeschlagen, um Reformen zu fördern und Investitionen im Euro-Raum selbst in Zeiten asymmetrischer Schocks zu gewährleisten. Dass die Mitgliedstaaten die Vorschläge der Kommission diskutieren, ist ein erster wichtiger Schritt. Doch es reicht nicht, wenn wir lediglich feststellen, was notwendig und geboten ist. Wir haben zwar bereits Fortschritte gemacht und Lehren aus der Krise gezogen – sei es bei der Reduzierung notleidender Kredite im europäischen Bankensektor, beim Aufbau der Kapitalmarktunion oder bei der Einigung im ECOFIN-Rat im Mai, als wir Maßnahmen ergriffen haben, um die Risiken im Bankensektor weiter zu reduzieren. Das war ein wichtiger Schritt hin zur Vollendung der Bankenunion. Der Gipfel im Juni – die Leaders' Agenda – ist der Moment, die Ideen und den politischen Willen endlich auch in konkrete Entscheidungen und Taten umzusetzen. Wir müssen uns endlich darauf einigen, dass der Europäische Stabilitätsmechanismus die Letztsicherung für den einheitlichen Abwicklungsfonds übernehmen kann. Und dafür müssen wir endlich auch beim Einheitlichen Europäischen Einlagensicherungssystem weiterkommen, das nicht nur über Nacht aufgebaut werden kann, sondern für das Vorbereitungen, Vorbedingungen zu erfüllen sind. Gestatten Sie mir, auch den mehrjährigen Finanzrahmen zu erwähnen. Ich glaube, dass wir uns vor den nächsten Wahlen unbedingt einigen müssen. En ce qui concerne la gestion des migrations, la situation n’est en rien comparable à ce qu’elle était il y a trois ans, mais ici également, nous avons encore du travail à faire pour compléter la mise en place d’une politique migratoire fondée sur la responsabilité et la solidarité, tout en assurant une meilleure protection de nos frontières extérieures. Les négociations ont déjà bien avancé sur une bonne partie des éléments proposés par la Commission pour réformer notre régime d’asile européen commun, notamment sur l’harmonisation des conditions d’accueil et les conditions standard de protection ainsi que sur un cadre commun de réinstallation pour renforcer les voies d’entrées légales. Nous avons également accompli des progrès sur le renforcement d’Eurodac – la base de données de l’Union européenne contenant les empreintes digitales des demandeurs d’asile – et nous avons déjà un accord politique sur le renforcement de l’agent de l’Union européenne pour l’Asie. Le Parlement s’est engagé dans toutes ces négociations avec détermination et a réussi à améliorer la qualité du texte et je voudrais saluer les efforts considérables accomplis par la présidence bulgare dans ce domaine. Mais pour finaliser un accord sur l’ensemble de la réforme de notre politique d’asile, il faut maintenant trouver un compromis sur le mécanisme de Dublin et je veux soutenir, avec tout l’appui de la Commission, les propos du président du Parlement à cet égard. Là aussi, on peut noter des avancées, en particulier la création d’un volet préventif de ce mécanisme. Prévenir la crise future est aussi important que la gestion de la crise elle-même. Mais évidemment, il faut reconnaître et respecter les différentes positions et sensibilités qui existent dans nos pays sur ces questions très délicates. Il est temps de résoudre ce problème. Tous les éléments sont sur la table, il est temps d’agir, je suis en parfait accord avec le président du Parlement européen. Ainsi, la Commission attend des chefs d’État et de gouvernement qu’ils se penchent sérieusement sur la question de Dublin et esquissent les orientations nécessaires pour parvenir à des solutions équilibrées qui aient l’appui de tous et qui soient des solutions solides et durables fondées sur nos valeurs communes. Nous risquons non seulement de perdre nos valeurs mais aussi de porter atteinte à notre humanité même si nous ne trouvons pas des solutions qui permettent de voir des personnes en crise comme des êtres humains qui ont besoin de notre aide.

Today's debate will certainly be marked by uncertainty and instability in the light of the G7 summit. That is why I would like to start with the positive message: we are all reaching the reports from Singapore on our mobile phones. If Kim and Trump agree that there is a great opportunity for a nuclear-weapon-free Korea, for a Korean peninsula that is nuclear-weapon-free, then that is a great success, and we should be glad that these results are there. Diplomacy works, sanctions also work. But I hope that Washington will recognize that diplomacy is not only good when Donald Trump signs it. We have already achieved a very positive diplomatic result with the Iran agreement. At that time, Obama signed, and that was as good as the current result that we have for Korea. If we now look at the summit, at the European Council, there is perhaps a risk that we will again describe major objectives and, in the end, perhaps come back with few results. That is why I would like to focus on highlighting two specific points where we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are now demanding clarity and results, and where there is also an opportunity to do so: the first is trade issues – an issue that concerns many who are currently worried about their jobs. Europe must give the European Commission full backing on this. Tariffs on aluminium and steel have been imposed for no reason. That is why united countermeasures, as the Commission has initiated, are the right way forward. We expect the Council to fully support this. And we also believe that the conversation is right. If Jean-Claude Juncker has now been given the task of going to Washington and talking about a world without tariffs, then that is the right approach. I would also like to add that the problem with America is also creating a number of opportunities for us Europeans at the moment. It is the case that we have seen in Canada that it is six to one. So we have many partners who are still advocating rules-based trading. We should talk to them, talk to them and, as soon as possible, with Japan, with Mexico, with whom Mercosur concludes the treaties that are now realistic. In retrospect, I would like to remind you once again that we have had a great deal of controversy here in Parliament on the issue of CETA – I would like to remind you of this once again – and we feel, in the current situation, how grateful we are that we are able to conclude such agreements, at least with Canada, with a country that is committed to our values. Ceta is still a model for the future shape of trade policy. Finally, a second point, namely the euro debate: here too, the debate is enough. I believe that we can now achieve results. The European Monetary Fund is within reach so that we can achieve independence from international structures in the future. The backstop is close. We will be able to involve parliaments more closely with the structures that are now being envisaged. In other words, this step should be taken, as should the step proposed by the Commission in December to move forward with the investment budget now. Following the reform aspect and the aspect of budgetary stabilisation, the focus is now on investment. We should make progress on this. That is why: act now, on these two points! The tailwind should give us the fact that we have great success in the euro. Since the beginning of the crisis, we have created ten million new jobs in the euro area and have growth of 2.5% – much stronger than the Americans and, by the way, the British friends. That is why the reform policy that we have been practising so far should give us a tailwind for this. I hope that the Council will no longer talk, but that these two points will be dealt with!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, this is the House of the European people and, having said that, I cannot avoid raising again and again the situation in the Mediterranean Sea. There is a boat in the middle of the sea. Many of those people – children, pregnant women – are in a disastrous situation, not for the first time and, unfortunately, perhaps not for the last time.  We have a general idea. Those who disembark in one of our countries disembark in the European Union. This is our principle. Article 80 of this Treaty speaks about responsibility and about solidarity. Yes, it is true that Italy has taken the lion’s share of the responsibility in the past, but – forgive me, dear colleagues, this is to Mr Salvini – if you need to demonstrate what you think is your strength at the expense of pregnant women and children, you have no idea how poor you are.  (Applause) This is a change in Italian politics which is by no means defendable.  And let us talk about the re—emergence of the Spanish people and the Spanish Government. Yes, Pedro Sanchez, thank you. You gave grace to the European Union again and what you did was marvellous. This is the new style of the Spanish people and of Spanish politics and we appreciate that. Thank you to the new government and all those who support it. But since this is not an isolated situation – and now we come to the Council – no, you don’t have time to postpone the issue of migration. No you cannot stay sleeping. No, there is no excuse for not doing anything and this is one of the major issues that have to be discussed in the next European Council. And this is also to Mr Kurz’s incoming Presidency. Mr Kurz, ask yourself whether you are happy. Are you still proud that you closed – this is one of your favourites – the Balkan route without any alternative? Are you still proud of your comradeship with Mr Orban, demonstrating it in each and every situation? No, we will not let him pass into this House of the People when he arrives in the second half of this year with a stance like that! This will not be the policy of my group, the Socialists and Democrats, and this will not be the policy of the European Parliament, dear friends. What we have to make clear ...  Und das bezieht sich auch auf meine Kolleginnen und Kollegen der Europäischen Volkspartei in Deutschland, lieber, verehrter Kollege Weber: Nein, das ist nicht drin! Wir können hier nicht pro-europäisch reden und zu Hause mit Orbán schäkern und die Europäische Union in einer zentralen Frage ohne Perspektive lassen. Das werden wir nicht tolerieren! Und das müssen wir auch an Frau Merkel adressieren: Nein, Frau Merkel, der Enthusiasmus, den Sie zeigen, der Enthusiasmus in Lösungen der Probleme – man kann nicht weiche Knie kriegen, nur weil Trump mit dem Handelskrieg droht. Der Wirtschaftsminister in Deutschland muss das kapieren: Das reicht nicht, was da geliefert wird! Und das gleiche gilt für unser Engagement, mit dem wir insgesamt die Europäische Union stark machen müssen. Auch Frau Merkel muss kapieren: Nur eine vereinte Europäische Union, nur eine starke Europäische Union wird in der Lage sein, unsere Gesellschaft in eine erfolgreiche Zukunft zu führen. Dafür steht meine Fraktion, dafür werden wir arbeiten. Und wir freuen uns auf die Diskussionen, die in diesem Haus zu dem Thema noch anstehen.

Chairman! Of course, it is not new that, because of national political victories, the European Union and other Member States are often used as the enemy of the ring, and after these sweet victories the national champion is crowned. However, recently, this situation has come to a new intensity, and victories are useful both for the victories of migrant workers – when in reality only a few per cent of the labour market – and for the issue of migration and the revision of the Dublin Convention. Now, in the run-up to the Council meeting, I will actually touch only a few points from the European Council's agenda. Firstly, on migration, the Dublin review and quotas as part of them. In the three years since the European Commission came up with this quota proposal, I think it is clear to everyone that this system cannot and will not work in the future, because in fact there are only a few Member States of the European Union on the map of migrants and also of the smugglers' organisers, which are the destination for these migrants to get to. All other countries are either transit countries or those that are not on the map at all, such as, say, those countries that are too poor to get there ever. Let us say, in my country, Latvia, a hundred places for migration were built – good, arranged , – shelter base, which is usually filled well, if with one third. By meeting our voluntary quotas, people who accidentally get there disappear with papers or undocumented documents in the literal days. This means that such a system does not actually work, and we have still not found other solutions in three years. The second issue is the multiannual financial budget, which will also be talked about in the Council. I think it is extremely important to stress that the European Commission's proposal, despite the Brexit cash shortfall, nevertheless creates more opportunities overall in this financial part, while at the same time a very targeted reduction in cohesion policy depending on the Member State concerned. In this case, what message is it for generations that are the new generation in these countries? We are talking about the period from 2020 to 2027, which actually means 10 years for many younger Member States, this is a message for the younger generation: 'You have a worse future than the new ones today, and that means you have to go away to those countries that are wealthier because they will even subsidise jobs for youth employment'. It is not clear whether young people coming in from other countries or only local young people.  It should be remembered that in some countries the so-called universal income base is higher than the average wage in other Member States of the European Union, and in all this common sauce it is very difficult for us to address the citizens of the European Union that there are common values, as Mr Timmermans said, that there is a common understanding of European values. It is difficult and almost impossible to explain to the citizens of such countries, the countries of the European Union, that it is.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I have to say to you that if I hear Mr Weber and then Mr Bullmann afterwards, I ask myself whether there is a government in Berlin or have I missed something?

No, it is not the same as in the past, but since the start of this mandate, Mr Timmermans, there will be more than 10 000 people who will have died in the Mediterranean Sea. And since the beginning of this year, there are 800 people, men, women and children, who have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea. And now it is the same with this boat – 600 people, seven pregnant women, pushed from country to country. It is a disgrace, it is a scandal.  I will not point my finger in this debate at one individual country, not at Malta, not at Italy. I do not think we have to point a finger at Mr Muscat and say it’s your fault, or at Mr Salvini even. I reject completely the ideas of Mr Salvini, but I think we have to point the finger not at you personally, so don’t take it personally, but at all of you, at the whole of the European Council which is not capable until this moment to take a position on this migration issue and on the reform of the Dublin system. It is a collective responsibility. I am always asking myself why we made the European Council an official institution of the European Union under the Lisbon Treaty. In the Lisbon Treaty we said, yes, the European Council has to become an official institution of the European Union, to take decisions, to steer the Union, and what we see today is exactly the opposite, the incapacity of the European Council to take a decision on this. So my question to you – I have only one simple question – is: when for God’s sake will the European Council take a decision on this migration issue, and when will you take responsibility?  I want also to urge you to do two things at the next European Council. I think there are two things you need to do. The first is to have this common position of Dublin; Mr Bullmann and others have already recalled this. But the second thing in my opinion is to do another thing, and that is to create as fast as possible, very urgently, what I call European reception centres in the transit countries so that we take our responsibility in these transit countries to give decent protection to these people, and that these people can ask in these reception centres for asylum, for protection, so that it is not necessary for them to jump into the arms and into the hands of these criminal gangs in Libya or in these gangs of human traffickers – because that is what needs doing at the moment.  And to media colleagues, the picture of the year – because everybody is talking today about what will be the picture of the year – will it be six European leaders humouring Mr Trump in Canada, or will the picture of the year be the handshake between Trump and Kim? I think, unfortunately, and to our disgrace, the picture of the year could be again another little Alan who is the victim of our bad policies on migration. I say to you Mr Tajani, I support you fully in what you said at the beginning of the debate. If the Council fails again at its next meeting, in my opinion we should really put the question if we have to invite Mr Tusk to our next meeting in July. Or more, I think we have to consider going to court under Article 265 of the Treaty. Article 265 of the Treaty will give the Commission and the European Parliament the possibility to go against the Council if the Council fails to act, which is the case here today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 8, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the expectations for this summit were indeed rather high. A lot of things are to be decided at the summit. The eurozone reforms have been mentioned – and this would be high time because we have been having a kind of eurozone crisis since 2010, so it is not really early – and also Brexit. While this is a newer topic than 2010, it is also one with a very tight deadline just around the corner and a lot of problems to solve. Then, of course, there is the migration issue that has already been addressed by many colleagues. We all know that the current Dublin rules don’t work. We have been saying this for years here in Parliament. We have been making proposals for years about how to fix it and it hasn’t been getting better. We all know the pictures of overcrowded camps in Greece. We all know about the refugees living on the streets in Italy. We all know this constant blame game between different countries – whichever it is at the moment – and it is outrageous how this is going. It is always countries trying to say that they want the lowest number of refugees possible so the only thing they can ever do is close the borders, but that is not a policy that we can carry out as the European Union if we value anything of our own and if we stand at all for the human rights that we tell other countries that they should adhere to.  So Dublin urgently needs to be reformed. This Parliament has shown how it can be done. The thing about this Parliament is that we are not some sort of weird extra—territorial something parliament, but we are the same parties, the same countries, present here as are present in the Council and as are going to be present at the summit. So I wonder why it is that if we – same country, same parties – can come to an agreement, why can’t the Heads of State and Government do that? I really don’t see any reason, except for lack of political will and a lack of will to lead somewhere, to help people and to really go to the heart of the matter.  Without solidarity, our common European asylum policy is bound to fail, and Member States are already engaged in this vicious circle of deterrence and responsibility shifting. So yes, it is outrageous that Italy cannot follow the principle – the most basic humanitarian and sea law – but also, Malta has not wanted to open its port for years. We didn’t hear anything from France. So I’m really thankful to Spain, but this cannot be the only solution. We also see in other countries – Austria, Denmark, Germany – that everyone is closing their borders; everyone is settling on deterrence. So human rights have become a matter of campaigning in the European Union. We are doing politics – pretty much all parties are doing politics – on the back of those most vulnerable. I think that this is totally unacceptable in a European Union that is worth any of what Mr Timmermans mentioned before. It is also very interesting that the approaching Austrian Presidency has told the Bulgarian Presidency that ‘Dublin is dead’. That is probably also quite unprecedented.  On the eurozone reform – thank you for reminding us of that – it is urgent that we fix the problems there. The problems are known. There are solutions on the table and, while we Greens don’t agree with all the details of what Mr Macron has put forward, at least there is someone who has put proposals forward. So we should finally get somewhere and the German Government cannot hide any longer. They also need to get their act together, finally get real and offer something, because this is something that all Member States should understand. They should not hide behind what they call their national interests. Actually it is in their national interests to have a strong and functioning European Union and a strong and functioning eurozone. This is something that is in all of our interests. The world is turning less and less predictable. All the Member States should be so happy that they have a reliable and strong Union that they are part of and a strong partnership that they are part of, but they need to do something for it and they might even need to pay euro or two for it, but I think it is worth it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Gabriele ZIMMER", "mepid": "28248", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the We are talking to the Commission and the current Presidency of the Council here in the European Parliament a few days before the next summit. All we can say is that it is now a ritualised form, that we meet here every time, then have a meeting again after the summit and state that we have not made any progress! I think this also has something to do with the way policy is present, both in the Member States and in the EU institutions. We take far too little account of what is happening in our societies, in the Member States, in the EU, and what is happening outside the EU. A lot of people are from outside the policy we offer. And we allow it, that, in the end, the whole problem, including that of the migration crisis, the asylum crisis, within the European Union, the inability to really develop common solidarity and feel responsible, leads us to the right, right-wing populists, right-wing extremists, nationalists, to roll out the red carpet and ultimately invite them to tell the people who live in poverty, to abuse them, to abuse their plight, to ultimately say that these societies are divided, and that we must oppose the idea of solidarity. I do not think that this can and must not remain the case. We have a shared responsibility here. And with regard to the ship, the Aquarius: Yes, thanks to Spain and also – as I had heard in the meantime – to the state government of Corsica to want to help here. But one thing is really clear: we cannot believe that we are actually able to develop a sustainable European Union policy that confronts the global problem of migration in the first place, with only spontaneous rescue operations. We can also – and I can see differences between us – but we cannot believe that, in the course of the Dublin negotiations, we believe that we are building a system of foreclosure, which also includes the blanket rejection of asylum seekers, of refugees from so-called 'safe third countries', for example.B from the Maghreb countries. We must also take note of the fact that the deals with Turkey and Libya remain very problematic. Mr Verhofstadt, you mentioned a number of figures a very few years ago. I would like to add one: since we have these deals, 3,000 people have drowned or died in the Mediterranean. This is also part of a realistic assessment of what we can do, what we need to do, what we are obliged to do. The Bulgarian Presidency has tried to draw up a proposal which I also do not think has been successful. I do not believe that it will work to say in a three-stage procedure that only in certain situations can other countries be expected to participate more or to provide greater financial benefits. The core problem will remain. Are the member states prepared to take in a minimum number of refugees together and to ensure that they act together and in solidarity with each other in crisis situations? That must be our point! That is what we are going to fight for! We are all calling for this! We need the solution now, not at some point! We cannot wait any longer for any government to have mercy on a ship. We have to create basic rules, and we should refrain from believing that if we build walls, then these walls are only directed outwards – they are also directed inwards.

But we’re not really any closer to leaving the European Union than we were the day after the referendum. Mrs May is a remainer who doesn’t really want to leave and, of course, as you found out, she couldn’t negotiate her way out of a wet paper bag. The whole process for the last two years has been about to delay and impede in the hope of eventually overturning the result of the referendum. This week the Commons votes on the Withdrawal Bill, and that’s entirely dependent upon this House voting on the Withdrawal Agreement later this year. Of course, you could vote against it. The whole thing then reverts to square one, like a game of political snakes and ladders. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Under the right leadership, Britain could leave the European Union quickly and decisively, and this is how it should be done. First of all, forget Article 50 – that’s your device, not ours. Parliament should repeal the European Communities Act of 1973 as a first step, and then we would have left under our law, not your law. We can offer you a free trade agreement with everything except the free movement of people, or trade on WTO terms. It’s going to be your choice anyway: take it or leave it, one way or the other. And we could easily reach an agreement on the reciprocal rights of citizens. Parliament can then repeal or amend all the EU-derived law in accordance with its own timescales and priorities, and I’m sure that can be done in a spirit of friendly cooperation with our good friends here in Europe. Her Majesty’s government shouldn’t be asking the European Union how it can leave; it should be telling you how it’s going to work. But, of course, that is never going to happen under Mrs May. Mrs May should go now and make way for a prime minister who actually wants to leave the European Union.

Chartered by a so-called humanitarian NGO, the ship was carrying more than 600 illegal migrants.  The smugglers' mafias that thrive on human trafficking, encouraged by the irresponsible rhetoric of some European leaders, led by Mrs Merkel, had promised these migrants a European Eldorado that does not exist, which no longer exists!

Furthermore, it is damaging to community relations in Northern Ireland.

I can go on to say seamlessly what our President has just said: we need a breakthrough on two issues at the European Council, at the summit: this is the issue of asylum, and that is the deepening of economic and monetary union. On the subject of asylum, I can only say that we need common rules that control and limit immigration. We cannot leave it to the people smugglers to decide who can or cannot come to Europe. I very much hope that progress will now be made at the summit. I would like to use my speaking time to talk about the deepening of economic and monetary union. Let me perhaps begin by saying – looking back – that the fathers of the euro actually did a good job more than 25 years ago with the Maastricht Treaty and with the Stability and Growth Pact, that we have actually created a working, firm framework, that sensible rules and mechanisms have been developed to keep the euro stable. After the financial and economic crisis of 2007, this has been further developed. However, I believe that the framework that was set at that time still applies today, namely that the Member States are also responsible for their own finances. This means that we should not move on to a debt union, to a shift of risk or liability. I believe that we should stick to the fundamental values of economic and monetary union. For me, the most important thing is still that the rules of stability are respected. This is the best protection against crises. If I send this in advance, I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that you can understand that I can only gain something from the proposals to deepen economic and monetary union in individual areas. I think it is a good thing that we are creating a European Monetary Fund. But here, too, I think it is important that conditionality applies. Conditionality is the be-all and end-all for me. In other words, aid yes, but against structural reforms, otherwise it simply does not work. We must finally address the enormous reduction in the risks of the banks. I would simply like to encourage this once again and perhaps ask the Commission again why we are not finally starting to move away from the zero weighting of government bonds.

The world is changing, it is so clear, and it is also clear that we need a strong Europe, a united Europe, to protect people. The solution is certainly not closing the borders, but neither is the solution to keep open borders without protecting people. We need to have a Europe which is open but protecting people.  This is the case when we organise the European border. Of course we need to ensure that we have a proper European asylum system to protect refugees who are looking for our help, but when we negotiate trade agreements we need to ensure we are open to the world but we need to protect our people and our standards.  If we want a Europe that protects, the next European Council must push the negotiations on the European budget also for a budget which will be there to protect people. I am concerned, on behalf of my group, that the current proposal on the Community budget does not ensure the proper level of economic and social vision of cohesion. This is too weak to ensure our unity. The same applies to the proposals to reform the eurozone, because we don’t have proposals to ensure strong investment to converge, to ensure that the social pillar is really applied everywhere.

I hope you will explicitly mention those who are not living up to their responsibilities and that you will mention those who feel responsible for the needs of others.

Big problems, we've all seen, are emerging in Italy, but you have problems again and on the so-called Balkan route, you have problems through Bosnia and Herzegovina, where new migrations are happening and coming to Croatia's borders. You know that Croatia is a country with 1300 kilometers of the external border of the European Union, and at the same time we have a wire on the Hungarian border, on the Austrian border, on the Slovenian border. We don't think wire is the answer, so we need to solve this problem together through an asylum system. It also seems to me that Schengen is very shaken. If we put checks within the Schengen borders, then at the same time the whole Union is shaken. Therefore, I think the solution is that croatia finally gets political consent together with Romania and Bulgaria to enter the Schengen area and thus solve problems together.

I think the answer lies in the concept of moral hazard. There is a lack of confidence between the Member States that the other state will do what they agreed to do to find a solution. Indeed, Italy and Greece for a very long time complained and said ‘you’re leaving us alone; we need to find a solution; Dublin doesn’t work; we’re swamped; we’re overwhelmed by the numbers of refugees arriving’. And then for too long they got the answer ‘that’s Dublin, deal with it. It’s your task’.  And then of course, we arrived at a situation of waving through, and this led to a lot of suspicion in other Member States: they’re not doing their job; they’re waving through refugees in large numbers. So there is no state that can claim to be completely innocent in the situation we have found ourselves now.  I also believe there is some criticism possible if people in Italy keep saying ‘we were left completely alone; we were completely abandoned’. Yes, for a long time that was true, but I find it difficult to explain that when I go to Germany. Look at the numbers of refugees that were taken in in Germany. Look at the number of refugees that were taken in in Sweden. An incredibly vast problem is now the integration of these refugees in many countries. As long as we keep refusing the idea that we have a collective problem that can only be tackled with collective solutions, we will not find a solution. As long as Member States just stick to their own solution and say ‘we are the only ones who are right’ and as long as the rest of the Union does not do what we do, we will not find a solution. And we will fail collectively.  Given the size of the migration challenge the world faces, not just Europe, given the developments in Africa, do you really think that building walls and fences and refusing to accept ships is going to bring a solution? Will that stop the pressure? Do you really think that if we do not stick together on this, individual Member States will be able to reach agreements with the states of origin to take back their migrants if they do not have the right to asylum? Do you really think that, individually, we can create a prospect for Africa that will allow young Africans to see a future in their own countries instead of feeling the need to come to Europe? Do you really think that if we take away a bit of the humanity of people on ships and say these are just migrants, that we will continue our policy on the basis of our values and human rights? Don’t you agree that by denying other people’s humanity, we take away part of our own humanity? Doesn’t that kill us morally if we continue like that? I am not saying everyone who wants to come to Europe should be welcomed, but I am saying we need to put an end to the dying in the Mediterranean. This can only be done if Europe collectively devises stronger protection of our external borders; if we finally devise a common European asylum policy; if we finally make headway in having agreements with the countries of origin so that they take back the citizens; if we finally have a realistic plan of investment in Africa so that Africa develops in a way that makes people want to stay in Africa; and if we finally come to terms with the fact that in a time of crisis, and one or two or three of our Member States are overwhelmed, they should be able to count on the solidarity of all Member States. The only way we will find a sustainable solution for the migration issue – which will not go away, whatever we do – is if we do all these things at the same time. According to your political preferences, you have a preference for one or other of the solutions, but none of you can close your eyes to the fact that you can only deal with it if all these solutions are part of our approach. And if we do not do this as Europeans, who else will? Member States will not be able to do it on their own, whatever their policies are. Let me end on one point. We are at a risk, in this time of turbulence and huge challenges, of falling into the trap of entering into Faustian deals. To handle the migration issue, perhaps we should not have as much of the rule of law or the respect for human rights as is good for us. Please, please, stay away from that Faustian deal, because you will lose on all scores. What is the price of unity of the European Union? Should the price of unity of the European Union be ‘let’s not make a point of the rule of law and human rights just so we can have unity’? I can guarantee you if respect for the rule of law and human rights is no longer a quintessential element of our Union, we will lose human rights, the rule of law and the European Union. That is a price that is far too high to pay.

All of you underlined that reform of the asylum system needs to strike the right balance between responsibility and solidarity. I can assure you that the Presidency also shares your sense of urgency. I would like to share with you that the Bulgarian Presidency has taken as its point of departure not only the conclusions of the European Council of October 2017, which tasked us with seeking consensus and with looking for ways to keep the right balance between responsibility and solidarity in order to ensure resilience to future crises, but also the results of the negotiations under the previous Presidencies, which called for a comprehensive approach to the whole area of asylum reform.  Based on this, we have built into the Dublin Regulation a new approach and a new crisis mechanism for managing the migration and asylum systems in the Union when under pressure. It tries to strike a balance between responsibility and solidarity by including clear criteria for determining the responsibility for asylum applicants which don’t shift or seize easily. The amended rules make the procedure more efficient so that pull factors and secondary movements are effectively prevented. We believe that the text of the Dublin Regulation, resulting from the discussions led by our Presidency in the last five months, offers a good and fair basis for striking the requested balance between responsibility and solidarity. The process is now being led by the President of the European Council, and it will be up to him and the leaders to look for further compromises that will help reach a consensus in view of the meeting of the Heads of State and Government at the end of June. I am confident that the Council will make every effort to find a solution and an agreement on a mandate for negotiations with the Parliament, as we all agree that Dublin III needs to be revised.  In terms of the trade questions, I would like to say that the European Union is sending a strong message on its ambition for an open, rule-based trading system, and all trade and external relations are on the agenda. But I cannot prejudge the outcome of the leaders’ discussion. In terms of the eurozone and the completion of the banking union, we also cannot prejudge what the leaders will decide at the June Euro summit, but I would like to say that the Presidency worked hard so that the Council could finally agree on a general approach on the banking package last month. The Council certainly looks forward to working with the Parliament to bring this file to implementation, hopefully still in the coming months. Progress on the banking package gives me reason to be optimistic that the leaders can, later this month, reach concrete results around the issue of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, likely in the context of the broader and not yet finalised work on the European Stability Mechanism. Progress on the European Deposit Insurance Scheme will take more time, but it has not been ruled out that the political discussions could still start in the coming months.  In terms of Brexit, I would like to say that unity among our institutions is paramount, and we value the contributions that the European Parliament is making through its resolutions. We expect this to continue until the end of the negotiations. We attach the utmost importance to safeguarding the rights of European Union citizens in the United Kingdom and vice versa, and to those citizens being able to effectively enforce their rights. The UK has given credible guarantees to this effect, as now translated in the text of the Withdrawal Agreement. It remains to ensure that this is implemented in a faithful and enforceable way.  There are actually many other important issues on the table for the leaders in June, and it would be really naive to expect that they can all be solved easily and rapidly. Some will require further time and effort, but it’s important to continue to build common ground. In accordance with well—established practice, President Tusk will be in plenary on 3 July 2018 for an open debate with you on the progress achieved on those topics, for, in the face of global turbulence, we should make sure not only that we remain united in dealing with the immediate consequences of instability, but that we – the three institutions together – also continue to work to shape the course of the years ahead in the interests of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 81, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate of ours is taking place at a decisive stage for the future of Europe and the euro area. We acknowledge that the Commission has put on the table a wide range of proposals outlining the pillars of a more complete economic and monetary union that is better able to generate growth, employment, cohesion and shock resistance. We note, however, that some of these proposals define more of the instruments that we need to be fully implemented and that remain critical. The most important proposal is undoubtedly the introduction of a macroeconomic stabilisation instrument, through an investment protection fund, during the adverse phases of the cycle. This is a decisive function because the absorption of asymmetric shocks cannot be effectively carried out by monetary policy or by national budgets. If we had already had this instrument during the crisis, we would probably have spared the second recession and all its economic, social and political consequences.  To those who talk about moral hazard, we point out that, on the contrary, this instrument would provide an incentive for responsible budgetary policies and the correction of macroeconomic imbalances. It is therefore a good thing that there is a proposal, even if it appears to be inadequate in terms of size, and an unemployment benefit would be a more effective and transparent automatic stabiliser. In line with the recommendations of this Parliament, it is also the programme of support for reforms. Here it is important that the concept of structural reforms is adapted to the real challenges of today's world, which do not require a devaluation of work and price competitiveness, but a capacity for innovation and development that is also based on a cohesive society.  As far as crisis management is concerned, the proposal to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism, which makes it independent of the International Monetary Fund and expands the range of instruments at its disposal, starting with the backstop proposal for the Bank Resolution Fund, is positive. On this point, however, I would like to express parliament's frustration at the obvious intention of the Member States not to follow the Commission's proposal to integrate the Fund into the legal framework of the Union. I would like to make it clear once and for all that the justification used for this choice, namely that otherwise the power of control of the national parliaments would be reduced, is not true, it is one. From this point of view, nothing would change if we followed the path proposed by the Commission. As has already been said many times, the European Parliament would not use its right of consent to alter the institutional balance of a body that uses the resources of the Member States.  Finally, I would like to advise some Member States to avoid wording on mechanisms for restructuring sovereign debts that are not only counterproductive to financial stability but would also result in the necessary unanimity for the reform of the ESM. With regard to the allocation of budgetary policy monitoring tasks to the new fund, I repeat that it would not only be wrong, but would clearly violate the European Treaties, and it is not, quite rightly, in the Commission's proposal.  The Commission's package also includes the incorporation of Article 3 of the Fiscal Compact into European legislation. I have to say here that the Commission has missed an opportunity. We must simplify and improve our budgetary rules, and this would require, firstly, a different treatment of investment expenditure and the avoiding of procyclical mechanisms. It is clear that the proposal presented on the Fiscal Compact will not go far and that a long way must be done to adapt our budgetary rules to the challenges of the times. Finally, it should be reiterated to everyone, including in this Parliament, that without a mechanism that ensures the same level of deposit protection, not only banking union but also monetary union itself is incomplete.  Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Parliament will seek to improve the Commission's proposals and ensure consistency between them and the MFF. We hope that a minimalist concept will not prevail among the Member States, which would risk not making us make full use of the decisive window of opportunity represented by this last term of office.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 86, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank you for this timely oral question on the deepening of our economic and monetary union. Democratic accountability is one of the key principles on which this work is based, and I am happy to be here to respond and to hear your views. A well—functioning EMU is at the core of EU integration. Our economic and monetary union is more resilient now than it was before the crisis, but the work is not yet complete. A more integrated and performing euro area is needed to bring increased stability and prosperity to all Europeans. Reconciling very different views on these matters is sometimes difficult, but we are making some progress. The general approach on the 2016 banking package at the May Ecofin is a major milestone that lays the basis for further progress on the banking union, including on the risk-sharing side. We hope that at the June Summit it will be possible to take the concrete decisions which are expected, notably regarding the completion of the banking union and further development of the European Stability Mechanism. We would like to see agreement on key principles and clear milestones for future work. Coming more specifically to Mr Gualtieri’s questions on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): with regard to the integration of the ESM into the EU legal framework, regrettably the Council has not yet started legislative negotiations on the Commission’s proposal, as several Member States are not in favour of anchoring the ESM in EU law. However, there is general support for the goal of converting the ESM into the European Monetary Fund. Discussions on related issues, such as the role of the ESM as a backstop for a Single Resolution Fund or the new ESM instruments, are taking place in an intergovernmental format. The Commission’s position is that integration of the ESM into the EU legal framework is important to allow full accountability and democratic and judicial oversight of ESM activities, to promote the interests of the whole Union and to ensure swift and timely ESM actions under the well—defined framework. The Commission also considers that any reforms of the ESM should not undermine the institutional prerogatives set out in the Treaties, in particular when it comes to fiscal and economic surveillance. We also remain convinced that the incorporation of ESM into the Union framework can be done by means of Article 352 of the Treaty. We also maintain that Article 126(14) is an appropriate legal basis for the directive transposing into Union law the key provisions as set out in the fiscal compact. This legal basis has also been used in the past to introduce comparable fiscal rules and obligations. As regards the involvement of the European Parliament, let me recall that we put the community method at the centre of the EMU package precisely to increase transparency and accountability. The Community method would increase the European Parliament’s and the national parliaments’ oversight of EU economic governance. The Commission attaches great importance to the views of the European Parliament. In preparing our proposals we have taken into consideration the recent own—initiative reports on the budgetary capacity of the eurozone; the Böge-Berès report on the possible evolutions and adjustments of the current institutional set up of the European Union; the Verhofstadt report; and, on improving the functioning of the European Union, building on the potential of the Lisbon Treaty, the Brok-Bresso report. We look forward to the input from the European Parliament in a formal legislative process and remain fully available to hold regular exchanges of views and debate on these topics. A first exchange of views took place in the ECON Committee on 27 March with Commissioner Moscovici and myself. Finally, let me say a few words on the two EMU-related proposals, which we adopted on 31 May in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The European Investment Stabilisation Function will help Member States to absorb large asymmetric shocks by helping to protect public investment levels. It will work through a provision of loans of up to EUR 30 billion, guaranteed by the EU budget, and grants to cover the related interest costs. To receive this support, Member States will have to comply with strict eligibility criteria based on sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies. The Reform Support Programme will provide financial and technical support to the structural reforms. A budget of EUR 25 billion will be divided among three instruments: a reform delivery tool providing financial support for agreed reform packages (EUR 22 billion), a technical support instrument continuing the successful experience with the current Structural Reform Support Programme (EUR 840 million), and a convergence facility to offer dedicated financial and technical support to those non-euro-area Member States that take demonstrable steps towards adopting the euro (EUR 2.16 billion). The package will complement other EU programmes and funds in support of jobs and growth, notably the Structural and Cohesion Funds and the new Invest EU Fund. An important theme of our MFF proposal is a stronger link between the EU budget and the European Semester, which is a framework for economic policy coordination. It is now time to decide and to live up to our commitments to reform the EMU. Our end goal is to achieve better living and social standards for all Europeans. That is what matters in the end.

Despite all of the pain of the financial and sovereign debt crisis, Europe has come back strongly. We are living through a jobs-rich recovery. That success is based on prudent budgeting, new investment, structural reforms and a commitment to stick to the rules of the fiscal compact. Firstly, it is absolutely useless dreaming up new ideas if we’re not delivering on what we said we would do already. Let us deliver on our existing commitments. Secondly, if you’re a small, big or medium-sized country, the rules apply to everyone. And thirdly, whatever change is proposed, it must be an inclusive format. That means, from our perspective, no euro-area parliament, no railroading of small or indeed any Member States. So where do we go from now? I see five areas of potential improvement. I think we need to complete the Banking Union, to deliver on the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). That means risk-sharing and risk reduction must go hand in hand. It means a credible resolution of the NPL problem. Secondly, Europe must be open for business, which means more trade deals, delivering on the potential of the single market economy and freeing the EU economy of protectionism. We also need a functioning capital markets union for new finance, alongside Juncker’s / the EFSI plan. Turning the ESM into a fully-fledged European Monetary Fund makes sense, but it needs to be accountable to this Parliament. We also need to be prepared to reform and turn the European budget – the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) – into an instrument of innovation and growth. Could we do the impossible, colleagues? That is, agree a better budget by the time of the next European Parliament elections. We need to – it would send out a powerful signal from this House, were we to obtain that agreement. Finally, I hope that once and for all, the idea of having an EU finance minister is dropped. It is a crazy proposal. It sends out the wrong message to national parliaments, to EU citizens. It does not have national public support. It is a weapon of euroscepticism.

However, there is a link between the two and it is clear when Mrs Merkel tells us: 'We will discuss the eurozone budget after discussing the multi-year financial framework'. So what will be left to organize the parallel path of these two tools? My second point is about the stabilisation function and how the European Commission has put a proposal to that effect on the table. The fact that you recognize that this function must be fulfilled, the fact that you put a proposal on the table, is obviously welcome, but recognise that when we call your proposal an embryo, we are almost below reality, because those in this Chamber and elsewhere are still trying to learn from the conduct of business by the IMF who do not listen sufficiently to the IMF, which is listening sufficiently to the IMF, which is from this point of view, tells us that we need a real automatic stabiliser, as we also said in the Berès-B-ge report you quoted. My third thought is on the transformation of the European Stability Mechanism into a European Monetary Fund. We urge you not to use this terminology, it must be a European stabilisation fund. The monetary fund cannot be shifted within the European Union. We support the Commission to ensure that this does not lead to the detracting of your budgetary competences and we are also at your side to advocate for the Community method to be fully implemented in this area.

Will that be an EMF according to the strict version of Mr Schäuble, the former German finance minister, or will that be the more lax interpretation of the European Commission? If I look at the origins of that idea of the EMF, you end up in 2010 with an op-ed in The Economist written by Daniel Gross and Thomas Meyer. The European Commission then proceeded with the idea of an EMF. What is interesting is that six months ago, in December 2017, Gross and Meyer wrote an update of their paper assessing and analysing the European Commission's proposals. And what's their conclusion? They wanted a European Monetary Fund that would provide more fiscal discipline and stronger debt management. When I look at the Commission's proposals, it seems to be seeking yet another solidarity mechanism, when we know that transfers encourage irresponsible behaviour rather than taking more responsibility. Gross and Meyer also saw the EMF as a non-political institution that can judge neutrally and economically. They also want to talk about an exit scenario from the euro, which is not a taboo. Both proposals are again not supported by the European Commission. In summary: The Commission threatens to encourage irresponsibility. And suddenly she is surprised that the northern Member States do not want to play along, that the northern Member States want to hold the reins and want an intergovernmental solution. It is clear what needs to be done. It is time for the Commission to change tack.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Ramon TREMOSA i BALCELLS", "mepid": "97203", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, just a couple of ideas in two minutes. On the European Monetary Fund, I think double accountability will have to be introduced. National parliaments should continue to be in charge of accounting for their programmes and actions from the IMF, but so should the European Parliament. How can we explain to our voters that the European Parliament – the institution that wants to represent democracy in the EU – does not have a say over the conditions in bailouts? This anomaly needs to be addressed – otherwise, if MEPs cannot decide on Europe-wide important issues, why should people go to vote in the next European elections? By excluding the European Parliament from crucial decisions, the ground is ready for the next generation of eurosceptics. The second idea: on the other hand, it is important that the fiscal compact is implemented through EU law. I think it is a good moment to check how its application has worked in different Member States, and how we can improve it. For example, in the case of Spain, the central government has arbitrarily put a much more stringent deficit objective to regional governments than to the central government. This has been a way to force cuts in welfare state and social policies. Similarly, many local governments in Spain with very low debt are not allowed by the central government to use the cash they have in the banks for investments on social policies. So control of excessive spending should not be a new excuse for recentralisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, it will be almost 150 years since Germany is unified and it has been reunited for 30 years. This political union had been preceded by a customs and monetary union and, since then, Germany has not been economically homogeneous. But no one doubts its durability. So what makes Germany stand together? Politically, of course, a common language and institutions; economically, it is a single market governed by widely shared fiscal and social rules.  This federal tax feeds into a federal budget of more than 10% of GDP, which, together with federal social security, are extremely robust mechanisms of economic solidarity. In addition, there is even a system of direct budget transfers between regions, so that, to date, three regions contribute more to the federation than they receive, and the other thirteen are the other. I take Germany as an example because it is both the Member State to which the Economic and Monetary Union benefits the most and one of those where resistance to any change in the structure of the euro is strongest. Germany's history shows us above all how economic and monetary union should evolve if it is to avoid disintegrating. We have built a single market and then a single currency backed by a federal central bank, but in this market and in the face of the rest of the world, Member States are barely regulated in fiscal, social and commercial competition and the only economic redistribution mechanism we have is the very modest budget of the European Union, which represents 1% of GDP. Is it any wonder that this package produces divergence rather than convergence? To believe that the euro has a future in this context is a denial of reality. If we want to give it a future, the solutions are known: banking union, including the common deposit guarantee; a much more robust common budget with its own revenues, typically a fraction of corporate tax or CO2 price; Finally, in the absence of social and fiscal unification, we must at least abandon competition in favour of cooperation. Without this, the return to national currencies will be inevitable. Some, including in this room, want it, either because they believe that the political will to carry out the necessary reforms will never exist, or because they believe that the nation-state is the only space where democratic sovereignty can be exercised. That is not our choice. We are convinced that the end of the single currency would lead the European Union in its wake into a spiral of decomposition, which would leave the Member States as pawns in the face of multinationals, in a situation where the Trumps, Putins or Xis of this world would be happy to rise against each other to our common detriment. We Europeans will soon be 5% of the world's population. Whether we like it or not, our unity is the condition of our sovereignty, political and fiscal sovereignty, social and economic sovereignty. So I ask you: is Donald Trump going to be the catalyst for this awareness? We hope so, but we do not see the signs yet. On the contrary, we still see too many Member States presenting the issue in a moral light: the virtuous states of the north should not subsidise the fishing states of the south. To these, I would like to point out that Germany, the country in which this moralizing discourse is omnipresent, Mr President, is also the home of Deutsche Bank, one of the most rotten banks on the planet and a car industry that has knowingly deceived citizens for decades. No one, no country, has a monopoly on virtue or vice!

It is a crazy model, based solely on exports and the reduction of domestic costs, and it is a model that is creating destruction and that depends too much on the decisions of foreign countries, as the war on tariffs is demonstrating at the moment.  Italy will not sink out of the folly of following the wrong macroeconomic instrument. Italy will reject any reform proposal that does not start from the desire to reduce these imbalances. No to the European Monetary Fund. Italian citizens will no longer put a euro and will no longer send a euro to Brussels to receive it back in time of need with conditionalities imposed.

The Monetary Union, as well as the EU, is a work in progress. That’s why the Commission has proposed that the Package be released in December. This forms a very good basis for the debate on how to improve the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the EU. But this package is by no way a replacement for responsible and good economic policy in the Member States: we can only achieve a successful, stable and growing Europe with such reforms.  Not all parts of the package have the same importance and same urgency. Let me mention just two that I consider the most important. The first is the European Monetary Fund: I believe that this proposal is a hectic way of creating the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (ESFM)/European Stability Mechanism (ESM), and it can incorporate other policies into the framework of this huge amount of money that is used for supporting and strengthening European policy. I guess this is a good proposal.  The second one is completion of ongoing initiatives, especially in the area of the banking union.

We also believe that the less complex, more efficient and more transparent the governance, the more effective its scrutiny. This relationship should be an underlying principle in the ongoing reforms.  We also believe that an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission could provide for better parliamentary scrutiny of different elements of economic governance.

The impact of this type of fishing is very important from an economic, social and environmental point of view. That is why we have asked the Commission to assess the role of recreational fishing in the future common fisheries policy, including multiannual plans, so that both types of commercial and recreational fishing can be managed in a balanced, fair and sustainable manner. At the same time, there is a problem with the lack, or in some cases the total absence, of available and up-to-date data. Let us remember, however, that the EFF provides funding for the collection of data on recreational fishing as well. That is why we have asked the Commission to extend the future scope of the EMFF, to provide financial support for research and analysis of the data collected and thus to fund monitoring projects for species most subject to recreational fishing.  We have also called on the Commission to establish a data register available to researchers, in order to constantly monitor and assess the state of fish stocks. Here, too, funding could be used under the EFF. Finally, we have addressed the issue of the definition of recreational fishing, an important definition, so that the activity is different from the illegal, undeclared and unregulated activity. This is a crucial issue, because only as a result of proper definition and regulation will it be possible to defend the interests of commercial and recreational fishermen, guaranteeing the protection of the environment and stocks, because there must not be a conflict between the two types of fishing, but cooperation in the protection of resources.

The idea that recreational fisheries – something that has been self—regulating for as long as human civilisation has existed, or indeed longer – needs to be brought within the jurisdiction of the European Union and subjected to the strictures of the common fisheries policy is a measure of the ambition that we have in these Brussels institutions. The European Union, I think, has learned from the bad PR of the last time that it tried to do this, when it was literally wanting to count every fish landed, even from people fishing on the rocks. It has now done what it usually does, which is to pay for a lobby group, supposedly representing the anglers, who are in fact a group created by the Commission, and then pretend that the legislation is representative of the sector.

Of course, the EU can contribute by organising and co-financing various exchange programmes, such as ERASMUS, but it does not organise teaching, and therefore we should not cross these borders, although I understand that some colleagues are improving parliamentary statistics with these reports.

The European Parliament's report makes it clear that teachers must be involved in the reform not as guinea pigs, but as co-creators. However, the education leadership is doing the complete opposite with us and ignoring teachers' demands for the necessary changes. For the foreseeable future, we face challenges such as robotisation. The best option to remain competitive for Slovakia is precisely investment in education. Schools must be the centre of critical thinking, training, problem solving, teamwork, relationship building. I am very sorry that our children themselves feel that the only way to get a quality education is to study abroad.

You know that just a few hours ago the United States and the DPRK ended their summit in Singapore. Today’s summit between the two proves that diplomacy and dialogue are the only way forward, in this case towards lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and beyond. Let me say that, in more general terms, this is a clear sign of the fact that the diplomatic track is often challenging, is often the most difficult one to be followed, but it is always the rewarding one and needs to be sustained over time. It was the same track that the international community and the European Union followed for over a decade with Iran, resulting in the signing, almost exactly three years ago, of the nuclear deal. We did it because it was in our security interest – our European security interest and the global security interest. Through this deal we prevented nuclear proliferation, we avoided a regional escalation and we made sure that Iran would never acquire a nuclear weapon – ever. Three years on, the deal is delivering. Iran abides by its nuclear-related commitments, as has been confirmed 11 times by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the last time was just a few weeks ago. Our position as Europeans has not changed. On the contrary, we have seen the reasons why this agreement was a good agreement. We remain committed to the full and effective implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran. What today is different is that on 8 May the United States took the unilateral decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal with Iran, which is a multilateral agreement unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council with resolution 2231. The European Union reacted in an immediate and united manner, as also agreed at the top level by the Heads of State and Government of all European Union Member States, in Sofia, on 16 May and reconfirmed, just a couple of weeks ago, by the Foreign Ministers of the 28 Member States at our last Foreign Affairs Council. Since a month ago, the bulk of the international community has confirmed and reiterated the strong support for the nuclear agreement with Iran, simply for a very pragmatic reason – that there is no better alternative and the world cannot afford a nuclear arms race. In particular, I would add, the world cannot afford a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.  This support from the rest of the international community is something I experience every single day in my meetings, be it with the Chinese Foreign Minister or the Japanese Foreign Minister or the African Union Chairman or our colleagues from Latin America or the rest of Europe that are not part of the European Union. This features always very high on the agenda. How can we partner together and make sure that the agreement stays in place. And, let me say, here the European Union has a responsibility also to share with partners around the world, which is how to maintain one of the few functioning pillars of the nuclear non—proliferation architecture.  This support was also reiterated by the other co—signatories of the nuclear agreement – France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. We convened and we chaired, as the European Union, the first Joint Commission without the United States on 25 May in Vienna. The work on the implementation of nuclear—related commitments continues. This is essential for security. For instance, the Arak reactor modernisation project led by China continues, as does the conversion of the Fordow facility into a Nuclear Physics and Technology Centre, a project led by Russia. A dedicated workshop on Fordow is foreseen to take place later this week.  It is essential for our own security and for the security of the region that implementation work continues and we are guaranteeing that this happens, regardless of the US withdrawal. Implementation must continue, both on the nuclear commitments and also on the economic track, because the other essential part of the nuclear deal is the lifting of sanctions and the opportunities it creates for normalised trade and economic relations. From this perspective, the US decision to withdraw from the JCPOA and to re—impose all secondary sanctions is extremely problematic and needs to be addressed, first of all by the European Union, by its Member States, and by the rest of the international community at large. Many European companies have chosen to do business with Iran after the agreement was signed and are doing so in good faith, based on commitments made by the international community, as I said, based on the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution unanimously adopted. Some of them have already announced now that they would discontinue their engagement so as to avoid US penalties. Others have informed that they would withdraw from negotiations that had already started – leaving, by the way, the economic investment space to other players in the world, which also is not in the European interest. This has created, as you can imagine, and as you know, enormous pressure inside Iran, especially from those who have always opposed the agreement, and the credibility of the entire international community, of the multilateral system, of the UN system, is being questioned. The recent statements by Iran on uranium hexafluoride must be seen in this context. These announcements are clearly not a violation of the nuclear deal, but it is also clear they do not contribute to build confidence and they are meant to put pressure on the international community. The letter sent by President Rouhani to the Heads of State and Government of France, Germany and the UK is to be interpreted exactly in the same context.  It’s clear that our strategic and security interest is to save, to preserve this nuclear deal. We have reacted in a firm, decisive and united manner to protect at the same time our security interests, and let me say, in this way, our economic sovereignty. This is also an incentive, I would say the incentive, for Iran to continue to comply with its nuclear restrictions. Any other alternative could have tragic consequences and it would make us all less secure, with no exceptions.  As a first major step, last Wednesday, the European Commission adopted two delegated acts. The first is an update of the blocking statute, which forbids EU companies to comply with US secondary sanctions. The second is an extension of the lending mandate of the European Investment Bank to support economic activities in Iran. After a period of non—objection, both acts should enter into force on 5 August, just before the first batch of US sanctions takes effect on 6 August. The support of this Parliament to conclude both processes swiftly will be of the essence and extremely important, also as a political sign. We are also working on concrete measures aimed at sustaining our cooperation in key economic sectors, particularly on banking and finance, trade and investment, oil and transport. In this work we keep a strong focus on small and medium—sized enterprises which are less engaged in the US market.  The most important challenge now is to find solutions on banking and finance, because legitimate trade and investment need banking partners and financial models that work. These issues are being addressed through intensive expert consultations, happening basically on a daily basis, including in Brussels and in Tehran last week, but also at the political level.  As I mentioned, we worked on this with EU Member States’ Foreign Ministers at the last Foreign Affairs Council. We focused in particular on the need to combine our work at EU level, with the two measures I just mentioned and the work that is ongoing at the expert level, with action from single Member States to protect national economic operators. This is the only way to be effective in this endeavour – to combine EU—level measures and national measures in a coordinated manner.  This is why we decided, and we have started to do so, to set up a network of national focal points of all EU Member States to further coordinate and intensify our work. This is essential to keep Iran in the nuclear agreement.  Of course, Iran also needs to do its part – and this is very clear – to improve its standards against money laundering and terrorist financing and step up banking reforms. These are essential steps to make Iran more attractive to European businesses and banks.  Last week, the Foreign and Finance Ministers of France, Germany and the UK, together with myself, wrote a letter to the US Secretaries of State and of the Treasury. We expressed our expectation that the extra—territorial effects of US secondary sanctions will not be enforced on EU entities and individuals, and that the United States respect the good faith of economic operators within EU legal territory, and we asked for a number of specific exemptions.  Let me be very clear. First of all, this is not an economic issue for Europe. This is a security issue for Europe, and the main thing is the nuclear non—proliferation efforts we’re making. Second, our determination to preserve the deal is also in the interests of the United States, because preserving the nuclear deal is essential to our common security, both for Europe, for the United States and for the entire Middle East, which might otherwise fall into a spiral of nuclear proliferation and of an even more dangerous level of conflictuality.  Think for one moment of the scenario without the nuclear agreement in place tomorrow and you’ll realise how dangerous this would be for all of us.  Preserving the nuclear deal is also essential to maintaining our unique and precious – even if difficult – channels of communication with Iran. The nuclear deal was never meant to solve or to address all issues in our relations with Iran. On the contrary, at the very beginning, meaning some 15 years ago now, that the purpose of the agreement would have been limited to only nuclear issues. Like it or not, that was the mandate the High Representative at that time received from the UN Security Council, and this is the mandate that was fulfilled.  Having a nuclear deal in place with Iran has opened up a window to address other issues that are not nuclear—related and that are there and that are our issues of concern as much as they are American issues of concern. They are outside the scope of the nuclear deal; they always have been. They need to be addressed. We believe that they can be better addressed on the basis of maintaining the nuclear deal with Iran, rather than on the basis of destroying it.  I’ll give you a couple of examples of small windows that have opened up in our dialogue and political talks with Iran on issues that are not related to the nuclear ones. We have had the opportunity to discuss ballistic missiles, regional issues and human rights in the EU—Iran high level political dialogue and in other meetings – quite a unique formation, especially for the West.  I’ll be very clear, we have serious issues with Iran’s behaviour and stance in those fields. This is no mystery – either for us, or for them – but they are not linked to the nuclear agreement implementation and they would not be easier to deal with at all without the nuclear deal in place. On the contrary, let me say by experience that during all the years of negotiations of the nuclear deal anything else that was not nuclear—related was basically off the table. Once you keep and consolidate the nuclear deal with Iran and make its survival beyond question, then the space opens up to deal with other issues.  We are addressing these issues in their own right, in direct contacts such as on Yemen. On this, I would like to share with you that we have set up a regional dialogue with Iran, chaired by us, by the European Union, with the participation of France, Germany, Italy and the UK. So far this dialogue has focused on Yemen and it has already delivered one step that was important – helping organise the visit of the UN special envoy Mr Griffiths to Sana’a at the beginning of June, to meet with the Houthi leadership. We will discuss further steps of this work exactly with the special envoy of the United Nations at the next Foreign Affairs Council to see how we can use our channels to try and make the work to solve the Yemen crisis more effective.  If the nuclear deal collapsed, it would also be much more difficult to address our non—nuclear concerns that we have. The current tensions on the nuclear deal have already narrowed the space for discussing all the other issues and we believe it is in nobody’s interest to close the channels that currently remain open. Again, the only outcome would be to give more space to those in the region, including in Iran, that argue for more radical positions.  Our position on the Iran nuclear deal is based on our principles and it is based on pragmatism. The nuclear deal makes Europe more secure and prevents a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It brings economic benefits to the people of Iran, and it should continue to do so, and it opens precious new channels – albeit difficult ones, as I said – for diplomacy and dialogue.  This is why we are determined to preserve the nuclear deal and prevent a new escalation of tensions in an already troubled region and world, because Europe and the world cannot afford wasting all of this.

Mrs Mogherini, you have just mentioned this: the massive violations of human rights, the ballistic missile programme, the destabilising role in countries such as Iraq, Syria or Yemen, support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and, last but not least, the aggressive threats against Israel are unacceptable to us, and we hope, High Representative, that these issues will continue to be addressed openly and unequivocally at all political levels.

For the sake of clarity, the Iran deal required the country to eliminate 98% of its uranium stockpile, dismantle and seal two thirds of its centrifuges, cap uranium enrichment at levels well below weapons grade and remove the core of its plutonium reactor. Today the sweeping inspections regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency certifies that Iran is complying with all its commitments. Yes, the deal is key for nuclear non—proliferation and should be kept in place as long as possible. This is key for global peace and security and is in the interests of the international community, including the USA and Iran. The credibility of the USA negotiating future nuclear agreements, notably the one with North Korea is now at stake. Today, after the summit between President Trump and President Kim Jong—un I can only hope that the North Korean deal will be as ambitious as the Iranian one. At the same time, this is to protect European companies in the light of the reintroduction of American sanctions. Thus, the S&amp;D Group welcomes the Commission proposal to activate the blocking statute. It goes without saying that the dialogue with the United States should continue. Nevertheless, in order to address separate issues, such as Iran’s presence in Syria and its support for the bloody Assad regime and the development of ballistic missiles, in parallel we call on the EU to take all necessary measures to ensure tangible economic benefits for Iran. Finally, we are living in turbulent times. It is therefore key for the European Union to stand firm and unite in the face of this challenge.

According to the IAEA’s verification and monitoring programme, although the limits were probed and are being probed, no outright violations have been detected to date. I would like also to take the opportunity to acknowledge the role of Baroness Ashton and the role of the European External Action Service in bringing the deal to fruition back in 2015.  President Trump’s decision, therefore, to pull out now and risk unravelling this finely-tuned agreement is baffling. It sends all the wrong signals to the other wannabe nuclear states, including the DPRK. The remaining EU signatories have a vital role now. On the one hand, the US must be persuaded that the deal is still our best tool against nuclear proliferation, and on the other hand, Iran must be encouraged to continue to meet all its obligations. Finding ways to financially protect the European Union companies doing business with Iran will indeed be challenging. In Europe, of course we do not share common values with the Iranian Government. There are still other major issues of concern to be addressed, such as the Iranian ballistic missile programme, its involvement in proxy wars in the region, gross human rights violations and supporting terrorism, but we must not let one poorly-advised anti-multilateralist president destroy an agreement that has, at its heart, the desire to maintain a more peaceful world.

Anyone who was not yet convinced now knows the EU needs foreign and security autonomy. Our strength is tested in the process of keeping the spirit of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) alive. The EU has chosen, with international partners, to bind and verify Iran’s nuclear programme through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and our part of the deal is lifting sanctions. Of course, we are committed to peace, diplomatic solutions and, first and foremost, that which we ourselves have signed up for. So to have this policy autonomy is key. Certainly, to have the US choose to abandon one of the biggest diplomatic successes at times where these are few and with so much at stake is enough for us to absorb, and so we simply cannot accept that Washington spells out which sanctions our European companies are bound by. I would be interested in what is possible to mitigate US extra territoriality without pushing private-sector risks into public institutions. At the same time, our autonomy must be clear in Tehran. Iranian leaders cannot and must not dictate what we in Europe should do. Iran itself must build confidence that they are committed to their part of the deal if they expect us to try and work hard to absorb the challenge of the US stepping back.

For if Iran has nuclear weapons, then its arch-enemy Saudi Arabia will certainly not be deterred from procuring them as well. And Saudi Arabia would certainly not be the only country that, on the one hand, is reaching for the bomb and, on the other, supporting terrorists. We must prevent this by all means. Europe must prevail against Donald Trump, who wants to punish all companies that trade with Iran.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I have thought for quite a long time what I am saying now. For, on the one hand, President Trump is sending signals to end the war and denuclearize on the Korean Peninsula, which we naturally welcome, and on the other hand, he is announcing a treaty on denuclearisation with Iran. He signed a statement from the G7 summit, only to tweet himself off a few minutes later. He dances happily with the Saudi despot during a state visit to Riyadh and denounces the countries that do not suit him as dirty countries. US foreign policy has become unpredictable and therefore arbitrary. The United States, as a serious partner, is only scrupulously perceptible, and it has long since lost its leadership role, which it insists on time and again. We must strengthen the UN and not squat in front of the queue like a rabbit and hope that it does not bite. The time has long since come to go our own way consistently, to remember one's own strength, to do the things that need to be done. The Iran nuclear deal must be preserved.

This aphorism fits perfectly with the complicated situation that has arisen as a result of the American decision to unilaterally withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement.  This has led the Commission to extend the EIB's mandate to Iran to support our businesses and to dust off the so-called blocking statute, which prohibits European companies from complying with US extraterrestrial sanctions. This game of chess is as big a problem as it is complex. Although the Eu ropean Union and the Member States have repeatedly stated our support for the agreement, the confirmation of secondary sanctions would destroy the economic incentives for Iran, which has in fact threatened to leave in turn. I believe that the US decision to unilaterally leave the agreement is an historic mistake and I firmly believe that it is our duty to do everything possible to safeguard it, despite the fact that the instruments available may not yet be sufficient for the difficult task.

As a gesture of good faith, however, the United States at least renounces the application of secondary sanctions to European companies.

Now it remains to be seen how we react to something that is already a certainty: that this behavior is behavior that makes the world more dangerous today than it was before Trump was the president of the United States.

Lauded as a means of ensuring peace and security for generations, its only effects have been to potentially catalyse yet more death and destruction in the already unstable Middle East, and to drive a wedge in western diplomacy, as Trump actually follows through with his campaign pledges and ends US participation.  The USA will be re-imposing sanctions on Iran. It was also reported last week that the Iranian regime is looking at options to boost uranium enrichment in case the deal fails. So let’s be clear: Iran is preparing for the failure of the nuclear deal. But what is the EU’s reaction to all this? The Commission is trying to force through a delegated act to make Iran eligible for European Investment Bank funding. Not content with clinging to a dying deal, you actually want to give economic and political support to the Iranian regime. It makes sense though doesn’t it? Trump pulls out of the nuclear deal and you see an opportunity to make the EU look like big players on the world stage.  This is more about EU vanity than it is about solving complicated political issues. It is almost as if the EU is trying to fight a proxy war against America in the Middle East. Our ability to influence Iran is greatly weakened without US participation. If the EU and Europe’s major powers continue down this line, its only real impact will be to tilt backwards towards the anti-Americanism that seeps through the seams of these institutions.  So how will this affect potential economic projects financed by the EIB? How will this influence the deteriorating trade and diplomatic relations between the EU and USA? According to Reuters internal sources, the EIB is unhappy with the Commission proposal because the EIB raises funds on US markets. To make matters worse, a delegated act is a power the unelected Commission has to adopt legislation without any anyone who was elected having a vote. So this proposal is far from being democratic and accountable. Whilst we will of course continue to work closely with European allies when our interests converge, this is not one of those times. May’s government is too scared to fully embrace the opportunities and independence that Brexit provides, and is continuing to follow EU policies and legislation, no matter the cost to the UK. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want an independent Britain to be the 51st state of America. But the British people certainly voted to stop being the EU’s 28th State. This is going to be one of the first big tests for the UK to refind its place in the world as an independent nation. The whole point of Brexit was to make our own democratic rules and pursue our own interests, but like the rest of the negotiations, Ms May will surrender to the EU, following EU rules and policies as closely as possible, completely against the express will of the British people.  The UK Government, packed with remainers, could not see the benefits of Brexit before the vote and is too scared to seize them now. This is not academia or a domestic political squabble, but will have real and long-lasting effects on our standing in the world, driving a wedge between the UK and our most important strategic partner, the USA. We should not follow Mogherini’s vanity project at the expense of our most important global relationship. It is time for us to follow our American allies and call it as we see it. The Iran deal is dead, and we must seek out a new style of diplomacy, one that actually gets results, as we are seeing on the current Korean Peninsula ...

If you want to be considered a friend of the Americans, then you must accept the conditions that are placed on you, twelve in the Iranian case, or pay the consequences of rejection.

Let us be clear: at the moment, there is nothing that can reasonably be done to convince Trump, Netanyahu and Bin Salman to push them towards a position of dialogue and rational analysis of the situation. If Europe, like Iran, wants to have a chance to get out of this difficult situation, it is essential that this opportunity is seen above all in its ability to wear down their intentions through common sense and patience. Pompeo's conditions, among other things, are more of a tool in the hands of the Israeli administration than in the UNITED States, opening the door to legitimising a conflict that has already begun a few weeks ago on Syrian soil.

The world is looking at us to try and preserve this achievement – no achievement is perfect, but it’s an achievement – and it’s also looking at us to find ways themselves – our international partners – to contribute to preserving these agreements.  I have heard a certain confusion on the extreme right of the Chamber. You know I never enter into these discussions, but I think I have to clarify a couple of things. One is the nature of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) because fake news can produce fake news and can itself become fake news. Let me be very clear on this: the nuclear deal with Iran is not a treaty. It has never been a treaty. It is a multilateral agreement that was negotiated for 12 years under the mandate of the UN Security Council, which mandated the High Representative of the European Union to facilitate the negotiations between Iran, on one side, and Germany, France, the UK, the US, China and Russia, on the other side, to reach an agreement that then became a UN Security Council resolution annex. So the legal framework that legitimates the JCPOA is not in the nature of being a bilateral or multilateral treaty. This is why it has not been ratified by Parliament, but it is an annex to the UN Security Council resolution. There is a UN Security Council resolution that unanimously endorsed and approved the text of the JCPOA and if you want to see it – sorry, the colleague has disappeared, as fake news disappears from time to time – the signed version of the JCPOA is in my office. You’re free to come and see it. It exists. It’s 102-3 pages long – it takes some time to read it and probably a lot of time to understand it – but it exists and it’s available on the website for everybody to consult it. Indeed it has a legal basis, being a UN Security Council resolution document. As such, technically speaking, the unilateral move of the United States Administration is the unilateral decision to stop complying with the UN Security Council resolution the United States itself voted. That is just to clarify what the JCPOA is. The second element of confusion I see especially – well, only – on the extreme right part of the Chamber is this – and I understand the political dilemma that some political forces might have at this stage, namely following the Trump agenda of destroying multilateralism and going only to bilateral agreements or affirming European autonomy. In French I would say ‘c’est où votre souverainisme?’, because for me protecting and preserving European interests – security interests, economic decisions – at this stage is a matter of priority. I’m surprised that some forces that have always argued for sovereignty and autonomy are now tempted to follow not Brussels but Washington. I think this is a mistake. This is a mistake that goes beyond the nuclear deal with Iran, but I leave this for political reflection in some parts of Europe. What is at stake today? First of all, what is a stake is the risk that Iran decides to restart its process to achieve a nuclear weapon. This is what we are talking about. The agreement is not perfect. I don’t know about you, but I don’t know anything in diplomacy – not even in life – that is perfect. No agreement, no deal is perfect, but this agreement is working. This agreement’s purpose was – and still is – to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and it is preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. That’s it. The risk is that, were this agreement not in place tomorrow, what would be the immediate consequence? Nuclear proliferation? Iran developing a nuclear programme that is not peaceful? The region going into a spiral of nuclear proliferation? And we know the region. We know the conflictuality of the region and some of you were perfectly right: the risk of slipping into a major scale conflict is real. It’s perfectly possible. There are two other issues at stake: the credibility of multilateralism and of international agreements – I would say of UN Security Council resolutions. The arguments that whatever is signed can be destroyed unilaterally after a few years is a dangerous one. I often gave this example in Washington. If a private company signs an agreement, when the CEO changes the agreement stays in place. If we introduce the element of uncertainty of agreements signed, the entire world collapses and the credibility of any negotiation – of any negotiation – collapses, and the international system also goes in that direction. So what is at stake is – and our responsibility is big in this – to try to maintain the credibility of diplomacy and multilateralism and, at the end of the day, bilateral agreements as well, because if you can unilaterally withdraw from a multilateral agreement, why shouldn’t you do the same on a bilateral agreement if at a certain moment you change your mind? Third, what is at stake is the autonomy of the European Union. This goes beyond the nuclear agreement with Iran. This would lead us to a different kind of debate, one that we will surely have at some point, but it is essential that the European Union, together with our international partners, is able to take decisions based on merit, based on our interests and our values, and based on what we think and decide is good for us and for the rest of the region and the world, that, by the way, was a joint analysis and a joint decision not only with our American friends, but also with the rest of international community. Otherwise, the UN Security Council resolution would not have been unanimously adopted. We didn’t move from where we were, and our analysis of what is in our interest and the global interest stays the same, especially after 11 reports that the deal has worked and that Iran is compliant. I believe that we need to be able to affirm that the European Union positions are determined in Europe. Having said that, the risk of not managing to save this agreement is real and I think we should not underestimate that we are running a risk. Even if we do all we can – and we are doing all we can – to preserve this agreement, there is a risk that this derails. I think we have the power and the instruments, together with our Member States and together with the other international partners we have, to prevent this agreement from being completely disrupted. But there is a risk that this work does not succeed. I think this is the worst case scenario because this would undermine security – nothing to do with stability – and would undermine the nuclear non—proliferation regime and the credibility of the West and of multilateralism and diplomacy. This is why I believe that, even if it’s difficult – and I see all the limitations – we have the responsibility to try to achieve this result. Even if it’s difficult, we must we must do all we can together to preserve this agreement, and this is exactly what we are doing because, again, the scenario of not having the agreement in place would be a disaster for Europe, for the security of the Middle East, for the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and I believe also for the United States of America.

As the European Union has emerged as one of the leading forces in the global free trade agenda, I welcome its attention to third-generation updated agreements such as we see today with Chile, rather than wholly pursuing new deals from scratch.  We are focused on the political operation aspects but let us not forget that these negotiations are also concerned with trade issues. Chile has re-emerged over the last three decades as a mature democracy with a strong internationalist outlook. As a member of the Pacific Alliance, the Organisation of American States and the Union of South American Nations, not to mention being a member of the OECD. Its links and areas of cooperation go well beyond its immediate region and are truly global. Although already cooperating in EU crisis management operations– this would include in fact things like the CSDP operations, Eurofor in Bosnia – since 2014, it is also hoped that the renewed association agreement will see further cooperation being developed in the coming years.  We proposed in our recommendation an ambitious level of commitment, one that is no less wide-ranging than the similar EU agreements recently concluded with Canada, New Zealand and Australia. This includes working together in the international arena to promote democracy and the rule of law to fight climate change, particularly critical in the Pacific region, combating terrorism and tackling organised crime and corruption.  In the area of education, the European Union seeks to continue cooperation via Erasmus+, but also to work towards full mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications and diplomas. We have also highlighted the important role the parliamentary oversight and scrutiny has in monitoring such agreements, and so we have endorsed the continued role for the Joint Parliamentary Committee which met for its 25th occasion back in January of this year. As the negotiations progress we will hope to see continued engagement from the Commission as to the latest developments. Its decision to publish the negotiating mandate and directives in November of last year was an important precedent and one which we welcome and are very keen to see continued. Indeed, we have made reference to this in the recommendation. With the third round of negotiations concluded in Brussels on 1 June 2018, I am confident that the talks are progressing well. The bulk of discussions are now focusing on trade rather than the political aspects, which are in my recommendation. Chile is clearly a natural partner with common democratic interests and aspirations everywhere. This was further reflected by the positive dialogue concluded with members of European civil society groups that was arranged as part of the latest talks between the EU and Chilean negotiators.  I will conclude my remarks therefore now, although I look forward to making a brief intervention at the end of the debate when I will be happy to address any issues raised, and to make a few comments regarding the two key amendments I have tabled to the resolution for a vote.

It shows how much we all value our relationship with Chile, and it proves that there is strong support within Parliament for the work done throughout the negotiations. Chile was the first country in Latin America to sign an association agreement with us. The new agreement we are now negotiating will once again be a model for other deals. This is not only about trade: it is about human rights; it is about the protection of the environment; it is about sustainable development and culture; it is about energy and workers’ rights.  Europe and Chile are very far apart geographically, but we see the world with the same eyes. Vemos el mundo con los mismos ojos. Pronunciation in Spanish! We both believe in the UN system and in the power of multilateralism. Chile has taken part in our CSDP mission in Bosnia, and it was the first Latin American country to sign a framework agreement for participation in our missions. We work together on scientific research, for instance under the Copernicus Programme, and when last year Chile was hit by a wave of wild fires, we sent our fire-fighting planes and our firefighters from many European countries to contain the emergency.  We both believe in solidarity as a driving force in international relations. Let me also thank Chile for having opened its doors to many Venezuelan refugees fleeing from their country. I saw the situation when I was in this region just two months ago. These negotiations show the potential for cooperation between like-minded partners like us. Our updated agreement will not only aim to strengthen our economies, it will also protect our workers, our trademark products, and our environment. It will demonstrate there is no better way to protect our interests than through strong cooperation with our partners.  This is international cooperation at its best. We want to show that globalisation can be governed together, with more rights, more protections, making international trade both free and fair. The negotiations are making good progress, and we have the ambition to conclude them as soon and possible, and certainly before the end of this Commission’s mandate. On the occasion of the next round of negotiations on the political and cooperation pillar on 21 June, we will also hold an EU-Chile Association Committee, with a focus not only on bilateral issues, but also on the regional and international situation. Once negotiations are concluded, we look forward to holding an EU-Chile Association Council, which the High Representative will co-chair with Foreign Minister Ampuero. Let me also stress that the work we are doing with Chile comes at a moment of strong engagement with the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean. Our negotiations with Mexico and Mercosur are also moving on, and by the end of the mandate we will present a new Strategy for even closer relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. I know we can count on Chile as a strong partner not only in our bilateral relations, but also in the larger context of relations between our two regions. Right now, we are working together to prepare the next EU-CELAC ministerial meeting, and we are also willing to expand our relations with the Pacific Alliance. We are currently working on a joint declaration with the four members of the Alliance, to identify precisely the fields where we could work together, in the interest of all our citizens. We live in a complex and confused moment in the history of the world, unfortunately, when nothing seems certain and even the most basic international rules are called into question. But our relationship with Latin America is here to stay, and will only get stronger. Our peoples and our economies are tied. We share the same principles and worldview. Europe and Latin America are closer than ever, and have the strongest interest in getting even closer. Together, we can be a force for good for the people of Europe, for the people of Latin America, and for our troubled and confused world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 246, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam Chairman, Respected Commissioner, I thank you for the kind words and for the extremely inspiring speech you said about Chile as one of the most important links with Latin America and I must say that I am extremely proud to have had the opportunity to participate as a shadow reporter in the drafting of this report, and as a Croat, because of the role of the Croatian diaspora that built Chile, which after the war in Croatia helped build Croatia , and who has preserved peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by participating in peacekeeping troops.  I would like to thank my colleague Tannock for a well-prepared report calling for further strengthening cooperation between the European Union and Chile, through a new modernised association agreement. Chile is a country that can only set an example for other countries through its successful democratic transition, and is one of the key partners of the European Union in terms of cooperation in the fields of economy, investment, protection of human rights and cultural diversity. This new comprehensive and modernised agreement aims to further strengthen multilateral cooperation in the fields of migration, security, defence (again I mention their troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have been one of the bright examples), in the fight against terrorism, organised crime and climate change, as a promotion of regular dialogue regarding reducing socioeconomic differences, strengthening human and fundamental rights.  What I think is important and what I will mention again is the call to strengthen cultural cooperation and strengthen the role of the diaspora as a link between Latin America and Europe, and this was evident in these examples that I outlined at the beginning. So those who went to South America, who built one country, came back and successfully laid the groundwork for new developing countries as well.

Chile is an example in democracy, in stability, in what its social inclusion, its economic openness and the reliability of its administrative and judicial institutions mean. It is, in that sense, an example for all other countries in America. It is also true — as the Commissioner, Mr Stylianides has said, that it is a country receiving tens of thousands of Venezuelans, in less intensity because of its geographical distance, but also in an open spirit of solidarity. Chile has made its geographical challenge—its American eccentricity—an extraordinarily successful solution. And, in that sense, there is one thing that is fundamental: the Alliance for the Pacific. We are being the subject of a continuous fracture, of a paradigm shift on the part of the American Administration.

Let's not see modernization as just an opportunity to achieve more profit at all costs.  In the case of the 2003 European Union-Chile Association Agreement, while it has made progress in some areas, we see very clearly what the outstanding issues are. Issues that have perpetuated the classic north-south division and areas where the nefarious heritage of Pinochetism has not been left behind.  I want to mention some examples. The water code in force converts water into merchandise and establishes rights that can be sold. The consequence: water hoarding by large domestic and international investors for export agriculture. Small farmers, as well as entire communities, run out of this essential good and have to buy water from tankers. This happens, for example, in Petorca, near the capital, Santiago.  The report as it reaches the plenary reaffirms access to water as a human right. I ask you not to support the amendment which reduces content.  On the other hand, we must support those who receive threats in Chile for defending this right and ask the Union delegation in Santiago to publicly defend the Modatima organization and its President Mundaca.  Another fatal legacy of Pinochetism is discrimination against indigenous peoples: counter-terrorism justice applies only to Mapuche. It cannot be that their lands are stolen and native forests cut down to plant eucalyptus trees so that we have cheap paper; the modernization of the Agreement must contain very clear language in this regard. I ask you to vote against the amendment which trivializes the acute conflict that still exists. And finally, since the agreement came into force too little has happened in Chile to stop it from being basically a supplier of primary products, and this is not a side effect. This is the main effect of the agreement and we need to change this if we want more equitable Chile-European Union relations.

It is therefore a reliable partner for the European Union in addressing global and regional challenges. Of all the initiatives suggested by Mr Tannock to strengthen cooperation with this country, he has caught my attention particularly in the areas of security and defence and, in that regard, everything about crisis management and peacekeeping operations, on the basis of the already positive experience we have had with this country.

The European economic world and, of course, European companies have much to do in Asia through the Pacific Alliance, and the agreement with Chile is key in that direction.  Secondly, I am incorporating into the idea that agreements are good: trade and political agreements are good in themselves and must be encouraged; with partner countries like Chile, even more so.

But Latin America, by and large, is a democratic continent; we need to respect that and we need to work closely with it. I would just like to briefly mention my two amendments: Amendment 1, which is to change the word ‘dispute’ to the word ‘matters’. In my view, there is no conflict with the Mapuche people. I wish to soften the text by doing that. I hope that colleagues will support that. In Amendment 2, I disagree with the intervention from my Green colleague. Access to water is, of course, a human right everywhere, but the economic model that is employed is a Chilean national sovereign matter, not for interference by the EU or by our report. Water companies are often privately owned within EU Member States, so it would be totally ridiculous for us to prescribe an economic model to Chile and interference in their domestic affairs.

In the last year we have constantly tried to show this: when we talk about principles and values we talk about human beings. When we work for human rights, we work to make a real difference to millions of lives around the world. This was the main focus of the campaign we launched to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and this is also the logic that drives the new annual report. We live in a difficult moment for human rights around the world. In too many countries the situation has become worse, not better. This moment tells us that progress can never be taken for granted, and this is why we should continue working for positive change. But the report also shows that our action can make a real difference. Progress can happen, and it is happening in many parts of the world – thanks also to our commitment. For every violation of human rights, there are many more good stories to tell. For every criminal, there are many more human rights defenders. In this fight for justice, we know where we stand. And the report I am presenting today on behalf of the High Representative shows what our commitment means in practice. It maps our work firstly to strengthen democracy. Secondly, to end the death penalty. And thirdly, to support the rights of minorities. These are just a few examples. Let me say a few words on the structure of the report. Last year you recommended making the report more readable and publishing it without delay. So this year we have decided to focus on thematic issues and use country-specific examples, rather than going through each country one by one. Country reports now feature on our website so that the process is still transparent but also much faster. With the report we do not only want to provide a picture of the activities we do, but also to show our impact and give concrete examples, once again to show that human rights are not only about international law – the strictly legalistic approach – they are about people’s lives and they are the foundation of more solid societies. The report, for instance, mentions the cases of violence against vulnerable children in Fortaleza, Brazil, that have been cut by two thirds thanks to our support. And Federica Mogherini has just come back from Jordan, where she took part in the graduation ceremony for over 100 Syrian refugees who were able to finish university thanks to our financial support. But let me also mention the first ever election observation mission that we deployed in The Gambia to accompany the country’s extraordinary path from dictatorship towards a truly inclusive democracy. I would like to thank in particular the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, who has contributed to many of these ‘good human rights stories’ and for making them more visible. ‘Good human rights stories’ is the name of a new initiative to be launched at the UN General Assembly high level week in September. The aim is to show, together with a broad alliance of countries from across the globe, examples of where positive human rights practices have made fundamental changes to individual lives, communities and societies. In the coming year we will be celebrating these stories. They show where strong human rights protection frameworks have been put in place, where communities have been made stronger through the work of civil society organisations and where countries have shown that poverty reduction and sustainable development can be achieved hand-in-hand with making progress in human rights. Stavros Lambrinidis is also putting into practice one of the main ideas from our human rights action plan: the need to engage with all actors at all levels, because only through engagement can we improve the human rights’ situation around the world. Last year we published the mid-term review of the EU action plan. The review showed an encouraging trend concerning human rights dialogues, which are gaining in legitimacy and exerting a more positive impact on third countries. Again, this should only reinforce our commitment to engaging constantly with our interlocutors, particularly where and when human rights are not respected. In this respect our European Union delegations around the world are at the forefront of our daily work. Our staff in delegations monitor and follow up on cases of human rights violations. They meet with the lawyers of jailed human rights defenders and attend trials as observers. And they lead local dialogues on human rights with the national authorities. They are very often the face of the European Union in the world, and it is also thanks to their work that we are known as a credible and reliable force for democracy and human rights. This is not an easy moment for fundamental rights, democracy and human rights defenders. In a moment like this, it would be easy to fall into cynicism and despair. We must continue to critically assess our own approach and adjust, where necessary. The scrutiny of this Parliament is indispensable in this regard. But as we do this, we must also keep in mind all the progress we have achieved together, and all the lives that have improved thanks to the European Union’s commitment. There is always hope, even in difficult times like these. And precisely in difficult times like these we must redouble our efforts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 271, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

Indeed, I believe that we cannot imagine a situation where human rights would be respected in the absence of a well-established democratic framework. In 2017, we have seen how authoritarian regimes are violating the most basic rights of their citizens. I am thinking of Venezuelans, whose freedom of expression is called into question and whose economic and social rights simply no longer exist. In this same sense, I am thinking of Cuba, but also of North Korea, to which the eyes of the world are now turning, forgetting that it is one of the worst dictatorships in history.

It is true that it depends heavily on the regions and that our efforts are always welcome outside the borders of the European Union. What I'm saying is that we have a coherence problem. The Commissioner said: it is not a good time, these are not good times for the defence of human rights, international law, fundamental rights. It is not; it is true that it is not and that there are entire regions of the world that are falling into questioning fundamental rights, the universality of human rights.  That is the case, and we have very important political leaders who defend this questioning of fundamental values. That is why the European Union needs to strengthen its work; but, of course, we too send very negative messages, aren't we, and I'm thinking of the Italian Government's last decision to keep out of its waters a ship laden with people who suffer and need help; or some of President Orban's actions and decisions.

In addition, in the EU itself, we have seen an unprecedented flow of fake news and propaganda, which have been used by governments and populists to spread anti—human—rights narratives, manipulate electoral processes and challenge liberal values. We urgently need to intensify our efforts to keep human rights at the centre of Europe’s Global Strategy and the EU’s external action. To foster civil society and stand up for human rights defenders around the world, it is crucial to build human rights alliances regionally and internationally with our United Nations partners. To resist the regimes and governments violating human rights, all tools at the European Union’s disposal must be applied with consistent resolve and determination.

The ongoing and intensifying attacks on the independence and employability of civil society and human rights defenders require increased attention. The Protect Defenders program in particular should be continued and expanded. With regard to the current debate on the financing and merging of foreign policy instruments, I would like to stress the importance of the independence of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Its effectiveness must not be jeopardised, especially in difficult political contexts. Expert voices from civil society report a creeping down on the EU's human rights protection. This is not the first time I have heard this criticism, and it must be taken seriously by the European External Action Service and the Commission. For example, it is unacceptable that the EU-Egypt Partnership Agreement was signed in 2017, even though the Egyptian President signed a tougher NGO law during the negotiation phase. This is just one example of many where the EU is losing credibility. In 2017, and also today, I see the EU's biggest shortcomings, not only in trade policy, but also in refugee policy, to deal with the double standards of its human rights policy and to consistently protect the lives and rights of refugees at our external borders.

Far be it from me to say that the European Union is doing nothing, but we all know here that overall human rights are going badly and that many of them are regressing, including, as has been said, in the European Union. A few examples, I think, are telling. Business and human rights: we know how much European companies are violating human rights around the world, how difficult it has been for the EU to participate in the work of the UN on the creation of a binding tool in this area, how much it is doing everything to minimise its scope.  Ditto for political dialogues on these issues with Asia and South America. These are the countries where European companies are on the front line of land grabbing and deforesting. Brazil is cited as an example, where a third of the Amazon rainforest has been destroyed, not to mention local populations displaced or even murdered.  How has the European Union made a difference? The same is true of efforts to support the ICC. A Statement by the High Representative of November 2017 on Mr. Al-Bashir's visit to Uganda, Russia and Chad is quoted. But the EU cooperates with Sudan and the legitimate internationally through the Khartoum process.  And what about the cynicism about migration policies: we welcome the human lives saved by forgetting the deaths in the Mediterranean, almost 15,000 in three years, in the desert but also on the soil of the European Union. People who are turned away, deported, including to dictatorships, such as Sudan.

The Italians bring to power two parties concerned with the interests of their people, the Eurocrats call for not respecting their will.

After decades of conquest, many countries seem to have taken steps backwards. Many populist leaders and strongmen systematically express a total disregard for human rights and those who defend them. I have to say, however, that perhaps the human rights movement does not seem to be learning the right lessons from the difficulties. Today, in the year in which the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration is celebrated, we must ask ourselves how to approach the issue, whether by intensifying the old strategies or whether we are broadening the field. Let's understand: there is no doubt that activism can move people, but if the things we say about moral obligations had made a difference the world today would be in better shape. Those of us who care about and care about human rights must ask ourselves what drives so many people to vote strong men in the world and in Europe. At the end of the day, the expansion of international human rights policies has been accompanied by the economic phenomenon that has led to the rise of radical populism and nationalism. It wasn't supposed to be like this. It was assumed that the Universal Declaration would take care of social protections and instead the fight for human rights left the social citizenship aspect too much in the background.  Well, if we want to point to a wider field today, then we must unify more and more human rights and social rights.

The photograph, which emerges from the accounts of representatives of civil society, supplemented by the interventions of the Sakharov Prize winner in 2006, Mr. Alexander Milinkiewicz, and Professor Andrew Wilson, author of the book \"Belarus – the last dictatorship in Europe\", emphasizes that Belarus is today a different country than in 2010 or 2014.

I thank this Parliament for having this debate today. At the height of the war, the mediation of the European Union (you might remember that) prevented further escalation and ultimately resulted in a cessation of hostilities. Since then, the European Union has been a central actor in the process to manage the consequences of the conflict, to improve the lives of all people in the region and to find a lasting solution. We have, as the European Union, a very special role to play, particularly because of our European Union monitoring mission to Georgia. To date, we are the only international monitoring presence in the field. The mission has fulfilled an indispensable function of stabilisation, to the benefit of all the communities afflicted by the conflict. The mission can currently count on over 200 civilian experts in areas adjacent to Georgia’s breakaway regions. Its mandate is not only to monitor the stabilisation and normalisation processes but also to actively build confidence, reduce tensions and prevent new escalations. As we work on the ground with the mission, we continue, also, to have a strong non-recognition policy. We continue to condemn Russia’s recognition of Georgia’s breakaway regions, and very recently the Syrian Arab Republic also announced that it would establish diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and we immediately condemned this move, together with the entire international community. It is a violation of international law and it will only make the resolution of the conflict more difficult to achieve. We are also denouncing the steps taken by Moscow to consolidate what it calls new realities on the ground. Among other things, we do not accept Russia’s military build-up in the breakaway entities and its construction of physical barriers on the dividing lines. All our actions aim at improving the life of all people in the region. Together with the OSCE and with the United Nations, we continue to steer the Geneva international discussions to address the consequences of the conflict. The European Union special representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia co-chairs these talks, with a focus on ensuring security and stability on the ground, as well as tackling humanitarian issues that impact on the life of the local population. Progress in these discussions is limited, as you might know, in particular when they address improved modalities for security and stability, but also issues related to internally-displaced persons and refugees. In spite of this, the discussions have helped make the security situation on the ground relatively manageable. Above all, the discussions are an opportunity for us to remind participants – starting with the Russian authorities – that the situation is unsustainable and unacceptable. It is not only unacceptable for the violation of international law, but first and foremost for the impact it has on all the people in the two entities, elsewhere in Georgia and in the entire region. Of course, our engagement with Georgia goes well beyond our monitoring mission and also well beyond the Geneva discussions. It is a true partnership – I would say friendship – a strong one, based on political association and development cooperation, on economic exchanges as well as on a strong friendship between our people. Our approach is to include the breakaway regions in our programmes in Georgia whenever this is possible. This is what we are doing, for instance, with our programmes on agriculture, on rural development and vocational training. We are also assisting civil society initiatives in the entities. We support all initiatives that can help re-establish confidence between the sides, such as people-to-people contacts, dialogue processes and academic exchanges. All our actions within the two regions are fully coordinated – I would like to underline this, because I think it’s a very important point – are fully coordinated and approved by the government of Georgia and in full line with the Georgian engagement policy. In light of the recent peace initiative of the Georgian State Ministry of Reconciliation, we are now looking at the possibility of providing further support. For instance, there is a clear interest from the breakaway regions to increase trade with the rest of Georgia, but also with the rest of the region, and this would represent a major improvement for the life of local communities, and for all people in the wider region. We are also considering a mobility scheme for academics from the breakaway regions, and this could also be facilitated by the peace initiative I just mentioned. Our policy is one of non-recognition but also of engagement with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, exactly in line with the approach of the Georgian Government. The conflict has impacted first and foremost on the people of these two regions. They’re not free to explore the full economic potential of their lands; jobs and opportunities are lost, and beyond Abkhazia and South Ossetia, an entire region suffers from the consequences of the conflict. So, ten years after the war, we do not and will not stop working: first of all for achieving a true solution, and secondly for all local communities, for their development and for their dignity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 303, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

Let us stick to the facts: like his ultra-nationalist predecessor Gamsachurdia, Saakashvili had instigated an arms race against the Abkhaz and South Ossetia with the aim of subjecting them to central power and at the same time depriving them of their historical identity – in the tradition of the Tsar and also of Russian reality under Stalin. In a region where the peoples living in the smallest of spaces still do not find the form of coexistence, an adventurous undertaking. I would like to say to you: be relaxed about today's question, because the political situation on the ground is more positive than shown here.

I believe that the right to self-determination of peoples is indisputable. But then the Georgian government attacked them. A peace-keeping truce was then reached under the supervision of Russian troops. But in 2003, European Union-funded NGOs staged a coup in which they overthrew the legitimate government and placed the now doomed Saakashvili in Georgia and Ukraine and was the one who invaded South Oshetia in 2008. So the reality is completely different from the one you want to present. In fact, there is no occupation in Abkhasia and South Ostia. On the contrary, I believe that the time has come for the international community to welcome these peoples that it has so unfairly excluded.

The torture and murder of Archil Tatunashvili at the beginning of this year was a moment when we could see again and again how this trauma is being activated again and again, and that Russia, which is responsible for occupying the regions in Georgia, has not yet found responsible treatment of these regions. Georgia today has no way of seeking a military solution to this situation. The good thing is that Georgia does not want that either.

Indeed now that internal and external security are inextricably interlinked, putting together the best abilities of the two organisations in providing security in general for the European citizens becomes imperative. Since Crimea in 2014, the basis and substance of collaboration between the EU and NATO have accelerated and enlarged, so that today we speak about no less than 74 common actions. However, as of late, the transatlantic relationship has become strained following the recent trade disputes between the US and their allies. Under the circumstances, besides trying to manage these disputes so that they do not get out of hand, one should also attempt on the one hand to insulate the security dimension of that relationship from its commercial one, and on the other, preserve and accelerate the existing good momentum in the EU-NATO collaboration. In general, given the existing fragile setting, what otherwise are normal differences of opinion between the two organisations today require more sensitive management so that we can overcome the difficulties of the moment. The changing atmosphere related to the topic has been felt during the consultation and writing of the present report, a fact illustrated by comparing its first draft with the version used for the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The report is based on the premise that the EU and NATO, both confronted with the same challenges and threats, share the same values in their complementary activity devoted to preserving peace and security in a rules-based international system. In regard to those threats and challenges, the upsurge in Russia’s military assertive behaviour and activities, political manipulation and cyberattacks, as well as direct interference in European countries’ internal affairs aiming at undermining their unity, are equally concerning to both the EU and NATO, a reality underlined by the fact that many of the 74 common activities mentioned above are directly devoted to countering exactly such actions. The report is addressing, understandably, the transatlantic relations and is stressing that the EU’s own increased defence and security efforts, apart from responding to US previous appeals, see for instance the ‘adios’ speeches of both defence secretaries Gates and Panetta, are a concrete contribution to burden-sharing, reinforcing both NATO and the security bond with Britain after Brexit. The EU-NATO joint declaration and the subsequent implementation actions mark a new and substantive phase of the strategic partnership. In that context, the report looks forward to the new joint declaration to be adopted at the approaching Brussels NATO summit in July. As expected, special attention is given to the collaboration between the two organisations in military mobility, recently identified as a priority area of cooperation between them, and in this respect suggest that the west-east axis should be complemented with a new one running north-south, which would confer the necessary coherence to their eastern flank. Controlling hybrid threats, countering cyberattacks, building resilience, sharing situational awareness, increased information-sharing, fighting terrorism and continuous improvement of cooperation on mission and operations at both strategic and tactical level, represent concrete domains for collaboration between the EU and NATO that were mentioned and supported in the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 349, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, let me first of all thank the rapporteur for the excellent work on one of the central issues in the work we are doing for a stronger Europe of Defence. The report wishes for ‘a more substantive partnership within the European Union and NATO’. Not only do we share 22 members, we also face similar challenges and we have converging security interests. Almost 95% of citizens of the European Union live in NATO countries, so protecting these people is the first of our shared interests. At the same time, the report is also very clear that EU—NATO cooperation should be complementary, as it is, and respectful of each other specificities, as it is. We are different organisations; we, the European Union, are not a military alliance, and we do not intend to become one. Our European way to peace and security is unique, and we are proud of the work we do and the way we do it. Our friends at NATO appreciate the specificity of what we do. Our missions, both civilian and military, carry out some very different tasks compared to NATO operations, so complementarity is in the nature of our partnership. We do different things, and this is why we are increasingly working together on the ground, taking advantage of our complementarity. This is why the NATO leadership, starting from the Secretary—General, Jens Stoltenberg, has been so supportive of our work towards a stronger Europe of Defence. All the work we’ve done inside the European Union has always been done hand-in-hand with strong NATO support and with the deepening of the partnership with NATO.  On the one hand, we are working to strengthen the capabilities of our Member States, and in most cases these are also NATO allies. They have one set of forces that can be used in European missions and in NATO missions alike – and let me also add in UN missions – and in this way, a stronger European Union in the field of defence makes NATO stronger. On the other hand, we are also investing in our complementarity; for example, in our civilian capabilities. As you know, last week, together with the Secretary—General of NATO, we presented to our respective councils, to the European Union Council and to NATO Council, the third progress report on the implementation of our joint declaration, which we signed during the last NATO summit in Warsaw. Let me just highlight some key achievements that are mentioned in this progress report, which, by the way, will also constitute a good basis for our further work looking ahead to the next NATO summit in Brussels. First, the clearest progress is probably on military mobility. Today more than ever, rapid response has become an essential requirement for our security, getting our assets where they are needed, and doing so swiftly, is a necessity we need to ensure at all times. But this is also about how efficient we are in our defence spending, because if we invest in the best military capabilities and the most advanced defence systems, but then they get stuck at the border for customs checks, obviously we have an efficiency issue. If we cannot move our assets rapidly, we will need to buy more of them to make sure that they are in the right place at the right time. This is clearly not an efficient way to invest the defence budgets, so it’s relevant for operational reasons and for budget reasons.  A big part of the work here is going on at European Union level, where obviously we have competencies and instruments to address these issues, with a project under the permanent structured cooperation, as well as with the proposed new investment from the Commission. We are working in constant coordination with NATO; experts from NATO are taking part in our work, and NATO has shared its parameters for transport infrastructure. There is no better example of how a stronger European Union in the field of defence also makes NATO stronger. The second field that I would mention as an example is hybrid threats. After the Salisbury attack, the European Council called for increased EU engagement on cyber security, strategic communication and counter-intelligence, as well as close cooperation with NATO on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear issues. We are currently working to respond to this task, and our proposals will be reflected in three documents that will be presented in the European Council at the end of this month: a joint communication on the follow-up to Salisbury; a joint report on the progress of the implementation of the 22 joint EU NATO actions on hybrid threats; and the 15 Security Union progress reports.  Our European and NATO staffs are working together on hybrid threats in a number of different contexts on a daily basis. I will mention not only the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, but also our Task Force on Strategic Communications and the EU Hybrid Fusion Cell for situational awareness. The next EU-NATO parallel and coordinated exercises are to take place next November. And similarly to last year, the exercises will be based on a hybrid scenario and will aim at synchronising our two organisations’ crisis response. The third area of cooperation is our work to build the capacities of our partners. In particular, we have intensified the exchange of information at staff level on three pilot countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova and Tunisia, but work has also intensified on Ukraine, Georgia and Jordan. We are also working together in Ukraine on issues such as strategic communications, training and security sector reform.  Finally, the first ever EU—NATO staff-to-staff dialogue on counterterrorism took place at the end of May. It focused on cooperation against terrorist threats, collaboration on the global coalition against Daesh, capacity building of partner countries and development of scenario—based discussions. These are just few examples – still many, and I apologise for being long – that clearly demonstrate the new engagement between the two organisations. Our cooperation has never been better, it has never been wider and has never been deeper.  On our side, we Europeans have finally decided to take full responsibility for our own security, and this is also in the interest of our partners in NATO. We are autonomous, but we are partners – very good ones. We are different, but we do share the same interests and we could not afford to walk in opposite directions. It would not be efficient, it would not be safe, and it would not be smart, and this is why we do not do it and we will never do it. As your report rightly says: it is time for a more substantial partnership between the European Union and NATO, and this is precisely what we are doing today, and we will continue to do even more in the future. Last but not least, I apologise, I just realised while I was speaking that I should have changed seats in addressing this debate. I will move to the other side of the plenary in a minute.

Practical, because since the Warsaw Summit of 2016 there are dozens of very concrete points to implement. You pointed out the areas where progress is already being made, that is what counts. Pragmatic, because it is complementarity that must take precedence. There are too many security issues around us in Europe for us to waste time bickering between these two organisations. We have the means to work in a complementary and effective way. The two limits that must guide European engagement are, on the one hand, the recognition of NATO's essential role in collective defence - and no one can dispute this - and, on the other hand, the affirmation of our ambition for strategic autonomy, because strategic autonomy is not strategic loneliness, it is directed against anyone, but it is the ability to decide with whom we do things and we want to do things.

Threats to the current way NATO works are a political reality. Discussions between the European Union and NATO include even trade preferences. Likewise, with the exit of the United Kingdom, as much as 80% of NATO's fiscal capacity will be outside the European Union.  The European Union was created to keep the peace. It needs to be its core function globally as well. However, the European Union must embrace geopolitical change and be prepared to contribute to globan security with adequate capacity of its own. Strengthening the European Union's defence capabilities needs to develop a more effective response to crises, strengthen transathlanic ties and contribute to NATO.

The UK is, after all, and will remain, the pre—eminent European military power. As referred to by Ms Mogherini, it is also right that due attention be given to the ease of mobility of allied forces across Europe, not just in times of tension but also for exercise purposes when necessary. Particularly at a time when there is some friction in transatlantic relations, and as we approach July’s NATO summit, it is doubly important that European nations signal to the United States our willingness to bear more of the defence burden. The Americans, after all, have increased their European Reassurance Initiative, which further confirms US resolve to defend Europe, by some 40% to USD 4.8 billion. Just this local increase by the United States is more than the total defence spending of at least 10 European countries.  I suggest that European burden sharing is not improved by the creation of separate defence structures, by the exclusion of major third countries from defence industrial projects or from pursuit of an elusive and ill—defined EU strategic autonomy.

Occasionally some timid references appear to mean the need for a defence and a concept of autonomous European security, which is evident.  If we take into account even the references made to the CEP and that the CEP has now just indicated that non-European companies will not participate in THE CEP investment plans, that is, The US, it is clear that the paradigm has changed, and the paradigm has changed because Trump has ceased to be an anecdote to be a categorical anecdote. And the categorical anecdote is called: the expulsion of the Atlantic Trade Treaty, which we were negotiating; the breakdown of the Iran Agreement; the breakdown of the Climate Change Agreement... and the last have been intolerable contempt in the G-7, which even reach personal offense.  This is Mr Trump's \"twitter thinking,\" which is critical because it's the main power right now in the world. And what this means is that the United States is no longer the permanent reliable partner we had in the European Union — and these are mrs Merkel's words, which gives me the impression that it is not a defining extremist. In this regard we have to respond and be able to respond with our own challenges.

This is certainly not the first time, and much less the last, that we have the chance to talk about the relationship between the European Union and NATO. And I fully agree with the rapporteur that this has been an important report: it offered the chance to clarify this rather complicated relationship. However, I regret to say that we feel that at some crucial points the report itself has been more of a missed opportunity. Instead of clarifying, at some points it has indeed further complicated this relationship that was otherwise not very easy. Despite the laudable work that went into the file on behalf of the rapporteur and the shadows, we are not able to support it, on many grounds. Let me start with the simplest, and the easiest one. The report makes reference and emphasises, rightly, the security, defence and political challenge that Russia poses for the European Union. However at almost all points of the text this sounds as if it is an exclusively eastern problem. We seriously disagree with that. Just witness the political meddling in the Brexit process or a number of European general elections, so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider, and this is not an issue for NATO’s eastern flank. This is a larger concern to that we need to deal with. The second and, probably much more important, point is that the report claims that Article 42, paragraph 7 of the Treaty contributes to a stronger NATO. I don’t think I need to remind my honourable colleagues that this particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response. This is an obligation for a bilateral, individual response between Member States. And considered in such a way, actually many analysts think that this this further complicates the issue rather than clarifying it.

Hybrid threats, terrorism, the migratory pressures we see today through the Balkan route, cyberattacks and disinformation hostile campaigns are just some of the challenges facing the Member States of the European Union and NATO, and accordingly they require a common response with a view to eliminating them.  Likewise, the European Union's cooperation with NATO is an integral pillar of European stability and security, and as part of the European Union's global strategy, this cooperation contributes to achieving peace and stability globally. However, I must stress the importance of adopting further steps towards the creation of the European Union's own forces with a view to maintaining peace, stability and security at its own borders and in the neighbourhood. If we take into account the fact that some NATO member states have serious problems in respecting fundamental human rights, then I think that the next logical step would be to create European capacities that would be a guarantee of peace and stability in the region, and especially in the Western Balkans, while respecting the fundamental human rights that are being trampled so easily in some of our partner states today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 375, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Laima Liucija ANDRIKIENĖ", "mepid": "28276", "text": "   – Madam President, in the past years, the EU and NATO have achieved a remarkable degree of cooperation.

Many of you reminded us of the crucial steps we’ve made, both in strengthening the European Union defence but also in cooperation with NATO. I would like to use these few minutes just to reassure you on the fact that, first, we will continue having a pragmatic, realistic approach as Mr Danjean mentioned. I believe we are beyond the ideological debate and we are focusing on the practical things we can and we have an interest in doing, and that the work will continue on the European way to defence and security, which is a particular one and which sometimes implies a military component but is never exclusively military. We will continue doing this, obviously, in the Council. Just in a couple of weeks from now, we will have another session of the Foreign and Defence Ministers together in the Council to prepare the European Council at the end of June, with further progress, especially on the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) but also on the EU-NATO partnership. That, I believe, will contribute also to the good preparation of the NATO summit for what concerns NATO issues. Then there might be other issues coming up on the agenda that do not relate to defence and security, strictly speaking. I would also like to say that I believe that work will continue also in strong cooperation with other European institutions. I am thinking of the European Commission that is supporting this work for the first time ever, with especially the European Defence Fund and the proposed Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), but also with the European Defence Agency, which is doing a fantastic job in supporting technically all this work. So, thank you for the support. Thank you also for the indications. Last point: some of you mentioned the future relations with the UK.

Macrofinancial assistance is an exceptional emergency mechanism aimed at addressing severe balance of payment difficulties in third countries. In other words, it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation.  This is the fourth time that the Commission proposes macrofinancial assistance (MFA) for Ukraine since the beginning of the war in 2014. This time, the Commission proposes EUR 1 billion to be dispersed as medium- and long-term loans. The assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in Ukraine, which is done by agreeing with the Ukrainian authorities a Memorandum of Understanding. This Memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the disbursements of the funds. In that context, I would like to highlight three key elements. First, the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of Ukraine and all the many socio-economic consequences of this aggression. Second, the economic recovery, which remains fragile. Third, the reform process, which has been important but is not really steady until now. Hence, the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against, especially in pre-election years. That being said, to address any doubts that may arise during this debate, the MFA is not an unconditional support. There are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms.  It is very important to remind that the Commission cancelled the last tranche of the third MFA programme when some of Ukraine’s commitments were not fulfilled. Therefore, it is crucial that the two unfulfilled anti-corruption measures will be part of the new conditions. If corruption is not addressed drastically, MFA funds should not be delivered to Ukraine.  A step in the right direction is the adoption of the law on the high anti-corruption court this last week. In addition, the newly adopted law was signed yesterday by the President of Ukraine. The rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction: it means that Ukrainians take the commitment seriously.  I believe that our common goal is to help Ukraine, but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation. If we are serious about our goal, we cannot slow down the procedures. This means that the rapporteur does not support any amendments tabled to the plenary and recommends closing the file at first reading. To end, I would like to underline once again that this report is just a legal base for the Commission to disburse the money, but they will do so only when Ukrainians manage to fulfil all the agreed and outstanding conditions. The rapporteur is very sure that the Commission will take this role actively and will pay great attention to political evolutions in Ukraine.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 393, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Wałęsa, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) for their work on this report. I would also like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) for its valuable contribution to this debate.  The partnership between Ukraine and the EU has grown deeper and stronger. Today I am seeking your support to maintain this momentum through the adoption of a further proposal for macro-financial assistance (MFA). A look at the past MFA operation from 2014 shows how important this support is for Ukraine.  First, back in 2014, the MFA was a key EU instrument to provide immediate financial assistance to Ukraine in order to stabilise its economic and financial situation. Ukraine returned to economic recovery and growth in 2016 and 2017, after two years of steep recession. It is an important success story, not only for Ukraine, but also for the EU.  Second, the MFA has played a major role in supporting reforms in Ukraine and, in particular, in stabilising Ukraine’s economy in the medium term. Through this programme, the EU has supported a broad range of anti-corruption reforms, including the establishment of the anti—corruption infrastructure, spearheaded by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Reforms to its energy and public procurement markets also helped to eliminate major sources of corruption. It has also helped Ukraine to improve its public finance management, to clean up its banking sector and to improve its business environment, for example, by automating VAT returns and reducing red tape.  However, despite its recovery, Ukraine’s economic situation remains fragile. Russia’s destabilising actions in eastern Ukraine continue, and the security situation remains tense. Ukraine is paying a high price. For example, its defence spending reached 5% of GDP last year, which otherwise could be used for the development of Ukraine. Ukraine’s debt repayment obligations will increase substantially in 2018 and 2019, putting a very heavy burden on the state budget. We cannot afford to let Ukraine fail. Therefore, the new MFA operation is necessary, along with other international support, in particular from the International Monetary Fund.  Having stressed the importance of this MFA proposal, let me add a clear message on the reforms in Ukraine. As always, this MFA proposal is strictly linked to reform conditions. Due to delays with the implementation of agreed anti—corruption reforms, the Commission cancelled the last disbursement under MFA III in January 2018. In order to give a clear political signal to the Ukrainian authorities that the newly proposed MFA operation will also be subject to state conditionality, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed – on Parliament’s initiative – to attach a joint statement to the legislative decision. I am convinced that this joint statement adequately addresses the key concerns of MEPs voiced in the committee process.  First, the joint statement recalls that the political preconditions of the MFA require Ukraine to respect democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party system, the rule of law and human rights under the scrutiny of the Commission and the European External Action Service. Second, the statement makes clear that the fight against corruption will be at the heart of the policy conditions of the memorandum of understanding to be agreed between EU and Ukraine for this MFA operation. Related issues, like money laundering and tax evasion, will also be taken into account for the conditionality of this operation. Specifically, the unmet anti—corruption conditions from the previous MFA operation should be implemented. These conditions were the establishment of the verification system for asset declarations and verification of companies’ beneficial ownership data.  Further MFA assistance will be conditional on progress in setting up a well—functioning anti-corruption court. Importantly, last week the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the law on the high anti—corruption court by 315 votes. That is 88 votes more than needed for a majority. Yesterday, the law was signed by the President of Ukraine. Let me also say that, behind that, Commissioner Hahn and I have raised the issue of abolishing the obligation of e—declarations on anti-corruption activists. This remains an urgent issue to be addressed, just like the reform of the Central Election Commission. We are at a crucial point in time in Ukraine, with the expiry of the IMF programme in March 2019 and presidential and parliamentary elections also looming next year. The window of opportunity for reforms may be closing as the election approaches, so it is important to get this MFA programme up and running in the shortest possible time. If we delay or turn our backs on Ukraine, the risk of reform reversals would be high. So I hope that we will have your full support going forward.

This time we are given proof: Ukraine is able to deliver once it receives clear-cut signals and expectations from our side. Establishment of the High Anti-Corruption Court is with no doubt a very meaningful step in the creation of a future and European Ukraine. I would like to stress very clearly that, even though we are right to expect many more things to be accomplished by Ukraine on its European path, we cannot deny the truth. And the truth is that it is precisely Ukraine which is setting an example for the whole world on how a country which is in a state of war is able to progress with reforms and great transformation. Yes, implementation is that important, but there is always a stage of adoption beforehand. Let me mention just a few more acts of legislation recently approved by the Verkhovna Rada: the law on pension reform, the law on healthcare and the law on education. These are the facts. I wish to conclude by saying that clear-cut responsibilities also remain with us, the EU: the EU’s policies and conditions must be tailored in such a way that eventually help to protect Ukraine’s independence and do not jeopardise the socio-economic life of its people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 398, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Rebecca HARMS", "mepid": "28233", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her In this debate, I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Rosati, Mr Gahler and Mr Austreviius.

The finance minister for Ukraine was dismissed last week. The stated reason for the dismissal was disseminating false information. One has to ask: what was this? Very simply, the now ex—finance minister revealed, exposed, spilt the beans on corruption in Ukraine.  Hopefully, everyone here will agree that we must not condone – let alone be fellow travellers to – corruption. Indeed, we must actively oppose it. Transparency International is a globally respected organisation, especially on anti-corruption. On its criteria, Ukraine is categorised as the second most corrupt country on the entire European continent. To put it another way: Ukraine rates even worse for corruption than the gangster—influenced regimes of Albania and Kosovo. Ukraine has delayed and delayed over and over again the establishment of an anti-corruption court. Vote or no vote, let us see how long it is before the president implements that vote. Worse, campaigners against corruption have been intimidated and, in some cases, imprisoned. To provide an example: on 15 March this year, one Nadia Savchenko testified on the corruption in the office of the President of Ukraine. One week later, Ms Savchenko was placed under arrest and charged with terrorism offenses. The same president had previously awarded Ms Savchenko Ukraine’s highest honour for bravery against terrorists.  These practices must be deemed to be unacceptable. Every informed person – and that has to include the EU embassy in Ukraine, and therefore the Commissioner – knows about the appalling level of corruption in Ukraine. The sacking of the finance minister last week for opposing corruption should have caused the alarm bells to ring. Instead, the considered response of the Ukraine groupies in the Commission and, regrettably, in this Parliament (and there are many honourable exceptions) is simply to hand out to Ukraine – without question, without adequate audits, and without enough consideration – these very large sums of money, all paid for by the taxpayer. What we are discussing this evening with such rapidity is over EUR 1 billion. By comparison, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is holding back on its assistance programmes to Ukraine, precisely because of well—founded concerns on corruption. On the objective criteria of the IMF, Ukraine does not pass muster as a worthy recipient of large—scale funds. The EU should follow the same course as the IMF: these payments should not be made.

Cybersecurity threats are real, they can be very damaging and may bring about lethal consequences. One can only imagine the effects of a successful cyber-attack on a nuclear plant, on an air traffic control facility or on a hospital. EU Member States are often subject to cyber—attacks by either state or non-state actors for political, economic or security purposes, including attacks on critical infrastructure, cyber—espionage and disinformation campaigns. Therefore, urgent reinforcement and development of European offensive and defensive capabilities is needed. We need to build up and improve our cyber—deterrents and defence if we are to truly modernise European defence. While cyber—defence remains the core competence of the Member States, nevertheless, due to the borderless nature of cyberspace, it is not possible for any one state alone to tackle the threats and challenges. Member States must cooperate closely and this is where the EU can be of help. The EU can provide a platform for European cooperation and ensure that the new endeavours are closely coordinated at an international level and within the transatlantic security architecture. As we have all seen, with the development of the European defence policy over the last few years, so too has the cyber—defence domain been developing. PESCO and the European Defence Fund are the latest initiatives with the necessary scope to facilitate co-operative projects in the cyber domain.  We have a huge deficit of cyber—defence specialists. While there are already some initiatives in this field that need continued support, like the Military Erasmus programme and some others, we see the need to do more.  It is important to increase the availability of virtual cyber—defence training. We need to create wide-ranging technical platforms and establish a community of EU experts to develop a platform to facilitate the pooling and sharing of training and exercises.  In 2016, at the NATO Summit cyberspace was recognised as an operational domain, together with land, air and sea. This was a big step at the time. We need to broaden cooperation with NATO in cyber—defence by increasing operational cooperation and coordination and expanding capacity-building efforts, intensifying joint training for staff, building trust and conducting joint exercises. Like-minded strategic partners should also be taken into account.  As regards international norms and rules, I am glad that the UN Group of Governmental Experts would agree on some of the concepts concerning cyberspace. It was agreed that international law applies and should be enforced in cyberspace. However, it is necessary for the EU to assume a leading role in the ongoing and future debates on international norms in cyberspace.  On civilian-military cooperation, again trust is a key issue. This needs to be developed further between companies and defence and civilian end-users. Also, private companies have a great role in preventing, detecting, containing and responding to cyber—security incidents, as well as in stimulating innovation. It is therefore also imperative that there is more cooperation with the private sector.  So in conclusion, we need to continuously update European cyber—defence capabilities. We need more cooperation at the level of Member States, the EU, NATO and other like-minded countries by building trust, training more experts, having more joint exercises and improving accountability. The next attack might create far more damage than we have seen so far.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 421, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you on behalf of the Commission and the High Representative. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Paet, for today’s report and the light he is shining on this very important subject. In recent years, as he said, the cyber—threat landscape has changed dramatically, underlining the need for a strategic approach to cyber—threats and challenges. That includes the need to look at the defence dimension.  The best way we have to face such a rapidly evolving series of challenges is to join forces and to mobilise all the resources we have. To protect our cyberspace we need better capabilities, more research, more training and exercises on how to respond to eventual attacks, and in the last few months and years I’m glad to say we have joined forces across the institutions – the European Commission and Member States, the External Action Service and the European Defence Agency – all in close coordination with our partners at NATO.  The report we are discussing today provides an excellent strategic vision and puts forward a series of very realistic recommendations. The report will help further reinforce our ongoing efforts to support Member States’ capability development for cyber—defence and deterrence. Cyber—defence of CSDP missions and operations, cyber—defence education and training, international norms applicable to cyberspace, civil military cooperation, public—private partnerships and EU NATO cyber—cooperation.  We are working to build the EU’s resilience to cyber—attacks, provide for better defence capabilities and to build a credible cyber—deterrence. Indeed, these were the key elements of the Commission’s cyber package brought forward in September last year.  In taking this work forward, we need to remember that most cyber—infrastructure is in civilian hands, so an important part of strengthening our cyber—resilience – making ourselves harder to attack – involves strengthening civil cooperation, which is why we proposed transforming ENISA into an EU cybersecurity agency and developing an EU—wide certification framework for cybersecurity. We also need to send a clear message to those who wish to cause us harm, and in this regard we welcome the reference in the report to Europol’s role in coordinating the law enforcement response to cyber—threats. I’d also like to draw your attention to the recent Commission proposals for facilitating access to e—evidence.  But we also identified the need to further invest in the development of dual use cyber—technologies and cyber—skills. Earlier this year, the European Defence Agency, led by the High Representative, set up an EU cyber—defence, education and training exercise evaluation platform. It will help advance training and educational opportunities within the Member States to cover the full range of cyber—defence training. This initiative will also bring together civilian and military training needs. The EAS and the European Defence Agency have in fact been engaged with Member States for some years now to develop capabilities for cyber—defence. In March this year, they conducted a survey of the Member States on their cyber—defence requirements in order to update the EU cyber—defence policy framework. That survey showed that some Member States are already very advanced in terms of structures and doctrine and that all of our Member States have at least minimum cyber—protection capabilities in place and are building their national cyber—defence systems.  We’ve identified several areas where the EU could support these efforts further, such as investment in research and technology, providing training and education opportunities and facilitating civil—military cooperation. The funding through the European Defence Fund should be focused on delivering these capability priorities. Some Member States, as has been mentioned, have also agreed to invest together in cybersecurity through the new permanent structured cooperation on defence. Member States have set up to cyber—related PESCO projects. One of them focuses on the sharing of cyber—threat intelligence through a network platform with the objective to strengthen national cyber—defence capabilities, the second aims to set up cyber rapid response teams to respond together to cyber—attacks. In order to strengthen cyber—deterrence, we continue to step up EU response to malicious cyber—activities and incursive cyber—operations in the framework for a joint EU diplomatic response to malicious cyber—activities. This sets out several EU measures to prevent and respond to cyber—attacks by state and non—state actors. Mr Paet’s report also highlights the role of international law and cyber norms in cyberspace. In this respect, we work closely with Member States to develop a strategic framework for conflict prevention and cyber—stability, promoting adherence to existing international law and implementation of cyber—norms and confidence—building measures are, and will remain, a centrepiece of our efforts.  Finally, we are working to deepen EU—NATO cooperation on cyber—defence, including against hybrid threats. You were talking about EU—NATO cooperation earlier today. We will continue to foster interoperability through coherent cyber—defence requirements and standards, to strengthen cooperation on training exercises, to harmonise training requirements and to mainstream cyber aspects into crisis management.  The report also makes some recommendations on institutional reinforcement, such as developing cyber aspects further in a white book for security and defence, to invest more in cyber—defence in the next MFF, to strengthen the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre and set up a new cyber—defence council.  I want to assure the rapporteur that we will consider all of these ideas very closely. Further investment in cyber—defence has already been highlighted in the current discussions on the next MFF. In conclusion, we’ve made considerable progress in the past few years on this range of issues connected to cyber—defence. We will continue to work to strengthen Member States’ capabilities and reinforce civ—mil synergies. We will continue to strengthen deterrence by bolstering our resilience and stepping up diplomatic responses to cyber—attacks. Thank you again for focusing on this issue and I look forward to our discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 422, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Antonio LÓPEZ-ISTÚRIZ WHITE", "mepid": "28399", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Urmas Paet, who has done some wonderful work.  Let's be clear, today's world is very different from yesterday's, it's more dynamic, it has an accelerated pace. So are threats, which are multiple and constantly changing. We can't be naive. The citizens of the Union demand that the Union protect them; a Union that strives to maintain an open, free and secure cyberspace.  It is clear that with the digitisation of our economies and societies we are exposed to many more threats, and these attacks have the potential to alter the daily lives of European citizens, as we have already seen too often.  Strengthening cooperation and coordination in the so-called \"fifth domain of war\" – cyberspace – is of paramount importance. Cyber defense can and should be cooperative, as its operational scope has no borders, national or organizational, and joint work resolves inefficiencies and confers credibility. I am proud that, over the past twenty-five years, my party, the European People's Party, has been a leader in security and defence policies. I am glad that the other political forces are now joining our concerns.  I am grateful for the support for this viable and realistic institutional effort which I have proposed, which is reflected in the figure of a european Union cyber authority, an authority that will coordinate operations, build trust between States, serve as a liaison point between member states' cyber authorities and working closely with NATO.

It has been a pleasure to work with him and the other shadows on this serious issue. The report recognises that cybersecurity and the defence of Europe’s cyberspace is one of the most important challenges that we face now. It also emphasises that there needs to be an integrated policy response with cooperation between civilian, security and military stakeholders.  The threats we face are multiple, coming from individuals, criminal gangs and states. In the UK last year our health service was severely affected by a cyber—attack launched by North Korea. That was not the only state—sponsored attack which the EU has suffered. It is essential that Europe stand united against attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya.  Cyber—attacks, whatever their source, do not respect national boundaries, making it all the more important to work together at an EU level. In the same week that the new European Defence Fund is launched, we want to see more invested in Europe’s ability to defend itself. As the report makes clear, there needs to be more investment in cyber—expertise, emphasising the need for more experts in the cyber—defence domain and the facilitation of cooperation between existing experts. We also need to develop our capabilities to ensure better attribution of cyber—attacks, enabling a stronger coordinated response to those specific attacks that impact all of us across Europe. The EU should also fulfil the role it plays so well in other areas: namely, leading the development of international laws and standards in this field.

Also, thank you very much to my colleagues and colleagues from the ENVI Committee for their contributions through their opinion. We regret that Mrs Crețu is not with us today, but we believe that our messages today will reach her and that we can count on her in the fight for a stronger circular economy in European funds.  The cohesion policy and circular economy report comes at the right time with concrete proposals and strong support from the Regional Development Committee. The Commission presented us with draft Multiannual Financial Frameworks, as well as draft Common Provisions and Structural and Investment Funds. On a positive note, the circular economy is recognised as one of the European Union's leading public policies, and I also welcome the Commission's proposal that the disposal of unsorted waste, mechanical biological treatment of waste and incineration of non-recovery waste will no longer be funded by European funds. We are currently in a challenging position to achieve the objectives of the Waste Directive because we have not been guided by the waste management hierarchy and long-term planning. This report warns of these bad practices and offers solutions to change negative trends through European public policies. The circular economy must not be imposed on Brussels policy, but a policy considered at local, regional and national level, which is why we propose an ex-ante condition in the form of a circular economy strategy as a precondition for us to rethink at local and national level what a circular economy is for our communities, how best we can achieve it, create new green jobs and achieve European goals for the benefit of the local community. As Parliament, it is of utmost importance to us how European public money is spent, which is why it is necessary to develop methodology and indicators for monitoring the consumption of money for the circular economy, so that they can evaluate spending well and react in time.  The potentials for our regions and local environments are great, waste to most is a big political problem, but we see it as a solution in a circular economy. The development of secondary raw material markets, the use of green and circular public procurement, the promotion of investments in the bio-economy, investment in renewable energy sources as well as advanced networks, and the encouragement of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship to innovate and develop business models in accordance with the principles of the circular economy are just some tools before countries, regions and local authorities.

On behalf of the Commission, I would like to welcome this debate and the opportunity to discuss cohesion policy’s contribution to the circular economy. As you know well, the Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted in 2015 when the framework for the 2014—2020 cohesion policy was already in place. Nevertheless, many priorities and principles have been key components of our cohesion policy, acting as a stimulus to local and regional development: waste prevention, recycling, eco—design and similar measures create savings, increase turnover and create local jobs in various sectors.  In the 2014—2020 period, cohesion policy invests in improved waste management with more than EUR 5.5 billion. Furthermore, we invest in resource efficiency, SME support and close—to—market innovation. Beyond funding, cohesion policy provides possibilities for capacity building,  technical assistance, promoting green public procurement and cooperation across borders. To avoid lock—ins, the system of ex-ante conditionalities was introduced, as mentioned. For waste, this means that the investments are made based on waste management and prevention plans, and for innovation, on smart specialisation strategies. All of this will go forward and continue in the next MFF. In addition, we will place more emphasis on the transition towards a circular economy. This is a broad challenge, profoundly changing our economies, which requires innovation, behavioural change, improved waste prevention and management, know—how, skills and administrative capacity, among other things. With its integrated policy framework, cohesion policy is well placed to help regions to face this challenge.  Among the priorities included in the Commission’s proposal is an increased focus on the upper strategies of the waste hierarchy, excluding landfilling and the least desirable treatment operations from the scope of the funds, to adapt regional waste management systems to the new long-term targets. We also increase the focus on smart specialisation, which helps regions to promote emerging industries and new value chains and business models – leading, we hope, to breakthroughs for the circular economy transition. That is our objective. We welcome this discussion.

The role of municipalities and cities in the use of new technologies, bio-waste in agriculture is also important.

In any case, these 150 billion, roughly foreseen in the 2014-2020 perspective, are very important for the transition to this area. Policies are both within cohesion policy, agricultural policy, and in other areas such as Horizon. In particular, I welcome the so-called Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking, which devotes a billion euros to the bio-economy.

For most people, the idea of a circular economy remains an abstract, if not entirely distant, concept. This is evidenced by a statistical data showing that more than 60% of waste is not recycled. It ends up in landfills. We easily adopted the \"do, consume, throw away\" model. The circular economy is a model of production and consumption in which things are not wastly thrown away, but are shared, lent, reused, repaired and recycled as long as possible. Today, we dispose of waste products made of wood, textiles, glass, plastics, but also building material, iron, practically everything that we no longer need for our own use for any reason. For this reason, it is of the utmost importance that future cohesion policy also has an incentive aspect for the circular economy, where it will also be actually applied. This means that local and local authorities must be integrated into this transition. Today, we already know a number of bright examples, where it was small municipalities that created their own local circular economy strategy and became energy independent. I would like to underline the fact that municipalities or local councils have the knowledge, the know-how, that really works. They must therefore be directly involved in the development of sustainable and regional development strategies and, on the other hand, must have sufficient space and financial opportunities to develop their own development strategies for the circular economy. The circular economy is not an end in itself. It brings benefits in the form of environmental quality, increases security of supply of raw materials, increases competitiveness, brings innovation, growth and the creation of new jobs. It offers consumers more durable and high-quality products that save their money and improve their quality of life.

The bad thing is that the circular economy still remains something exotic or something that can be done without it. The bad thing is that it needs to be proven that the circular economy, the reduction of the scale of waste, the recycling of raw materials can be beneficial. I believe that these thesis must be axiom. The principles of austerity, recycling, a responsible approach to raw materials and the future of the planet have not, and for a long time, it has long been to become part of not only public policy, but also part of the educational system or human consciousness. We only have one planet. It is good that Europe adopted the waste package a few years ago.

The report on the circular economy that we are about to vote on is very ambitious and meaningful, especially for those who, like me, come from Campania who, it should be remembered, has been battered for decades by criminal associations that, in contempt of any rule, including ethics, have caused the pollution and destruction of one of the most beautiful territories in Italy. Reducing waste that ends up in landfills and putting legal and illegal landfills in safety and reclamation is a top priority of the text we are approving. I believe that this is the right direction. The Commission is now being asked to take extraordinary action and efforts to clean up areas used for the illegal spillage and burial of hazardous waste, which undermines the health and economic and social well-being of the populations involved. As I have said, what has happened in the Land of Fires is a phenomenon that goes beyond national borders and therefore also deserves attention from the European Union. I think that an explicit reference to such phenomena is a positive sign. This is an important message from the European institutions to the citizens who live in those areas whose lives have been completely turned upside down. I therefore hope that this request will not remain a dead letter and that the Commission will act as soon as possible to protect the health and rights of citizens. Every time, when I leave and take the plane and see Vesuvius, I think I'm really admiring one of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen.

Madam President, the 21st century sees the emergence of a new economy, that of the management of our consumer products after use. A full-fledged economy, it is based not only on an economic principle of value, profits and job creation, but also on a new vision of consumption, because it is of course the object itself of consumption, from our daily food to motor vehicles, through our homes or our auxiliaries and robots, but also their packaging as well as their waste. The new idea is to take into account all these parameters before consumption, in advance, and no longer after the fact. Radical change that can prevent us from disappearing under our own objects and waste.  Therefore, globalized funding may be acceptable, especially if there are big savings.

While there is no doubt that coordination and greater cooperation between regions, small and medium-sized enterprises and other public and private actors are desirable, it is also true that, in accordance with the very principles of cohesion, those regions that are not yet able to comply with good practice must be accompanied and followed more closely.

We need to reduce, recycle and reuse. It is therefore urgent to combat waste. If we want a more sustainable Europe, the circular economy must be a commitment made not only in the long term, but as a permanent goal. The circular economy faces challenges that involve the change of the entire production system and which in fact needs the financial assistance of cohesion policy.  We must therefore provide local and regional authorities, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, investors, educational and research institutions, with adequate functional and financial autonomy, enabling them to prepare and implement strategies they believe to be the best for their regions, including community-based local development and integrated territorial investments.  It is also essential to combine different funding, including those of research, and it will not be too much to recall the privileged use of the environmental fund, which, for example, will fully support the agenda for the circular economy of one of the European outermost regions, the Autonomous Region of Madeira.

I think we’re all agreed that, if we get it right, the circular economy has the potential to support economic growth and regional development, while at the same time boosting environmental protection. We’ve discussed, this evening, a number of the potential gains and, from the Commission side, we agree with many of the points that have been made in the debate.  We have sought to target support during the current period, but, as many of you have stressed, it’s also important that we integrate these objectives in our proposals for the next period – the post-2020 period.  The transition to a circular economy is now included in the policy objectives that we are earmarking. Although the circular economy strategies are not yet implemented widely enough to be a new enabling condition, we are excluding the least desirable waste management options from the scope of funding.  Again, the monitoring framework includes new indicators more closely linked to the circular economy and the objectives we’ve been discussing, such as the use of recycled waste as raw materials. Now we’ll also have a tracking methodology that supports environmental objectives next to the tracking of climate objectives.  A number of other points have come up in discussion and, as we undertook at the beginning, we will make a careful report on all of those to Ms Creţu and her team.  The circular economy requires considerable changes to the way we live our lives and run our economies, and that requires the effort, support and engagement of a wide range of stakeholders who are trying to make the circular economy happen in all regions, local authorities and cities, but it is worth the effort.

I will look back at just a few details that I think are important that we might highlight and explain them even more strongly to our citizens.  First, it is very important to strengthen the capacities of our local and regional self-government. As a fact, I give the fact that in last year's competition of the European Commission for consultative assistance to regional self-government units, it was in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that there was a very low turnout. Thus, this part of the European Union did not recognise the circular economy in time as a potential for the development of its economy. Also, investing in the entrepreneurship sector is very important in order to enable it to transition to a circular economy. Here again I will give one example - the other day in a European retail chain I bought wooden spoons, forks, knives, as a substitute for the disposable plastic products that we use today, but what surprised me was that it was made in China, not in the European Union. So, China has recognized the European Union's policy in the circular economy and has actually applied the biomaterials it sells to us on the market today. So we need to make our entrepreneurship work to become competitive on a global scale. There was a mention of \"smart specialization\", this is very important in order for our regions to recognize their local potential. It is precisely as I would say that through the new Horizon Europe in the research and development of new materials using biomaterials, they would actually develop products, that is, those based today on disposable plastics. That is why I support the Commission's initiative to propose a directive on the limited use of single-use plastics and, of course, the proposal for a directive amending the Drinking Water Directive. And finally, I would just like to highlight what our most important messages really are, which our colleague Pietikäinen has already pointed out, which is that in this programming period we have projects, we have money from European funds that is poorly used. So, ex ante conditions that respect the hierarchy of waste management are actually the conditions for financing the circular economy, i.e. these projects.

The circular economy is much more comprehensive than waste management; it areas of renewable energy, resource efficiency, bioeconomy, agricultural and fisheries policies, food waste, air quality, research and development and innovation. The circular economy effectively supports sustainable development and the fight against climate change, so exploring and exploiting its potential is therefore an important task.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 483, "date": "2018-06-12.json", "name": "Adam GIEREK", "mepid": "28379", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – The structure of plastics used in tangible products is subject to irreversible changes during their operation as a result of the increase in internal entropy. A return to baseline, i.e. the distribution of secondary raw materials into starting components, although theoretically possible, would be subject to a higher energy input than that which occurred when primary raw materials were used.  Starting from the exergetic balance sheet, we can see that \"simple recycling\" has its own energy constraints. Repeated recycling of thermoplastic plastics leads to a shortening of polymer chains, i.e. a sharp decrease in their mechanical properties. The same is true of recycling in the case of the production of steel based on scrap iron alloys. The more melt cycles, the more likely it is that low-melt, nobler than iron components, such as copper, will appear in the steel structure. Such constants are fragile and not very malleable. They are not suitable for car body work.  The circular economy should take into account the exergetic constraints of secondary raw materials when developing new technologies for their use. A classic example of this approach could be the use of worn car tyres for the production of various types of rubber-polyurethane fittings (polyurethane as a binder), which have beneficial vibration damping properties. It is not difficult to predict that \"simple recycling\" would be extremely complex and energy-intensive in this case.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
