With his innate leadership skills and constant personal example, the South African President has embodied the principles of freedom, equality, justice and reconciliation like few others in the world. These values represent, taken as a whole, the very essence of the European Union and of this Parliament, which in 1988 awarded it the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. It is a fair recognition of his long battle to end apartheid and his commitment to equal rights. The Republic of South Africa will organize a series of initiatives throughout the world to convey to young people the memory of this great personality of the twentieth century. The European Parliament will participate and contribute to this programme of celebrations. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that next week we will be hosting a concert, in honour of Nelson Mandela, at the European Parliament's Yehudi Menuhin space in Brussels. This concert will be organized together with the South African mission.  At the September plenary session here in Strasbourg, I will receive Mrs Graça Machel, wife of former President Mandela. Mrs Machel has been committed for many years to women's and children's rights through the Graça Machel Trust, which aims, among other things, to enhance and convey the civil and moral legacy that Nelson Mandela has left us. I would also like to express, on behalf of Parliament, our deep concern at the reports of the repeated attacks on the Roma community in Ukraine in recent months, including the brutal stabbing of a 24-year-old man in an attack in which four other people were injured, including a woman and a ten-year-old boy. We express our sincere condolences to the victim's family and friends and wish a speedy recovery to all those who were injured. Relations between the European Union and Ukraine are based on common values and the Eu ropean Union attaches great importance to the rights of minorities. That is why we will continue to ask the Ukrainian representation for information on what is happening and on the development of the situation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   The Minutes of texts adopted at the sitting of 14 June have been distributed.

This is something that we cannot let happen. We cannot let ourselves be ignored.

I believe that the need to approve this reform has been included in the final document precisely because I have put a great deal of emphasis on this issue and many Heads of State or Government have intervened, after my speech, to underline the importance of the work carried out by Parliament, which must already be seen as a starting point for opening the debate.  I do not therefore believe that a reform can be adopted unanimously – since the Treaty provides for it to be adopted unanimously, because the Treaty provides for it to be adopted by qualified majority, which I have said and repeated. I believe, however, objectively, that the inclusion in the conclusions, unlike what was in the initial draft, where no mention was made of the reform of the right of asylum and dublin, was achieved thanks to the action of the European Parliament. However, I will reiterate this position before the debate that will take place in this House, reminding President Tusk of Parliament's position, and I will also reiterate this at the meetings of these days: I would like to point out that I had already sent the letter before the Council. As has been confirmed by those present, there has never been such an intense debate since my report ten years ago, that is, since the President of Parliament was present at Council meetings. I therefore believe that the European Parliament's message has arrived loud and clear on this issue, as well as on all the other issues – I am thinking of the issue of own resources – agreed during the meetings with the Conference of Presidents and the Contact Group on the next Community budget.

For the past 18 months, three-quarters of my allowances have been punctured to the tune of 300,000 euros. This absolutely considerable sum is supposed to represent the salaries and payroll taxes of one of my assistants, whom I say he worked entirely in accordance with his status. The decision was taken by the Secretary-General, without even being heard while the measures of application of the Statute, Article 68, paragraph 2, state: \"any decision on recovery is taken (...) Member concerned having been heard beforehand.\" The European Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 41, paragraphs 1 and 2, states that 'every person has the right to have his affairs dealt with fairly', which includes, among other things, the right of every person 'to be heard before an individual action that would adversely affect him is taken against him'. Article 6 of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms goes in the same direction. The charter for good administration, which we voted for, explicitly states this. I am speaking to my colleagues and to you. Irrespective of the political differences between us, is it decent to allow such a situation to continue in an administration which I have seen, for 30 years now, the arbitrariness gradually developing at the expense of the rights of parliamentarians, without the quaestors and the Bureau in any way?

One of the things we had required research on a vaccine for production. The recommendation was followed by the facts. That is why this epidemic has not had the scale it had in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, but the discussion is still relevant and I will tell you why. If we broaden the debate, we risk losing sight of an important aspect. I believe that we need to assess what has been done and I believe that we can put to our credit having had an influence on the Commission and on the global health institutions. If the epidemic has not happened, so much the better, but that is not a reason to ban it from our discussion.

Mr President, the Turkish elections on 24 June were a triumph for Erdogan, who was re-elected President with 53% of the vote. Erdogan will therefore benefit fully from the constitutional revision that transforms the Turkish parliamentary system into a presidential regime. Obviously, he will take the opportunity to continue the human rights violations that affect entire categories of the Turkish population, including journalists and academics. He will also take the opportunity to increase tensions with the United States and the Western world and to intensify his Islamist proselytism.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a decisive step for Europe's defence which we will take by adopting this regulation tomorrow. This is the first community program for the defence industry. We've come a long way on this. What is possible today was unimaginable a few years ago.  I would therefore like to thank the European Commission and you, Mrs Bie-kowska, in particular, for your help along this legislative journey. Your involvement in effective European defence has been decisive. The Bulgarian Presidency has also played its full role in bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion within the allotted time. Finally, thank you to my two fellow rapporteurs from the AFET, SEDE and BUDG committees, Ioan Paecu and Esteban Gonzalez Pons, as well as to the shadow rapporteurs of the ITRE committee with whom cooperation has been very productive. We have come up with a strong text to implement this programme as early as January 2019. Parliament has been heard, whereas this is an area in which Member States are not used to having a co-legislator. From the beginning, I have advocated a truly European approach to this programme, the only way to rapidly advance its implementation and reap all the benefits at European level. This new programme addresses three challenges for the European Union: budgetary efficiency, competitiveness and strategic autonomy. Budgetary efficiency, first of all, because it is no longer possible to continue to develop so many different defence technologies and products in Europe without cooperating and organising. Member States must be encouraged to invest together in future technologies and avoid duplication, based on their capacity priorities. At least three companies from three Member States will be required to submit action. It's pragmatism. Existing projects must be supported while encouraging further cooperation. Above all, it is urgent to have the same specifications between Member States to avoid any delay or additional cost. Competitiveness secondly, because the European Union must remain at the forefront to keep innovative industries on its territory and the thousands of jobs that depend on them. Our defence industry needs more Europe to provide less expensive, more reliable, more independent technology and thus showcase its technological wealth. Excellence must be the basis for the selection of companies in this program, whether large groups, mid-sized companies or SMEs. In fact, we have paid particular attention to SMEs that have a very useful capacity for innovation and adaptation in this sector. At least 10% of the budget will have to be reserved for them. Strategic autonomy at last. It is crucial to guaranteeing the European Union's freedom of action in the world and essential to dealing with the current instability of the international context. With this programme, a new dynamic is being set in place to encourage Member States to acquire technologies and products financed by EU money. What is our autonomy if we persist in buying hyperconnected products from third countries? Everyone must take responsibility for instiling a wind of independence in the European Union in this matter. We have also been able to reserve funding for companies based in the European Union with very limited exceptions for those that would not be controlled by Europeans. It is indeed crucial to avoid the leakage of our technological know-how. The role of our Parliament has been decisive in this regard. To succeed in this programme, Member States and industrialists must bring their best projects to European level. This is essential for this programme to create real leverage for defence investment in Europe. The new Post-2020 European Defence Fund already offers a prospect for this new defence industrial policy. This is an ambitious course. Ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are calling for the European Union to protect them from new threats. This program is a concrete way to respond responsibly.

It also provides a solid foundation for closer coordination with other regional and international frameworks, especially NATO, on capability development priorities. The EDIDP comes at a crucial time in international politics when both the political and military superstructures and their underlying basis in free trade are under attack.

I think that while facing new and evolving threats the European Union must first, of course, ensure its strategic autonomy, must become a security provider, but at the same time we must make sure that the European defence industry remains innovative and remains competitive.  Today the EU defence market is, as we all know, fragmented. There are a lot of inefficiencies, there is a lot of duplication in the way that public money is spent. The European Defence Industrial Development Programme is one part of the European Defence Fund launched by the Commission in June last year.  We’ve prepared and we’ve been working on two windows of the Programme: the research and capability windows. The research window is already well on track with the pilot projects and the preparatory action. Together with our EDIDP they mark really a new era in European defence, the EDIDP with EUR 500 million for the last two years of this budgetary perspective.  So I would like to thank Parliament very much for its support for those two instruments because, as we all know, all three institutions made concessions to reach agreement. I also want very wholeheartedly to thank the two rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs; they were working very hard in order to reach their agreement at a really record pace. This was a huge effort for all of us and we all know it was not a very easy process.  For everyone, of course, there were some points that didn’t make it through the negotiations and that is why we have foreseen a number of declarations that will have to be appended in the record of tomorrow’s session. I mean especially the Commission’s declaration on the list of priorities for the adoption of the work programme, on the selection of experts for the evaluation of proposals, and on the intention of the Commission to manage directly the programme. Overall I certainly believe that the compromise is a very good and balanced text. It is balanced, inclusive again, and it will truly help the EU defence industry to cooperate more and more efficiently. I am pleased that the final outcome upheld most of the proposals from the Commission and, of course, even improved on some of them.  On a few specific points: the budget. The final agreement providing for 60% of the budget to come from redeployment of existing programmes and 40% from the margins is, I think, a good and, once again, balanced one. As these redeployments have not yet been earmarked for specific purposes, we are confident that this will not affect the good implementation of their respective programmes.  Additionally, the programme provides strict conditions for the participation of companies based in the EU but not under EU effective control, and for cooperation with companies from outside the EU. It also provides conditions to ensure that intellectual property rights and EU added value will remain within the European Union. We will also introduce conditions for subcontractors’ participation.  The European Defence Fund, as was said before, is not a protectionist tool; we just want to make sure through this programme that the security interests of the EU and the security interests of its Member States are preserved. A firm obligation not to fund actions related to products prohibited by international law was added and a specific reference has been made to defence products designed to carry out level strikes without human control.  On governance: the regulation provides a very well defined and framed list of categories of capabilities that the work programme should include. We will define the work programme, of course, with the limits of our competitors and, as I said before, the Commission intends to implement the programme directly.  Finally, as I stressed when presenting our proposal to you in October last year, the programme is not only – definitely not – for the big companies and for the big Member States. I am very happy to see that the inclusive character of the original proposal was not only maintained but even strengthened in the final proposal. The programme promotes the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises from different Member States in the defence supply chain and provides some bonuses for cross-border SMEs and cross-border mid-caps. It is open to participation by beneficiaries from all Member States.  Now, the most important thing is to be ready by January 2019. I hope that the work programme can be adopted right after this summer break, so that we can launch the call for proposals immediately afterwards. With the EDIDP we tested our capacity to discuss and to agree at European level between different institutions on defence matters, but the real test of course is now. We need concrete and ambitious projects and this is work that is ongoing right now. The EDIDP also paves the way to the fully-fledged European Defence Fund that we just proposed for the next budget, with EUR 13 billion in financing. This new programme is, of course, again building on the results of the agreement reached on the EDIDP.

The observation was mentioned: there is not enough cooperation in the Industrial Sector of European Defence. At the same time, unfortunately, many Member States are equipping themselves with non-European suppliers, as illustrated by the example of Belgian fighter jets that are American. The aim is therefore to promote joint initiatives, initially, at the research and development stage, in order to gain competitiveness and better match future equipment projects to European needs, in the hope that Member States will ultimately be encouraged to equip themselves 'made in Europe'. Even though I am not a strong militarist, as everyone knows, I share this approach. Indeed, to reject this programme is to maintain the status quo, and the status quo will not have the effect of constraining the military-industrial complex, but rather will simply give it the latitude it currently has, just as it will leave the field open to certain Member States to continue buying non-European. I would like to point out a few factual points mentioned by Mrs Grossetête: with regard to the eligibility criteria - three companies from at least three Member States, the specific inclusion of mid-sized companies to cover the whole of European geography, exemptions for non-European entities with sites on the territory of the Union, via compartmentalization - the point of equilibrium has been found. Moreover, it is taken up almost as it is in the proposal of the European Defence Fund. However, it would have been nice to have a time to evaluate this mechanism in order to be able to attest to its waterproofing. It should be noted that in the proposal for a European defence fund, the new Article 7 on ethics fills a gap, but it will require a strong reinforcement. In conclusion, we will have to vote on the joint declaration on the funding of this programme, I regret that Parliament's position, which asked for fresh money for this new priority, has not been heard. However, I warn the Council and the Commission in view of the future European fund. For the next programming period, the punctured programs will require considerable resources, so it will no longer be possible to proceed by making the budget cavalry. If Europe is to be present on all fronts, it will need a much more ambitious multi-year financial framework.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Françoise Grossetête for the excellence of her work and the cooperation we have had with her.  It is good news that we are voting on this European industrial development programme in the field of defence. Together, Parliament and Member States are sending a strong message about the importance of this programme by reaching a strong and rapid agreement. The need to pool our defence needs at EU level gives rise to the emergence of bilateral and multilateral initiatives, such as announcements of Franco-German industrial collaboration, permanent structural collaboration at 25 or most recently the European 9-a-side intervention initiative. But, while supporting these initiatives, we believe it is more effective to move, like this programme, towards a common framework at a community level.  Everything has been said about the content of this program and the agreement we had, both on its funding, its deployment model and also on the fact - I stress - that management is centralized. We must realize that there is no power without military-industrial complex. I know it is a dirty word, but it is a word that actually needs to be mentioned. When we look at our Chinese and Russian transatlantic neighbours, we see that all their industry and their space, aeronautics and digital technology exists, thrives and competes with us through the transfer of the military to the civilian. This complex is the basis of military power but, thanks to its civilian benefits, it is also the pillar of economic development. It is high time that Europe had it and this programme is one of the most interesting to create a real military-industrial complex. I know that the basis of our deliberation is industrial and we hope that this small industrial seed will give us a solid tree towards a European defence. 68 years ago, the vote of the French National Assembly condemned the European Defence Community. Things have changed a lot since then. The need is growing, and the danger is pressing. It is therefore time that, from this mechanism and the one that follows, we can develop a genuine Community defence policy for our fellow citizens in Europe.

Tomorrow we will vote on a proposal to divert half a billion euros, that could be invested in useful and peaceful projects, towards the development of new weaponry, and particularly drones. Despite Parliament’s resolution that this should be fresh money, 60% of it will come from existing civilian programmes, so we will be investing in weaponry instead of improving communications and satellite technology.  This agenda is being driven by our continent’s powerful arms companies, which have more than doubled their lobbying budget in the last five years, and it seems to have worked. The EU Defence Fund is set to put nearly EUR 40 billion in these companies’ pockets over the next 10 years. That is over 30 times larger than the EU’s budget for human rights. Sadly, I fear some colleagues on the left of this House will have believed the lobbyists’ argument that funding arms protects jobs, but to defend these jobs that thrive on death and destruction, while ignoring the life-giving jobs that this same money could support in just and sustainable sectors, is a tragic failure of imagination. As Greens, we are committed to a European Union that was founded on peace and continues to support peaceful and secure livelihoods through its aid budget. But we should take note of the fact that the absurd inconsistency is there between spending public money to repair the damage caused by the very weapons that we are subsidising through budgets like the European Defence Industrial Development Programme.

The eligibility conditions also express a European matrix because it has excluded the financing of products and actions that may be related to weapons of mass destruction, personal mines or other weapons prohibited by international conventions. European control of the beneficiary consortia and the projects developed is also ensured, as well as the location within the European Union of the development and production process.  It is therefore essential that the European Defence Fund, proposed about a year ago, will be in place on 1 January 2019, ensuring sound prospects for European industry from 2020.      The European Fund of 500 million is a starting point that must take into account its effective use by European industry, the promotion of technological innovation for defence purposes in a broad sense, and the inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises in the supported consortia.  Moreover, sustainable and widespread economic and social development in the territory is also part of a modern concept of defence. With the appropriate constraints to the specifics of the sector, the more small and medium-sized Enterprises and European knowledge centres are involved, the greater the rooting and success of the programme. Getting off to a good start, with a focus on financial reallocation that takes investment in other areas, is an important step for Europe's information, at a time when diplomacy and economic competitiveness cannot be disconnected from the deterrent force of the risks of war conflict.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 38, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Anna FOTYGA", "mepid": "28353", "text": "   – Madam President, the European Defence Industrial Development Programme compromise is reasonable and worth supporting.

The second point: there is no contradiction between what we are doing for European Union defence, and NATO. We are working in very good cooperation, and let me repeat and echo what I have said many times before: a stronger EU in defence is ultimately a stronger NATO.

So yes, this programme is deed to guarantee peace, not to wage war, but to guarantee the peace and security of our fellow citizens. So let's not caricature this program, it's an industrial program for innovation and competitiveness. It is not a European army, it is about equipping the European Union with the most advanced technologies, in particular to ensure cyber security.

The Commission's initial proposal for a new regulation on integrated statistics on European farms was based on the idea of ​​simplifying data collection, reducing costs and administrative burdens, but also maintaining a flexible framework that can last and last. could adapt over time. We fully share these objectives, which have been the subject of our work and negotiations to find the balance between cost and flexibility. The process of collecting statistical data, in particular those on the structure of agricultural holdings, visibly influences decisions in future agricultural reforms, which ultimately affect farmers. The first pillar of this regulation is the 2020 agricultural census, and efforts have focused on reducing administrative burdens and pressure on farmers and, where possible, supplementing data from other existing databases. However, our biggest concern was to have a more accurate picture of the European agricultural area, from small farms to the largest structures. The second pillar is represented by statistical modules at regular intervals on various topics, such as agricultural labor, agricultural equipment, irrigation. Here we took care to keep a flexible framework, which would allow European statistics to evolve over time, but also so that a reasonable number of variables could be taken into account. The third pillar is the option of conducting ad hoc agricultural research. This was probably the most difficult point in the negotiations. First, there was a need to find an interinstitutional balance between delegated and implementing acts. Second, it was necessary to set a limit on the maximum number of variables. I know that some of you would like to have statistical information on various topics. Some could not be technically included in this file because they related to production statistics. Others were separate cases, national or local, which are already covered by national statistics. We regret that some animals, and in particular horses, could not be included in this census. An amendment has been tabled in the European Parliament to include horses in census data. Unfortunately, he did not obtain the necessary majority in the specialized commission. In addition, some countries no longer consider horses to be agricultural animals and we risk having a wrong picture of the number of horses in different countries. For other animals, such as quails or buffaloes, the herds are too small and too localized, and the statistical analysis would not have been conclusive. I remind you that, for horses and buffaloes, their number can be deduced from the national zootechnical registers. I believe, first of all, that we have reached a good agreement, which respects Parliament's mandate, guarantees the necessary flexibility for Eurostat but, at the same time, does not expose national statistical institutes to unforeseen administrative and financial costs. The Council agreed to withdraw the amendments concerning derogations from the Regulation on the protection of personal data (GDPR Regulation) aimed at creating specific statistical derogations from this Regulation. Thank you to the Council for the understanding I received. It would probably have been impossible for Parliament to reach an agreement if these amendments had not been withdrawn by the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 57, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Zoană, and the shadow rapporteurs for their very constructive approach to the proposal, and their support during the process. Following fruitful cooperation between the three EU institutions, I believe we have reached our common objective. The Commission welcomes the agreement reached on this important regulation on integrated farm statistics. We are discussing today the re-ordering of the collection of data for structural farm statistics, since the common agricultural policy is one of our oldest policies and the first European service on the structure of agricultural holdings dates back to 1966. This is one of our oldest data-collection arrangements. With each new iteration we improve its relevance for the changing economy and for our policy priorities. This proposal will ensure the availability of the data that only farmers can provide for planning and monitoring the common agricultural policy, as well as for climate change, environmental and other important European Union policies. Information from the farmer that we do not need – such as geolocation or whether the farm is, for instance, in a mountainous area – will not be asked for. Comparable and flexible, modernised European agricultural statistics of high quality are also important for a fair single market and sustainable growth and, in general, for a better understanding of our rapidly changing world. I want to thank you for having recognised the need for this flexibility and made sure it remained in the final compromise text. This will ensure that data collection keeps pace with the evolution of the CAP, taking into account, too, the recent Commission proposals. Because, as you all know, data collection is an investment that pays for itself many times over. Knowledge is the base for good policymaking. That is why I particularly welcome the addition of information on young farmers. This will help us understand the intergenerational dynamics, and the interests and the needs of the new generation that we need so much in this sector. Not having these data, or having them only in an inflexible form, would in the end be much more expensive. That is why I believe that this final agreement on integrated farms statistics is a success for each institution, and that, first and foremost, it will be of great benefit to Europe’s farmers and rural communities today and tomorrow, and to our Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 58, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, it is true that a priori we could think that statistics on agricultural holdings constitute a mere technical dossier, but the truth is that their importance is vital to be able to make effective use of the financial resources that we have. .

Of course I received information on how many hectares we have under organic agriculture in the European Union and of course I received information on how many hectares we have under protected products, ie protected geographical origin, but I did not receive information on how many of these protected products are produced organically.

I am especially pleased that our own priorities have been included in the final outcome, and will form part of the new service, specifically in relation to farm ownership models, information on farm transfers and the age profile of our farming community. Of course, statistics are only as useful as the purpose they are put to. We have known for years, for example, that we have a serious problem in attracting young people into farming.

This certainly applies to agriculture. If we want to steer the common agricultural policy, we need accurate data. How else can we know exactly what the situation is with our rural areas and what the impact is of, among other things, climate change, but also of the changed social climate in the countryside? By collecting data meticulously for years, we can better indicate trends but also predict trends. One of the clear trends is of course the rapid decline in the number of farmers, which really worries me. In the new CAP, we must take measures to find a supportive solution for this. Colleagues, although the collection of data in the agricultural sector has been happening since 1966, I need not tell you that in 2018 this data is even more needed than ever. Modernizing the data collection provided for in this legislation is therefore desperately needed as far as I am concerned. In closing, I would like to emphasize one more thing. When measuring various rural indicators, it has recently been noticed that the internet connections of rural municipalities are not always optimal. Nevertheless, the presence of a high-quality and smooth internet is absolutely necessary, not only to allow people a social digital life, but also to be able to engage in precision agriculture, for example.

However, this process cannot be treated completely separately from rural communities - digital developments are already mainly targeted at urban areas.

There is a separate European regulation, which organizes production statistics and, as far as I understand from the discussions we had at the European Commission, this regulation is also to be revised.

Especially unprotected and vulnerable in the context of globalization and climate change, indigenous peoples continue to be victims of homicide, aggression, forced evictions from their ancestral lands, arbitrary detentions, persecution and intimidation, racism and exclusion. As if that were not enough, they have alarming levels of poverty, disease and illiteracy, insufficient political participation and representation and an accelerated loss of their cultural and linguistic heritage. But the scope of this report goes beyond the issue of the rights of indigenous peoples by covering the phenomenon of “land grabbing”, which affects not only these peoples, but also countless peasant communities spread across various regions of the world. It is known that the growing demand for natural resources on the part of the extractive industry and the agro-industrial sector places enormous pressure on territories traditionally inhabited and cultivated by such communities, with conflicts over land use sometimes leading to serious violations of their human rights. One of the darkest aspects of this panorama is the number of murders of defenders of the rights of indigenous peoples and of the right to land that has occurred in recent years. In 2017 alone, 312 activists were murdered, two-thirds of whom were defending this type of rights. The European Union must therefore give more emphasis to the situation of these communities in its foreign policy, in particular in its dialogue with third countries on human rights and in trade, cooperation and development agreements. This report proposes, moreover, a set of initiatives to improve the situation of these communities and to protect their rights, starting with the adoption and implementation of the relevant international treaties by all the Member States of the European Union. In this chapter, it is never necessary to underline ILO Convention 169, as it is the only legally binding treaty. But a more robust approach is also proposed in the field of European Union extraterritorial obligations and domestic activities with an extraterritorial impact. This entails, from the outset, ensuring that violations of the rights of these peoples that, directly or indirectly, result from the extraterritorial action of companies and investors within the jurisdiction of the European Union are properly investigated and sanctioned. It is in this sense that it is proposed, in this report, to create a European mechanism that allows these communities to make complaints about these violations, regardless of the country where they register, in order to have effective access to justice. On the other hand, it is recommended that development projects supported by the European Union with an impact on the lives of these peoples scrupulously respect their right to be informed and consulted in advance, in order to obtain their prior consent. In parallel, the European Union must carry out impact studies before concluding trade and cooperation agreements. Finally, we cannot underestimate the importance of these communities for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and to stop the phenomenon of deforestation. That is also why the European Union must include them in its strategies for sustainable development and the fight against climate change. This is, moreover, a dimension that is sought to be emphasized in this report. Indigenous peoples are often, as we all know, completely invisible. People without a voice, seen as anachronisms, as people who are too many, who no longer have a place in our world. The European Union must make an effort to give them more visibility, and we hope that, with this report, it has made a small contribution to this. Before I finish, I would like to highlight the way in which the dialogue with all parliamentary groups has taken place on this issue. This report was greatly enriched by several contributions that were made by representatives of various parliamentary groups in this parliamentary assembly. I am convinced that, therefore, the conditions are created for a stronger report to emerge and a report mainly supported by broad support from Members of this European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 78, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I thank you all and especially the rapporteur, Mr Assis, for his report. We share your concerns. The human rights situation of indigenous people is extremely precarious in many countries and we see a rapid rise in the incidence of land grabbing, with increasing violence against indigenous rights and environmental defenders. Therefore, in 2017, we stepped up our support for indigenous peoples, and for human rights defenders working on land, environment, biodiversity and climate, through the European Union human rights defenders mechanism. We also share the concern over the multiple discrimination suffered by persons with disabilities and by women. The joint staff working document on indigenous peoples by the European External Action Service and the Commission, of October 2016, reflects the action we are taking to address these concerns. The May 2017 Council conclusions on indigenous peoples touch on and match the policy positions expressed in the Assis report. These conclusions also confirm the European Union’s support for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as the outcome of the 2014 World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. In relation to land grabbing, let me assure you that the European Union attaches vital importance to land governance and secure access to, and tenure of, land. The EU is supporting land governance in about 40 countries, with a total budget of EUR 240 million. In this regard, let me give the example of our programme in Colombia that was also important to the peace process there. Thanks to European Union support, 280 000 hectares were awarded through collective title, benefiting some 8 000 indigenous and Afro-Colombian families living in the neighbourhood of protected areas of national parks. We also recently concluded an agreement with Honduras which promotes the rights of indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples on issues such as land tenure and titling, and we are hoping to conclude soon an agreement with Guyana that seeks to raise guarantees for improved protection of Amerindian peoples and the land rights of forest-dependent local communities. The Assis report calls for the updating of the EU land policy guidelines from 2004, which the Commission is already considering. Implementing the principles of sustainable and responsible governance of land is key to stopping land grabbing, but we believe, too, that full implementation of the UN guiding principles on business and human rights is relevant in this context. We will also further reflect on the call for the Commission to launch an EU action plan on responsible business conduct. Mr President, honourable Members, allow me now briefly to touch on other recommendations in the report. The report addresses the issue of the training of delegation staff on the rights of indigenous peoples. In fact, the rights of indigenous peoples is a subject that features regularly in the human rights training programmes we provide annually to our staff but we also know more is needed, so we will certainly make efforts to enhance such training opportunities. The report also attaches importance to ensuring dialogues and consultations with indigenous peoples, at both national and regional level, as the May 2017 Council conclusions note too. Against that background, we are constantly working to enhance and explore ways of consulting and engaging with indigenous peoples more effectively. Such engagement could include discussions on the idea expressed in the report of establishing a complaints mechanism for indigenous peoples who have been affected adversely by EU action and cooperation. We firmly believe that the main challenge ahead of us lies in the implementation of the wealth of existing international and EU-level policy and legal frameworks, and it is in this light that we concur with the report on the urgency of ensuring consistency in all EU policies and actions pertaining to or affecting indigenous peoples. We would also very much welcome the European Parliament’s appointment of a standing rapporteur on indigenous peoples’ rights. Should this be realised, we will stand ready to cooperate with and support the mandate holder. Mr President, honourable Members, thank you once again for a very rich report and for your attention.

In 2007, after more than 20 years of negotiations, the United Nations adopted a declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. For the first time, the indigenous peoples' right to self-determination and control over their land and the mineral resources stored there was recognized. Significantly, the governments of four states that until recently had not even been willing to grant citizenship to the original residents of their states voted against: the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Like all declarations of the United Nations, this UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples will only become effective if it is incorporated into legally binding international treaties or national legislation. But that's missing. So the rights of indigenous peoples continue to be disregarded in most cases when it comes to the exploitation of resources that are in their settlement area. Their rights to self-determination and the preservation of their culture are not respected. Even the only norm to date for the legal protection of indigenous peoples, ILO Convention 169, has only been ratified by a few states. The EU and its member states often praise themselves for standing up for human rights, pointing the finger at others. The EU states have so far largely failed to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination and, in particular, to protect their land from being robbed.

And in the defense of environmental rights, as in the defense of human rights, the most exposed are women who, too often, are victims of sexual violence, harassment, extortion and smear campaigns.

Today, different indigenous peoples live in more than 70 countries.

Indigenous peoples have a unique relationship with the land and the environment in which they live: for these people the land is life and the close relationship that binds them to it and its resources completely transcends the concept of ownership of Western societies. The devastating consequences that the loss of land causes for indigenous peoples are a crime against humanity that is perpetuated under the eyes of national institutions: often the perpetrators of such atrocities are multinational companies and it is not uncommon that they are also involved European multinationals. This Assembly in October 2016 had tried by a very large majority a resolution signed by me, on the subject of human rights violations by multinationals. Among other things, we proposed a series of very concrete measures also in this sector but, after almost two years and countless appeals, the European Commission - and I turn to the Commissioner here - continues to remain totally immobile while the multinationals continue to enrich at the expense of the environment and the fundamental rights of these ancestral peoples.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 90, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Csaba SÓGOR", "mepid": "39724", "text": "   – Mr President, according to the UN, indigenous people around the world today are facing greater violation of their rights than was the case 10 years ago.

As the Commissioner has just said, and very well, this is an extremely complex subject. There are no simple solutions to this type of problem. That is why it is important for the European Union to fully assume its responsibilities. In making a commitment to indigenous peoples, we are, above all, resuming a commitment to the best of ourselves. We have a set of values ​​that inspire our action, which are reasonably consensual values. Although we are experiencing difficult times in European political life today, it is good, at other times, to realize that these values ​​continue to be relatively unifying values ​​for Europeans and their political representatives. Respect for human rights and respect for the fundamental principle of human dignity are essential values ​​that must always govern our political intervention, under any circumstances. Afterwards, our policies will be declined differently, depending on the doctrinal and programmatic options of each one, with due respect for their own parliamentary democracies, such as those in which we live. But there is a set of fundamental values ​​that have to be taken care of. Today, when talking about indigenous peoples, we are also talking about these values. We all recognize that indigenous peoples, who in fact make up a significant percentage of humanity, are people particularly affected by situations of violence, oppression and injustice. Often, they are absolutely misunderstood. Perhaps the greatest injustice is to look at them and see in them a kind of anachronism that must be called into question, which must be exterminated. It is often on the basis of this, on the basis that indigenous peoples are anachronistic peoples, that we close our eyes, too often, to many of the violence that is committed on them. Now, the contribution that this European Parliament can and must make - and I am sure it will make it tomorrow, with a very significant vote - is to assume this responsibility on the part of Europeans. Just to finish, allow me just another 30 seconds to say the following.

The issue that is the subject of our debate today concerns a very large number of people. More than 700 million people around the world are affected by this problem. These are girls and boys, but above all, young girls who are the victims of a practice that is absolutely inhuman and reprehensible. The European Parliament has so far made every effort to condemn these practices. In Sudan, for example, the marriage age is 10 years. From the age of 10, young girls who are forced to marry cannot oppose it and this creates untenable situations. The Belgian daily Le Soir recently recounted the extremely sad story of a girl who was the victim of a forced marriage. What is the role of the European Parliament in this whole issue? We have iteratively thematized, I said, this problem. It is not the number of findings that is lacking. Everything has been said, but perhaps not yet by everyone. What needs to be done is to define a strategy, an approach to move the lines in this area. However, to develop a strategy, we must set a course. Therefore, firstly, one must have a clear vision on the objectives and, second, define the path to get there. We must therefore agree on the appropriate means to be put in place to fight this scourge. The goals are as follows: we want the marriage age to be raised to 18, and not just in one or two countries or even in the European Union, but all over the world. It is a universal standard. It has been consecrated by a number of international texts, it has been consecrated by a number of conventions which have already been ratified or are in the process of being ratified. The minimum age for marriage must be made a legal obligation and this legal obligation becomes an obligation of result. A policy based on results must be initiated. It is not enough to have enshrined in law a ban on marriage below the age of 18, it must be ensured that this obligation becomes reality. Now let's talk about the means. In countries with extreme poverty, education is often the poor relation of public policies. It is in the context of a political dialogue that the Commission and the European External Action Service should address these issues. The Commission and, of course, the Member States, which provide the bulk of the resources made available for development aid policy. We must support institutional actors such as Unicef ​​and Fnuap (United Nations fund for populations) who have considerable experience and expertise in this area. Then, I will also ask the Commission to make the fight against early and forced marriages an element of conditionality. Let's also talk about credibility. We must ensure that all Member States of the European Union also set this standard of marriage at 18 years. We ask the Commission - this is also a request from our committee and from the report that I have the honor to present to you - to devote one of the next years to this issue, by declaring a European year for the fight against forced and early marriage. Finally, it is important to fill the gaps created by the Global gag rule. I know that the Commission is on the right track, it can count on our full support. To conclude, we need a strong and determined European Union, strong partner states, not skimp on resources, set a course and, at the latest, we should have extremely comforting and tangible results in 2030, the year in which the objectives of sustainable development should be realized.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 100, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Charles Goerens, for his excellent report. Protecting girls is, first and foremost, about upholding European values and respect for human rights. It is also about enforcing European law and respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights and international human rights law. Combating child marriage requires a comprehensive strategy, and the European Union has already stepped up its external work and the recommendations included in the report are of vital importance to us and will help us in achieving even more. Ending child marriage has been identified as a priority for the European Union action plan on human rights and democracy. We have translated this priority through the EU Gender Action Plan (GAP II) with a strong emphasis on the empowerment of girls. The revised European Union guidelines for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child highlight the fact that raising awareness and promoting gender equality is a priority for European engagement with partner countries. The human rights and democracy country strategies for the 2016—2020 period include children’s rights as one of the main priorities, some of them focused on combating child marriage. The report also mentions children on the move as particularly vulnerable. The communication on the protection of children in migration, adopted in April 2017, proposes actions to protect these children, including girls who are at risk of forced marriage. I want to reassure you that early and forced marriage is being regularly raised in political and human rights dialogues with the EU’s partner countries and we will continue to do so, as requested in the report. The report also calls for the Union to work together with the relevant UN agencies – and the rapporteur also requested this here – on this subject. This cooperation is already ongoing and will continue. It has to continue. For instance, the European Union has contributed EUR 6 million to the UNFPA—UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage. The programme targets communities from a group of 12 countries and focuses on education, access to health care, strengthening enforcement mechanisms, girls’ empowerment and changing social norms. In September 2017, the European Union and the United Nations launched a historic initiative, branded the ‘Spotlight Initiative’, to end violence against women and girls with an investment of EUR 500 million. Ending early and forced marriage is as much about adopting protective legislation as about enhancing access to education. The report refers many times to the lack of education, not only as a root cause, but also as a consequence of early marriage. We share this view. The communication on education and emergencies and protracted crises, adopted in May 2018, reiterates the protective role of education, recognising that children who are not in school are exposed to forced marriage and early pregnancy, among many other risks. The Union will markedly focus its education in emergency actions to bring children back into school, those forcibly displaced or those belonging to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and to quality education. We are also doing our homework inside the Union. We are combating early and forced marriage through promoting sustainable social change, through our rights, equality and citizenship programme. The Union has co—financed the setting up of a European network on guardianship for unaccompanied children. This network will allow developing guardianship capacity as well as the prevention of, and responses to, early and forced marriage. In October last year, we had a Girls Summit in Brussels, which brought together many young girls from around the world. The aim was to put the spotlight on what needs to be done to ensure their rights are respected, protected and of course enforced. I would like to conclude by sharing some key messages from this summit that I find very valid in the context of today’s debate. Firstly, child marriage is not only a violation of girls’ rights, but also a form of violence and discrimination against women and girls and, as such, is absolutely unacceptable. Secondly, to end this practice it is of the utmost importance that girls and women have a voice at all levels of society. We therefore very much share the views expressed in the report that the active participation of girls in society is an active way of preventing child marriage. Thirdly, as the report says, it is urgent to inform and educate men and boys. Men and boys must take full responsibility to challenge discriminatory social norms and gender stereotypes and foster positive norms of gender equality, non—violence and respect. Finally, education is the main channel through which sustainable progress in ending child marriage will be achieved.

When I learned of the AFET commission's decision to propose a resolution to the Commission to highlight the problem, I was pleased to hear that our requests, as FEMM commission, have finally been heard. We are no longer alone in fighting this violation of human rights, as can also be seen from the resolution that has been tabled in this House.

We must remember that these kinds of marriage lead to serious consequences, including limiting opportunities to study for those concerned, as education is often ceased abruptly, and, in some cases, to high mortality rates among mothers. We need to ensure that forced marriages are not conducted on European territory among migrants or person of non-European citizenship. If we want to strengthen the fight against these forms of marriage, we need to invest in education and empowerment, especially for women and girls, and provide support to victims. Boys and men in third countries need to be given more information and education in order to develop support for measures that respect human rights, including those of children and women. We need the EU, as an institution which has a global role on human rights, to also take a central role in the fight against early and forced marriages.

It is cultural norms and practices which allow this. Child early and forced marriage is a cultural, not a religious, practice, and while strict legal enforcement and education may eventually bring about a changed mindset, it will be a slow, gradual progression before we are rid of these practices. And despite there being many international and legal instruments already available to governments to fight these malpractices, we have a long way to go to eliminate child early and forced marriage. Our efforts must continue and be accelerated. I therefore fully support the recommendations made by MEP Goerens in his report.  Much consideration was given to demands for a minimum age of marriage. I accept that in some Member States you can marry at 16 with parental consent. However, I believe it is right we consider a higher age so that vulnerable young people, particularly girls, are sufficiently mature and are able to stand up for their rights and resist social pressure.

Medieval forced and child marriages had long since been overcome here. Ms. Merkel's uncontrolled mass immigration has brought her to Europe thousands of times. We do not want this form of violence against minors. It brings immeasurable suffering. But this is the order of the day in parallel societies. The cause of this practice is - let's call the evil by its name - the Sharia. The causes of forced and child marriages are not poverty and patriarchy, but primarily Islam. The report misses the chance to make this clear. It is right to counteract forced and child marriages in foreign policy. But we have to sanction these crimes here too.

The example of Turkey clearly shows: Although forced marriages are officially prohibited there, Islamic-religious marriage from twelve onwards is not. Twelve-year-old girls are often faced with the choice between a forced marriage or being rejected by the family. According to Unicef, almost every third woman in Turkey is less than eighteen years old. The sociologist Necla Kelek, who was born in Istanbul, estimates that there were around 500 forced marriages in Berlin in 2017 and is of the opinion that the tradition of forced marriage is becoming part of everyday life here too.

Forced marriages are caused by a long tradition, partly religious, but also by living conditions. Parents consider the marriage of their children, especially daughters, to be a solution to difficult social conditions or a way to protect against even worse forms of violence.

To succeed and meet the 2030 Agenda target, we need a stronger partnership, we need more and better laws, more action plans, budget and accountability mechanisms and more data collection. We also need to see more comprehensive approaches, addressing all the various patterns behind child marriage. We need, too, more communication of positive stories on what works and also on what does not work. We see great potential in a European year dedicated to the fight against child, early and forced marriages, and we will ask our services to evaluate this idea.

It thus testifies to the will of the Commission to tackle this problem head on, and we have taken care to give political impetus to this problem. Then the Member States of the European Union must be exemplary. They must include permission to marry at age 18 in their legislation. This is an obligation of result, no mitigating circumstances allow this obligation to be ignored. In addition, the anchoring of a criminal practice that recurs from year to year, from generation to generation, in no way justifies its maintenance. Again, there are no extenuating circumstances to excuse or justify in any way the perpetuation of a practice which is absolutely villainous and criminal. It is not the anchoring of such a practice in religion or in the cultural tradition that would justify it, because in a pinch we should end up accepting cannibalism on the grounds that this practice too has been anchored in certain traditions. . So let's be absolutely clear so that there is not the slightest misunderstanding about this, we as the European Union, as Member States of the European Union, we must be absolutely determined to show the right example and make it an element of conditionality in our external relations. Let no one come and tell us that this ban would fall under a jurisdiction or a set of behaviors of Western countries. The universal convention of human rights is universal. All legislation on the protection of the rights of the child is universal. So I believe we need to act globally.

In addition, children's health is endangered by pregnancy and childbirth. Child marriages are prohibited by a number of international agreements, such as the Istanbul Convention, but concrete action is still urgently needed. In Finland, child marriages sparked a stir when PLAN International's fundraising campaign appeared on the street a year ago, featuring a 12-year-old girl who was recently pregnant. The picture spoke more than a thousand words and sparked heated debates, which I think is merely a good thing. The problems do not go away by silencing them. As a result of immigration in particular, childbirths have also increased within EU countries. The numbers of child marriages are appalling. An estimated four million girls marry before the age of 15 each year. If the situation continues, it is estimated that by 2050 there will be 1.2 billion victims of child marriage in the world.

I am very pleased that we are discussing the own-initiative report on climate diplomacy by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on the Environment here in plenary today. We have drawn up a very comprehensive text and, above all, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the success of this paper over the past few weeks for the excellent intergroup cooperation. It was time for the European Parliament to put climate diplomacy on its external agenda. However, if the EU is to make a credible international commitment to the implementation of the climate goals from the Paris Agreement, it must first of all do its own homework. European climate policy must be ambitious, and it must be visibly based on its own commitments and promises and make a significant contribution to supporting less affluent countries in implementing international climate norms. In order to put the EU in a position to take a leading role in the international implementation of the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, we must first strengthen the European External Action Service in the field of climate diplomacy in terms of personnel and finances. This also includes enabling the EU delegations in third countries to integrate the topic more closely into their portfolio. This replacement must also be reflected in the EU's next multiannual financial framework. Against this background, I appeal to the European Commission to comply with the demands formulated in the report and to strengthen EU climate diplomacy in a sustainable manner, also to continue to actively involve it in the upcoming legislative initiatives. The European Parliament must also firmly establish climate diplomacy on its foreign policy agenda. In view of the cross-departmental nature of the topic, Parliament's climate diplomatic approach must also include other policy areas. In particular, conflict prevention, migration policy, trade policy and the common security and defense policy are part of it. That would be a direct approach and the application of the development policy goals 2030, the goals for sustainable development, which can and must be well connected here. In view of the fact that climate change and its consequences are not only a concern for politics, I am particularly pleased that Pope Francis 'encyclical “Laudato si'”, which also makes a strong reference to the topic, has been included in the report as a reference point. As a further practical example, I would like to use trade policy, which will also be used in future agreements and in other policy areas, but also in trade policy and free trade agreements. We experienced that at CETA and now with the currently negotiated free trade agreement with Japan. Via its parliamentary networks, its delegations in partner countries and through delegation trips, the European Parliament must further advance its climate policy agenda and, in its diplomatic efforts, set the climate goals as part of the sustainable development goals as an integral part of bilateral and unilateral talks. The European Commission and the European External Action Service should work closely with the European Parliament and the Member States to develop a strategy for EU climate diplomacy. Their implementation and revision must be checked regularly. In doing so, Parliament will have the task of identifying successes and gaps in the EU's climate diplomatic efforts in its relevant reports and of making suggestions for future directions. In addition to international summits such as the G7 and G20, the regional level is becoming increasingly important for successful climate policy. Cities and regions, local actors up to town halls are often the decisive actors in the implementation of climate policy demands and the sustainable agenda. They should therefore be included in the EU's climate diplomatic guidelines and taken into account, even when the EU is on the move around the world. The same applies to civil society and science. These networks are particularly important for high-profile campaigns and international persuasion.

Climate protection is a global challenge and it can only be tackled through global cooperation. The EU is of course a pioneer in climate protection and has so far achieved many achievements. But Europe alone cannot protect the climate. We need partners in the world, and as we know we need all levels. We need the governments, but we also need civil society, the local level, the regional level, companies and science. That is precisely the subject of our report: how we can develop an instrument - together with all the institutions that the EU has, not just the Commission, not just the Council, but also Parliament and our agencies - how we can be coherent, strategic and can also credibly promote the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Mr Lietz has already mentioned: We want EU policy to become coherent when it comes to climate protection, that is: mainstreaming into all other policy areas, above all, of course, into trade policy, development policy and security policy. And there would be my first question to Commissioner Arias Cañete: can you imagine that the trade agreements we make are conditioned and that the countries with which we make agreements have ratified and are implementing the Paris Agreement? We see that countries that do not do that gain advantages that are unfair. We recently had this big conference on the relationship between climate change and security policy. Indeed: water shortages, droughts, storms, massive rainfall can endanger the existence of millions of people and thus also endanger security, which we have already observed in some countries. The EU's foreign and security policy should adapt to the fact that we have early warning systems and that we also base our strategies on them. There is an example of strategic partnerships, Commissioner: we have been working with China for many years on an emissions trading system - that is certainly a success story - and I would also think that we are doing thematic cooperation with other countries, especially when we exit fossil energies, in the development of renewable energies and other policies that we need for climate protection. There is also a question for Mr Arias Cañete: How far has the Commission done so that we can do thematic cooperation with cities, regions and other countries? We of course need a credible climate policy with us. Katowice will be the next test case. We believe that the EU should raise its climate target for 2030. I also have a question for Commissioner Arias Cañete: is it possible that before Katowice we will be able to increase the already agreed target of 40% CO2 reduction - in the light of the legislation that we have already passed? It would certainly be gratifying if we would also present the long-term strategy to 2050 after Katowice to ourselves and to our partners around the world. I too was delighted with this report as I was working. Thank you, Arne Lietz, who was the main driver. It was his idea, the cooperation between AFET and ENVI here in Parliament shows that this is possible. I would also like to thank all the departments in Parliament for their work. I am looking forward to broad support in the plenary tomorrow, and then the work really starts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 134, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, let me begin by congratulating the co-rapporteurs, Mr Lietz and Mr Leinen, for their excellent work and their cooperation on this important issue, particularly as we look in the months ahead towards COP24 in Katowice. The Commission fully shares Parliament’s view that addressing climate change is a collective responsibility at global level and requires a continuing shared commitment to multilateralism. Today, more than ever, Europe stands by the principles of a rules-based order, with the Paris Agreement as a cornerstone of an indispensable multilateral system. For Europe, dealing with climate change is not only a matter of political responsibility and multilateral engagement but also a matter of security, prevention of conflict, and stability around the world. Those principles were reaffirmed during the second edition of the Ministerial on Climate Action, co-hosted by the European Union, together with China and Canada, in Brussels on 20 and 21 June. Ministers confirmed that the Paris Agreement is irreversible and it is not to be renegotiated, stressing the importance of multilateralism. They reiterated their commitment to concluding the negotiations on the Paris Agreement work programme. In addition, on 22 June, High Representative and Commission Vice-President Mogherini hosted an important event on climate, peace and security, at which, as a European Union leader, she was both congratulated and further called upon by international leaders. The European External Action Service and the Commission are committed to deploying maximum political and diplomatic efforts to integrate action on climate, security and development, enhancing the European Union’s already strong, proactive voice on the global stage. As acknowledged in your report, 2018 is a crucial year for international climate action. The European Union is taking an active role in the Talanoa Dialogue. The recent ‘EU for Talanoa’ conference gathered some 550 participants, with widespread agreement that concluding on the Paris work programme at COP24 will be an important stepping stone towards delivering the Paris Agreement commitments. Talanoa is also the theme of the European Union climate diplomacy weeks in 2018 and presents an opportunity for the Union to showcase its model for low-emissions transition in a way that empowers more ambitious engagement from state and non-state players in order to help our partner countries implement the Paris Agreement. In this context, the European Union recently launched a strategic partnership for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. This is but one of the several initiatives on climate change that the Union is carrying out in various regions of the world through its sustainable development and cooperation instruments. A number of those initiatives, such as the global climate-change alliances, help address trans-boundary climate-related issues through dialogue and negotiation, thus supporting the climate diplomacy objectives. The report also rightly acknowledges that climate diplomacy plays a vital role in global security. Climate security has become one of the most important parts of our climate diplomacy, and the need to strengthen our efforts, to avoid climate change becoming a serious threat multiplier, is widely understood in our partner countries. The Commission welcomes the recognition in the report that effective climate diplomacy requires leadership at home as well as action at international level. The European Union is continuing to lead by example, by forging ahead with implementation of our nationally determined contributions (NDCs). We all reached a political agreement on the key pillars of the 23rd Climate and Energy Framework and this will allow the European Union to reach beyond our, at least 40%, emission-reduction contribution under the Paris Agreement. The European Union is committed to continuing its efforts. As a next step, the Commission will put forward a vision for the European Union long-term greenhouse emissions reduction strategy by November 2018. It will provide a clear vision of how to have a truly decarbonised European economy and will give a clear direction of travel, to ensure we have the right investments in place. The European Union and its Member States also continue to contribute their fair share to climate finance, remaining the largest donor of public climate finance by population: EUR 20.2 billion to climate action in developing countries in 2016. During this year’s climate diplomacy weeks, the European Union’s delegations around the world will, together with Member States’ embassies, be communicating their success stories. They will be showcasing the European Union’s strong track record in domestic implementation through effective climate policies. The European Union will, through strength and cooperation, build strong partnerships and provide continuous support to the poorest and most vulnerable. President, honourable Members, let me conclude by thanking Parliament once again for this comprehensive report and for your strong support for European climate action. I look forward to continuing to work with you in the months ahead as we approach COP24.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 135, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Francisco de Paula GAMBUS MILLET", "mepid": "125006", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, the debate we have today is more important than it may seem and, therefore, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs and also the other committees involved for their work.

There will be no country in the world that will not be affected by climate change or anyone who solves it alone, neither the most developed nor the least, but we must also be aware that the damages of climate change will affect the people of the countries the most. that they have no means at their disposal to alleviate the effects of climate change.

It would be good for the European Parliament to focus on filling the Paris Agreement with content, and not put itself in the position of a lone long-distance runner who is de facto running on the wall.

It also concerns what kind of products are brought into the EU and how climate compensation or quality standards are made here, and how the EU works within the WTO so that climate and resource efficiency criteria are actually included in international trade agreements and interpretations.

Yet there has been no discernible increase in global temperatures since the late 90s, despite an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. To date, the EU’s implementation of the Paris Agreement, in conjunction with its climate policies, has seen large—scale carbon leakage from the EU to third countries, whose energy dependent industries, such as those producing ammonia, leave, taking thousands of jobs with them. An unforeseen circumstance of driving ammonia production to countries outside the EU, such as China and India, which now account for 60% of production, has perversely led to a shortage of carbon dioxide in the EU, causing problems for bakeries, abattoirs, breweries, manufacturers of soft drinks and food packaging companies. In my opinion, the EU should adopt a wait—and—see attitude, rather than continue along the path of decarbonisation.

Now we have to implement it and indeed I think we can be very pleased with the work we have done in the whole clean energy package. I was the rapporteur for Parliament on the renewable energy file. We have agreed on a 32% target and a 32.5% target for energy efficiency, and I think Europe can certainly say that it is putting its own house in order and giving leadership to the rest of the world, on which it is to be complimented. We have, of course, a duty to help the third countries in particular. I was pleased that Commissioner Arias Cañete, who has been so active in this area throughout his Commissionership, pointed out the role we are playing in terms of giving finance, but we also have to share perspectives and knowledge not just with third countries, but also the industrialised world, because this is a global problem.

Climate diplomacy encompasses many aspects which we have touched on in this discussion – implementation and ambition under the Paris Agreement, migration, climate security, climate finance and, last but not least, our domestic commitments and actions here in the European Union. There was a direct question from Mr Leinen related to the Paris Agreement and trade agreements, and I understand that discussions are ongoing in the Council and at DG level on the complex question of potentially including the Paris Agreement as an essential element in the political process of the European Union’s international agreements. The European Union has already committed to the promotion of the Paris Agreement in its bilateral relations, and in trade relations in particular we have included an obligation to implement effectively the Paris Agreement in our more recentagreements.  But elevating the importance of the Paris Agreement further, putting it on a par with human rights, would also send a strong signal that the European Union’s international agreements, including trade agreements, are tools to help save globalisation, not only in economic terms, but also through protecting and promoting European Union values. However, it is a step that should not be taken lightly. It needs to be done in a manner that is operational in practice, and the Paris Agreement is designed to be facilitative, non-intrusive, non-punitive and respectful of national sovereignty.  We need to keep this in mind, but the Commission is ready to act as a facilitator in the discussions and to provide any information that could usefully inform this analysis.

Thank you very much for the lengthy debate, and thank you also the Commissioner for his answer. Several things have been raised, some of which I would like to address. Droughts and storms were also addressed in particular. There was now a conference of the Commission on the subject of climate diplomacy, climate and security, and here I would like to cite an example where we as parliament have had contact, for example in states and with representatives of Iran who, for their part, have difficulties in international negotiations. But when it comes to the question of the climate, the question of environmental damage and the question of droughts, there have been major inquiries, and certainly in the direction of the European Union. This means that climate diplomacy is also an introductory topic for diplomatic talks, even with states that have difficulties here. I would also like to mention an example on issues of multilateralism. We have here - you said it, Commissioner - the USA and Canada as interlocutors. And here Europe shows leadership initiative, namely in the situation that we are not only doing diplomacy towards the White House, but also on campaigns \"We are still in\" or campaigns by the governors who are committed to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement, a best practice As the saying goes, the European Union, not just the European delegation, which deals with all levels, but also the European Parliament. We have an office of the European Parliament there, and this cooperation on climate protection is going very well here. On the question of mainstreaming around Katowice, I would definitely like to mention one point again. The European Union must present the strategy for the Sustainable Development Goals in New York in 2019. Here it really makes sense for us to show that the climate issue is of outstanding importance. I would like to close with the point that was mentioned, namely how we also achieve technologies - also an important point, a goal in the area of ​​the Sustainable Development Goals -, energy supply and decarbonization, especially in our European neighborhood. North Africa has been mentioned here. This is about using renewable energies, from large projects to private households.

Mr Arias Cañete, I think it is good news that we are filling our trade agreements with elements of the Paris Agreement, because it would somehow no longer be appropriate for us to pursue free trade and to leave aside the sustainable elements of the climate change agreement.

Although some members of this and other forums deny it, the evidence of climate change is overwhelming, with anomalies increasingly frequent and damaging. 40% of the world's population lives in coastal areas, at risk of losing their homes and their way of life. Exceeding 1.5 ° C global temperature would lead to unprecedented changes. In extreme cases, some states will be engulfed by the sea or cyclones like the Marshall Islands. The fight against climate change is a global task. Human activity affects us equally and this fight must be egalitarian and in solidarity.

The global strategy on the US foreign and security policy affirms that the EU will strive for a strong United Nations as a bedrock of the multilateral rules-based order. The UN brings unique value-added measures to our citizens. Nevertheless, let me start with a bleak observation. If Winston Churchill were alive, what would he have said about the UN? It might have sounded like this: ‘The United Nations is a weak organisation, but I don’t know a better one.’ In my opinion, which is reflected in the report, this weakness has a structural origin and it has a name: it is called the Security Council. It is, by the way, also the most powerful body within the United Nations. Let me illustrate this with an example. In April of this year, the Security Council held a debate about what turned out to be a chemical attack in Syria. The question we all had on our mind was: how will the United Nations react to this atrocity? But unfortunately, just as in so many other cases we have observed, the veto of one superpower blocked the resolution condemning the attack, and so each side voted against the other’s proposals. When the United States and Russia are at odds, nothing moves and people keep suffering or even dying. This is one of the calamitous consequences of the power of veto. Our report therefore urges all those responsible to redouble their efforts to change both the veto right and the composition of the Security Council. It was enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which was adopted a few months after the end of World War II. The world of today is significantly different from that of the past 70-odd years, but the UN Security Council has practically remained the same. We actively support the UN Secretary General in his reform agenda to streamline the peace and security structure, which needs to become more efficient, focused and operational. We also support the Secretary General’s efforts in making a substantial change in order to align the UN development system with the priorities of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. We must not forget that the EU and its Member States were instrumental in shaping the global UN 2030 agenda, and the EU remains committed to being a front runner in mobilising all means of implementation and ensuring strong follow-up. We continue to support the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. The fact is that when women participate in peace processes, we have seen over and over again that peace agreements last significantly longer. Let me now turn to disturbing trends: sexual violence, including rape, is still being used as a weapon and constitutes a war crime. We therefore call for strengthened protection of women and girls in conflict areas. With regard to weapons of mass destruction and the issue of non-proliferation, we support all UN actions, as we do when we promote the full implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and encourage all UN Member States to sign and ratify it. As for human rights, we are very concerned to observe an ever-tighter space for civil society around the world, and we would emphasise that human rights are indivisible, interdependent and inter-related. When we speak of human rights, this is directly related to our support for the UN Global Compacts on Migration and on Refugees. We would strongly remind the international community to provide enough financial support for the UN High Commission on Refugees in order to be able fully to protect refugees around the world. I may pick up on a few outstanding issues in my final statement at the end of the debate and I hope that, despite some differences, you will support this important report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 162, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, today’s discussion shows the strong synergies and common ground between the European Parliament report and the European Union priorities for the United Nations and the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, adopted at the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 June. In the coming year the European Union will focus on peace and conflict prevention, a common positive agenda with the promotion and protection of human rights at the heart of multilateralism, and on expanding global engagement on issues such as climate action, the environment, migration, counterterrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These are set priorities and I see in the draft European Parliament recommendation the same narrative and key priorities. In the year ahead of us we need to capitalise on this common agenda in our changing global landscape. The European Union will strive for a strong United Nations as the bedrock of the multilateral rules-based order. This will be a decisive year for UN reform, and the European Union is a strong supporter of the United Nations Secretary-General’s ambitious reform agenda. The European Union has a strategic interest in seeing reforms unfold this year and we will vigorously support their implementation. I also want to say that I am pleased to see UN reform as a point in Parliament’s report for the first time. Enhanced cooperation with the African Union (AU) is key. The ground-breaking joint trilateral AU-EU-United Nations work on Libyan migration, aims to pave the way for enhanced cooperation on the wider peace and security agenda. The support being provided to the G5 Sahel Joint Force is a key example of the importance of investing in global security partnerships, and we are happy to see Parliament’s report welcoming trilateral cooperation as a strong means of strengthening multilateralism. We see the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an opportunity to advance this work at a time of negative threats. We both say that human rights are at the heart of multilateralism. Looking ahead, European Union unity is essential in order to fortify multilateralism and the current strong presence of European Union Member States at the UN Security Council contributes to positive forward momentum. A lot can be achieved through this European Union presence. Let me be more specific on our three interlinked priorities. On peace and conflict prevention the European Union will pursue an integrated approach, deploying all its tools and policies in support of prevention. Meaningful participation by women and youth in all aspects of peace and conflict prevention is critical to success, including in peace processes. Mediation is also a crucial tool to foster peace. In the coming year the European Union will further enhance cooperation with the UN on mediation and will step up efforts to carry out joint mediation actions, including with the AU and other partners. The European Union supports efforts to improve the performance of peace-keeping in order to protect populations better. In this respect, the European Union supports the UN action for peacekeeping initiatives. This will focus on prevention and calls for an integrated approach. Peace and security are indivisible from sustainable development and human rights. On our common positive agenda this year, marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Union strongly supports the pledge by the UN Secretary-General to move forwards on the human rights agenda, particularly at a time when there have been serious negative trends around the world in human rights. The 2030 Agenda is our joint blueprint for action in the years ahead, across all the pillars of the United Nations. The European Union sees the Sustainable Development Goals as an extraordinary opportunity to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, societal and environmental. The EU-UN Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls, launched in 2017, illustrates an innovative, joined-up approach. This initiative also reaffirms the European Union’s resolute and unwavering commitment to gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment – a common EU- UN imperative. Finally, on the issue of expanding our global engagement, the coming year will be crucial to accelerating climate action and operationalising the landmark Paris Agreement. Together with China and Canada, the European Union organised the 2018 Ministerial on Climate Action, renewing global momentum towards the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. With regard to migration, the European Union and its Member States are proactively engaged in the United Nations processes shaping the .. migration response firmly on the UN Agenda. The European Union will continue to intensify its efforts to strengthen the respect for international humanitarian law, as well as refugee law and international human rights law. ... full, prompt, impartial and effective investigation in cases of violations.

Thank you, colleague, friend, for your work on this. We have an extensive chapter on the manifold questions of peace and disarmament and, above all, an explicit commitment to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I expect you to act decisively in support of this agreement from the European Union. Do not follow the argumentation attempts of the German Foreign Minister, who opposes the will of 122 states. Today all steps towards the abolition of nuclear weapons and their non-proliferation must be taken.

This report contains concrete reform proposals to enable the United Nations to act more effectively. We also call for the role of the International Criminal Court to be strengthened so that those responsible for the most serious international crimes are brought to justice. In this context, in the last urgency resolution of the European Parliament on Myanmar, we proposed that the General Assembly launch an independent and international investigation into human rights violations against the Rohingya. The present report takes a clear position against the dangerous US foreign policy. It is demanded that the nuclear deal with Iran be adhered to. The USA's decision to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council is also regretted, and finally it is warned that the USA must also be committed to climate protection through international agreements.

Many of today's challenges are global; regional solutions are insufficient. I am thinking of climate change, of terrorism, of the management of migratory flows ... The latter is a serious challenge to which the European Union has not yet found adequate solutions. It is essential, first of all, to cooperate with the countries of the southern Mediterranean and with the African countries and, also, to actively contribute to economic and social change in Africa, whose population continues to increase. Otherwise, the problem, in the medium term, will be insoluble. For the rest, I hope that the December meeting in Marrakech will be an incentive to successfully conclude the global compact that is being negotiated within the framework of the United Nations. Peace and security are also an essential objective of the United Nations. We are very close to the conflicts in Libya and Syria and also the serious problems of the Sahel. As we have sadly lived through these days, Europe cannot escape its geography. Again, cooperation with the United Nations and with regional bodies, especially the African Union, is essential.

I am deeply disappointed that Mr Preda left the room immediately after his speech and I also deeply regret that, due to some – as a matter of fact, two – divisive issues, Mr Preda indicated that he would not support the report. That will mean that he – and how many others we don’t know – will not support the UN in its efforts to provide peace. They will not support the fight against sexual violence against women and girls, they will not support standing up for human rights, they will not support the global compact on migration and refugees, and they will not support the necessary reform initiatives of the UN Secretary—General, to name just a few of the important issues.  I would also like to mention at the end that we have to insist that, due to the ever-growing number of tasks for the UN system, we demand adequate financing by its member states. We deplore that there is a growing gap between the organisation’s needs and the funding provided for it. Last, but certainly not least, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the Paris Climate Accord and stress the need for its implementation globally.

I am honored to present, on behalf of myself and of the AFCO Committee, a report on the position of cities in the functioning of the European Union. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone who worked on this report. First of all, the shadow rapporteurs for their inventiveness, ideas and proposals, which were mostly included in the recommendation presented at the plenary session of the European Parliament. I would like to thank very much Mr Olbrycht, representing the REGI committee, who contributed autonomously to this report. The report responds to a new phenomenon, and good policy should respond to new phenomena. This new phenomenon is the accumulation in cities of a number of very important problems affecting the areas of EU policy. These are issues of our safety, the quality of public services, environmental protection, and in many cities also immigration and social exclusion. Hence the belief that the position of cities and their role in the functioning of the European Union should be greater than before. The report is based on the conviction that cities, where European problems are increasingly concentrated, play too little role in designing, implementing and debating the shape of EU policies. The report presents innovations within the framework of the treaty regulations: a stronger position of cities in the Committee of the Regions, increasing the role of city associations - Eurocities and the Council of European Municipalities and Regions - in the process of consulting and agreeing decisions, and finally strengthening the platforms established at the initiative of the European Commission. The report also recommends that the European Council should establish closer contact with local authorities. What is characteristic of the report is a dynamic, full-fledged understanding of the city. The city is not only a political unit, an administrative structure under political control. A European city is more than that. It is a social node, it is a place where the media and non-governmental organizations operate. Virtually no continent in the world has a network of cities of this value. Hence the report's proposal that, at the initiative of the European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions, open forums for European debate should be created around city councils willing to undertake this work, which would be a place for discussing and designing EU policies. And finally, two reservations. This is not an idea of ​​fortifying cities against anyone else. This is an idea for multi-level management and synergy between the activity of states, cities, local and regional structures and the European Union itself. It is also not an idea of ​​the selfishness of big cities. The report covers cities and urban areas, including those outside metropolises. They, too, can bear the burden and responsibility for the development of Europe to a greater extent than before. That's it for explaining the core ideas and content of this report. I am sure that, as in the AFCO committee, it will be approved by the majority of political forces in the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 181, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN", "mepid": "40599", "text": "- Mr President, 70% of Europeans live in cities.The majority of our income comes from cities.Clearly, the vast majority of innovations arise in cities because the diversity of cities and the diversity of people are a favorable basis for the emergence of innovations with education.Cities also have a long way to go in terms of land use planning, increasing green spaces and tackling climate change, as has been seen in various projects across Europe.That is why I hope that the next Commission will be able to include clearly in its work program the strengthening of urban policy and, in that connection, the increase in land-use planning, even though there is no direct competence.In the report, I particularly appreciate the idea of replacing the new bodies with the Urban Policy Unit and its operationalization through the Committee of the Regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 182, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Rory PALMER", "mepid": "190099", "text": "   – Madam President, before coming to this Parliament I was the Deputy Mayor of Leicester for six years.

As you know, all cities are a place where many of Europe’s challenges, such as dealing with high unemployment, promoting social integration, fighting against climate change, and reducing air pollution or congestion, are specifically acute and must be dealt with. Cities are at the same time places of great opportunities to boost growth, create jobs and enhance productivity for the benefit of all European Union citizens. Local authorities are often the closest contact point for citizens as 70% of our population live in urban areas, as Ms Šojdrová has just stressed, and even more will live there in the future. Therefore, working with them for cities can only bring the European Union closer to its citizens. Therefore, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s resolution as cities’ challenges and opportunities are part of most of the European Union’s actions.  Without forgetting the role of the Committee of the Regions, the Commission recognises the need to strengthen the role of cities in shaping future European Union policies. The European Union’s regional and urban policy aims to improve territorial cohesion and support urban development in the European Union. The Commission often expresses the need for more systematic and structured dialogues with representatives of local and regional governments at an earlier stage in policymaking, but also to develop some multilateral governance mechanisms for better policymaking and implementation. In this respect, the Urban Agenda for the European Union is an important milestone towards reinforcement of the urban dimension in all the European Union’s relevant policies. Two years after the Pact of Amsterdam setting up the Urban Agenda for the European Union, much has already been achieved. A more coherent and coordinated approach on urban issues within the Commission is taking place. The implementation of the Urban Agenda for the European Union is ongoing, with 12 thematic partnerships successfully established, mobilising more than 84 cities, while key new partnerships on security in public spaces and on culture and cultural heritage are to come and three action plans have already been finalised.  A one-stop shop for cities pulls together all European Union information for cities and URBIS has been set up under the European Investment Advisory Hub to support the preparation of urban investment projects. In addition, globally the Urban Agenda for the European Union is meant to become the European Union contribution to the United Nations’ New Urban Agenda, the Habitat III Conference, and the Sustainable Development Goals.  The recent Commission proposal for the next multiannual financial framework and post—2020 funds regulation confronts this by dedicating one of the policy objectives for investments specifically to be close to citizens. And cities will benefit from a specific earmarking of 6% of the European Regional Development Fund and will be empowered to select projects and manage the funds themselves. Within the Common Provisions on the European Regional Development Fund Regulation, the Commission also proposes to create a unique European Urban Initiative. This initiative will provide a coherent offer of services for cities in terms of capacity-building, innovation and knowledge. It will also enable cities to play a further role in the European Union policymaking process by supporting the Urban Agenda for the European Union.

The issues are diverse and complex, but I have chosen to focus my report around two main areas: that of intellectual property law and issues related to civil liability, particularly in the event of the production of defective objects. Regarding civil liability in the event of defective or even dangerous products, the multiplicity of players involved in the production chain could indeed lead us to consider new provisions in order to best cover and compensate consumers in the event of damage. Safety issues are also paramount, and in particular when it comes to the production of spare parts that will affect the automotive, household appliances, aircraft parts and even firearms sectors. In this report, we have also addressed issues relating to the medical field or to the production of prostheses or organ reproduction. This poses real ethical questions, such as that of equal access to health care, and this constitutes health issues. I will also say a word about the economic and environmental benefits that 3D printing could bring in the future. I am thinking in particular of the production and storage costs which will in fact decrease. The second text on which this report is based concerns intellectual property law which can be undermined by 3D printing if this process is not properly framed. 3D printing may indeed facilitate acts of counterfeiting, not only by individuals who may benefit from the private copying exception, but also by organized networks making profits from the sale of counterfeit products. To this end, it seems to me essential to prevent counterfeiting that a legal 3D printing offer develops so that the private individual who wishes to print a work can do so without breaking the law and ensuring fair remuneration. of the author. Finally and briefly, there is one subject that particularly interested me, and this because of my former profession as an auctioneer, it is that of the revolution that is looming in graphic arts. Tomorrow, everyone will have reproduction software or 3D printers that will allow them to reproduce the greatest masterpieces of painting and sculpture in a perfect way. Achieving perfection in reproduction is just a matter of time. So, unless you have a gendarme behind each work, the question that arises is obviously that of the production of works of art, that of copyright and that of Copyright. So I ask these questions: Tomorrow, what will an original work mean if the copy is perfectly identical to the original? Why will the original be worth more than the copy? How to protect yourself against fakes? As you can see, my dear colleagues, it is essential to be able to answer these questions by allowing more traceability in works produced in three dimensions. However, it is not a question of slowing down innovation through law, by legislating more and more and by accumulating legal texts, but here to anticipate and see to what extent the existing rules will have to adapt or be completed. To conclude, we have worked on this report in a true spirit of collaboration with my colleagues from the different political groups in the Legal Affairs Committee. I would also like to point out that it was passed unanimously. I was very happy about it.

In the event of damage to a particular item, for example, it allows the consumer to make a spare part instead of purchasing a new product.

Parliament’s report comes at an important time as this enabling technology has the potential to boost innovation in our industry and to have an impact on our everyday life. The Commission is looking closely into this technology. We originally adopted a third Data Package and a communication on artificial intelligence in which we set out a comprehensive approach to artificial intelligence. Liability and intellectual property are part of this discussion. Honourable Members, as pointed out in Ms Bergeron’s report, the opportunities that 3D printing offers have increased in various areas of our economy, for both business and consumers. By allowing the timely manufacturing of customised objects, not intended for mass production, 3D printing has the potential to make production more flexible and to boost industrial development, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To tap this potential we need a coherent legal framework that provides legal certainty for both consumers and businesses in the European Union. What do we currently have? The final result of the 3D printing process is a product, and in the European Union we have strict rules to ensure that products placed on the market are safe. We ensure safety whilst encouraging innovation through technology-neutral product rules – a major advantage in world trade. However, not all products are always safe and some can cause damage. That is why we have the Product Liability Directive in place. It ensures that producers and company suppliers are jointly and severally liable if products are defective. The directive covers all products from raw materials to highly complex and automated machinery, including the output of 3D printing. We originally evaluated the directive and did not come across any specific problems related to 3D printing, even though some questions remain regarding emerging digital technologies. Products today can be altered and changed after they are placed on the market. The production process may involve more and different actors than was the case in 1985 when the directive was adopted. In addition, there is no straightforward distinction between traditional products and new products. We should bear this in mind when looking at damage caused by products. We need simple liability rules that allow consumers to claim compensation for damage caused by defective products. To define how best to address this question, the Commission set up an expert group to discuss liability in relation to new technologies. We will issue guidance on the Product Liability Directive in mid-2019. At the same time, we will issue a report on the broader implications for, and potential gaps in, the liability and safety frameworks in respect of artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and robotics. We see intellectual property as a key element of our industrial policy strategy. Efficient, well-designed, and balanced intellectual property systems are key in promoting investment, innovation and growth. In the European Union we have top-quality common rules on IT protection, including unitary titles for trademarks and designs, which also allow citizens to defend these rights in practice. We have just lately successfully completed trademark reform at Union level. On 29 November 2017, we adopted the IP Package for a balanced IP system responding to today’s societal challenges. We have provided guidance on implementing the directive on the performance of intellectual property rights. We have also announced our actions to step up the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, and we are now in the process of reviewing some of the copyright rules in order to make our digital single market a reality. We expect that our copyright package will contribute to increasing the competitiveness of the European Union’s cultural and creative industries in the digital environment. It will also deliver more in terms of access to content by users and opportunities for creators, and will enhance the potential for all online operators. The question we need to ask ourselves is whether the robust framework I have just described is fit for purpose. The issue is actually a cross-cutting one with impacts not only on copyright protection but also on design rules, trademark and patent laws, as well as trade secrets. It is really the whole intellectual property spectrum which needs to be addressed. As for industrial applications which would not stifle innovation, aerospace is one such sector which sees a promising future in the application of 3D printing technology that will benefit our society. We need to anticipate new business models and assess the impacts of any changes in the IP framework. In conclusion, emerging digital technologies provide us with opportunities to see whether what we are doing is still fit for purpose. The European Union needs a liability and intellectual property rights framework that encourages innovation but also protects and fosters the uptake of emerging digital technologies. Rules on liability and intellectual property rights play an important role in creating this environment. Importantly, the European Parliament has identified similar issues related to technological progress. I look forward to working with you on finding the best way forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 193, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday.And now I hand it over to my colleague representing the place, my colleague, Vice-President, and I apologize for leading the meeting with such a voice, I was at a great music festival in Sopron, where I was born, this weekend, and that is my voice.In any case, thank you for your patience and I wish you a very good job.Good night!Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 194, "date": "2018-07-02.json", "name": "Lidia Joanna GERINGER DE OEDENBERG", "mepid": "28377", "text": "in writing. - The dynamic development of three-dimensional printing made it possible to produce more and more technologically advanced objects with the use of 3D printers.

The same is happening in the aviation sector, where building lighter components will reduce costs by using less fuel. The growing availability of 3D printers also makes it possible to make prints at home, which brings with it challenges in terms of intellectual property law. Mapping a three-dimensional object in the digital world can be considered an adaptation or some other type of development because a computer graphic artist transfers a three-dimensional object to another artistic technique - a CAD file. In this context, without a doubt, the graphic designer should have the consent of the creator of the original that he reproduces. His work related to the creation of the CAD file will also be copyrighted. The author will also be an operator who uses a 3D printer to create a completely new piece.

I reiterate my position, which you have been hearing for 4 years now, a hard line, stopping illegal movement, fighting traffickers. That is why we need trained police officers, and that is why we need the establishment of uniform minimum standards for police officers in the European Union. Regardless of the country of the European Union, the European citizen must be guaranteed the same level of security and personal protection, as well as the same quality of services and assistance provided by police officers when necessary. Every European citizen must feel equally protected and have an equally good connection with their police services. That is why the European Parliament and the Union must immediately start adopting uniform minimum standards for the equipment, gear and training of police officers. The European Parliament must do so, drawing on the findings and analysis of the European Police Union, a 15-union organization that has been investigating and documenting discrepancies between Europe's various police forces over their uniforms, equipment and training for the past three years. These conclusions and analyzes were presented by the Bulgarian participants in the trade union, the trade union federation of the employees in the Ministry of Interior and I think that they definitely deserve your attention.

Dear Mr. PRESIDENT! Ukraine has opted for European integration since 2014, which is why the EU supports it through a number of instruments: visa waivers, association and free trade agreements, financially. Under the Association Agreement, Ukraine is obliged to guarantee the fundamental human and minority rights and security of the people living on its territory. We must not turn a blind eye to the recent increase in extremist manifestations against national and ethnic minorities. In addition to the restrictions on power, ultranationalist organizations have emerged whose activities are dangerous for minorities. A living example of this is the bombing of the headquarters of a Hungarian advocacy organization in Transcarpathia, or the murder of Roma last week. Members of extremist organizations have carried out 6 pogroms against Roma in the last two months. The latest attack killed a 24-year-old man, injuring several others, including a child. I thank President Tajani for commemorating this case at the beginning of the sitting. Ukraine seems to be undergoing reforms, but the minorities in the country are in an increasingly difficult situation. Their constitutional rights are constantly narrowing and they face discrimination on a daily basis. I therefore call on the leaders of the European Union to follow developments and call on the Ukrainian authorities to ensure the peaceful coexistence of their citizens.

It is inadmissible for the President of a Member State of the European Union not to comply with the decision of the highest court in the State.

I joined with Women for Europe, a campaigning group who recognise that our rights will not be best protected by being outside the EU and that the cost of Brexit will impact on women much more than men, as we women always pay the price of increased household costs and we bear the burden of caring for our families in times of crisis. And, believe me, Brexit will usher in a new era of austerity for the many, not the few. I marched with young people who feel that their future has been stolen from them. They are furious, and we should heed them as they will not treat Brexiteers kindly at the next elections. I also marched with disabled people and military veterans, including a 96-year-old war veteran who fought against the fascism of the 1930s and 40s.
