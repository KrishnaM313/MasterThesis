The Sulawesi archipelago was hit by strong earthquakes which, in addition to causing numerous casualties, caused a large tsunami. Waves up to six metres high fell on the island's capital Palu, the town of Donggala and other coastal villages. According to the United Nations, 191 000 people on the island of Sulawesi need support, including 46 000 children and 14 000 elderly people.  The European Commission has unblocked a first humanitarian emergency aid of EUR 1.5 million to help the most vulnerable and provide basic necessities such as food, housing and water. The Community satellite cartography service Copernicus has also been activated. On behalf of this Parliament, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, to the Indonesian authorities, and I ask you for a minute's silence in memory of those who lost their lives in these disasters. (The House was standing and observing a minute's silence) In recent weeks I have been told of a number of cases of personal attacks on Members of this House, and I would like to make it very clear that such acts are unacceptable.  Violence, verbal or physical, and disrespect cannot be justified under any circumstances, let alone if they have the effect of limiting the normal exercise of the mandate that Members have received from the citizens.  In strongly condemning these acts, wherever they may come from, I would like to express our solidarity with my fellow Members Judith Sargentini, who has been the subject of a media hate campaign, Eleonora Forenza, who has also suffered physical violence, and my colleague István Ujhelyi, whose image was offended during a demonstration in Hungary.

I believe that you are particularly sensitive to this issue and I believe that once again the European Union and the European Parliament can send the message to Turkey that it is inconceivable and unacceptable for a country of the European Union, a full member, to continue to be divided, part of the European Union.

In the last session, we were interested, as regularly, in the issue of human rights, and I would like to speak to you, based on the regulation and on the basis of the texts that this House has adopted, on the issue of human rights in the European Parliament.  All the texts agree that before a decision that grieves is made against someone, that person must be heard. I want to quote Article 41 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 68 of the Enforcement Measures, which states that any decision on recovery is taken only after the Member concerned has been heard before by the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General robbed me of 300,000 euros and he refused to listen to me!  Ladies and gentlemen, we have passed a European Code of Good Administrative Conduct which says that in cases where a decision affects an individual - and we are also citizens - it is necessary to allow him to submit not only written submissions but also - and I quote: 'if necessary, to make oral submissions'. This right has been denied to me. It is also the result of a resolution of our Parliament on 9 June 2016.  Mr President, the parliamentary jurists who are under your orders or under the orders of the Secretary-General, Mr Welle, are currently trying to refute my legitimate claim before the Luxembourg court to at least be heard!

There is a real judicial setback! I have the text that I will communicate tomorrow at a press conference.

The S&amp;D Group re-proposes this issue on the agenda because the signals coming from the ground are alarming. The Government of Israel seems to de-eose all appeals. It continues with its plans and today, precisely today, the deadline ends so that the inhabitants have to destroy their homes and flee from there. Jan al-Ahmar is currently surrounded by the police and we don't know if the army is going to come in and demolish it. So today this House cannot be silent. That is why I call on the groups to support our request for the President to make a statement, followed by the group round. So that we may show our absolute rejection of this serious violation of human rights. For us to speak out out against this harassment and against this illegality, because no one is above the law. And so we can demand that Netanyahu not cross that red line. Because Jan al-Ahmar is not just any village: it is a strategic enclave that, if demolished, will put into check any attempt at peace in the Middle East.

Briefly, we were attacked by CasaPound militants, attacked and threatened with clubs, knuckles, chains. My parliamentary assistant is currently at home with nine stitches to the head, another boy has two broken vertebrae. That is because we took part in an anti-racist demonstration. This is because we felt it necessary to wait for an Italian citizen girl, but of Ethiopic origin and therefore with dark skin, who was afraid to cross the street of her house, because it was occupied by representatives of CasaPound, who then implemented the aggression that I told you about. I believe that this House should know that in Italy alone, from 2014 to 2018, more than 100 attacks by neo-fascist organisations took place. Yet the Italian Government has kept quiet, perhaps because one of its members, the Minister of the Interior, does not hesitate to be represented at dinner with that Simone Di Stefano, whom I personally asked a few months ago, on 1 February, that he be denied a press conference in this Parliament, precisely because he is part of a neo-fascist party.

The Commission's proposal was a timely proposal. I said that when I introduced it, but it needed to be aligned with the challenges of health technologies, their access and the sustainability of health systems. I believe that the agreement we reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is a good agreement because it is balanced because it focuses on the patient and because, in turn, it is respectful of the Member States which, through health systems, have to provide the right to access to health, a fundamental right. I would also like to begin by saying that this is not the first time that harmonisation has taken place in this sector at Community level. It was already done in the year 65 around safety, in the year 95 the EMA began to work and in 2001 the foundations that today regulate the field of medicine at European level were laid. And I think the results have been positive. But today the challenges are different: today we have the challenge of improving quality; research needs need to align better with medical needs, and prices, high prices also have to be regulated. These and other concerns were already expressed by both the Council and the European Parliament in June 2016. I am also aware that medicines and health technology have a view to European consumer good regulations, but this must be respectful and ultimately guarantee the fundamental right to access to health and, ultimately, access to health technology. This proposal, especially with the amendments and with Parliament's proposal, I believe that it is in improving quality, improving and aligning medical needs with research and, moreover, contributing to the sustainability of health systems; in short, to improve European citizens' access to medicines and new health products. In particular, and to illustrate this need, I would just like to give one piece of information, which is that in the last ten years, despite an increase of up to ten times the price of cancer medicines, only 14 or 15% of them have been shown to increase survival to five years. Marketing authorisation requires or evaluates safety and efficacy, but it is not your task to assess effectiveness or comparative effectiveness. There was already an attempt in 2004, through Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, to establish the added therapeutic value of medicines, but the agreement was not possible. To this day, the reality is that Member States carry out this evaluation process prior to the price and reimbursement process, which generates not only duplication, but, more importantly, the loss of the opportunity to improve the clinical evidence available, to direct research priorities to the medical needs of patients, to improve that quality of research and, ultimately, access to it. Therefore, as I said, I believe that this proposal is timely and can be positive. The Commission presented it to us justified in Article 114 TFEU — the internal market for eliminating duplication. I consider that this is neither the only nor the most important of the objectives to be achieved, but Article 168(4) TFEU allows us to take these decisions on the basis of the need to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. The mandatory nature of this assessment by the Member States requires the necessary confidence that I believe the text gives, a confidence based on a high scientific quality methodology that compares on the basis of the best available evidence, which is transparent, independent and public, and that is carried out by the coordination groups, by experts at national level. And, at the same time, that it cannot prevent the Member States themselves from adapting these assessments to the specificities of their national context. I would also like to have a very important impact on what is the agreement reached on medical devices. I am aware of the difficulties and differences that there were, but we have reached an agreement that I think is positive, in an emerging sector that needs that necessary increase in evidence. The participation of all stakeholders – patients, consumers, professionals – is also guaranteed and heard. At the same time, the door is opened to voluntary cooperation in new aspects, such as precision medicine, discouraging those Technologies...

The European Parliament has shown very active and constructive engagement on this issue, leading to the adoption of the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) on 13 September by an overwhelming majority. First of all, I would like to congratulate Ms Cabezón Ruiz on her timely work as rapporteur, as well as the shadow rapporteurs in the ENVI Committee, and the Members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO). The Commission appreciates Parliament’s overall support for its proposal, including a clear and ambitious product scope on medicinal products and medical devices. While time does not allow me to comment in detail on all the various amendments, I would at least like to mention briefly a few areas of modification. First, on the issue of the national use of European joint clinical assessments, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s strong support in ensuring that joint clinical assessments will be used by Member States – and will not be repeated. The approach suggested by Parliament, of adding some clarification as to the meaning of non-duplication, should address the concerns expressed by some Member States in the Council. This specifies that the legislation should not prevent Member States from conducting complementary clinical assessments outside the scope of the joint clinical assessments. Other amendments were aimed at further clarifying the proposal, as they stress that Member States continue to be responsible for drawing their own conclusions on the added therapeutic value of health technologies in the context of their health system. The second general area I would like to comment on concerns the respective roles of the Commission and the Member States in the cooperation process. In this area, the amendments follow the spirit of the text as they aim to clarify the Member States’ responsibility for conducting the joint work, and the supporting role of the Commission. The third important area relates to the quality and transparency of joint work produced through EU cooperation. The proposed amendment should ensure the submission of appropriate evidence by technology developers as well as providing for high scientific quality, independence and transparency in the joint work. These were important objectives of the Commission proposal. Lastly, let me stress that the Commission has serious concerns when it comes to the removal of harmonisation of national rules related to clinical assessments. This was one of the essential elements of our proposal, notably to ensure a high level of human health protection. In proposing such a harmonisation of national HTA methodologies, we had actually responded to previous calls for action from the European Parliament, including to your resolution on access to medicines, which called for the harmonising of HTA tools and methodologies. I would like to conclude by stressing that the Commission welcomes Parliament’s constructive proposals and stands ready to continue to discuss and explore solutions to outstanding issues with the co—legislators. Patients are at the heart of this proposal, which aims to deliver more efficient, transparent and effective EU HTA, and this new model of EU cooperation has clear potential to facilitate better access to innovative health technologies. I therefore call on you to help make this initiative a success for the benefit of patients across Europe.

As the rapporteur for IMCO, I have given particular interest to the fact that patients across Europe are facing disparities and delays in accessing innovative treatments due to the fragmentation of HTA systems. The IMCO opinion concentrated on improving the text in the area of the involvement of stakeholders in HTA, and we underline that cooperation between HT authorities should be based on the principle of good governance, objectivity, independence and transparency. Health technology developers should have the possibility to request an update on the clinical assessment when additional evidence from clinical practice becomes available. Finally, as regards the subsidiarity principle, while the decision on whether a drug can be reimbursed or not must remain a competency of the Member States, joint clinical assessments should be done at European level in order to shorten the HTA process, and it should not prevent a Member State from carrying out assessments on the added clinical value of the technologies as part of national or regional appraisal processes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 41, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Lieve WIERINCK", "mepid": "183022", "text": "  rapporteur for ITRE's opinion. Thank you, Mr President. With the new legislation on the evaluation of health technology, we are taking a step in the right direction for three reasons.  Firstly, our attention goes to every patient, indifferent to where in the European Union. Thanks to this European cooperation, patients with a rare cancer or a rare disease are more likely to have the availability of a medicine that works. Subject to the necessary privacy protection for the patient and the company, Member States will have access to larger-scale research data that they could not have collected separately.  Secondly, this European clinical assessment is a good development for the producer. The pharmaceutical sector only needs one clinical test at European level, not 28. For example, the countries where there is no clinical evaluation still have access to the European assessment. The clinical evaluation of new health technology ensures that Member States are kept informed of market developments and learn whether these products are working better than those already on the market. By putting innovative developments in the spotlight, we are stimulating our health sector at European level.  Thirdly, I am very much in favour of the flexibility remaining, both for the Member States and for the coordination group that is compiling the evaluation. It remains up to the Member States themselves to decide whether there will be a reimbursement system for the new technology. Some Member States may further develop their voluntary cooperation, as is already happening today with EUnetHTA or BeNeLuxA. The coordination group retains an overview of which new technologies are groundbreaking. If we in Europe want to draw the full map of research and innovation and put the patient at the centre, then a European evaluation of health technology is the path that we must take together with the Member States.  First, Ms. Gesine Meissner would like to thank the rapporteur, Soledad Cabezón Ruiz, for her good work and all the shadow rapporteurs for their collaboration. This is a very important file that will accelerate access to medicines for patients in the EU. By simplifying procedures by doing them once for the EU market instead of once in every EU Member State, it will indeed reduce the workload of the administrative bodies in the Member States – the scientists, but also the manufacturers. However, we are aware of Member States' reservations regarding their competences. That is why it was one of my key priorities to draw a clear distinction between EU and national competences. We have managed to negotiate overall compromises on all the paragraphs which ALDE supported in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) vote and which it will support in the plenary vote as well. One of my key concerns was the inclusion of high-risk medical devices in the scope of an EU HTA. With the new Medical Devices Regulation we have just adopted new standards on the safety and performance of medical devices. Regardless of their class, medical devices must be proven to be safe and their performance must be verified. A new requirement of the clinical benefits, which is the added value of a medical device, will also have to be demonstrated. I propose to focus on strong legislation for medical products and look at the medical devices at the second stage. Although my approach did not make it entirely into the final compromises, I was very pleased to see that the rapporteur agreed to further narrow the scope on medical devices. This is a good starting point for further negotiation.

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Cabezon Ruiz, for her hard work in a very collective way. I would like to point out that the European treaties call on Europe, in terms of health, to allow everyone equal access to quality care and it is indeed important to demonstrate the added value of the European Union in the field of health. I could even say that the future of health, in my opinion, will be European or not. How can we understand that the clinical added value of a drug authorised throughout Europe differs from country to country? How can patients be explained that the same treatment is considered innovative, useful and highly effective on one side of the border, when it is considered to have less added value in another Member State? How do you tell a patient that they still have to wait to get this new drug already available in the neighbouring country? Make no mistake, we are not talking about a decision about the price or reimbursement of the drug, it is all in the national context. The aim is to conduct a scientific evaluation of the therapeutic added value of a new technology compared to existing alternatives. This work will help promote high-value-added treatments and accelerate patients' access to medical innovations. As the Commissioner pointed out, the national health authorities who hold the expertise will remain responsible, of course, but they must learn to work together and that is why we wanted to strengthen the collegiality of the work. A word, finally, about medical devices. This sector includes many small and medium-sized enterprises that are already facing major regulatory upheavals. We must avoid an impact that would be too brutal on this changing sector and that is why we have decided to restrict the scope a little. All of this will be a success if we can combat the reluctance of the Member States.

I approach this report dualistly, on two sides: on the one hand as a politician, on the other as a doctor. As a doctor, I realize that HTA is today the basis for optimal and best medical decisions. As a politician, I already have some doubts, because health services, health care, its organisation and funding are the exclusive domain of the Member States. I therefore recommend some caution here, particular caution in formulating very strong harmonisation on HTA. I am well aware that the evaluation of medical technologies is a multidisciplinary process that summarizes information and knowledge on the use of specific medical techniques in medical, social, economic or ethical conditions, and its use is always difficult.  It is important to strive for HTA to provide a basis for shaping a safe and effective health policy, and here I am respectfully saying that the patient should be at the heart of this document. It is also important to make the most of the financial resources allocated to health.  I have two comments. Firstly, it seems to me that the compromise would concern the possibility of constructive dialogue within the common European reports to be carried out by the Member States, as well as an additional evaluation, and possibly the use of their existing scope of work and expenditure, because it is not the case that The Member States do not prepare their own reports and do not carry out their own studies.  The second point should, however, seek to extend the transitional periods for the application of medical technology assessments mainly in the field of medical devices. This is a new, difficult, huge issue, and here I think that first we would have to deal well with drug programs, where it is simpler, we have more experience. It is worse with medical devices, here there should be a larger transition period.

Simply registering a drug or medical device based on an assessment of its effectiveness and safety does not guarantee that the new treatment is a step forward. The diverse bodies that carry out HTAs in the Member States today often make very different decisions on the same medicines, putting patients in an unequal position, in addition to being very confused. Moreover, these decisions lack any transparency and are the work of a narrow group of people.  As I have said several times, I am very disappointed that the proposal focuses purely on clinical trials. Eliminating the economic, social and ethical aspects of the proposal is a mistake. The proposal establishes as the main authority a coordination group of Member States for HTA. Unfortunately, in the context of committee negotiations, I have not been able to enforce that patients should also have a representative in this group. I'll try again then. I will table my committee amendment in plenary, and I would therefore like to ask you to support it. I also do not like the proposed extremely long transitional period, after which Member States will not have to participate in the system at all. It should be noted that patients are waiting for this adjustment in order to ensure equality in individual Member States.  And other disappointments include addressing the issue of joint assessments of medical devices, where, let's be honest, the committee-voted text essentially means removing them from the system.

To date, in order to bring a drug into the European market, manufacturers must first demonstrate its safety, then its non-inferiority to the therapies currently established and therefore their effectiveness. But patients will never know if a drug brings real added value compared to others, clinically. And that is why we have found ourselves in cases such as that of cetuximab, in the face of cases such as these, which if used for the treatment of the lung costs about eight thousand euros per patient for a median increase in survival of only one month. Or, like the case of erlotinib, which when used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer costs 15000 euros per patient for an increase in median survival of about ten days. Our health systems cannot afford this waste that only pharmaceutical companies benefit from. Clinical voting must therefore be based on clear scientific evidence, which, on the one hand, must be aimed at demonstrating the existence of a real breakthrough for the health and quality of life of patients, so that prices can be renegotiated with pharmaceutical companies and, on the other hand, they must be the same in each Member State, so as to guarantee all citizens of the Union the same right to health that is a fundamental right of the Citizen of the Union. , without wasting resources and without overlapping tasks that are useless and counterproductive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 8, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 48, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Joëlle MÉLIN", "mepid": "124765", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

This is conceivable, of course, and it is clear that it is better to anticipate any drift and, as far as possible, to use these innovative advances to the best of their objectives.  Unfortunately, this approach has already been applied in France with regard to medicines. These were evaluated for a decade of medical services rendered, and the result was not long in coming! Many old specialties that were generated, inexpensive and proven to be effective, were swept away, of course, because they were unprofitable. The French pharmacopoeia has thus been amputated from real little treasures. The laboratories that made them have also disappeared. Only the economic factor prevailed. Tomorrow, in the context of the evaluation of medicines at European level, but also of medical devices, which range from sparadrap to extracorporeal circulation equipment, but also of all clinical and paraclinical techniques, it will be all carers who will be checked, invalidated or even banned, because there is every doubt that independence and transparency will be questioned.  So, in our view, there is a great danger that economic interests alone will condition health in Europe. This is, of course, fundamentally unacceptable.

We have a European Medicines Agency – currently still in London, soon in Amsterdam – which is working very well. And as someone who wants to put a new drug on the market, you get a licence for the whole of the European Union, once you have put all the data that is necessary on the table. Then you want to make this drug available to the patient. But then, in 28 countries, 28 different procedures must be followed and additional data – scientific data – collected to answer the questions they still have about this drug. In some Member States there are even regional procedures for HTA, then the whole thing becomes even more complicated. I believe that this is a waste of resources, which increases costs. The highly qualified pharmacists, doctors who collect additional data, should instead research new drugs that will help patients better. And it also delays access to medicines. That is why it is very, very good that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Social Affairs adopted the report by a large majority. Thank you to the rapporteur, Mrs Cabezén Ruiz, to mrs Grossetéte, who did this for the PPE-DE. I am also grateful for some clarifications. We want scientific work to be done together. Whether a cancer drug extends a patient's life by three years or not at all compared to standard therapy, or only three months, is no different in Germany than in France or Spain. We are a bit different, but we are not so different that drugs have a completely different effect. That is why we can do it at European level. And the question of what is reimbursed is national competence. We made this clear once again in the committee vote. I am very grateful for that. This may also give us more support in the Council of Ministers. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats still has a number of amendments which it wishes to table, and I would ask for your support in this. The most important thing, in my view, is: how is the decision made in the body that carries out the benefit assessment? We are in favour of qualified majority voting. Because the Council of Ministers has been arguing for a long time about how to do this. And this is an ideal instrument. After all, each country is weighted individually, but so are the people who live in that country. And that is the principle of democracy in Europe. We should apply this here too. It is also technically justified, and this will help us to obtain approval in countries such as Spain and France and, unfortunately, also in my own country, which are still hesitant. I am convinced of this after the talks. That is why I am asking for your support. We will support this report, partly because it is important for us as the PPE-DE to bring innovative medicines, for example against cancer, to the market more quickly.

This proposal will ensure precisely that. With the proposal, we will ensure that high standards are not watered down, while at the same time taking advantage of the benefits of European standardisation of authorisation. Although cross-border cooperation at strategic and technical level has been in place for years, it has become clear that cooperation on a voluntary basis is neither effective nor efficient. It is not currently guaranteed that new health technologies within the European Union will be judged on the same criteria. But that should be the case! Quite apart from the fact that it takes a lot of time and money to have to carry out complex studies several times. By standardising at European level, we are minimising the risk of fragmented and delayed access to treatment within the Member States and ensuring better access for people in the European Union to medicines and medical products. We want to increase the quality and efficiency of interventions in the health sector and improve the sustainability of health systems. A European HTA will help in this.

Health promotion is a challenge that increasingly requires integrated and cross-cutting interventions. Health expenditure accounts for 10% of gross domestic product in the European Union and expenditure on medicines almost 1.5%. The increase in average life expectancy puts enormous pressure on these numbers. It's great news, but it requires more management and requires more cooperation. Technological developments are a great opportunity to improve the functioning of the internal market, to make health spending more effective and to provide better care to citizens. I am co-responsible for a resolution on this subject and I support 3 fundamental principles. It is necessary to safeguard the patient's centrality, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of privacy in the use of data and it is necessary to promote inclusion and access to these services. But it is also true that cross-border sharing of health data is essential to improve the potential of responses, on the assumption of qualification of all actors, enhanced interoperability and systematic protection of sensitive data, which should be done with tools and mechanisms developed and provided by public health systems. And that is why the legislative proposal under discussion contributes to developing the digital single market, encourages innovation and research, promotes a European it network in the area of health and, above all, contributes, or can contribute to, improving the health care provided to citizens in a generalised and budgetary-sustainable manner.

A heartfelt thank you to the Commission for this proposal. Every time we talk about health here in the European Parliament, the questions of subsidiarity and the question of concern arise swell edging into matters and competences of the Member States. If we take a closer look at Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which has already been mentioned today, paragraph 4c states quite clearly that, on the issue of drug approvals, on the issue of medical devices, the highest safety, quality and effectiveness of these products is a joint task of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission with the Member States. The present draft also speaks quite clearly of the area of evaluation of health technologies, which is limited to science, which is limited to clinical evaluation. We must mention one thing very importantly here: this is not a question of covering costs, this is not a question of ethical issues, it is not a question of pricing. This will continue to be the responsibility of the Member States in the future. What we are dealing with is the provision of new, innovative products in the medical and medical devices sector as soon as possible to patients, to consumers who are entitled to them. The current situation is that some products are being approved more quickly in some Member States. In other words, we have a dual distortion of the internal market here, in economic terms, but also in terms of the safety and health of patients in Europe. I would therefore like to thank my colleague, Cabezan Ruiz, and her shadow rapporteur for this very balanced report, which clearly identifies those areas that will continue to be the responsibility of the Member States and the area that we must resolve at European level.

To date, a very high proportion of new medicines placed on the market do not show a clear technological improvement compared to existing medicines. Competition often plays more on the name of the drug than on its composition. Only 30% of clinical trials approved by the European Union involve more than a thousand patients and involve monitoring of more than a year, while early authorisations are increasingly common, which increasingly concern drugs withdrawn from the market. We need a permanent system that guarantees the achievement of the objectives set while respecting the principle of subsidiarity with a common evaluation methodology.  I therefore fully agree with the introduction of the European evaluation of the added therapeutic value of health technology and the harmonisation of the criteria for the clinical evaluation of medicinal products, which may lead to a higher quality of research and innovation and the elimination of unnecessary duplication. However, it is necessary to avoid the length and inefficiencies caused by the additional evaluation criteria for adaptation to specific national circumstances. In other words, avoid adopting amendments that would have the effect of watering down the objectives of the regulation in order to favour certain national evaluation systems.  A decisive role will be played by the Commission to ensure the proper functioning of the procedure, in order to generate sufficient trust between the parties in favour of the best interests of patients.

Unfortunately, not all citizens of the European Union experience this progress. In Greece, for example, as a direct result of the austerity policies imposed by the institutions, access to high-quality health services has been dramatically restricted. Most medicines have been replaced with suspect generics, which do not meet all the high standards in force in Europe. Moreover, even with these medicines, the participation that each patient has to pay is often prohibitive with disastrous results, as treatment is not followed for reasons of inability to pay.  It is therefore easy to conclude that, despite the undeniable advances that have been made and are still taking place today in health technologies, access to them is far from universal, creating dangerous inequalities among European citizens.

Health is one of the most important values of EU citizens, as eurobarometer has repeatedly stated. As set out in the TFEU, improving health must be a political priority for the EU in all its actions, but in particular on specific health issues. The right to health is a fundamental right, not only important for the integrity and development of a person, but is also a decisive factor in social cohesion, as well as productivity. The EU's welfare system , where health systems play a key role, can ensure high EU health standards. Over the last decade, the cost of cancer medicines has increased to 10 times, regardless of their therapeutic value. On the European market, a very high percentage of medicines are not superior to existing medicines. In addition, the fact that medicinal products are considered to be a consumer product subject to market rules has helped the industrial sector, one of the most competitive sectors of the economy in the European Union, despite clear competition with the United States or emerging economies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year and a half ago, the world discovered the very serious situation and the chechen horror. Hundreds of men, presumed gay, perhaps gay, perhaps homosexual, were systematically taken from their homes, taken to unauthorized prisons and subjected to torture.  Some of them managed to escape and managed to break free and tell this story. Chechnya is a state of the Russian Federation, Mr President, and that does not, of course, work for the civil rights of that country. Russian public opinion was also shocked by these events, which had been discovered and reported to the newspapers, and an independent investigation into what had been discovered and what was happening had been promised. None of this has happened, to date there is not the shadow of a single inquiry, of something trying to clarify what has happened. I would like to acknowledge and thank once again the Vice-President and High Commissioner Federica Mogherini, for the work she has done, the only Western leader who had the courage in a public statement with Russian Minister Lavrov to denounce what happened and to ask for clarity, but today we are still standing here.  What should the European Union do? The European Union must do much more than it is doing, because what external action has done, namely to have an LGBTI guidelines, is clearly not enough. Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen, Qatar and Somalia, these are the countries where the death penalty still applies to homosexuals. In addition, countries such as Russia, such as Chechnya, such as Azerbaijan, such as Uganda, such as Jamaica, where homosexuals are imprisoned, tortured and threatened, are sometimes bullied.  The European Union has relations with these countries. economic relations, financial relations, diplomatic relations. If we really want to be the beacon of human rights and civil rights in the world, we cannot think that we are the beacon only on our own continent, but we must also be the beacon when we have relations with third countries.

Not only are there reports of concentration camp—type facilities, torture, extrajudicial killings and other severe violence, but in addition, honour killings take place and have even – very cynically – been welcomed by Chechen political leaders. It is appalling, sad and unacceptable. Kadyrov first claimed that there are no LGBTI people in Chechnya, then urged families to kill their loved ones and now suggests that media and civil society organisations are making up, inventing, the notion of LGBTI rights violations in Chechnya. We know that Russian LGBTIs and their experiences are not fake news. They are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, friends and loved ones. No political or religious interpretation will ever change that. A number of LGBTI people fleeing the violence in Chechnya have found safety and shelter as refugees in Europe. Not only do these individuals remind us of our obligations, but also of the need to see people on the run, refugees, as individuals.

In its history, the LGBTI community has faced rejection, persecution, intimidation and torture. You probably think that makes us weak, but the opposite is true.

The European Union’s LGBTI human rights guidelines from 2013 help address the human rights issues confronting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, in particular by setting out measures which can be used in the EU’s relations with third countries. The European Union’s diplomatic efforts worldwide on LGBTI human rights focus on the following: firstly, combating discriminatory laws and policies and ensuring decriminalisation; secondly, promoting equality and non-discrimination; thirdly, combating state or individual violence against LGBTI persons; and, last but not least, supporting and protecting human rights defenders. Depending on the country situation, the European Union is able to address the issue through a variety of means including high-level advocacy, quiet diplomacy, public statements, political and human rights dialogues with third countries, and financial support to civil society via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. In April last year, the Russian media reported on the persecution, kidnappings, torture and killings of gay men in Chechnya. This was a serious deterioration in the already very worrying developments in the Chechen Republic. I shared my concerns with you on this matter at our last debate on this subject. In the immediate aftermath of these horrifying reports, High Representative Federica Mogherini met Foreign Minister Lavrov in Moscow, and she underlined that an immediate stop should be put to the persecution in Chechnya. The High Representative called for a full and thorough investigation into the reports, for accountability by the perpetrators, and for justice for the victims of the violence. On the same visit to Moscow, Federica met also with civil society representatives for a discussion on human rights developments. The European Union and our Member States, as well as like-minded countries and human rights organisations around the world, were swift in condemning the brutality against LGBTI persons in Chechnya. All of us have urged a full investigation into the matter. There was speculation that the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation launched an investigation last year, in 2017, but unfortunately there has been no further news about this, or indeed of any progress in ensuring accountability and protecting victims. Since the reports of violence became public, European Union officials and Member States’ diplomats have liaised with local human rights defenders, international human rights organisations and the journalists who uncovered the persecution campaign, in order to be fully and accurately informed of the situation on the ground and to offer support to the victims. In addition, EU support has been offered to civil society organisations and human rights defenders. Such support is one of the cornerstones of our Russia policy, as set out in the five principles on EU-Russia relations confirmed at the 2016 Foreign Affairs Council. The European Union and Member State missions in Moscow discussed the issue of LGBTI persecution in Chechnya and coordinated their action. As a result, some Member States have granted visas to victims of the persecution who sought asylum. During the current year, 2018, we have continued to issue statements regularly, outlining our concerns at the LGBTI situation in Chechnya. Most recently, two weeks ago at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Human Dimension meeting in Warsaw, the European Union made an opening statement in which we expressed concern that the reports of arrests, unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture and killings of people in Chechnya, on the basis of their actual or alleged sexual orientation, remained unanswered. The human rights situation continues to fall short of Russia’s OSCE commitments and international human rights obligations. The European Union has also issued statements in the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, and at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. We will continue to take every opportunity to call on Russia to ensure an effective and thorough investigation into the reports of abductions and killings of gay men in Chechnya, and justice for the victims of the persecution. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to our discussion, but be assured that for the Commission – for all of us in the College and especially for the High Representative – this issue is our top priority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 73, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Elly SCHLEIN", "mepid": "124804", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Commissioner, more than a year ago, we were discussing in this Very House the systematic violence and illegal detention of the LGBTI community in Chechnya, and the situation does not seem to have improved.

On the other hand, let us briefly consider the causes of this phenomenon, which we are talking about here. Our colleague Mr Viotti has calculated a long list of Muslim countries where he sees the danger of the same situation as in Chechnya.

Yet one year on it is clear that condemnation alone is not enough. The EU must act as a defender of LGBTI rights, as it is obliged to under international law. To date, Russia has not conducted any meaningful investigations into these abuses, effectively allowing the perpetrators to carry on with impunity while victims continue to flee. The EU and its Member States must put more pressure on the Chechen and Russian authorities. We need to put concrete action behind the LGBTI guidelines in EU policy.

Moreover, many European political parties represented here have expressed their moral and political condemnation in this context.

The moral lessons that you keep giving to the whole world are becoming particularly embarrassing for a growing number of Europeans who would like you to look a little more at what is happening at home.

We will continue coordinating with Member States to support the victims and to put pressure on the Russian authorities to stop the violence and ensure justice for the victims. We will continue to pursue all the avenues open to us, and to look at how best to use all our available instruments in specific support of human rights and democracy. Just a few words about our support under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). In 2017, several emergency grants were allocated under the EU’s Human Rights Defenders mechanism to LGBTI persons’ rights defenders from Russia at the time of the events affecting LGBTI persons in Chechnya. I hope that you will understand when I say that it is important to maintain discretion with regard to annual support when a vulnerable or at-risk community is concerned in order to be able to continue our work.

Insurers are important long-term investors. This is why, in November 2017, the Commission asked the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, or EFRAG, to carry out a comprehensive impact assessment to inform the EU’s decision on a possible endorsement of the International Accounting Standards Board’s International Financial Reporting Standard 17 for insurance contracts. The Commission specifically requested an assessment of the consequences of the standard on financial stability, taking into account the joint implementation of International Financial Reporting Standard 9, on the competitiveness of the European insurance industry, on the impact on the insurance markets across Europe, and on long-term investment.  In the meantime, the Commission launched two separate initiatives on the consequences of IFRS 9 on long-term equity investments and possible alternative methods to the mark-to-market valuation of long-term equity investment portfolios.  In response to the Commission’s request, EFRAG launched an impact assessment, including a field test of the IFRS 17 standard. The Commission acknowledges that the scope of the field test is limited. This is a necessary trade—off designed to secure a realistic implementation timeframe ahead of the implementation date of 1 January 2021, set by the IASB. Constituents have raised technical issues. EFRAG is currently considering these issues in its endorsement advice and has referred six implementation concerns identified as part of its impact assessment on the IASB. Furthermore, with a view to sustaining the implementation of IFRS 17, the IASB sets up a transitional resource group on insurance contracts, which is expected to channel the interpretation and implementation issues arising from the standard. The IASB is expected to consider potential amendments to IFRS 17, as well as a request for deferral of the implementation date, at its October meeting. As part of the endorsement procedure laid down in the International Accounting Standards Regulation, the EU is only empowered to endorse, refuse or carve out parts of a standard. The Commission therefore encourages the insurance industry to report this implementation challenges exhaustively to the IASB transitional resource group, and to actively develop realistic solutions, if necessary by devising targeted improvements to IFRS 17 when outstanding issues cannot be resolved through the interpretation of IFRS 17. With a view to securing the consistent implementation of the standard following the endorsement decision, the European supervisory authorities and the European Central Bank participate in the endorsement process as observers.  Finally, as part of its fitness check on public reporting, the Commission will specifically consider the potential inconsistencies between IFRS 17 and the existing EU reporting framework applicable to the insurance industry, including the Insurance Accounting Directive and the introduction of the Solvency II prudential regime in 2016. The Commission expects to report the findings from the fitness check by the second quarter of 2019, so as to secure its capacity to undertake any necessary action before the implementation date of IFRS 17 on 1 January 2021.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Theodor Dumitru STOLOJAN", "mepid": "39721", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, this motion for a resolution is about International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 17 for Insurance Contracts. These standards are a fundamental change in the accounting for insurance contracts, bringing the benefits of more consistency, transparency and comparability. This motion for a resolution is the result of the permanent teamwork set by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) after the financial crisis to focus on the reform of the IFRS. IFRS issues are no longer secondary business for ECON and Parliament.  I would like to thank all members of this permanent team and to the other members of ECON who contributed to this motion. In this motion for a resolution we underline the effort and costs needed in order to implement IFRS 17, which are significant. Unfortunately, the signals that we have received from insurance companies that have started to prepare the implementation of the IFRS 17 confirm the difficulties of this implementation. The effort, time and cost in human resources have been underestimated. Our technical adviser, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), has already identified several issues raised by IFRS 17 during the drafting of its endorsement advice, such as the level of aggregation, the contractual service margin, and reinsurance.  The final endorsement advice is expected in December 2019. We regret again that no field test has been developed to examine the potential effects that IFRS 17 might have on financial stability and competitiveness in the financial markets. We ask the Commission and EFRAG to consider carefully all the signals sent by the insurance sector and to deliver clear assurances in respect of these signals through the endorsement advice. The Commission and EFRAG should assess whether the current implementation timeline of IFRS 17 is appropriate.

We are talking about experience. When we adopted the equivalent accounting standard for banking, the so-called IFRS 9, we finally discovered - nine months after this standard came into force, thanks to a study by the European Systemic Risks Committee - that our intuition, our vision that the introduction of such a standard might perhaps weaken long-term investment. , was well founded. We call for the same vigilance with regard to the insurance sector and therefore ask not to repeat the introduction of an accounting standard, this time IFRS 17, which would also risk undermining the long-term investment that we know is so much needed for the European economy. We need to learn another lesson from experience, from what insurance companies have experienced through the implementation of the Solvency II Directive. Everyone agrees that this is now useful legislation, adapted to the insurance business, but it has only been able to come into force through a long iterative process. The more I consider the concerns about the IFRS 17 accounting standard for the insurance field, the more I think that the question of the timing of implementation — beyond a few adjustments that may need to be asked by the international authority, the IASB, to revise its copy — is essential.

The International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17, from what we have seen, will be implemented in two and a half years, from 1 January 2021. But there are too many thoughts and criticisms as to whether the insurance market itself is really ready, whether insurance companies themselves can deal with the problems that exist.  Of course International Standard 17 will contribute to greater transparency and comparability, but it is complicated. And insurance companies, as they act and work, see that significant training of executives is needed, changes are needed, investments are needed, measures are needed. It appears that 67 % of large insurance undertakings are ready, but only 10 % are ready for small insurance undertakings.

Mr President, international agreements on how to report to investors and other stakeholders are crucial in a world where borders are actually becoming increasingly blurred.

Harmonisation and progress are not free at all. But I believe that it is worth it, that the benefits will outweigh the costs and that the insight and comparability will contribute to a much more efficient market. Is ISFR 17 perfect? No. Are there standards that are optimal for everyone? No. But that does not, as far as I am concerned, removes the fact that we are striving for standards that work for the European market and for European companies. That is also why EFRAG is currently investigating the effects of IFRS 17 across Europe. On the basis of that opinion, the Commission and the co-legislators can then decide whether postponement is justified and, if so, under what conditions. Parliament's resolution makes a number of suggestions for further research to the EFRAG. We await these results with full confidence. New agreements will have to be made at the highest level, internationally. I assume that the concerns that have already been identified by the EFRAG and the European market parties will be taken into account.

The European Commission shares the view that distributed ledger technologies and blockchain—based developments are an opportunity for industry and public services in Europe. This will allow rethinking of information systems and processes promoting user trust while ensuring compliance with the protection of personal data and transparency. These technologies have the potential for more efficient delivery of products and service across organisational boundaries and borders. I had direct experience of that potential in June when I attended a blockathon where 11 teams of coders developed ways to fight counterfeiting. Blockchain can provide an electronic chain of custody for each and every piece of intellectual property.  The Commission is working to seize the opportunities, address the limitations and define policies that will promote the uptake and development of blockchain based applications in Europe. To reach scale, 26 EU countries and Norway have agreed to work together to set up the European Blockchain Partnership. Its aim is to develop a coordinated European response that guarantees interoperability and avoids fragmentation. Another objective is to create a European blockchain services infrastructure to support cross—border public services with the highest standards of security, privacy and energy efficiency. The partnership is now examining which cross—border digital public services could benefit most from such infrastructure. Examples include the exchange of data for moving goods, duty suspension, digital identity and VAT collection.  The first EU-wide services will be provided over the European blockchain services infrastructure by next year. Principles of governance and other conditions will be specified by the end of this year.  With the help of the European Parliament, we have also launched the EU blockchain observatory and forum to help us identify and overcome obstacles in blockchain innovation. They organise online community building, workshops and blockchain focused events across Europe. Their work aims to stimulate a competitive blockchain environment and the conditions of legal certainty that are needed to sustain investments in distributed leisure technologies and blockchain applications across the European Union. Thank you for your attention, I am looking forward to the discussion.

I am happy to present the resolution on distributed ledger technologies and blockchain, the first one on this promising technology. This resolution has already achieved important political goals. It has become a reference point for other reports related to blockchain technology in this House and it has provided guidelines to the Commission, along with policy directions, preparing the ground for further action. It also provides a solid framework for legal certainty, not only in Europe but also beyond, and of course it has received publicity worldwide. Blockchain is a groundbreaking technology that promises to improve efficiency, reduce costs and friction, and increase transparency and trust in a wide range of sectors, such as supply chains, financial services, energy, transportation, health care, education, and even copyright and the creative industries, by giving citizens back control of their data. Blockchain also has strong potential to improve the quality of public services, and, as an instrument or indeed a platform, to increase efficiency between the state and the citizen in relation to smart contracts, public documents, avoiding duplication, certificates, licences, land registries and even voting. Blockchain-based applications could also potentially help to fight fraud and tax evasion. I am pleased, too, to announce that blockchain has united this House, as all the parties in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) voted in favour of the resolution under the principle of being technology neutral and innovation friendly in Europe. One of the core messages of our text was to signify that the European Union aspires to become the global leader in the fourth industrial revolution. Here I must underscore the great contribution and work of Commissioner Gabriel in this direction, and thank her for supporting the funding of pilot schemes in a broad EU blockchain alliance of Member States. I would also like to thank Vice—President Ansip, since he is one of the people who have led by example in his country, making Estonia one of the most advanced countries in Europe in the digital era. On behalf of the ITRE Committee, allow me to deliver the following oral question to you Vice—President. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and blockchains have not only shown great potential in improving existing value chains, but also create new value chains that reduce intermediation costs and transactional friction, and that remedy trust issues, monitoring problems and transparency concerns. The applications of blockchain are numerous and encompass a wide range of sectors. Energy grids, health care, the financial sector, supply chains, transport, education, the creative industries and the public sector are just some of the possible fields. In terms merely of transaction fees, we have an OECD study to the effect that EUR 130 billion in hidden fees is the cost in Europe alone per year. In order fully to grasp the potential of DLTs in the spirit of technological and business—model neutrality, we need a better understanding of their key underlying features, such as decentralised distributed databases, disintermediation, the immutability of data, ad permission and permission—less applications, as well as the technological possibilities they offer in areas such as smart contracts and funding for SMEs through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). However, in addition to their potential, DLTs also raise concerns about data protection and in relation to the General Data Protection Regulation. Cybersecurity, interoperability, new sources of fraud and environmental issues are among these concerns. How is the Commission planning to provide the environment of legal certainty that is needed to boost DLTs and blockchains in Europe; and what initiatives would the Commissioner undertake to create a competitive blockchain ecosystem in the EU? Let me just say that technology is neutral. How we use it depends on us. We are innovation friendly and I think this is demonstrated by this resolution and the great support it has received thus far.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 104, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Henna VIRKKUNEN", "mepid": "124726", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, thanks to Eva Kail and Commissioner Ansip, it has been truly inspiring to work on the blockchain resolution in this House. It was great how enthusiastically the various stakeholders and members of parliament participated in this work. Europe is clearly a pioneer in blockchain technology, and this is clearly an area where we have a very strong basis for developing into a world leader in the future as well.  It should be noted that blockchain is still an evolving technology, but it has very great potential. What we discussed very much during that work was that we must ensure that Europe has a very pro-innovation legislative environment – legislation that would encourage innovation in the sector and also encourage investment.  In particular, we are trying to find points where we would have legal needs. Often, of course, companies say that do not just start making any legislation, but on the other hand it is very important that we have a European reference framework from the outset, because if we do not make a European reference framework, it often leads to Member States starting to take their own action and that would lead to the fragmentation of the digital single market again. It is therefore important that we have an immediate Europe-wide approach to this new technology. I am very pleased that all the Member States are now working on this and are working together to find areas for development where blockchains could be used together. Similarly, the Commission has set up this blockchain observatory, where experts are also carrying out this same mapping work.  It is now also important to invest sufficiently in research and product development in the sector. The Commission has already invested EUR 80 million to date, with the aim of investing an additional EUR 300 million in blockchain technology over the next few years. It is, of course, a very important contribution for the whole of Europe: investment in research and product development, and ensuring that we have legislation that encourages innovation and investment.  We must also ensure that companies have a certain legal certainty when they start investing in this new technology. Among these applications, smart contracts, among others, have been on display. In other respects, legislation must also be assessed in order to have sufficient legal certainty.  There is a great deal of talk about cryptocurrencies in the context of blockchains, but it should be noted that we have a very large number of promising other sectors that can take advantage of blockchains: transport, energy, healthcare and different supply chains, that is, it is a very potential technology.

Blockchain and DLTs are part of the great digital transformation, together with the development in the artificial intelligence, cloud computing, social media and very high connectivity, these new technologies will radically change the way we live. Challenges are often debated here in the plenary, and they are many: security, privacy, trust and copyright, they are familiar to us MEPs. But some problems might have a straightforward solution. DLT will make sure that information moves at speed, but that it remains secure and that transactions cannot be manipulated as each party sees modifications. One promising application is in the field of copyright. A distributed ledger can give both artist and art consumers a better, more transparent method of knowing who made which piece of digital art, and I want to see applications in Europe for example on renewable energies and electrical charging for cars. But there are other more wicked problems: take for example trust in society. How will DLT increase trust if new financial instruments based on the technology are volatile and not very transparent? Moreover, how do we ensure that core functions of society, such as taxation or prevention of crimes, can still function in a world where data is not centralised? Blockchain technology developers need to answer these questions when developing the technology and applying it, hopefully destroying some old thinking and models of the way of life today. I’m also curious to see how old companies will find new ways to integrate this technology. Public sector and governments must also change and learn to do things better with the new technologies, and I’m very happy that the Commissioner took up these concrete ways in Europe as well. So Madam President, I support the active role that the Commission has taken, and Parliament supported it in order to get involved in the possibilities offered by blockchain and DLTs. The EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum is now up and running. We as a society need to adopt a strong but soft approach to new technological possibilities. We must not curb innovation, but set the framework for a legal and trustworthy environment. We need to learn ourselves and be fast to recognise new situations and effects, and take corrective measures if need be.

On the other hand, the system is still in its infancy. It is therefore important, as far as I am concerned, that we look very carefully at the challenges that this system poses. I think this resolution is a very good first step. I'm happy with that, too. This technology is also widely embraced by the financial sector. However, we simply cannot afford to take risks, particularly in this sector. As far as I am concerned, there is no room for a quick-and-dirty approach. We must not close our eyes to the risks of the new digital systems. When and how, for example, can it be seen whether it is being abused? How are we going to protect our citizens of Europe from this? This calls for rules to prevent money laundering or tax evasion. Understand me: I am very much in favour of this technology and really believe in it. I do think that European legislation is needed to enable innovations such as blockchain on the right scale. As far as I am concerned, the legislation must be facilitating. It must not stand in anyone's way and provide the right opportunities for the European market, because that is the only way we can compete with the most innovative continents on earth.

Technology can become a safe and effective alternative to encryption to protect personal data and something that will become increasingly important in the future. With blockchains, we also have the potential to democratize energy markets, for example. Individual households will be able to produce green electricity and easily sell their surplus to the grid. There is also the potential to tackle corruption around the world. By decentralising systems and data, we reduce the ability of corrupt officials to exploit their position for their own benefit. The system itself makes it impossible. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize many areas.

We are all aware of how much information is the new gold today, and what it means to be able to control, manage, transform and use it according to the purpose to be pursued.  The distributed register, that is, more commonly the blockchain and its brothers, represents a beautiful technology, which has in itself a very positive promise of change and the resolution we vote on tomorrow contains numerous elements of analysis and push. No one is able to say today whether this protocol that allows unimaginable advances in terms of traceability, recognition, disintermediation and therefore peer trust, can ever be the new paradigm on which to base a new form of society: DLT are a terrain still to be explored in all its dimensions. Today the value chain is often complicated, intricate by a globalization that has created countless levels, many intermediates and therefore many different forms of cost control and other social effects.  Technologies like these, whether called blockchain or otherwise, certainly allow you to imagine new information models, distributed control and rapprochement between the production phases of goods and services and their use and consumption.

I strongly believe that the modern and scrupulous legislator must be maniacally curious and attentive so that we never have the desire to know well what is having to come out of the world again, in order to be ready to legislate on time and in full knowledge. We must therefore be able to conduct digital technologies with common sense, without suffocating them with too many rules or standardisation too much in advance, but also without ever losing control of them, so as not to be more or less aware of ourselves as victims. It applies to blockchain today, but it applies to all that storm of technological innovations on the horizon, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, bioprinting, the future that is being explained in a very near tomorrow. The text we are debating today certainly emphasises many positive dimensions, such as the potential in terms of traceability of ingredients and components, control of ownership and identity by opening up models of bottom-up participation in decisions and their formation or equal exchange of goods and services. In this last sector, I too have been wondering for years how we can account for energy exchanges in a decentralised production model, and I am very pleased that the Commission has positively accepted my pilot project proposal for the second year to study the feasibility of blockchain technologies in peer energy exchange. But another area that I would really like to see a commitment from everyone is to investigate the potential use of DLT for environmental monitoring and therefore the possibility for all citizens to participate in a distributed emission control system of all the plants that today load our air with particles and pollutants of various kinds , slaughtering our loved ones in a now ubiquitous way. Sustainable and equitable development certainly passes even today for digital technologies, but first we put them at our service, the sooner we curb their potential drifts. Man must always be at the center without putting technological Ferraris in the hands of a company without a license. If these technologies help these objectives, and it is our job to make this happen, then I am the first supporter of them, and that is why I am particularly proud that last week the government of my country also joined the European blockchain partnership and filled an incomprehensible absence on the curtain of the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 110, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Christelle LETARD-LECHEVALIER", "mepid": "188718", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Madam President, Commissioner, distributed registers and block chains are promising technologies, which could change our use of registers and their data. However, your enthusiasm and the sudden enthusiasm of the European institutions give the impression of an irrational runaway, perfect for new discoveries. My intention will therefore be to encourage you to be more cautious and temperant. Many parliamentarians see only the positive aspects of this technology, without seeing its limits, especially with regard to block chains - because the real revolution in the field of registers is the use of block chains. These allow to certify the register and avoid going through intermediaries to access it. However, this technology is not without criticism. Thus, the use of work evidence in the mining process involves consuming a gigantic amount of resources for very low real use. The mining of bitcoin consumes as much energy as Austria: imagine if hundreds of other registers had to be mined! In the long run, the size of the registers is intended to become exponential and will require that users, or \"minors\", have enormous technical means for the system to work. This also raises the problem of data retention time: can a block chain keep the data forever without the need for a centralized archiving registry? The independence of minors is also a constraint because block chains can only be certified if the majority of minors do not form a cartel. How can we control it? Finally, if the number of minors is today large and allows the operation of this technology, it is thanks to the remuneration of these through cryptocurrencies. So how will the remuneration of minors in a public service be made? Many other examples could demonstrate that the technology of distributed registers, and especially of the block chain, is still unspetura. Until the problems of energy efficiency and an effective alternative to proof through work have been solved, it will be foolhardy to want to offer these technologies to all parts of society. What we are therefore advocating is to invest in research, as always and as proposed, and to let the Member States legislate on their territory.

We need to ensure that new solutions based on digital innovation incorporate the values and civilizational principles that we develop and share in the Common European Area.

It must be developed within a framework of legal certainty and robustness in relation to the control of cases and the risks of misappropriation of power without proper legitimacy.

It is here and it is here to stay. Let’s not stop it. Eva Kaili is doing a great job with this resolution, which I think is very important. I also think it is very important to educate politicians that blockchain technology or DLT does differ significantly from cryptocurrencies and bitcoin and Ethereum, and then Ethereum differs a lot from bitcoin too as it was a main means of funding a lot great projects for which Europeans got money could have never come to them before. So there is a lot of great innovation where people have been contributing from all over the world. We will see how that pans out.  Over—regulating and being too nervous is not the way to go. The European Central Bank has been quite active, and a lot of reserve banks in Europe have been quite active, warning people of the risk – and there are risks when you speculate, and the bitcoin price does fluctuate significantly – but bitcoin is here to stay. Other parts of it, like decentralisation is here to stay too, and once these technologies are decentralised we will not have much say, unfortunately.

I am responsible for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade for the file on blockchain and forward-looking trade policy. Blockchain and DLTs have definite potential and this has been shown via recent projects around the world. I really believe that the future will be better with the help of these technologies. But at the same time we need to be pragmatic and keep in mind also the vulnerabilities and imperfections of the system like the threat of hacking, risks to cybersecurity and the environmental impact.  Consequently, we need a more environmentally friendly system and a less energy consuming one, but also one that addresses technological risks and potential security challenges. The future competitiveness and capacity for innovation of European industry could be closely related to the adoption and implementation of distributed ledger technologies. Sectors such as energy, food, health, transport and manufacturing could be significantly reshaped by these emerging technologies. What I consider crucial for these emerging promising technologies to flourish in the European Union is to adopt an innovation—friendly approach and not to rush prematurely into regulation and potentially hamper innovation. Further, to ensure companies and start—ups simplified access to, and enhance, financing within EU financial instruments. The EU needs to create an ecosystem where innovation by companies and start—ups are encouraged.  I highlight the major potential to integrate DLTs with other technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Moreover DLTs, with enhanced cooperation between the Commission and Member States, have the potential to improve monitoring, security and verification mechanisms and to fight unlawful payments, facilitate anti—money laundering policies and detect misappropriations of assets. As regards smart contracts, it is true that they can be a key enabler of decentralised applications, but at the moment my opinion is that this technology is not mature enough to be considered legally enforceable.

I would like to thank the European Parliament for the opportunity to discuss distributed ledger technologies and blockchains, and for the interesting views expressed by its Members.  The resolution to be voted on during this plenary will provide additional impetus and support to the EU’s vision for developing and promoting these technologies during the coming year. The Commission has already invested more than EUR 80 million in projects supporting the use of blockchain through Horizon 2020. The Connecting Europe Facility will support a first wave of deployment of cross-border public service use cases and engage the private sector, including cutting-edge start-ups. We are proposing more investments in the Digital Europe programme, including for European blockchain services infrastructure to ensure that Europe is at the global forefront of blockchain innovation.  The Commission is pleased that the European Parliament shares our view on the need to seize the opportunities offered by distributed ledger technology and blockchain technology, and acknowledges the importance it plays in the digital transformation of European industry and governments.  As we know, Europe is already host to more than 500 blockchain start-ups. I mentioned in my introduction that we organised the first ever ‘Blockathon’ in Europe. The aim of this ‘Blockathon’ was to better protect intellectual property rights. As we know, this is a real headache not only in the European Union, but globally. In the year 2017, 43 million European citizens bought some kind of pirated goods, and if we lost EUR 85 billion in this way, it means that we also lost 800 000 jobs in Europe. It is really good when young people would like to use this very innovative new technology to protect our jobs and intellectual property rights in the European Union.  Of course blockchain may not be the panacea that will solve all our challenges, but it is an opportunity that we cannot overlook – an opportunity for the EU to lead in new trusted business models and for public services to deliver better, more innovative services to people, in line with our legal principles and our European values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 123, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 128(5).

In China, the amazing amount of data and the efficiency of central management, and in the United States, its innovative industry, provide a competitive advantage that we have nothing to show for its effectiveness.  Europe is very special and has resources that make it unique in the world. The uniformity of the internal market, its massive purchasing power and a flexible and forward-looking regulatory environment provide a basis that competitors do not have. These are precisely the conditions that are most necessary for blockchain-based technologies, so I believe that if we properly develop a framework for innovation and applicability, Europe could be at the forefront of development.

It gives me the opportunity and also the pleasure to discuss the needs of rural, mountainous and remote areas. As you know, one of my key priorities for future cohesion policy is a policy for all regions, with no region left behind – no rural region, no mountainous, no remote areas left behind. I have read your report and I share your concerns about rural, mountainous and remote regions, but I think we are already putting in place the right tools to help them. These regions are a very diverse group. You know very well that, for instance, the Canary Islands are very different to the north of Sweden, to give you an example. Even within one type of region – a mountainous region – there is enormous diversity. Kardzhali in Bulgaria is one of the poorest regions, whereas Heidelberg in Germany is one of the richest. Because of this diversity we need a diversity of tools, and I believe we are providing these tools in our proposals for the future.  The first tool is the territorial agenda. Integrated investments, based on the specific needs of the territory – and this includes, of course, the local actions led by local communities. The territorial agenda includes synergies within the functional areas, because, of course, rural and remote areas do not exist in a vacuum. They are linked to urban areas, while urban areas need their hinterlands. An integrated strategy balance I think this needs.  The second tool is about the integrated investments themselves, promoting accessibility and digital connectivity, energy, education, small and medium—sized enterprises, migration, services, social exclusion. We are modernising and updating these actions and I believe post-2020 they will better tackle the needs of remote, rural and mountainous regions. The third tool is about the Smart Village initiative, launched last year by Commissioners Hogan, Bulc and myself. We have now pilot actions already in place, improving rural services with ICT and making villages more sustainable, contributing to the diversification of the rural economy, which builds on the Cork 2.0 Declaration on a better life for rural areas. We are putting in place also the tools which will work for rural, mountainous and remote regions. As I mentioned, first the Territorial Agenda and integrated strategies for each region. Second, our range of investment tools which are being sharpened to tackle the needs of rural, mountainous and remote regions. Third, the Smart Village initiative, ICT at the service of rural and remote areas.  These are my first thoughts. I am looking forward to seeing your views and I know that at the end of the day we have the same goal – no region left behind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 128, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Lambert van NISTELROOIJ", "mepid": "28165", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner is right to ask himself: are we on course? Let me note a few things. Firstly, there is a real population exodus from many rural areas. Young, vital people move to urban areas in economically stronger regions for study and work, but many do not return after that. Villages are ageing rapidly. The projections for Poland and Romania are that the population decreases by a quarter and in rural areas by half. That is why the REGI Committee, which has requested this debate, is ringing the bell from the point of view of cohesion. Secondly, Europe faces major challenges everywhere, socially, economically and technologically. Just look at the previous debate on digitisation, robotisation and the circular economy. If you don't come, you're going to be behind. We believe that far-flung areas should also be included. Thirdly, what does the REGI Committee want from you as the European Commission? In 2016, the Amsterdam Pact focused on urban policy. The role of cities has since been strengthened in many innovative actions and can no longer be seen as a spearhead in your policy and that of EU funds. It is now time to come up with a pact for rural communities. The basis for this has already been laid in the European Parliament through pilot projects launched in 2017. Now it is necessary to unite these pilot projects and to achieve one action, this time not the Amsterdam Pact but perhaps bucharest's, or better yet the Sibiu Pact under the Romanian Presidency at the beginning of 2019. This pact should not be concluded between administrators, but, as with the urban pact with the stakeholders themselves, namely rural organisations. Commissioner, it is time for action. In 2019, the preparation of the post-2020 programmes will begin in the Member States, together with the second pillar of agricultural policy, namely the European Rural Development Fund. Experience with Leader and local initiatives shows that this is more than the development of farms. Socio-economic sectors also benefit. The villages in the countryside also matter. Many villages feel forgotten. Anti-European noises are gaining a foothold. In 2017, the representatives of rural municipalities asked for a different course. The European Rural Parliament, supported by the Council of Europe and your Commission, requested a pact on 29 November 2017. I quote: \"We strive for a pact of rural communities and a European rule agenda to foster our contribution and participation on European scale, parallel to the pact of Amsterdam for the cities. We are ready to contribute to a stronger relationship between citizens in our communities and the European goals\". I'm shutting down. Mrs Creţu, you responded positively to this request last year. Commissioners Bulc and Hogan were also positive. The REGI Committee and the PPE Group believe that it is time for this approach. Make election year 2019 also the year of a new pact.

As my colleague also mentioned, we in Europe have intervened, through the urban agenda, on an important part of our territory, but, I would remind you, even though it includes the majority of the population, it concerns a small amount of the territory.  As you well know, over 80% of our territory is characterized by rurality and mountain, very often the mountain is also rural, but not only. We are convinced that this part of the territory deserves non-residual attention, what is not urban and mountain is rural, but specific attention.  And why? Because it is not true that areas with a low population are destined to remain poorer and, above all, to be substantially rural areas at all times. Instead, they must be able to develop innovative policies to the full.  You mentioned the Smart Villages, and indeed we are very concerned, as a Parliament to this experience, to this experimentation, because it is quite possible that there will be innovative activities in this area, which is the majority of the territory, the one on which we also have a duty, in times of climate change, to intervene by creating a series of initiatives that avoid that precisely in these places , in particular the mountains, climate change is devastating. So research and innovation do not only concern urban areas, they also concern rural areas, mountain areas and the outermost regions of the European Union.  I was one of those who promoted the pact for cities and then the urban agenda. We now believe that the time has come to start with an agenda for rural and mountain areas and for the outermost regions, where the same objectives are set, because the objectives are common. The problem is that the way in which they are reached changes when people intervene in areas with a population that is rarely populated or with structural handicaps.  That is our objective.

Although they cover 80% of the territory and 57% of the Union's population, downward economic trends show that rural, mountainous and remote areas generate 46% of gross value added today and gdp per capita is 70% of the European average.  Young people are drawn to the lights of big cities that can provide living opportunities, standards and excitement, which rural environments often cannot. But for the Union to continue to be a functioning and sustainable community in the future, life in the countryside must be preserved. There are a number of measures that can contribute to this, such as investment in infrastructure, tax relief and reduction of administrative burdens, the application of digital solutions in the development of rural areas and better exploitation of renewed energy potential. If life in the countryside is cheaper and better quality than it is now, we don't have to fear for the demographics of rural areas or their economic prosperity. Life in big cities is becoming more expensive and substandard. If we can bridge the obvious infrastructure shortcomings of much of the Union's rural area and attract young people with lower taxes and cheaper energy, these areas will quickly live up and get a new perspective.  In particular, the rural, mountainous and remote programme must address the availability and quality of public services, as well as opening markets to the private sector, which can work synergistically in raising the quality of life in the countryside. The challenges are great, and times are deducies because unfavorable demographic trends are not easy to stop.

On the other hand, cohesion policy or a policy of uniform development is one of the most important European policies. But, nevertheless, it is clear from the data presented that this policy has not actually achieved its objectives. The ratio of GDP in rural, mountainous and remote areas is 70% of the European average and 123% in the city. Of course this big difference affects young people leaving these areas. At the same time, these areas are ageing and all the problems we encounter in general in society in our countries, these areas feel stronger than they do with urban areas. And these reasons, therefore, the failure of this policy and the deterioration of the situation, and even in recent years, speak of the need for a program for rural, mountainous and remote areas. It cannot be said that these cohesion policies are not successful because perhaps without them the situation would be even worse than it is now, but definitely these data show that the objectives have not been achieved.  Elementary things need to be done, better transport connectivity of these areas should be enabled, clean energy should be made available and should of course be covered by high-speed internet, and then economic activities will develop within them – some are mentioned such as rural tourism, but also any other economic activity such as energy production, such as various services, are also out of the question. And the techniques of how to do it organizationally, the steps are decentralization and subsidiarity.

They need to be facilitated to access European funds and somewhere by direct access, as some countries, central authorities, are holding back access to these areas.

Rural mountain areas in the European Union make up a significant part of the territory of the European Union, home to almost fifty-seven% of the citizens of the European Union. The importance of these areas for the sustainable and sustainable territorial development of Europe is therefore undeniable. Due to their specificities, these areas and their populations face major challenges in terms of social and economic development, climate change and demographics, and the European Union's policies on these regions must therefore respect a particular concept. These regions need additional support to tackle poor accessibility, declining job opportunities, an ageing population, insufficient infrastructure and other sensitive problems. We really need to focus more on rural areas and increase synergies by coordinating the various policies, strategies and programmes of the European Union. It should be noted that the rural development funding scheme proposed by the European Commission in the new Multiannual Financial Perspective, which is separate from the funding instruments for cohesion policy, is a cause for concern. Today, much is being said about simplifying the rules on the financing of European Union funds, cutting red tape, greater synergies between The European Union's funding instruments, but the new approach proposed by the European Commission does not take into account the cohesion dimension in the rural development fund, thus preventing beneficiaries in these areas from having simplified access to different sources of funding.

It is important that we once again deal with the issue of rural areas and mountain areas here in plenary. They are, in fact, of very central and fundamental importance for the further development and development of the European Union as a whole. As you have already mentioned, Commissioner, statistics say little. Statistics are an average. And if you look at rural areas in Europe, there are very, very successful rural areas. Fortunately, I come from one of these successful regions. In addition to these successful regions, there are also regions and rural areas that are lagging behind in development. It is precisely in this second group that you see people leaving, so people are going out of these areas and going to the cities. If you then look at what distinguishes the successful from the less successful ones, it is ultimately the question: is there a successful sensible rural development in the area, a real rural development policy? A real rural development policy means taking care of agriculture, taking care of tourism, also taking care of jobs in industry and crafts – because only then can the people stay on the ground – and also provide infrastructure. I am thinking of roads, of roads, but also of modern roads of our time, which are digital roads and high-performance data networks. And it needs social infrastructure, it needs hospitals, schools, kindergartens. It takes everything that people need in order to be able to live normally and so that their quality of life is roughly comparable to the quality of life in cities. That, I think, is something that people from cities often don't understand, because people from cities think that rural areas are a kind of romantic Disneyland, a space where a few backward people still live and where you just have to protect and not use it. I believe that, especially in rural areas, this link between protecting and benefiting is a very, very important one. I am also thinking, for example, of the debate we are currently having on large carnivores. You can see how some people think you only need to protect, but you don't understand that you have to use it in rural areas. And there are our policies, which are very important; for example, the common agricultural policy. I think that the proposal now on the table to reduce the second pillar of the common agricultural policy by 15% is a fatal proposal for rural areas and, above all, for more backward rural areas. This will, in fact, cause massive damage to these areas. We need a sensible European social fund, it needs structural funds, and the proposal to create smart villages is certainly the right one. Overall, I think that these rural areas are a great opportunity for Europe. But they can also become a major danger. After all, if we neglect these rural areas, we will not only lose cultural and biodiversity, we will ultimately risk natural hazards – landslides, water and so on. We should not risk that.

If even this infrastructure is no longer there, which family with three children will stay in the region? Probably the very few, people move to the city. But it is not just about the infrastructure we need in the countryside. It is also a question of: how do we assess the value of rural areas? Much is said in the paper about the economic contribution, about the economic contribution that people make in the countryside. But how much do the rural regions do to make our urban population able to do what they do every day when they go out to the countryside on weekends to experience a bit of nature, to grab a bit of fresh air, to see a sunset, and to stay physically and mentally healthy? Rural areas are also an essential part of the performance of our urban population. A hint about spending money. Selling us in the countryside, minus 15%, would be a great support – I think that borders on cynicism! Nevertheless, it is also a question of what this money is used for. Will this money be used to strengthen regional economic cycles? Or is it used to bring back companies from somewhere that are building their things here? Or are farmers being supported here in direct marketing and in building up regional value-added cycles themselves? Or is it just a supermarket being put in the village by a chain?

Access infrastructure, transport, public health and education are essential elements for any community, however, and their lack in rural mountain communities further aggravates the irreversible process of depopulation. I therefore believe that investment in the provision of these services must be a priority for any public authority.  At the same time, the natural potential of mountainous or low-access rural areas is an invaluable added value. Encouraging models of the development of local economies by exploiting their natural resources or supporting short food chains would contribute significantly to the economic development of these communities. I stress that the new proposal of the common agricultural policy places particular emphasis on attracting young people to agriculture and developing smart villages models. However, we must bear in mind that young people are only attracted to the countryside if they have at least access to high-speed internet networks and adequate digital services to enable them to implement innovative projects, and here the role of cohesion policies is a decisive one and, I might say, even a decisive one. Local communities' initiatives to engage in local development projects, we must recognise that they have achieved remarkable results, the partnerships of local authorities with the private environment, civil society, for the establishment of local action groups have led to the development of integrated strategies for responsible community development.  The LEADER Rural Programme has also proven to be a highly effective tool for community development. However, I believe that much more could be done, so I appreciate that local authorities must be actively involved in increasing the attractiveness of these areas and the ability to integrate newcomers, taking advantage of the tools made available to them, encouraging exchanges of experience and implementing as many actions as possible to attract new inhabitants. Last but not least, the expertise capacity of local action groups must be supported with more comprehensive funding.

Just this weekend, at a conference in Portugal in which I participated in a more interior area and with the same problems described here, what the fellow citizens most interested in was how the European Union will be able to adapt its cohesion policy to the territorial, effective and permanent development of the territories we are talking about here today.  The diagnosis is made in all its aspects and is by us well known. Moreover, this diagnosis is well summarised in the resolution. Now we need to act and do so as a union of peoples and States, but also through our Member States, regions, local authorities or even with the help of international partners, as has happened recently using the World Bank's technical assistance in pilot projects to help the less developed regions of the European Union. I have said this - I would like to repeat this - on the road to intra- and extra-regional convergence, both within and outside borders, both the urban agenda and support for these territories, should always be the two sides of the same currency, i.e. territorial development objectives supported by smart, sustainable growth strategies for our cities and especially for medium-sized ones , for our regions, sub-regions and municipalities, should always take into account the specificities of the most central urban reality, the surrounding urban network and the most remote rural territories and further away from these same centers. This seems obvious to me.  We can also start from the most remote, rural or mountain areas with a low urban or demographic density in order to articulate or design specific policies for the development of these territories, involving the most remote urban centers, but with service or infrastructure that will inevitably be needed to implement functional and successful strategies. That is why this agenda must gain greater institutional visibility and also greater political visibility and the example set by the initiative for the most depressed regions, the so-called Lagging Regions Initiative, but now also called the Catching-Up Regions Initiative - indeed a new name that I consider happier - could be an important lever for this important agenda that needs to be implemented on the ground and this is all for the sake of the equitable development of all our regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 145, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Monika SMOLKOVÁ", "mepid": "96655", "text": "   – Madam President.

I am very pleased that today we are talking about an agenda for areas from rural areas, mountain areas and remote areas, and as has already been said today, today is the right time for this, because we have a period of new financial perspective ahead of us, and much will depend on what we do in the new financial perspective. 80% of the territory, 57% of the population lives in these areas, we know that GDP is much lower and the key consequence of all this is the exodus of people from these areas, and this must be stopped in any way. Demographers' predictions that as many as 80% of Europeans will live in metropolitan regions in 2050 must not be realised. As you mentioned, the campaign for smart villages, my colleague Tibor Šani, is leading an activity here in Parliament, which is also run by three Commissioners in the Commission area, and in this activity we want, above all, to present what needs to be done. On the one hand, provide quality jobs and, on the other hand, quality living conditions.  As it is for both young people and for the elderly, that is, for all generations, and without the help of cohesion funds, the funds from the rural development programme will be virtually impossible to achieve. Something that in a big city can be a business case, a business model, in the countryside needs public assistance, especially in the beginning. In this activity, we are talking about the basic area of agriculture, which must certainly be complemented by other things, such as tourism, social, education, education, the retail economy, because today the countryside is much more than just a basic agricultural activity.

And that perhaps, indeed, as Mr van Nistelrooij said, the following year such a Bucharest pact would, in fact, be such an anti-poverty pan-European strategy, these five areas that you have examined in recent years and parliament has given you reports and proposals on them, in such a Pan-European poverty strategy, in the most secluded regions – perhaps look at the crisis map that we produced in 2011.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2018-10-01.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you once again for this debate tonight. It has been very interesting for me. I have heard many different opinions and interventions, but with one common feature: our passion for the development of rural, mountainous and remote areas. You know very well that two years ago we were all desperate about Brexit, about the gap left by the second largest donor. We thought about the idea of having this cohesion policy just for the less—developed regions and it was my battle to defend this policy as a policy for all regions. As I said in the beginning, my motto has always been ‘No region left behind’.  I share a lot of your views. Two weeks ago, I went to eastern Croatia. We made a plan for construction after the war. Last week I was in the Mezzogiorno, the less-developed region of Italy. This week I will be in Greece. So I know very well all these tragedies. I see them everywhere, especially in the old villages with ageing populations and people living in sparsely populated areas. I know very well that young people are leaving, in my own family also. This is also one side of the coin, the liberty we achieved in 1989 – to have the right to move and the right to choose where to work and where to live. But I think it is our duty at European level, and also at the national level, to do whatever it takes to encourage people to remain in their villages.  Your work is a very useful input for me and for us to discuss the post—2020 Territorial Agenda. You know that our proposal is now in your hands, in the hands of the European Parliament and the Council as co—legislators, and I am looking forward to the start of the trilogue. My wish, and I think it’s very important for all of us, for all the countries, for all the regions, is to have an agreement during the Romanian Presidency, because it is very important to start implementing the programmes from day one of the programming period, from 1 January 2021. We have had a lot of delays, and we have to learn from the lessons of the past, as the main reason for the delays we have now is the late adoption of the legislation for 2014—2020.  I mentioned some of the tools. I think we have to have synergies between rural development, the ERDF and other instruments, an integrated approach to local development, the territorial tools of cohesion policy and, as I said, the Smart Villages initiative, which is very important to me and Commissioner Hogan. We know very well that we cannot encourage young people in the 21st century to go where there is no broadband, where we don’t have water and where we don’t have electricity, so it’s very important to bridge this gap. We should also remember diversity. Some of you come from very rich rural areas, some of you live in very poor rural areas, so it is obvious that one size does not fit all, and we need a diversity of tools. I don’t think we should talk about money because it is not about money. The fact that we don’t have an agenda for rural, mountainous and remote areas does not mean that we don’t care about these areas. You know very well that in 2016 we had this core declaration to mainstream rural development and the new action for Smart Villages in 2017, which was a joint initiative by Commissioners Hogan, Bulc and I to develop a long—term vision and an integrated strategy for rural areas. Also under cohesion policy there is the possibility to modulate the EU core financing rate to take into account areas with natural or demographic handicaps such as mountains and, of course, the northern sparsely populated areas, which already benefit from higher aid intensity.  However, I very much encourage you to talk with your governments because we have national programmes and regional programmes, and it is up to the governments how much they will invest in the regions. In our Regulation that you have on the table, for 2014-2020, 75% of the money is going to the less-developed regions, and for 2021-2027, 80% – more than today – will go to less-developed regions. As I have stressed already, it’s very important to fighting poverty and I think it was right to raise this point, because we aren’t tackling migrants or nationalities, we are tackling human beings and their lives, and it is very important to have a special strategy for these vulnerable people and for fighting poverty. Ms Ward and Ms Vallina raised an issue that is very close to my heart, that of gender equality. This is not only an issue only for rural areas. I have launched a campaign for more women in public administration in general, but especially in local administration, because everywhere it’s a tragedy. You don’t see women running to be mayors of villages or local councillors, so I think it’s very important to raise awareness and to encourage women to run for local administration. The idea from Mr van Nistelrooij is a very beautiful idea. I started my mandate with the adoption of the urban agenda under the Dutch Presidency and I have to pay tribute once again to the Mayor of Amsterdam, Mr van der Laan, for his passion to have this urban agenda in place. It will be very emotional and beautiful if we end our mandate with a pact for rural areas during the Romanian Presidency. Let’s work together to put all our ideas in place, and see how we can adapt to all the diversity that we have in these areas. Thank you once again.

This is especially true for rural, rural and mountainous regions. These areas are still very high in terms of unemployment and are increasingly disconnected from the more developed urban parts of the Union in terms of GDP per capita. A quarter of rural and mountain households do not have broadband internet access. I think this is unacceptable in the 21st century. What is particularly worrying is the demographic challenges in rural and mountainous areas. The average age of the population, the proportion of over-65s and the increasing exodus of young people are leading to depopulation of these areas. If we add that 80% of the EU's territory is not an urban region, then we see how challenging this is and not a marginal issue. The European Commission must come up with a specific strategy to help non-urban regions catch up. Programmes should be offered that take into account the specificities of these areas and the needs of the people living there.

This human tragedy will leave a legacy for years to come, and it is brought to you courtesy of the so-called stable politics of Fine Gael and their pals in the EPP.

A man who's been driving a truck for 15 years who's never had a problem with the police in his life. He is an up-to-life citizen of the Czech Republic living in Spain, where he lives with his wife, who is seriously ill.  French authorities have given him 18 months in prison for allegedly smuggling people. Those people confirmed they got in his truck without him knowing. Is this the rule of law?

It stood as a reminder of the horrifying risks that people are forced to undertake in order to seek safety and a sustainable life. This memorial was desecrated by right-wing thugs.
