At the Wednesday sitting of the Strasbourg part-session, I asked Mr Juncker – as it happened to be at the time – a question in relation to the bank debt in Ireland. I was hoping that I was speaking in an environment where I would get the protection of the Chair, but far from it. When my office looked at the video after the speech, we discovered that the Chair had accidentally left on the mike, and he exclaimed the phrase ‘Jesus Christ’ after I spoke. I do not know whether it was perhaps in reference to the fact that I have long hair and a beard, or maybe it was the fact that he did not like what I was saying. I do not really care whether he likes what I am saying or not, because that is not his job. His job is to be independent, and if I did want him to do his job properly, maybe he might make Mr Juncker answer the question instead of being exasperated about the fact that he did not like what I was saying. What I want here is an apology on behalf of the people who elected me, because it is insulting to have that phrase used about me; it is insulting to say that after someone speaks. Can that Chair come out and do the right thing and prove that they are independent? Because there is not a lot of independence in the Chair in my experience.

And even though we found a common solution, the real test of time is ahead of us, because of the referendum in the United Kingdom on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union. Only the British people can and will decide that. All we could do on our side was to agree a new settlement for Britain within the EU. And we did. The 28 Heads of State or Government unanimously agreed and adopted a legally-binding and irreversible settlement for the United Kingdom in the EU. The decision concerning a new settlement is in conformity with the Treaties and cannot be annulled by the European Court of Justice. It will, however, only enter into force if the British people vote to stay. If they vote to leave, the settlement will cease to exist. We have agreed to do all this in a way that does not compromise the European Union’s fundamental values, such as the freedom of movement and the principle of non-discrimination, and without compromising the future development of the Economic and Monetary Union. If I had any doubts about this, I would never have proposed such a settlement. Despite many difficulties, the leaders did not walk away from the negotiating table, because we were fully aware of the stakes involved, namely keeping the UK in the EU and the future geopolitics of Europe. Here I would like to express sincere thanks to President Juncker and his whole team, with whom we worked side-by-side during the process. Let me also thank Parliament’s negotiators, who were engaged in the negotiations, and who were highly effective in obtaining their goals. It is my firm belief that we needed to involve the European Parliament fully in this process. I will always remember the crucial talks with President Schulz, with Group leader Verhofstadt, and with my distinguished colleagues Gualtieri and Brok. It is thanks to you that this agreement allowed us to take into consideration the interests of the Union as a whole. Without your help, this agreement would not have been possible. Thank you very much again. The European Union will respect the decision of the British people. If the majority votes to leave, that is what will happen. It will change Europe forever, and it will be a change for the worse. Of course, that is my personal opinion. Prime Minister Cameron said in the House of Commons on Monday that now is not the time to split the West. I could not agree more. (Applause) This is why I did my best to prevent that. On the other hand, if Britain decides to stay, I hope this Parliament will also ensure that the agreed settlement is transformed into the necessary legislation and will enter into force. Let me now turn to the migration crisis. Leaders agreed that our joint action plan with Turkey remains a priority, and we must do our utmost for it to succeed. This ultimately means that the high numbers we are still witnessing have to go down, and quickly. This is also why we decided to organise a special meeting with Turkey on 7 March 2016. The discussion among leaders focused on building consensus in the crisis. To do that, we must first avoid having a battle between plans A, B and C. It does not make any sense, as it only creates divisions within Europe without bringing us any closer to a solution. Instead, we must look for a synthesis of different approaches. There is no good alternative to a comprehensive European plan. Secondly, a European response is not only about the decisions taken in Brussels. It is also – and even more so – about the decisions taken in the capitals. We must accept that, but at the same time we should seek to improve the coordination of those decisions. The European Union is here for all of us to cooperate. And lastly, we must respect the rules and laws that we have all adopted together. This concerns both the decisions on relocation and the need to gradually go back to a situation where all Members of the Schengen area fully apply the Schengen Borders Code. There is no doubt that we need to restore Schengen. It will cost money, take time and require a huge political effort. There will be countries that may not be able to cope with this challenge, but Europe will be there to assist them. We need to invest in Schengen, not in its collapse. (Applause) Its future will be one of the key issues to be discussed by the leaders on 7 March. Separately, leaders confirmed the need to keep humanitarian aid flowing to Syria and the Syrian refugees in the region. We welcomed the donors’ conference in London, where two thirds of the pledges came from Europe. Leaders agreed to move quickly to disburse the EUR 3.3 billion pledged for 2016 as well as the EUR 3 billion agreed to help the refugees in Turkey. This is not only a European responsibility, therefore I will continue to build a global response to this crisis at the G7 and G20 meetings later this year. Finally, I want to end with a plea not to allow the stormy days to derail our efforts. We cannot simply wait and see. We have entered the most dangerous time in European history. We must act with resolve. I count on your support.

Mr President, we and our British friends had a hard and time-long debate. The negotiation was difficult, but in the end we were able to prove together - the other 27 Member States and the United Kingdom - that Europe is capable of making decisions, even if the situation it faces is particularly difficult. I would like to pay special tribute here to President Tusk, who, assisted amicably and effectively by the Commission, was able to conduct the debates with elegance and dexterity. The same tributes are paid to President Schulz and the sherpas of the European Parliament, without which and without whose inspiration the result would not have been that obtained. We have reached an agreement with the United Kingdom: the British Prime Minister has got the maximum of what he can get and the other Member States have offered him the maximum of what they can offer, which makes me say that the agreement with the United Kingdom is fair, that it is balanced, that he respects the main principles of the European Union and that at the same time , it takes into account the concerns, desiderata and suggestions of the United Kingdom. So I think that the British people, who have so often demonstrated their courage and wisdom in the past, will say \"yes\" to the agreement we have reached with the United Kingdom.  As soon as the British people have approved the agreement we have reached, the Commission will refer the relevant legislation to Parliament and the Council, particularly with regard to the social aspects of the agreement. We will come back to that when the Commission's legislative proposals have been tabled. Naturlich haben wir beim letzten Rat auch 'ber Migration und Flàchtlingsfragen geredet.

We are surrounded by war – in Ukraine, in Syria, in Libya. We have a partner at our side with Putin who pursues national imperialism. Unfortunately, we have little growth in the European Union, we have a generation of young people looking for jobs and a perspective for their lives. Frankly, if you look at this situation, it is difficult to see that at the last meeting of the European Council there was indeed the question of whether the special interests of the City of London or whether child benefit justice is being discussed in the European Union, that these were the two obviously most important issues that were discussed. I wonder whether the priorities we are discussing with each other are being set correctly. Unfortunately, we have to discuss this, because the British have brought these wishes along. Britain had special demands that needed to be discussed. First of all, I note that it is good that we have a result, that we have a result and that we can also support this result. David Cameron has put his points forward, fought and brought home a solid result for the British people. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support the result in essence, and we also make it clear that if the british citizens vote to remain in the European Union, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will also be a fair partner in implementing the commitments. The third thing that needs to be made clear is that the result is respected! Those who are now in the UK and tell people that if there is a 'no' vote, there is a better deal, it has to be said that the deal is on the table, the special arrangements are on the table, and now it is up to the British to decide. From our point of view, from the point of view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there will be no renegotiation. (Applause) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which The British decide they are going into the debate now. First of all, of course, the truth will be strained. I heard Nigel Farage say that trade is much better for Britain outside Europe. One then wonders why Germany is then the largest trading power, even though it is in Europe, why Ireland has 6% growth, even though it operates in Europe, why China, India and the Americans are asking the British to stay in the European Union because it is better to work with its trading partner Europe. Nigel Farage claims 5,000 foreign fighters are on the way. Incidentally, he only has the number because Europol exists. That is a figure for Europol, without this institution it would not have the number at all. And Europol chief Wainwright made it clear that there are major security gaps for Britain when it leaves the European Union. The first thing that will suffer is the truth. Nigel Farage will tell the untruth to mislead people. The second is: who is happy if the British really decide against it? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which Putin and the terrorists will rejoice, because they will then have an easier time doing their business, dividing Europe and creating uncertainty. The third is that we can only issue an invitation to the British people to do it together. We live in a time of great uncertainty. Everyone who is sensible must see this. And a divided Europe is definitely weaker, less able to answer the challenges. That is why we are inviting the British people to continue to do it together in the future. Ladies and gentlemen, one more sentence on migration: yes, what can we say? The President of the Commission has described it quite nicely that what has already been decided has been confirmed. It is good that it has been confirmed. But I would note that, unfortunately, we have experienced a great deal of selfishness – national selfishness and also party-political selfishness – from all parties, I would like to say that explicitly. If we were to take a positive view, I would say that the commitment is clear, that we must secure Europe's borders, that we support the NATO initiative in the Aegean as well. And it has become clear that we must not leave people fleeing the bombs in Aleppo, for example, from the Russian bombs, not on the Syrian-Turkish border, that we cannot, on the one hand, ask Turkey to open the border with Turkey, but at the same time ask them to close the Greek border. That would not be in line with this continent's humanitarian approach. That is why the two sides belong together: on the one hand secure borders and on the other hand show a willingness to help. Enough has been said. It would be important for action to be taken now! Finally, I should like to bring the citizens on board, because a few days ago the Bertelsmann Foundation published a very representative study throughout Europe, asking citizens – not politicians, but citizens. We have been given two tasks: firstly, that 79% of Europeans want us to be free to travel on this continent – 60% of Britons, by the way, want freedom of movement to be maintained – and, secondly, that 79% – the same number – of Europeans want us to help refugees and carry it together. The citizens of Europe are sometimes wiser than some politicians.

Not just for reasons of convenience: we all know that a possible Brexit would be a leap in the void, with disastrous consequences first and foremost for the British, but Europe is not a marriage of convenience. The United Kingdom, in our opinion, must remain in the Eu ropean Union because it is part of Europe. We, like the United Kingdom, have a common history and culture and without London, without the United Kingdom, Europe would no longer be the same. Friday's agreement is therefore a good one, and thank you to all those who have contributed to it: to President Schulz, to the sherpas, to Mr Juncker, to our friends in the Council.  Equally clearly, however, I must add that we will not accept being taken hostage by the internal balance of the British Conservative Party. It is unacceptable that, while Europe is experiencing the worst crisis in its history, weeks have passed to discuss how to vote in the Council, or the interpretations to be given to certain provisions of the Banking Union.  Friday's agreement reaffirms that, from a legal point of view, the principle of the free movement of citizens will not be affected. Well! I take note, but I am not convinced by one aspect, the social aspect. Imagine two young people, both Europeans, the same job. There is a risk that one of them, just because he is not British, will have fewer rights than the other. This is called discrimination, although I hope to be contradicted by the proposals that the European Commission will put forward after the result of the referendum. For us there are principles, threads, which must be touched prudently and carefully, because otherwise there is a risk of lethal shock, and one of these principles is that there is no distinction in terms of rights between the citizens of the Union. We will fight for the United Kingdom to remain with us, and I say this with the utmost respect for the British people, who are responsible for the choice alone. I say this with the utmost respect. You have been protagonists in the world, the United Kingdom has been a player in the world, for peace and for democracy. These values connote the UK's DNA. Well, what better place to bear witness to these values and principles than the European Union? Together we can witness and overcome the challenges, in the world and in time, of pitfalls and fear, of the tumultuous speed of globalization, loneliness and sadness and abandonment.

Many countries had concerns and objections, but I am glad that those hurdles were overcome, aided by willpower, fuelled by packets of Haribo and sealed following a visit to the chip shop. We found an agreement that enshrines the United Kingdom’s special status as a country never joining the euro and never joining Schengen, as a country that does not wish to be part of the ratchet of the European political project, and that delivers a live—and—let—live agreement, one where the United Kingdom continues to play an active role in the European Union without facing discrimination in areas where it wishes to keep national control. The ECR Group welcomes this deal, and now it is for the British people to pass judgement on these new terms. I will be supporting the campaign to remain in the European Union. (Applause and catcalls) My reasoning is simple: Britain’s economic recovery, though good, is still fragile, and I will not put it at risk by tearing us away from the single market. I also believe that my constituents will be safer and my country more secure if we continue our cooperation with our European partners. There are good people who would disagree with me, and I respect their decision. If the British people decide to leave, then we must respect that choice and make it work. But there are also those in this Chamber who are not respectful of other people’s choices – we can hear them today jeering behind me – those who compare the EU with the Soviet Union. I think that is foolish and offensive to those who actually lived under the yoke of communism. (Applause) Because, unlike the USSR, any country is free to leave the European Union. Mr Farage, that is the will of the sovereign people. Being in the EU is a choice, and the Conservative Party will respect that choice. The voters in Britain will exercise their sovereignty and they will decide whether to remain or to leave, and in the UK we can now look forward to debating this subject for the next four months. The EU must concentrate on the migration crisis it faces. The Dutch Prime Minister said we had six to eight weeks to save Schengen. He said that five weeks ago. In this Chamber we seem unwilling to accept that the migrant crisis was exacerbated when Chancellor Merkel said Germany would take people without limits, unilaterally defying a number of European rules. And – guess what – people are coming without limits. When some countries, like Hungary, apply the rules and defend the Schengen border, they are criticised, and when other countries break the rules, they are applauded. We cannot begin to solve this crisis until we enforce the rules in place: to protect the external Schengen border, to focus on the basics of processing detention and returns, and to prevent asylum seekers and economic migrants moving around the EU at will. We need international action to end the conflict in Syria. We need to give priority to those refugees already in the camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, both with humanitarian aid and in offering them refuge. Is it not perverse that the EU gives priority to those who cross the Aegean, rather than those already classified as refugees by the United Nations?

I think he is still in doubt and he does not know at the moment what he is going to do, and I think that is a better answer to Mr Corbett’s question than saying that they should ask the Members themselves. But I have another issue, involved in the negotiations from the beginning, Mr Fox. I have always asked myself why this British deal was so necessary and so vital? I can tell you there is one thing I am sure of: that this deal is not about Europe; it is in fact a deal to reunite the Tory Party. Let us be honest about this. I may not know the result of the referendum – whether Britain will remain in the Union – but I am sure of one result: it will not reunite the Tory party. That is clear, because what I am seeing is a glorified cockfight since Mr Tusk reached this deal, with Boris Johnson challenging David Cameron. I can tell you, I have seen ambitious politicians – I myself am an ambitious politician – but Boris Johnson takes it to a whole other level. Because it is the Mayor of London acting against the interests of the citizens of London, and all for personal ambition and certainly not for a better Europe or for a better Britain. It is totally bonkers, dear colleagues, and I would say it is pathetic that this is happening. It is even dramatic for Britain, especially, Mr Fox. We see that the pound sterling is falling rapidly, the unity of the United Kingdom is under threat and their American cousins are saying: ‘Please stop it, we will not make a trade deal with you outside the Union’. Apparently the special relationship between the US and the UK is not so special any more. So let me give some advice to those who are now carrying out this debate in Britain. Do not think that after a ‘no’ you can come back to the negotiating table. I know that some people are thinking that, saying: ‘Ha! It’s Europe. Once you have said ‘no’ in a referendum you are invited back to the negotiation table as with Ireland, as with Denmark, like after the Constitution with France and the Netherlands’. But this is not about the same thing. That was about the Constitution – a Treaty. Here it is about in or out. It is one or the other. And if I see how the currency of Britain is endangered, how now Britain is alienated from the US and how Britain is step by step being transformed into a little England, I think they would be wise to stay in the European Union. But, dear colleagues, pathetic as this debate is for the UK, it is also a dramatic debate and an important debate for Europe because, let us be honest, what we are discussing now is crazy. We have to unite; we should not be divided. The only ones who will gain from a divided Europe are – who? People like Vladimir Putin, people like Bashar al-Assad, like IS. And instead of discussing how to stand up to them and develop a strategy, what we are showing at the moment is division: we are weak. And yesterday this again became very clear when the Russian-American plan for a ceasefire in Syria happened and we were again not around the table for such a crucial decision. We can continue now – and some are doing so – to complain about the deal and point out the downsides of the deal. My appeal, Mr President, President Tusk, and to everybody in this House is to do the opposite. Let us use the deal to put Europe back on track and to make Europe work again. Let us finally stop Europe à la carte and stop the standstill because of the British issue. Mr Fox, I have nothing against giving special status to Britain if next time you agree also that in the next Treaty revision we can also go ahead with our integration. In all these reforms we need to establish a more united Europe, because we need it to tackle the multiple crises we are facing today and certainly the refugee crisis. And that is my last point: that we should also do more on the refugee crisis. Make as much effort, President Tusk, to solve the refugee crisis as we have made to find a solution for Brexit.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which As a result of an internal party power struggle, the EU went so far last weekend to dismantle an essential pillar that is supposed to include the consistency and structure of the EU – namely, the social pillar. Mr Juncker, I ask you: what will become of your AAA? What will become of it? It has been sacrificed. You could actually pack your stuff now and say: That's it! All promises are gone! I also tell you that we are on the way, the EU is moving closer to the market-radical Anglo-Saxon economic model. A monument could be erected in Brussels with the inscription: \"Here the spirit of Margaret Thatcher was revived on 18 February 2016\". Thank you. The real drama took place somewhere else and it still takes place today. It is the hundreds of thousands of people who have come to Greece in the last two months. It is the European Union's refusal to actually make the commitments, namely to ensure redistribution. It is a fact that the unanimous decision of the last summit – and you did not criticise it, neither of them – was repealed, and the day after the summit there was no longer any mention of it. The borders are being closed! However, it has been agreed that the borders will remain open until the next March summit, that this will be negotiated jointly and that a joint decision will be taken. Now a conference is taking place in Vienna under, I have to say, the invitation from Greece, the main actor! How do you want, how do we want to arrive at a European solution? I do not hear any criticism of this Vienna practice, not even from the Commission and the Council. What we need is for us to finally - and you yourself said this, Mr Juncker - comply with what we have decided. That would be the first condition for the corresponding figures, the quotas, to be taken over and for Greece to be helped here. We need a legal path, which must be created, and Greece must be helped in concrete terms. We can no longer simply pretend that this can be left to some Member States. The Member States have a duty to do their duty here and that is a human duty. We give up our values if we refuse to do so. I would also like to say this very specifically: should the Member States take an example from the new Portuguese Government, costa's offer to Tsipras that he will take over thousands of migrants, or the Spanish province of Valencia, which has proposed to the Greek province of the South Aegean, to take over a thousand migrants. Why can't the other Member States? That would be the way forward, that is the need that we should be talking about here today! Not a power play between Johnson and Cameron that does not affect me in any way, that does not affect many refugees, and that is what we should be talking about here. 24 hours of drama in Brussels, a staged drama, the real drama takes place outside and we do nothing! We do not react, we act as if everything is going to go away on its own. I believe that we are called upon to do so, and I also call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to act together here, to form a majority and to state clearly what is needed.

Of course, politics is always staging, but I did not have the impression at this last summit that we were dealing only with a cheap staging, but I had the impression that Donald Tusk correctly described this, that it was the end of a very serious negotiation, in which this agreement with Cameron was by no means the focus alone, but the desire to achieve something that would enable us to hold the European Union together. My impression of this summit – and I am always only on the sidelines as an observer – was that of a summit at which many of the members of the Council looked into the abyss and, for the first time, really realised what that actually means when a large old Member State leaves the European Union. I hope – and I say this now against these cockfights, which are being fought everywhere and which we are not immune from – that the conflict in the United Kingdom helps the British to realise what they have in the European Union, and I even hope that, in the course of this debate, we all in the European Union will see, until the vote, what we have in the European Union, because what has been built up over decades, for which even people have died – especially in Eastern Europe in recent times – can be broken again within a few weeks. This must not be forgotten, and I know such hasards in the debate as Mr Farage for long enough. I can fairly well assess what to expect in the debate.  This process of self-understanding, which has now been opened in the United Kingdom, could be a process that benefits us all in the challenges we face, which have now been described often enough. The European Union has actually become a bit more lonely in the great crises of that time, because the United States – as has often been described, it can be seen in many conflicts – no longer wants to help us out of every difficulty that we expect – and this has become crystal clear in the Ukraine crisis – that we Europeans, if we want, find common solutions in our own way. And when I think of the new Kremlin strategy, when I look at Syria, when I think of the worsening in the world, I can only say that with the United Kingdom, the European Union will be better able to survive these crises, in a European way, but it is also the other way round: the United Kingdom will only be able to survive these crises better if there is this unity in the European Union. It is a pity that the refugee issue has been dealt with so poorly! Mr Juncker, you said that whenever it gets very difficult, we agree. However, this did not happen at all at this summit on the refugee issue, but we see how, in a chain reaction – also as a result of the incompetence in refugee policy – the borders in Europe are being raised, even now we see more and more decisions that these borders are being protected militarily. The issue has been postponed to the summit with Turkey. I wish those who want to enshrine a fairer refugee policy, who want the European Union to treat people in greatest need fairly, for example in Syria and around Syria, that they have great negotiating skills. The issues remain the same: distribution in the European Union, which, if you look at these figures, should still be feasible, better border management, it will cost a lot, but that is important and must happen on a legal basis. NATO can step in, but it cannot secure the external borders of the European Union. And the greater aid for refugees in Jordan, in Turkey, must finally happen now.

It is referendum season and the referendum is coming – on 6 April in the Netherlands – where they are going to have a referendum on the Ukrainian deal, and the opinion polls show that they are going to reject it. And, just today, Mr Orbán has announced that there is going to be a referendum in Hungary on whether they should be forced to accept mandatory quotas for migrants after the grievous errors of the EU’s common asylum policy, not to mention Mrs Merkel’s pronouncements. And overnight we get a Czech Premier telling us that there is now demand building in the Czech Republic to have a referendum on membership. Oh, and I nearly forgot, there is going to be a British referendum on 23 June on whether we remain in or leave the European Union. This follows a 40—hour summit, where Mr Cameron, doing his modern day impression of Oliver Twist, went up to Mr Tusk and said, ‘Please sir, can I have some more concessions?’ Well, he didn’t get very much did he? We are allowed to change – ever so slightly – migrant benefits for a short period of time, and we are told that, in future, we will not be committed to ever closer union. And, on the basis of all that, we are going to have a referendum which the Prime Minister says is on a deal that is legally binding. Indeed Mr Tusk joined in with this today by saying the British deal was legally binding. To top that off, Mr Cameron has told us that he will lodge the deal – will lodge the documents – at the United Nations. But frankly, you might as well lodge an old pair of socks, because the fact of lodging a document there is completely meaningless – you could use a safety deposit box. But is this deal legally binding, Mr Tusk? Well, the ECJ itself said in 2008 that the obligations imposed by an international agreement cannot have the effect of prejudicing the constitutional principles of the EU Treaties, which means that the ECJ rules in favour of the existing Treaties until we get a new treaty. But who’s to say there is going to be a new treaty? Any new treaty would trigger yet more referendums and would not, I think, be favoured by the big Groups in this Parliament. But of course, we have an emergency brake. That has been judged to be a great success but, crucially, that happened through secondary legislation that can be voted on by this Parliament. So what happens? We have a referendum. We follow Mr Cameron, we vote to remain and then we come back to this Parliament. Is this Parliament going to support British exceptionalism? I think we have heard voices today that make it perfectly clear that this will not happen. So the deal, Mr Tusk – and Mr Cameron if you are listening – is not legally binding in any way at all. I have to say that the British public will decide which is our safest option. Is it safe to stay within an organisation whose own police boss tells us there are 3 000 to 5 000 terrorists who have now come into our continent through the migrant crisis, or is it safest to take back control of our own borders and our own democracy?

Mr President, be careful with the analyses on the results of political movements in their respective countries. In France, I believe that the Socialists went down to 22% in the last elections and no one resigned.  Ladies and gentlemen, in four months' time the British will vote in a referendum on whether or not their country should remain in the European Union. This choice of a popular election to decide such an important issue is absolutely legitimate and demonstrates a great vitality of British democracy, unlike the situation in France. Moreover, not all the media have the same unanimously pro-European position. So there will be real democratic debates, a swarm of ideas, analyses, positions. We see freedom of thought in action, freedom of opinion and respect for all opinions - the essence of democracy, in short. This reflection on Brexit will be an opportunity for the British to take stock of the stage of membership of the European institutions decided in 1970. If the record is not convincing, they will take another path, the path of freedom, the path of sovereignty. They will find the means to solve the problems of their time. The Declaration of Human and Citizen Rights of 1793 expresses in Article 28 a clear and just principle: \"A generation cannot subject future generations to its laws.\" A generation of Britons had chosen to enshrine the recent history of the United Kingdom in the European Union. This generation cannot today impose the European institutions, without debate or vote, on current generations. This referendum is in the very logic of democracy: it is therefore perfectly legitimate. The European Union imposes its innumerable laws on us in the shadow of the treaties signed by our successive governments, but these decisions are taken by unelected people, usually without any real democratic debate and without any media debate. By these unfair decisions and in reverse of the interests of its citizens, the European Union behaves like a tyranny in office, legally coming to power, but which makes an unfair and dangerous use of it. And the organization of the mock agreement staged will not change this cruel reality, nor will the threats or blackmail that are multiplying on the side of the system, or the polls surely carried out by Mr Soros brandished by Mr Weber, who clearly prefers the polls to the referendum, it seems. You cannot refuse to be judged by the people, and incidentally sanctioned by them, because that is precisely the essence of democracy.

The deal was done, and now the clock is ticking. While the summit has finally given the British Prime Minister what he needed – to speak out loud and clear in favour of our EU membership – it is not Friday’s deal that is on the ballot paper for the UK referendum. The question facing the British people is far more significant than anything that can be agreed over a very late breakfast in Brussels. It is about the very future of Britain as an outward—looking global player. It is about the future of Europe at a time when we need international cooperation to face the challenges of an uncertain world. For too long, politicians in Britain have shied away from the big arguments about Europe. We have allowed debate to be dominated by those on the other side of the Chamber and by those who are willing to stoke fear and divide communities to drive forward their ideological agenda, and by those who go heavy on the rhetoric and bluster but are in short supply of actual answers when asked about their alternatives to Britain holding its head high as an active and leading member of the EU. Colleagues, it is time we called out those who claim to speak for Britain but who, in truth, represent only a fraction of the British people. It is time we called out those who claim to be making a patriotic case but argue for a course of action that would diminish our country’s standing in the world. It is time we called out those who claim to care about working people but are pushing for the choice that means less job security and fewer working rights. That is why Labour is already out there, going from door to door, street to street, making the case not just for Britain to remain a member of the EU but for it to be once again a leading player in Europe. Thanks to campaigning by Labour and the trade unions, we have been able to block early efforts by the Tories to weaken workers’ rights as part of their negotiations. Those rights to paid holiday, equal pay and a safe place to work will feature front and centre of our campaign to remain. We will be making a positive case about Britain’s place in the world and about the fact that, on everything from the environment to the economy, Britain is stronger when working together with its European partners. There is still much we can do to make Europe work better for our constituents. Nobody should be under any illusion: after the referendum is won, after the legislation agreed at this summit is passed, our job of reforming Europe is not done. But for Britain to have an influence on this process, we must have a seat at the table. So, for Britain and for Europe, we will fight with every breath to win.

By force of successive crises of refugees, security, Brexit, we have forgotten that we have been living in a permanent crisis for a few years now of growth, employment, social rights and low wages. The OECD published its outlook last week: the euro area grew by 1.4%, Germany, 1.3%, France, 1.2%, Italy, 1%; and that means that we are not able to respond to the crisis that is at the source of the other crises that are currently destroying the European Union. Why is this happening in an exceptional monetary policy environment, in a favourable exchange rate environment, in a low-priced commodity environment? Because there is no expansive fiscal policy, which is what the European Union needs right now. And so the OECD calls for more ambitious fiscal policies, calls for more investment in the short term and on the basis of the long term. And whoever says this is not a conspiracy of Keynesians who have taken the OECD or a group of socialists. It's common sense and evidence of what's happened in recent years.

You did not even reply. Since then, the Supreme Court in Ireland has been hearing an appeal by a Member of Parliament into the constitutionality of those notes. In its defence, the state argued that the moment the notes were issued, they were not just a promise of billions to what even then was an insolvent and non-systemic bank; they were in fact capital, capital that was raised from the ELA fund. This was a blatant violation of its rules, as the fund was only to be used for solvent institutions – and yet it was sanctioned by the ECB. Why? Because it feared contagion. Mr Juncker, wherever you are, 31 billion more than the entire combined tax take of Ireland in 2010 was put into this. Would Britain put up with it? Would Luxembourg put up with it? Would France put up with it? To the Irish living in Britain: why aren’t these questions being answered? So far my conclusion is: because they don’t bloody well care in here.

In my country, Austria, too, there is a very strong dissatisfaction with the European Union, and I ask against this background: why should it not be possible for democracy to re-enter the continent where democracy was born – whether it was in Iceland or In Greece, that the political historians should argue accordingly – that democracy should be reintroduced on our continent?

With regard to the other Council conclusions, as much as you are pleased with NATO's arrival in the Aegean, be aware that the Greek people regard this move as a betrayal, both on the part of the government and on behalf of our so-called allies, who caress Turkey, a donor state of terrorists that has no place in Europe.

I believe that this deal is also legally tenable, and we will also have to see this in the legislation according to the fact that we are carrying out legislation that is legally tenable.

If we see these days that the Americans and the Russians are doing a deal without us, then that should finally make us aware that the nation states can no longer look into our interests alone. We can do it together, or we will all not be able to do it. That is why this is a way of regaining sovereignty for our peoples – over Europe.

Earlier, our President Weber said well that when we were at war in Libya, Ukraine, Syria, we were prioritizing this British issue. Unfortunately, we deal with this as a priority, but we rightly question whether this is the right priority in the crisis we live in in Europe, with the number of unemployed we have in the European Union. However, we have to deal with it and we are ready for it. Mr Juncker said recently: \"Either we will be brave, or everything will collapse.\" I believe that we should be brave and that the EU must not collapse and I believe in the British people who will make a decision in June this year. I believe that it will be prudent enough and that the answer will be positive, that it will remain in the European Union, because this is the only solution for both the Union and the United Kingdom.

If this emerging unity of action on the migration crisis is violated by anyone, they may in fact contribute to the UK leaving the EU. As I have already said, the UK settlement will enter into force only if the British people vote to stay. If they vote to leave, the settlement will cease to exist.

What seems decisive to me on this issue is that the European Union – which must of course not interfere in any way in the sovereign will of the British people, who will decide freely whether to remain or leave the European Union – will make it very clear that if the option is for exit, this has consequences – and irreversible consequences.

Madam President, Turkish slave traders continue to send thousands of refugees to Greece, Skopje, assisted by Austria, closes the border and Greece is in danger of becoming a vast refugee Dachau, while France, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and now Belgium have suspended Schengen.  The hypocrisy surrounding relocation continues, since of the sixty-six thousand four hundred refugees the European Union has pledged to take from Greece, not even four hundred have been relocated. As long as Greece remains in Schengen, it is a magnet for the thousands of refugees, since it grants them Schengen-style travel documents that allow them to travel to Germany. That's why refugees risk drowning in the Aegean Instead of going from Bulgaria to Germany.  The only solution is for Greece to withdraw from Schengen, close its borders and entrust the guarding of its maritime borders to the Greek navy and the Coast Guard.

It focuses on the fact that economic and financial systems are aimed at improving citizens' living conditions, and that is the main reason why we need to continue with the consolidation of these systems.  Presenting as an objective social development, which must be presented across all Union policies, it proposes monitoring of these policies and stresses that Member States and the European institutions need to ensure, in a responsible manner, the long-term stability of their political and budgetary choices in order to be able to continue towards sustainable growth. In this sense, this report focuses on the need to consolidate public finances and tax systems, given the fragile economic situation of many Member States, and reinforces the importance of this consolidation in order to ensure social stability, not only in the present day, but preparing the future of younger generations. As we have seen in recent years, Member States' resilience to the financial crisis is linked to the empowerment of their public finances, and the ones with the worst results are those with the most marketable economies and larger deficits. This financial consolidation must be accompanied by growth policies, which are translated into a set of structural reforms aimed at competitiveness and defending the social role of states in the face of the problems – also structural – that we are currently facing. The sustainability of social security and social security systems and pension schemes is perhaps the most paradigmatic example of this challenge, given the ageing trend of the European population predicted in the coming years. Education is also a fundamental pillar for development, and we are competing to ensure that education systems give young people the necessary skills, especially in new work areas, of which the digital, green and blue economy is an example. It is also an essential area to meet the needs of companies, which are the first engine of development. We believe that European policies should still enhance public and private investment at European level, but that investment must be targeted at projects that ensure economic and/or social return and should boost growth and can never be a mechanism for the mere use of public funds. Finally, I would like to highlight the entirely new approach proposed in this process, which is the unprecedented introduction of social indicators, including the activity rate, youth employment and long-term employment, in the analysis of the overall development of the Member States. If this report is adopted, Parliament will be giving the Commission and the Council a strong message that, alongside other existing indicators, such as those in the economic and financial field, we must have mechanisms to assess the extent to which our policies are having an impact on the daily lives of our fellow citizens. This will be a way of ensuring that internal imbalances in the Member States are further assessed so that we can redesign their economic and social reforms where necessary. This is a great step that allows us to strengthen the social pillar. In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups, who have been very committed to us in a joint effort to reach a common position.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 155, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Maria João RODRIGUES", "mepid": "124737", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, we are at an important moment for the European Semester because Parliament can deliver today three important reports which deal with a situation that is quite unique in the European Union. We are dealing with overlapping crises and, if you want to cope with these overlapping crises, it is certain that we need to strengthen the internal cohesion of the European Union. This will depend a lot on delivering a much stronger and more balanced recovery. I have the pleasure to present today the report adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I am very grateful to my colleagues, because I believe that it was possible to reach a very useful compromise with real added value for the situation in the European Union. The starting point of our report is to say that the European Semester should be used to pursue the rebalancing of our budgets and relevant reforms, but also to implement the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, because we believe that, in the end, the future of Europe will depend on this kind of competitiveness geared to the future, based on energy transition , digital solutions and bringing about more and better jobs. But if this is the case, the policy mix should be fully supported for this ambition. This means that in the policy mix to be implemented in the coming year, pushing for investment should be a top priority. This means making the best of the available tools, starting with the European investment plan, but also completing the banking union to make access to credit much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises. We do, of course, also need reforms, but we believe that we need a second generation of reforms pushing for education, innovation and good public administration and ensuring sustainable welfare systems. And, of course, we need to pursue the fiscal rebalancing of our budgets, but in such a way that we do not undermine this pro-growth move and the strategic investment we need to address. We should also take into account the fact that Europe is confronted with new challenges, security issues and, in particular, the refugee crisis. I believe that the most important value in our report is the way to manage the euro area, because we recognise that the euro area is an economic entity deserving an appropriate policy mix. That is why we recommend that the investment gap which is there in the euro area should be addressed by sharing the contributions from different countries, particularly those with more fiscal space. The same should happen when it comes to reducing macroeconomic imbalances because, on the one hand, we need more-competitive countries to expand internal demand and, on the other, we need less-competitive countries to increase their competitiveness – not by reducing wages and social conditions but rather by investing in the future. These are important conclusions. We believe that it is crucial to organise upward convergence in the eurozone, assuming that economic and social objectives should be treated in the same way. This can only be delivered if we complete economic and monetary union with a fiscal capacity and the banking union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Catherine STIHLER", "mepid": "4545", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank the Council – in the person of our former colleague from Parliament – for being here with us on this important debate. The single market is a precious resource which the European Union’s current and future economic prosperity depends upon. The untapped potential of the single market, estimated at EUR 1 trillion in value, is both an opportunity and a wake-up call to ensuring the single market works to benefit us all. I think it is a great pity that we have continued to miss out on these advances for over 20 years, especially in the light of the ever-growing internationalisation and global competition that we face. The single market has great potential to boost jobs and growth, and this prospect has been widely acknowledged at an EU level. However, despite repeated calls to strengthen the single market in the Council and in annual growth surveys and country-specific recommendations, not enough progress has been achieved so far. In order to effectively deliver on jobs and growth and competitiveness, the progress of integration of the single market and Member States must be accompanied with better governance and greater transparency of the process. Including the single market under the European Semester could help us achieve this goal. Regular, structured compliance dialogue with Member States, proper involvement of the European Parliament, inclusive and non-discriminatory approaches to all EU Member States, euro and non-eurozone, Member States’ national parliaments and all stakeholders, is crucial for transparency, governance and ownership, and ultimately for the success of the process. I also believe it is the enforcement and implementation of already existing EU legislation by all 28 Member States that is key to unlocking the full potential of the single market: overcoming unnecessary non-tariff obstacles, proper implementation of the Services Directive, proper and timely transposition and implementation of public procurement and concessions legislation, modernising public administrations, providing more and better accessible digital services for citizens and businesses – and these are just a few examples where already-existing EU legislation is not yet properly implemented. They are stalling the development of the single market across the European Union. Change cannot and should not only come from the top. All players need to embrace a single market compliance culture and work in a cooperative partnership. Such multi-level ownership needs to be supported by adequate training, assistance and dedicated resources and accessible information at all levels. I have tried to address these features in my report, and overall I am pleased with the final text. I would like to thank the shadows for their contributions; although we did not always agree on everything, I think we managed to reach an agreement in the end. I would also note that it is my firm belief – and hopefully that of many of my colleagues – that one of the reasons we are here as Members of the European Parliament is to ensure that we pass and adopt transparent, appropriate and fair laws. Since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, Parliament has more say over what and how legislation is adopted at EU level, and we need to use this influence as the only democratically-elected EU institution to ensure we adopt better regulations and better regulatory principles. That is why on behalf of my Group, I am asking for a slight change of wording in paragraph 46, via an amendment. This is to ensure that the better regulation principle is duly referred to in this report, as better governance and greater transparency of the process equates to an enhanced functioning of the single market for consumers and businesses alike. I hope I can count on your support, colleagues, to support the amendment and the text as a whole, and I thank you for your cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 157, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Jean ARTHUIS", "mepid": "124773", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. Madam President, I welcome the Presidency of the Council and the Commissioner. I would like to stress the somewhat formal nature of our exercise, deplore the small parliamentary dimension of the European Semester and regret the lack of ambition of the report of the five presidents in this regard. Having said that, and I repeat Mrs Rodrigues' words, the European Union does not have an economic policy. Economic policy is an addition of national policies and coordination too often remains somewhat incantatory. That is why we believe it is necessary to strengthen the euro area, which can only expand when the countries that are not yet members will show the will. The euro area needs a budget that would allow us to combat asymmetric shocks and reward the reforms that are being made by the Member States.

In times of crisis, when pressing issues abound, I am grateful to Parliament for dedicating time to the subject. Yes, it is a complex issue but one that deserves our full attention, for if we are to make Europe relevant to people’s daily lives, we need to achieve concrete results on growth and jobs. We need to create opportunities for young people, for the long-term unemployed, for small businesses. Yes, it is a long journey, for sure, but things are looking up. Europe is experiencing a recovery. Slowly but surely we are emerging from the crisis. So which priority should guide our actions at this juncture? Reading your reports on the European Semester, I was pleased to see that we share a common assessment of the challenges before us. Obviously, relaunching investments remains a vital condition to strengthen the still fragile recovery and, as stated by rapporteur Rodrigues, investments are crucial. So yes, the Commission’s investment plan is central to our efforts in this respect. The European Fund for Strategic Investment, on which the European Parliament and the Council have worked hand in hand, is in place, but more needs to be done. So let us continue to work together with the same sense of urgency to lift the remaining barriers and to foster a truly favourable investment climate. Clearly, sound responsible public finances are another essential part of our growth strategy, for the recovery can only be sustained if it is based on solid ground. This means making our tax systems more growth-friendly as well as developing modern social protection systems. We also need to embrace structural reforms to strengthen our economies, to ensure that our economies are resilient and fit for the future. Member States, especially those hardest hit by the crisis, have over the past few years undertaken ambitious reform agendas which are starting to bear fruit. However, as the pressure eases, the temptation to go back to ‘business as usual’ emerges. This is, obviously, understandable, but standing still in a fast-changing world is not an option. We have to move from rebalancing our economies and reforming our pension systems to ensuring that the younger generation have the skills they need for the future challenges. In other words, the reforms we carry out today will shape the competitive Europe of tomorrow. In our endeavours to promote long-term growth, we can rely on the EU’s most valuable asset: tapping the potential of the single market. This was also stated by Ms Stihler. You have underlined in your report a single market dimension of the European Semester, and I very much welcome this. As you know, deepening the single market is an issue dear to the Netherlands Presidency, and we have planned to report on the issue ahead of the European Council meeting in March. At the core of our approach lies the conviction that, in the midst of global uncertainty and the crisis that Europe is facing today, we need to lay the ground for tomorrow. It is about designing and implementing future-proof policies. How do we make sure that our policies withstand the test of time? First, we need to constantly review our work, for good recommendations are by no means a guarantee of success unless they are fully implemented. This is perhaps the single most important challenge of the European Semester: making sure that we actually deliver on reform. Member States’ responsibility is central here. The European Parliament has been active in pushing us to do better, and rightly so. As the Presidency, we believe that much can be done in the Council to provide the right peer pressure to undertake the necessary but sometimes painful reforms. More political discussions on the implementation of reforms and sharing best practices between ministers will help keep the momentum for reform ongoing. This is why, in the coming two weeks, in addition to the usual discussions on the Annual Growth Survey, we have scheduled specific debates in the Council on the implementation of country-specific recommendations in the run-up to the March European Council. But let me be clear at the same time: there is no quick fix to address the implementation gap, and deeper discussions within the Council will not be sufficient. We need to involve all stakeholders, national parliaments, social partners and, of course, the European Parliament. This is not just about democratic oversight; it is vital for the process to be effective, as ownership is the foundation of meaningful reforms, and today’s debate is important for that very reason. Progress has been made. Shorter, more focused recommendations do make it easier to concentrate our efforts on the key issues. The new timing of the Semester gives more time for work at expert level to exert a truly multilateral surveillance, and the early adoption of the euro area recommendation means that our discussions on national recommendations from now on will take into account euro area challenges. More attention is also being given to the social dimension of the Semester, and taken together these are meaningful changes, obviously. We will continue to strengthen our cooperation in order to reap the full benefits of the European Semester with just one goal in mind: delivering on a stronger Europe for all citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 159, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, this morning the College of Commissioners held an orientation debate on the European semester, including country reports and developments in the macroeconomic imbalances procedure. We will publish the country reports on Friday, and decisions in the context of the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure will be taken in the next few weeks. The country reports follow the policy guidance provided by the 2016 Annual Growth Survey and the recommendation on the euro area last November. The 2016 European Semester is more streamlined than in the past: it integrates the euro area and national dimension and puts stronger emphasis on employment and social performance, convergence and support from the European structural investment funds and technical assistance to the implementation of reforms. This year we decided to streamline the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure, moving from six to four categories, namely: no imbalances; imbalances; excessive imbalances; and excessive imbalances within the corrective arm of the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure. To put country reports in a broader economic context: the EU economic recovery is still ongoing but risks have visibly increased over the past few months, with negative external developments starting to feed into European financial markets and confidence indicators. Unemployment has been falling, but it remains high in a number of countries, particularly unemployment among young people and long-term unemployment. The adjustment of macroeconomic imbalances has advanced but is far from complete. In particular, high levels of private and public debt still act as a drag on growth in many Member States. This situation must be seen as an incentive to redouble the efforts to implement policies that support growth and stability. In this respect we have many good examples of reforms in our Member States but also see that progress is uneven across Member States and different sectors. Further progress can be made with the close involvement of national parliaments, social partners and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of reforms. It is necessary to strengthen the effectiveness and ownership of reform efforts in the Member States. Publication of the country reports earlier than in the past serves this goal. It provides more time to engage in an in-depth dialogue with Member States and key stakeholders before the Commission publishes country-specific recommendations. The role of the European Parliament in the European Semester has evolved over time. Ways to strengthen it further are being explored in line with the Five Presidents’ Report on completing economic and monetary union and the communication of October 2015 on steps towards completing the EMU. I am convinced that it is of the utmost importance to have an exchange of governance milestones like the country reports, and I am very much looking forward to discussing these with you. The findings of the country reports, the outcome of the Commission’s analysis of our exchanges as well as the stability and convergence programmes and national reform programmes will pave the way for the 2016 country-specific recommendations, which the Commission will issue in May. Now to come specifically to the three reports we are discussing today, to start with the Stihler report. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Stihler, and welcome the contribution of the European Parliament on single market governance as part of 2016 European Semester. Structural reforms are needed to facilitate the reallocation of resources across companies, sectors and regions in order to increase productivity and competitiveness. It is necessary to go further in the process of reform, setting the foundations for a more competitive and resilient European economy. This can be achieved through reforms such as opening the product and services markets that would boost the EU internal market, and through structural reforms to eliminate barriers to the free circulation of goods and services. The Commission is working to reduce the high number of restrictions in product and services markets in many EU Member States. Improving the functioning of these markets is essential to renew the economic fabric of the EU and to ensure that EU companies adopt and successfully integrate into the increasingly global value chains. Now to move the Rodrigues report. I would like to thank Ms Rodrigues for this report and it concurs with the views of the Commission on a wide range of issues. The Commission welcomes the support for the 2016 Annual Growth Survey and for the priorities it identifies, as well as for the advanced timing and content of the recommendation of the euro area. The Commission shares the importance of making more effort at national level to implement structural reforms effectively. It also shares the need for close coordination to achieve more robust economic recovery, to support sound public finances and address macroeconomic imbalances. The emphasis on promoting convergence towards the best performers in the euro area is also at the core of the Commission’s work. Finally to the Ribeiro report: once again, thank you to the rapporteur. The European labour market is showing some positive signs. Unemployment is still high in many Member States, but it is gradually decreasing. Employment is growing in most sectors and for all age groups. More young people are back in jobs or taking part in education and training. Our efforts to fight against youth unemployment are beginning to bear fruit. We are also seeing the first signs of divergences among the Member States starting to decrease. Because of the crisis, more people have fallen into poverty, but also we see some first signs of progress. The promotion of better social standards and upward social convergence within the EU is a priority. The European Pillar of Social Rights will be an important vehicle to restore social convergence. The Commission is paying more attention to employment and social developments in the European Semester. First, the 2016 Annual Growth Survey package puts social fairness at the heart of economic recovery. Second, in line with a new start for a social dialogue, the involvement of social partners in the European Semester is strengthened throughout the consultations at EU and national level, and in addition, the new employment guidelines call on Member States to involve social partners in the design and implementation of the reforms. Third, the analysis of new employment indicators in the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure allows for a better understanding of the employment and social consequences of imbalances in some Member States. Several Member States have pursued reforms in the labour market and there are visibly positive effects, not least through increasing employment rates. However, these reforms should be continued, to stimulate growth and to create a positive environment for the creation of quality jobs.

Our aim is not to weaken the strong, but to strengthen the weak. In concrete terms, this means that if there are countries that have an export surplus, for example, then other Member States in the European Union will benefit in the same way, because we also have very intensive trade relations internally. It is not by trying to reduce this, but by enabling others to produce similarly good figures. The third thing that particularly moves us as the GROUP is that we are concentrating more on a few requirements for country-specific recommendations for the Member States, which will then actually be implemented.

I begin by thanking the whole team of colleagues who were rapporteurs and, in particular, Maria João Rodrigues, for ECON, this excellent report. The message that the report brings is very clear: it says that it is time to change Europe's economic agenda. Today, in the United States, the 2008 crisis belongs to the history manuals. In the European Union, however, we continue to 'skate' (excuse the plebeians) in an overly weak recovery and unemployment. Expectations today for German industry are unfortunately at the level of 2008-2009. Banking and insurance have started to show signs of tension again, because there are no good deals if there are no good profitable companies, and there are no profitable companies without domestic demand and without investment, no reason how low the interest rate. In the economy, you cannot just see supply, there has to be demand, and the economic policy that we have followed has extinguished that demand through excessive austerity. Today, any swing in the economy of the United States or China disturbs the Union.  Fiscal policy needs to be readjusted and symmetry introduced in the adjustment between deficit and surplus countries. We need to protect strategic investment – and it seems that there is consensus on that. And we must complete the banking union, or the European Union will lose control over its own destiny. Portugal is, in this respect, a good example that european rules can be complied with and a more stimulating policy of economic growth and employment can be taken on. But the Union and the Commission in particular, as well as the Council, need to be available to support alternatives such as these and also to change the dominant one that has existed so far in the general policy of monetary union itself. With so many problems threatening the Union, let us have the intelligence to solve the economic component, because it is in our hands.

Entire countries and regions remain decoupled from the recovery. The European Semester aims to make country-specific recommendations on economic reforms on the one hand and to address macroeconomic imbalances on the other. The effort involved is considerable. The success – i.e. the transposition by the Member States into concrete policies – is rather low, at around 25% in 2014. Implementation is voluntary and should remain so in the spirit of subsidiarity. This is not a problem in the non-euro countries. With their own prosperity and their future prospects, they must be liable for the quality of their own politicians. In the euro area, on the other hand, the costs of inadequate reforms are passed on, for example, via target balances, artificially low interest rates or, right through the printing press. Inequality in the EU is growing, and the dream of economic convergence – once an objective of the introduction of the euro – is further away than ever. Since there can be no devaluation of one's own currency, it is still necessary to devalue internally.

A failed economic recipe, meaningless Community, which still strongly imposes the German will. To oppose this recipe, it is not enough to say 'no' to austerity, but we must be intellectually honest and question the monetary instrument through which states are obliged to apply these wrong policies, continually trampling underfoot national constitutions. The transfer of monetary sovereignty is the original sin and taking it back is the only concrete way to fight against austerity head on and put the Union back on its founding principles and save Europe. To date, we have two clear examples of bargaining power: the strong example of those who do not have the euro, such as the United Kingdom, which can determine itself economically, comes to Brussels to play a leading role, setting the conditions, and the weak one of those who have given up economic policies by adopting the euro and are therefore obliged to do what Brussels and Frankfurt say, begging for flexibility and suffering slaps and injustices in the application of the rules. Greece and Italy are the two most concrete and glaring examples. I am talking about injustice because for almost twenty years we have had a currency that is an expression not of a real currency area, but of a fixed exchange rate bond between 19 states with deep and deep-rooted economic and social differences. We say this in every report on economic issues since we entered this Parliament: every day, for too many years, germans and Dutch have been exploiting the undervalued fixed exchange rate for their economies and enriching themselves by recording current account surpluses in the balance of payments. The Commission is slowing down and doing nothing concrete, applying the MIP too softly, slowly and gradually. Over the years, the Commission has only moved to beat the Mediterranean countries, which are already in difficulty, which are forced to devalue internally, trapped in the impossibility of floating exchange rates in order to close the gap. The Italian Finance Minister, Mr Padoan, also had to admit this a few weeks ago. Plus there are decades of economic studies that say what I'm saying right now. Unfortunately, once again, the issue of the German surplus will not be clearly dealt with head-on in the text on which we are going to vote.

The truth is that we have been recovering for two years, but it is true that it is a slow recovery, it is a weak recovery and, above all, it is a deeply uneven recovery. All international reports tell us. For example, the OECD, I can't help but say it, is stating to us that the differences between the poorest 10% and the 10% it has the most since the start of the crisis have multiplied, in some countries like mine, to seven. And you draw us, as I say, an overly accommodating picture, even with the reality we are seeing, with the new economic and social uncertainties that are scouring us. For this purpose, from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, from the Socialist Group, we ask you mainly three things. First, encourage investment. Secondly, they correct the excesses of the policy of excessive austerity that have been carried out in both labour reforms and structural reforms, and above all, which have attacked the European social model. And third, to build and strengthen the euro area, the social dimension of our common currency. We have to strengthen investment. If we do not invest, if we fail to create a countercyclical policy in this new climate of economic uncertainty, we will not have learned from the mistakes of the past. We have the Juncker plan, but the Juncker plan is not producing the effect of increasing investment in the euro area. Do you know that with regard, for example, to the United Kingdom or, for example, to the United States, which has increased investment in the last two years, last year in the euro area we continue to decrease global investments compared, for example, to the period 2013-2014? We can't allow it. We need more investment to boost economic growth and we cannot allow what little we know about the Juncker plan today to be as a result of a substitute effect on all Member States on already scheduled and unensured investments. We need to correct the excesses of labour reforms, because employment is being created, but precarious employment, underemployment, working hours of very few hours. We're on totally involuntary partial contracts. We are seeing indefinite contracts replaced by precarious contracts, sometimes by hours. And we are generalizing and not combating a phenomenon of labour poverty which today is, throughout the European Union, to work for less than it allows us to fill the shopping basket or pay the receipt of light, that is, ultimately, to live with dignity. And we have to recover the social model, because it is the fairest policy, but above all it is the most efficient economic policy. With decent pensions, with sufficient unemployment benefits, with scholarships we are not only creating a fairer society, but we are creating automatic stabilizers that protect us against the economic shocks that come from outside. If we don't get back to social models, we won't be learning from the mistakes of the past.  And finally, we have to build a better euro area, with a social dimension.

As far as the European Semester is concerned, fortunately, I can say that this is not a new topic. From my point of view, I have a few comments; two characteristics I would like to present. Firstly, structural reforms in the Member States. We regularly debate how binding the country-specific recommendations are. Let us be clear – the recommendations are, after all, binding, because they are approved by the Heads of Government themselves and very often strike at the very heart of the problem in individual countries. Another point, which is somewhat inter linking to the previous one, is that I cannot imagine how and why to increase economic coordination at European Union level if we are not able to coordinate the ESMS accordingly at the moment. Many countries are not implementing the reforms they are recommended, so I personally believe that we should rather focus on what to do to encourage governments to carry out reforms at national level, especially now that the spectre of another financial and economic crisis is really threatening us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 176, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Ulla TØRNÆS", "mepid": "124880", "text": "   – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Ms Ribeiro, for a very good and a very constructive process and work on this report.

There is not enough of it, so growth is limited. The improvement – indeed the preservation – of social conditions for workers in employment, young people looking for a job, working families and pensioners is not in sight. These people claim that Europe is failing them. The social compact on which it was established is no longer there. It is not populist to agree with those who make such claims, as they are right. The problem is not about agreeing or disagreeing with them. The problem is how to get economic growth back on track so that full—time, secure jobs are generated for young people and the old do not fear for their pensions. We do not need complex technocratic tools to solve this problem. We just need the political will to think outside the box into which we have squared ourselves, supposedly in order to satisfy the Stability and Growth Pact. We need simple, decisive action that goes to the root of the problem: public and private investment. The record shows that private investment follows from public investment, not the other way round. Public investment has been lagging. The Juncker fund, worthwhile though it is, cannot cover the problem. Moreover, public investment is more effective when deployed at national level when it does not have to depend on the delays of bureaucracy. If we can find ways and means of promoting national public investment that will in turn stimulate national and Europe-wide private investment, would this breach the current rules of the Stability and Growth Pact? Possibly, yes. Should we care much?

These issues need to be dealt with separately, not by making each other a condition. I also regret the fact that the rapporteurs have failed to make such a provision in the report.

The external environment has deteriorated and we have seen a marked increase in financial market volatility and risk aversion.

I would like to underline the importance both of new proposals in fields where the internal market is not completed yet and of the full implementation of existing legislation. Many of you also stressed the importance of strengthening the social dimension in the Semester, and I understand. But as you know, Member States have different opinions on strengthening the European Semester on the social dimension and employment. A number of Member States made it very clear that social policy matters fall within the competence of Member States. They do not wish to give in on national sovereignty through the Semester process. However, all Member States – and this is the good news – stress that a revamped European Semester should continue to ensure that necessary structural reforms are implemented to address social and employment challenges and continually improve social and employment outcomes, taking into account the targets set in the Europe 2020 Strategy with regard to increasing employment, fighting poverty and social inclusion. Many of you also emphasised the importance of the implementation of the country-specific recommendations (CSRs), and I could not agree more. CSRs are the key to structural reforms in Member States. Sometimes it is not easy – sometimes it is even painful – as I said it at the beginning, and let’s face it, reforming Europe’s pension system or labour market is difficult. But it is the best way to kick-start growth and jobs, so yes, I agree with you, implementation is therefore crucial. Many important points were raised today. I will need to keep them in mind in the coming months. Soon the Commission will adopt country reports analysing Member States’ economic situations, their reform agendas and possible imbalances, and this will mark the beginning of the groundwork by experts and should lead to the adoption of the upcoming country-specific recommendations in the summer. In other words, and in closing, this is an important phase of the European Semester where we can take stock of how much has been achieved in each Member State and set out the main challenges ahead. Many are long—standing issues, from reforming our social protection systems to ensuring well-functioning housing markets. Others are new, such as setting up the right policies to deal, for example, with the recent influx of refugees and migrants. All require our full attention in the year to come.

This is the responsibility of all of us as the European Union, but it is a responsibility which in many cases is also exclusive to the Member States, and the Member States cannot afford that responsibility. We need stability in our public policies and we need to gain the trust of our investors. And since we are talking about confidence – and we have just talked about the Portuguese situation, in which we have set an example by colleagues of the Socialist Party on the Portuguese issue, in which a vote of confidence has been asked for the Portuguese Government, which was given by the European institutions – let me just say that we cannot have uncertainties. Mrs Rodrigues said she thinks we can grow. We cannot think, we cannot continue to use demagoguery and we cannot afford to do more experiments in Europe, we must be sure, we must have responsible policies and we must have properly targeted policies. In the last two years, we have witnessed, both at the level of my country and at European Union level, an economic and social recovery, which is true that has been timid, but which has pointed us to a path that we must continue. If it is true – and it has been recognised – that there are numerous factors that can be reviewed and that must be reviewed – and we have that responsibility – we cannot lose everything and we cannot make change just by change.  It is in this sense that I am prepared to continue to cooperate with the Commission so that we can, in fact, in conjunction with national parliaments and the social partners, understand how, in a global and local way, we can actually build the Europe of citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 226, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Catherine STIHLER", "mepid": "4545", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, thank you to colleagues, the shadows, the Council and the Commission. The importance of the single market has been heard today and we know that we have the beauty of the single market, but balancing that with social rights is some strength that we have within this European Union. Many colleagues have spoken about the issue of digital, and I would like to touch on the importance of the digital single market in my final remarks. We are experiencing this Fourth Industrial Revolution. You just need to look across at colleagues while this debate has been going on, with everyone on their smartphones. In fact, by 2021, 70% of all handsets will be smartphones. By 2020 there will be 14 billion network devices and 3.2 billion people using the internet. Mobile traffic alone has grown by 65% from Quarter 4 in 2014 to Quarter 4 in 2015. We are truly experiencing this revolution, and this links into the Semester and the single market. There are three points I want to make: accessibility when it comes to the digital single market strategy; accessibility to superfast broadband and infrastructure; and accessibility to ensure that those who have the least also have access to this revolution. We do not want the digital divide to become a digital chasm. On skills, we look at the range from just switching on a computer right through to becoming a software developer. In fact, while we have been speaking in this Chamber, one of the great initiatives called CodeClan has been happening in Scotland. This allows people who want to be software engineers to be able to do that within a three- to four-month period. This is about lifelong learning and about mindset – a mindset that, no matter if you are a small business or a multinational, we all have to get real about digital. Therefore I think we have an opportunity through the Semester, and through the single market, to make the European Union one of the most digitally-savvy spaces in the planet, and this is the opportunity we have now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 227, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The joint discussion is over.

But the problem of European unemployment is far deeper than choosing the right investments from European or national budgets. It is necessary to coordinate policy correctly not only in the context of national negotiations, but also at the highest European level. I would therefore like to push for joint meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection Council with the Economic and Financial Affairs Council.

BECKER", "mepid": "107041", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, representative of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. With the EURES report on the European Network of Labour Market Administrations and Labour Market Mediators, we have before us an EU regulation for the vote, which, after eleven intensive trilogue rounds, has succeeded in a highly constructive spirit on the part of all the groups in this House and, at the same time, the Commission under the Luxembourg Presidency, which will have a lasting effect on European labour markets for a longer period of time. While many regions in Europe are characterised by high unemployment, two million jobs remain vacant elsewhere because of a lack of skilled labour on the ground. The EURES Internet platform can ensure very easy access to hundreds of thousands of vacant jobs across Europe from the very first stage of development. As a result, many more jobs will be offered, with up to 1.4 million jobs available. EURES is thus a massive promotion of labour mobility, which is currently only 3% in Europe. More people should work in another country. We have worked very intensively in Parliament on the Commission's initiative to reform the EURES regulation through a new EURES platform and optimise it with efficiency and innovation, and we have wrapped Up Parliament's priorities in almost 700 amendments and over 40 compromises, which were then negotiated in the trialogue for the joint result. In this context, I would like to express my thanks to the competent round of shadow rapporteurs and their assistants, as well as to the professional EMPL secretariat, as well as to our active advisers to my own and to the other groups, not least To Mrs Ulvskog as sovereign chairman. I would therefore also like to mention the soft values, which are not unimportant when a result is achieved. A spirit of cooperation has emerged, together with the Commission's leader and the Council team. Without lazy compromises, the quality of the new EURES regulation, a strong instrument for promoting worker mobility and thus also to reduce unemployment in the EU, could finally be made clear. We were able to enshrine the following key points of the regulation by common accord: in addition to the public labour market administrations, private employment intermediaries are also on board. Together, they feed the hundreds of thousands and, later, even more vacant, vacant jobs in all the Member States. And there has never been so much support for people, especially young people, with THE easy-to-use and accessible Internet platform of EURES if they want to find work in another country in Europe because they are not able to do so in their home country. And every job seeker has been able to post their application documents online with ease, and their CV can be viewed by all worker-seeking companies from anywhere. With EURES, job seekers receive support not only on the internet platform, but also personally, through 850 best-trained EURES consultants in all EU countries. The path of every job seeker to his new job will be completely free. Most importantly, we have also succeeded in convincing the Commission and the Council that the active role of the social partners in the EURES construction is not only safeguarded, but even strengthened. Why, in fact? There is a clear answer to this: in a modern European labour market, the interests of workers and employers must be fully guaranteed. And another success of our negotiations: as part of the redesign, the cross-border models, which have already been recognised as successful, were explicitly and comprehensively anchored and given access to EaSI. As Members of this House, you can therefore vote in favour of the new EURES regulation with complete conviction, including as an achievement of this European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 246, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Parliament for its support and the rapporteur, Mr Becker, and also the chair of the trilogue, for working so competently. I would also like to thank the entire negotiating team for their efforts and constructive approach. The new EURES Regulation is part of our broader policy to help people into a job and to facilitate the exercise of the freedom of movement of workers within the European Union. EURES is much more than a mobility portal. It is essentially a human network that provides support to jobseekers and employers across Europe, and it is key to addressing high unemployment rates and skills mismatches. Of course, while discussing labour mobility, it is important to ensure that this does not become a one—way street and does not result in a brain drain in some countries, especially new Member States. There are more than 22 million people unemployed in the European Union today, and yet there are 2 million unfilled vacancies advertised. It is clear that we can, and must, do more to help people into jobs and to help employers to find the workers they need, within the Member States but also across borders. This is precisely what the EURES Regulation is about. Therefore, the Commission welcomes the timely agreement of the co-legislators. Already today, the pan-European job search network, with its 34 European public employment services, is working successfully. For more than 20 years EURES has helped people to find jobs in another Member State through its web portal and its network of 1 000 advisers across the Union. The new regulation builds on this work and strengthens EURES further for the future. So what are the main improvements? More jobs will be advertised and there will be more effective automated online matching between the specific qualifications of job searchers and the skill requirements of specific vacancies, a broader network open to more members and partners and an agreed minimum package of services to jobseekers and to employers in all Member States. It is good that the EURES network will open up further to more members and partners, also including private employment services. We need to work together across silos and exploit synergies to be most effective. At the same time, those who join must be serious, reliable labour market actors and must be committed to building a responsible partnership within the network. With the new member organisation, EURES should also become better known, since today too many job seekers and employers are simply not aware of its potential. Members may want to promote its existence within their constituencies, in particular in regions with high unemployment or high skills shortages, or in border regions where the EURES network can, for example, provide information on concrete social security or labour law questions that potential border workers are often confronted with. EURES is indeed more than a pan—European job search tool. Through its network across the Union it can advise and assist in finding a job or a worker and give guidance on the many practical questions that still arise in the context of labour mobility. Whereas today the services offered vary a lot among the Member States, the regulation ensures that a minimum package of support services will be available everywhere. The Council is expected to adopt the new regulation on 15 March. In the meantime, preparations with representatives of the Member States of the EURES network have started to ensure successful application of these rules as from the day of entry into force. Within two years we will report on the state of play to Parliament and the Council, as well as to the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 247, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Viorica DĂNCILĂ", "mepid": "95281", "text": "  Rapporteur for REGI opinion. – Madam President, every day more than 1.1 million European citizens living in a Union country cross borders to go to work in a neighbouring country.

One method of encouraging employment and creating human capital is by not only reinforcing every EU citizen’s fundamental right of free movement but also removing possible obstacles which may obstruct intra-EU labour mobility throughout the Union.

In the first case, the process by which we arrived at this piece of work was collaborative, it was sensible, it was admirably led by the rapporteur, Mr Becker, and I learned a lot as a British socialist about where the centre of gravity in this Union lies. It lies in a very liberal, sensible, social place. Social partnership was easily woven throughout this piece of legislation as it could never have been in the UK.

However, I must say at the outset that my wish – and I think that the wishes of many of us – are that the citizens of the European Union find application, especially in their Member States, as this is often a sign that the situation on the labour market is working, that the country is doing well, that they are not forced to leave their families for long periods of time by going abroad to work. On the other hand, however, there will always be a proportion of citizens who live close to the borders, for example, or simply people who desire and need foreign experience for their work. Such an experience helps, improves language skills, helps the transfer of skills, but also personal development, and thus ultimately enriches us all. It is therefore desirable that we can support these workers, make it easier for them to find vacancies and help them to navigate the labour market. It is also important to me personally that we have found broad agreement during the negotiations, and the proposal does not forget the principles of non-discrimination, and the EURES portal will also be available to people with disabilities.

Fortunately, what we have built among all has been something very different: a network that will have to support the fair mobility of workers, with the full participation of social actors and a central role for public employment services. But we know there's a lot to do. Mobility will not be fair if neoliberal policies are implemented that push millions of Europeans into forced migration, further denying them recognition of social rights and expelling European workers residing in another country.  Commissioner, mobility cannot be defended and at the same time, together with the Governments of the European Union, the UNITED Kingdom's attack on the fundamental right to the free movement of workers and the strengthening of fierce competition in the single market cannot be endorsed at the same time.

As an MEP I am regularly contacted by people who are desperate for work and desperate to support their families, but who – even after years of searching – have failed. I do not believe this is because every single unemployed Brit is lazy or unqualified, as some politicians say. So why does the British Government support a strengthened and expanded policy which allows every man and his dog to apply for jobs in the UK? It means that job centres in the UK are now legally obliged to advertise any vacancies they have to half a billion people. Let me get one thing straight: this legislation has not been written for the benefit of the working person; it has been written for the benefit of big business. Open-door immigration is a policy which has driven down wages in the UK, and this is backed up by the GMB Union. The minimum wage has become the maximum wage, and British taxpayers are now subsidising low salaries which employers can get away with thanks to the over-supply in the labour market. The government’s support for this expansion of EURES and the obligation for all Member States to post jobs on the website was just a cynical attempt to make it look like the proportion of UK jobs advertised was smaller in comparison to other countries, but figures show that one third of the vacancies advertised on ‘Your first EURES job’ were placements in Britain. 1 178 unemployed people from across the EU took jobs or training in Britain, yet only 25 Britons under 30 found jobs. I do not believe we should be exporting jobs to other EU Member States, and we certainly should not be paying GBP 55 million a day into an organisation that tells us we must.

The regulation aims to transform the EURES network into an effective tool for jobseekers and employers, respecting member states' competences with regard to labour market regulation, which remained a national competence. My position is that employment problems should be reduced not by more non-EU and explicitly unsklined immigrants, but by strengthening the free employment of EU citizens.

It is estimated that more than 7 million European citizens lived and worked in another Member State in 2013, 78% of them active and 68% of them in employment. However, due to the financial crisis, the movement of labour within the Union has recently decreased by a third. In addition, there is a trend of a lack of qualified staff. In order to counteract the further effects of the evolving trend, on 2 December 2015 the Permanent Representatives Committee approved the agreement reached with the European Parliament on the re-establishment and reorganisation of the European Network of Employment Services (EURES). The aim in itself is to make the EURES network an effective tool for jobseekers or employers. In addition, overcoming barriers to mobility will increase employment access across the EU, facilitating job creation.

Mr President, dear Cecilia Malmstrom, I think this is an important debate that we have this evening. I'll be back in two minutes. First of all, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have been fully involved in the last few weeks on this important issue not only for Tunisia, but also for Europe and for the idea we have of it.  You all know the Tunisian context, you all measure the progress Tunisia has made since the last Arab revolutions. It is basically one of the few countries that has succeeded in its democratic transition and has succeeded in establishing this democracy. He was rightly rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize for Tunisian dialogue. That was entirely justified. Nevertheless, you all know what challenges this country faces. We all remember the terrorist attacks that hit Tunisia. The terrorists did not hit this country by chance, they hit it because Tunisia is succeeding and, in doing so, they have obviously damaged the economy: there is no more tourism, there is an unprecedented economic crisis, there is extremely high unemployment, especially among young people and young graduates , and there are all the questions obviously posed by the neighbourhood of Libya and perhaps tomorrow of Algeria. So we need Tunisia to succeed, and the European Union must help it succeed. It is the spirit that presides over the two texts that we will be talking about now. The first of these texts is very important. It has been presented by the Commission: these are emergency measures in favour of olive oil. I say it is important because it is about getting it done in practice. It is not just a question of talking, it is not about beautiful speeches, it is about being at the rendezvous of solidarity with Tunisia and Tunisians. What the Commission is proposing is quite timely, namely to increase not Tunisia's olive oil exports, but to increase quotas of zero-duty olive oil by 35,000 tonnes per year over two years, without exporting more olive oil from Tunisia. I give you a figure: we produce more than 1.4 million tonnes of olive oil in Europe. So you see that this proposal is very important for Tunisia, but is not likely to destabilize Europe. We have also obtained amendments that provide for measuring the effects of this mechanism after one year and, if there is a problem , which I do not believe, action will be taken. The second text refers to alecA, the free trade agreement with Tunisia. The first round of negotiations took place. Tomorrow we will adopt a resolution on which we have worked a great deal in our committee. Parliament's message is simple: it is not just a resolution that talks about trade and free trade; it is first of all a political resolution, a resolution that says our solidarity, our support for democracy, growth, the economy and jobs in Tunisia. This resolution sets the conditions for success. We are saying that, first, the agreement must be political; secondly, that this agreement be asymmetrical - first of all for Tunisia - and progressive; thirdly, that there be not only transparency, but also that Tunisians as a whole take ownership of this agreement, let them make it their business. That is why I am very pleased that we have had this dialogue with Tunisian parliamentarians in the European Parliament. It is very important to install it absolutely permanently. This agreement must serve Tunisia, it must serve all Tunisians and, at that time, we will meet our demand, namely to be with Tunisia and Tunisians.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 290, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Tunisia and the European Union have been close partners for a long time. Since 2012, the EU has been supporting the young Tunisian democracy via a privileged partnership which is not limited only to trade but encompasses a variety of other issues such as an intensification of a political dialogue and a significant increase in technical and financial assistance to Tunisia. Because it is, as the rapporteur said, very important to support this country where the democracy is fragile and weak and the situation is, as we all know, very difficult for the Tunisian people and the government. Twenty years after the signature of the Association Agreement between us and them, during which our bilateral trade has more than doubled, we are again at the beginning of a new process aiming to deepen our trade relations even further. It is my conviction – and recent citizens’ protests also demonstrate this – that Tunisia’s political success depends on its economic success. They go hand in hand. We have an obligation to support that. An openness to trade and investment can play an important role. So the negotiations for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area Agreement (DCFTA) represents one of the ways in which the EU can support the economic recovery of Tunisia. It will go hand in hand also with the reform process undertaken by Tunisia itself, and I was very happy to be in Tunisia earlier last fall to launch the negotiations of this DCFTA. We are aware, given the current fragile economic situation, that these negotiations are a major challenge for Tunisia. We therefore propose, as the rapporteur also said, an asymmetric and gradual approach to market opening in these negotiations. We share with the Tunisian authorities their willingness to move forward in stages. A good negotiation begins in the first place by mutual listening, during which we must integrate the realities, the specificities and expectations of each other. The EU is ready to accompany this negotiation and implementation with a package of different supporting measures. This package will support the reform process and be conducive to the upgrading of certain key sectors such as agriculture and services, and also providing support to the private sector. I am very aware of the importance of Tunisian civil society. They have played, and are playing, a key role in Tunisia’s reform process. They should also play a role, of course, in these negotiations. I was happy to meet many of them when I was in Tunisia, and we had a dialogue on the DCFTA. I have promoted a high level of transparency and dialogue with civil society, both Tunisian and European, all along the process. Civil society should be provided with regular debriefings after each negotiation round. Close and continuous involvement of civil society will play a key role in raising awareness about the negotiations and also the future implementation. As for the draft regulation on olive oil, the purpose of the measure is to send a positive political signal to Tunisia and to bring concrete, tangible short-term benefit to its economy, creating jobs that are so desperately needed in Tunisia. I welcome the way this has been dealt with in the European Parliament under the work of Marielle de Sarnez, the rapporteur, and all the others in the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and joint committees which have worked with this as well. I hope that this House tomorrow will support the proposal by the INTA Committee so that the benefits we offer to Tunisia can enter into force with no further delay. The imports of olive oil from Tunisia will, of course, have to comply with preferential origin and EU sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. The measure is proposed for a limited period of two years, and it will be closely monitored. Let me assure you that the Commission proposal does take into account the general situation of the EU olive oil market. It is expected that this volume of the quota will be absorbed under the current market situation without any significant impact. So thank you very much for the work you have done on this. I hope tomorrow we will send a strong joint signal from the European Union that we are on the side of the Tunisian people.

There was a vote mostly in favour of rejecting the proposal which absolutely wanted to reject the report proposed by the committee. The committee is therefore in favour of political agreement, but I sincerely believe - and that is why I would like to point it out here - that the interests of the European olive sector, on which many European rural areas, including mine, Andalusia, are not adequately preserved. It is a sector which we cannot therefore forget in the processing of this report.

It is therefore a duty for Europe to help Tunisia in these difficult times, and I fully support the granting of extraordinary import quotas for Tunisian oil. Having said that, it is always our farmers who pay the consequences and in this case I think it is important to strike a balance by taking measures to ensure that European olive oil producers are not harmed by this agreement.  In this regard, we have tabled amendments which clarify this point and which I hope will be voted on in the affirmative tomorrow.

This has been said, but it must be remembered, because it is important for us Europeans: Tunisia is both the cradle and the symbol of the Arab Spring and it is one of the only countries that is now able to succeed in its democratic transition. But of course - and Mrs de Sarnez was right to point out - Tunisia faces considerable challenges: political challenge with the terrorist threat, economic and social challenge with mass unemployment and collapsing tourism. In short, the question before us is how we can help Tunisians in a concrete and lasting way.  The first thing, and this is recalled in the text, is exceptional financial aid. Many Member States have committed to this. The second thing we can do now, urgently and temporarily, is the extension of zero-right olive oil quotas. On this point, I would like us to have a sincere debate among colleagues. I do not believe, given the small importance of Tunisian olive oil on the European market, that this will have an impact on prices or even on European producers. I think it is a temporary emergency measure, which can give some air to the Tunisian economy. Finally, there is this free trade agreement. I want us to say that this is primarily a partnership that is not only economic, but political. And what does that mean? This implies, of course, that it is symmetrical and progressive, it also implies - and here I am speaking to the Commissioner, because I know she is aware of this - an association of civil society at all times, which sometimes has reason to be concerned, and it must be reassured. In a way, Europe must demonstrate in this agreement that it is not business as usual, but that there is a political imperative that we have taken into account and are trying to implement on this occasion.

I ask this because today the imported oil is not easily identifiable and I strongly suspect it after the recent maxi-seizure in Puglia of as many as 7 000 tonnes of North African extra virgin olive oil sold for Italian. The risk is that this oil will not benefit Tunisians, but rather be used by some company that makes money by mixing oils. With this proposal, only agriculture in southern Europe bears the burden of strengthening democracy in the countries of North Africa. Instead, it is the whole of Europe that must help Tunisia. It must help it to combat poverty and Islamic fundamentalism, of course, but we need a Euro-Mediterranean agricultural strategy that values our agriculture and not false forms of one-off support that penalise it.

This sector has experienced serious crises and does not need the European Union to worsen its situation for political reasons. The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa has already put it in great difficulty so I think it is totally useless to add more. As is often the case, the European Parliament organises unfair competition, since there is no import tax. The small producers will again be the turkeys of the farce.

It is a fragile democracy, it is really struggling and the people there have chosen a courageous way, as opposed to many of their neighbours. We know the challenges from terrorism and others that have affected them, but still they keep on fighting, and we as their neighbour have a duty to try to support them. Their economy has also suffered immensely, and that is why the DCFTA has the potential not only to support the economy and a longer partnership, of course, but also a democratisation and reform process, which they are already following. We will carefully work with the Tunisian Government in order to identify the priorities to make sure that this is asymmetric and that sensitive sectors are included, excluded or phased-in very slowly and that the priorities are defined jointly but, of course, listening very carefully to our Tunisian friends. We will involve civil society, which is something we are talking to the Tunisian Government about a lot. It needs to be transparent, inclusive and as open as possible and they need to work hand in hand, because Tunisia also has this very strong and dynamic civil society, as opposed to many of their neighbours. So the DCFTA will have important effects for the future, but it will take some time before we can see the results. Bearing in mind the acute situation in Tunisia, we wanted also to support them short-term, and one way of doing so is the olive oil sector, which is so important for their economy. It was not our idea; it came from Tunisia, which wants us to support this. How can we do it? Well, we do it with what is important for Tunisia but for us is a very modest contribution – less than 2% of our total olive oil market will be affected by this. We have, of course, closely monitored the situation, and it will have a very marginal effect on our market. So I think, honourable Members – even if I hear what you are saying – that many of your fears are exaggerated. We will continue to monitor the situation. It is a two—year thing.

It also provides an opportunity to elaborate a response to the world drug problem and to find long-term solutions in the framework of the international treaties. As an outcome, UNGASS should adopt a short and action-oriented document comprising a set of operational recommendations, and the EU supports such an approach. To be more precise, the EU advocates the following priorities. First, we emphasise that the three UN drug conventions which provide the international legal framework, and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, should remain the cornerstone of the global response to the world drug problem. Indeed, there is sufficient scope and flexibility within the provisions of the UN drug conventions to accommodate a wide range of approaches to drug policy in accordance with national and regional specificities. Second, we highlight the importance of human rights. We call for the abolition of the death penalty for drug-related offences as well as the abolition of other practices which are not in line with the principles of human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, solidarity, the rule of law and human rights, and the EU continues to stress that the death penalty undermines human dignity while failing to act as a deterrent to criminal behaviour. Also, the EU recalls that the application of the death penalty for drug-related crimes does not meet the threshold of the most serious crimes as set out by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Third, we advocate drug policies based on an integrated, balanced and evidence-based approach. Clearly, a balance between drug supply and drug demand reduction measures is needed, and we also call for drug policies to be underpinned by a sound public-health approach based on scientific evidence and supported by objective monitoring systems and evaluation. While the international drug conventions call for a balanced approach, we feel that in a number of states, measures to address drug production and trafficking take priority over drug use, prevention, risk and harm reduction, treatment, rehabilitation and recovery. Therefore a stronger health approach is needed to redress this balance, and UNGASS is a unique opportunity to achieve that. The Union also calls on state parties to guarantee access to risk- and harm-reduction measures, which are not only related to HIV/AIDS prevention but also cover a whole spectrum of measures to protect public health and society. The EU consistently stresses that these measures have proved their effectiveness in improving public health. We also advocate the promotion of alternative development as a long-term and holistic approach to tackle the root causes and framework conditions of the illicit cultivation of drug crops. Finally, we attach great importance to the role of civil society and science, especially in the field of drug demand reduction. Therefore the EU is also calling for the recognition of a role for civil society in drugs policies. These priorities will reflect that, in the common EU position on UNGASS set out in November last year and in the EU contribution to the UNGASS outcome document. Currently the EU is closely involved in defending these priorities in the negotiations on the UNGASS outcome document, and we are glad to see that the UNGASS outcome document already includes many elements that are important to the EU. However, two important issues are still missing: first, a reference to the abolition of the death penalty for drug-related crimes, and second, strong language on risk- and harm-reduction measures. Clearly the EU will have to keep on advocating the inclusion of these very important elements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 331, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission believes that the EU has a very important role to play in promoting a robust outcome at the United Nations General Assembly special session on drugs and is fully engaged in its preparation. The European Union adopted last November a common position for the UNGASS. We are determined to speak with one strong voice, and you will hear that the Commission is very much in agreement with the Council at this session. We will ensure that critical issues for the EU’s Common Position are taken on board in negotiations on the outcome document. Commissioner Avramopoulos will represent the Commission at the special session and seize the opportunity to present and promote the EU’s world—recognised model of drugs policy, and this policy is based on evidence. It drives a balanced approach between drug demand reduction and drug supply reduction and gives attention to the challenges, such as the online trade in drugs and new psychoactive substances. Some of the key issues we will focus on have already been mentioned by the Minister, but let me emphasise them again. Our priorities include respect for human rights and the call for abolition of the death penalty for drug-related crimes, because they do not meet the threshold for the most serious crimes under international law. So, we have proposed from the EU side to organise a side event, during the special session, on the death penalty to explain our views on why capital punishment for drugs-related offences is not a good policy solution – and, by the way, it is never a good solution. We will also plead for proportional criminal justice when dealing with people who use drugs, and we will advocate rebalancing our drug policy towards public health approaches. This is the primary objective of an international drugs control system. We need to do more when it comes to demand reduction, encompassing prevention, early detection and intervention treatment, risk reduction, care, recovery, rehabilitation and social integration, and we are comparatively very well placed to share our experiences and best practices in this area. We will support the draft recommendations on drug supply reduction currently on the table. We want to see greater international cooperation and coordination to prevent and respond to drug-related crimes. Primarily, the focus should be on those having a leading role in the trafficking chain. It is equally important to address the links between drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime, money laundering and corruption. The EU will remain active in regional and international networks addressing these issues. Europol is contributing decisively to this end, offering experts and facilitating information exchange and best practices. We will also call for effective international cooperation on challenges such as drug trafficking on the internet and on new psychoactive substances – threats that concern all the regions of the world. We will stress the importance of building drug policies on evidence, reliable objective monitoring and evaluation systems. We have our own agency, the European Monitoring Centre of Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in Lisbon, which is pursuing these goals steadily. Last but not least, we wish to see tailored measures for children, women and young people. Therefore the EU will be at the forefront of those calling for greater involvement of civil society in the definition and implementation of our drugs policy. We have an expert group of 45 NGOs in the form of the EU Civil Society Forum on Drugs, and they are a constant adviser to us. So, dear Members of Parliament, I am looking forward to hearing your interventions, which we will carefully take into account in our preparations and participation in UNGASS.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 332, "date": "2016-02-24.json", "name": "Michał BONI", "mepid": "124896", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. –  Madam President, Madam Commissioner, the UNGASS Conference will be an opportunity to promote the European approach related to drug issues in order to tackle the demand and supply, also to fight drug-related problems. The European approach is unique, as we have managed to create coordination with 28 drug policies joined together and reinforced by action taken at EU level. This is a model with a special role for EMCDDA, our agency, to do risk assessments, and we should share this experience with the regional organisations. As Europe, we should promote the abolition of the death penalty and the right to healthcare services for people affected by drugs. It is important to change the attitude, not to stigmatise or criminalise people dependent on drugs but promote a preventive approach and build an awareness of how dangerous all kinds of drugs are. Three points: firstly, the integrated approach should be further developed, with cooperation between health, justice and law enforcement, civil society focused on assistance, treatment, education and awareness-raising. On the other hand, a more coordinated fight against organised crime should be a priority as well. Secondly, we need to adjust to the new ways of drug distribution, taking into account the role of the internet. This is not only for law enforcement but also for parents and prevention organisations. And thirdly, we should understand the phenomenon of new psychoactive substances, which pose more and more of a threat. We need a proper early-warning system and the possibility to react much faster.

This action plan aims to significantly reduce or eliminate drug demand and supply.

I have previously considered very much the role and operation of this state, but I do not think that it is appropriate to be restrained at this time. I think there is also no dispute that this state provides intellectual and material support to terrorist organisations. Although Saudi Arabia has recently been in the shadow of the Islamic State in this regard, the European Union cannot continue to pretend that everything is in order.

I do not dispute policies in the fight against social tourism but, in the area of child allowances, I cannot agree that they should be paid at the level of the parents' country of origin if they do not live in the Kingdom.  Children are already suffering because they are away from their parents, either emotionally or in the process of growing and educating. Allowances are also a form of compensation for these things. Parents, who pay taxes, in the UK, have left their children in their countries of origin precisely to give as much value as possible through their work.  British society also benefits from the expertise of people – whether doctors, teachers or engineers – professionally trained in other countries, without having spent a pound in this educational process.
