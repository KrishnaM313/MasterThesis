Today, we are giving our final vote, our approval, to the EUR 672.5 billion European Recovery and Resilience Facility. This means that money will be coming, support will be coming, for people, for enterprises, for regions all over Europe affected by the coronavirus and by the consequences of this pandemic. Our message is clear: help is coming, support from the European Union is coming to those affected.  This support, this money, is money to overcome this crisis, but it is also money to make us stronger in the face of the next crisis. It is money for recovery and for resilience, to make us more resilient to better face the next challenges in the future. Never, ever, again in the future, people and enterprises should be affected by crisis as they have been until now. It’s money to modernise our economies, to make them cleaner and greener, to make them more digital, more innovative, more modern. This is why how we are going to use this money is very important.  Parliament proposes that the money goes in six directions. Firstly, greening. Second, digital. Thirdly, economic cohesion: money for the private sector, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for industry, money for infrastructure projects. This is the third pillar. The fourth pillar is social cohesion: money for the people affected, different social categories affected by this pandemic, including children, including elderly people.  Fifth, institutional resilience: we are going to strengthen the institutions in Member States about which we learnt during this crisis that they have to modernise, increase their capacities. And here I would like to be very clear – countries can use this support to build or modernise existing hospitals, to build new hospitals or modernise and enlarge existing hospitals. And the sixth pillar is money for youth.  We, as the European Parliament, have negotiated intensely in the last months and we believe that through Parliament, the European Recovery and Resilience Facility has been made better. What have we achieved? Firstly, we have managed to offer and agree on an increase in pre-financing. That means that once a national plan of one country is approved at European level, the pre-financing, the support that it will receive, will be bigger – 13%, thanks to the involvement of Parliament, compared to the 10% initially proposed. This means that the recovery will be quicker and more decisive. We will be able to create more jobs more quickly due to the increase in this pre-financing.  Then the structure with the six pillars, which I just described, is also a proposal and an achievement of the European Parliament. We are setting up clear rules for spending the money, but within these rules we are also leaving flexibility for Member States to decide where they use the money. We say 37% of the amount at European level should go into greening and 20% into digital. But we do not impose other specific proportions for different directions because the needs of different Member States are different. Malta is different from Finland, Portugal is different from Ireland, Luxembourg or Romania, and countries should be able to decide, within the European rules, to use the money where they need it.  We, as the European Parliament, have also imposed that Member States make a self-assessment with regard to safeguarding the cybersecurity of the European Union while accessing money from this Recovery and Resilience Facility. In clear words, the money should be used in a way in which the cybersecurity of the Union as a whole and of individual Member States should not be affected. For example, money should not be used for investment in 5G networks by hostile companies from countries outside of the European Union against our will. The money is not for ordinary budgetary expenditure to finance deficits. The money is for investment and reforms, and reforms are a key concept to make our economy stronger for the future, and this is something which Parliament will insist on very much. We, as the European Parliament, have also achieved that there will be democratic control for all of the money spent, democratic control and legitimacy through the involvement of the European Parliament. Parliament will be involved in all of the future phases. We will supervise, we will scrutinise to make sure that money is being spent according to the rules. And we have also achieved, together with the Commission and with our colleagues in the Council, that the European Recovery and Resilience Facility will be revised after two years. We are going to look at it. We are going to have a review, evaluating how things go and see if something needs to be further improved or adjusted. Today we are going to vote in favour of this Facility, I believe, by a very large majority. I would like to thank my co-rapporteurs, Eider Gardiazabal Rubial from the Socialist Group and Dragoș Pîslaru from the Renew Group, for the excellent cooperation which we had throughout this process, and I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of all of the other political groups. This Facility was adopted by a large majority in the joint meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), and I believe a large majority of Members will also support it today. This is thanks to the excellent cooperation which we had throughout the groups.  To conclude, the experience of the last year shows us that none of us, no country alone, can overcome this pandemic; only the joint response of all of us, based on solidarity, will help us. This is a day of success for the European Parliament. It’s a good day for Europe. Thank you very much for your support.

And the first thing I would like to highlight is the Success of the European Union in tackling the pandemic-derived economic crisis with an investment plan of almost EUR 700 billion, an absolutely different response to that of the 2008 crisis, where austerity and cuts were the big headlines. This plan is the right answer, this is what the citizens of the European Union expect: protection, support, aid... because the impact on their lives is being very hard. And this Parliament was very clear from the outset and, as early as May, we adopted a resolution calling for a strong economic response. The long and historic July Council laid the groundwork for this recovery plan to come to light, and during the second half we have been working to define, together with the German Presidency and the Commission, the axes of this investment plan. This plan is a double response: on the one hand, the short-term recovery, with an injection of money that will slow the fall in GDP in our countries and that will revive investments, and whose effect will be felt in the productive sector and in households, and, on the other hand, transformation, resilience, because it is not only about stopping the economic impact , but to take advantage of these investments and reforms to make unprecedented transformations. We have been talking for years about sustainability, digitization, modernizing education, efficient public administrations, but the lack of funding has so far turned these ideas into utopias. So far, because this plan is going to allow progress in these areas in a few years what in other circumstances would have taken decades. The basis on which the July European Council discussed was good: a large plan, EUR 670 billion; a rapid mobilization plan, so that its impact is immediate, and a plan focused on the ecological and digital transition; but for Parliament this was not enough, and we believed that the plan had a good chance of improvement. That is why we proposed and agreed with the German Presidency on a number of points.  First, expand the targets to six. This is how we aligned the plan with the European Union's strategies and priorities: the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals, the European Pillar of Social Rights... The objectives of the plan are: combating climate change; digitization; social and territorial cohesion; economic pillar to support industry and SMEs; health and institutional resilience to increase response capacity and preparedness in the face of crises, and the last pillar focused on youth and children, with objectives such as education, training or insertion into the labour market.  In the fight against climate change we wanted to be more ambitious and for this we have changed three aspects. On the one hand, we have increased spending to 37%. We have also included the principle of 'not causing significant harm', so that no investment or reform financed by this plan can harm the environment. And finally, we've established a new methodology for accounting for that green expenditure, to make sure that spending is real and not an empty amount of content. In the digital field we have specified that at least 20% has to be spent. And in the social sphere, in addition to adding it as one of the fund's priorities, we wanted it to be a cross-cutting aspect and that is why we have committed to making reforms and investments contribute to the fight against poverty, to the creation of stable and quality jobs, and to the integration of disadvantaged groups or to the improvement of social protection systems. The 2008 crisis showed that making decisions based on debt and deficit, regardless of social impact, was a very bad strategy and we do not want this to be repeated. In this regard, the agreed macro-conditionality will have to take account of those economic and social circumstances of the Member State concerned, in particular the level of unemployment and the level of poverty or social exclusion in that Member State, as well as the effect that a possible suspension would have on the economy.  Coronavirus has caused an unprecedented crisis, an unprecedented health crisis, and tested our health systems. The lack of material and human resources has been alleviated by the unlimited commitment of our health and health care, but this is neither fair nor sustainable, so this plan, as it could not be otherwise, will also serve to improve accessibility and capacity of our health systems and to prepare them for future crises. This crisis, like all of them, has also particularly struck women, and we could not accept a plan that did not take this situation into account. In gender budgets and methodology to measure the impact of gender-based investments and reforms, we are still in the 19th century, and this is a to-do task that we cannot delay any longer. This is good financial management, measuring the impact of measures, not only from an economic or social point of view, but also with a gender perspective, so we will follow very closely how to address it in the different national plans. We have worked hard: we have also included the importance of national plans being designed with agents, we have managed to increase pre-financing, we have achieved retroactivity until 1 February 2020; there has been no phrase that we have not negotiated until exhaustion. For my part, I would also like to thank my co-workers, Mr Siegfried Mureaan and Mr Drago-Pslaru, for their work. It hasn't been easy to agree on some issues, but we never quit until we get an agreement. To the shadow rapporteurs too, because they have been a fundamental part of the team, and of course to the Commission and the Council. We have spent many hours negotiating, days and nights; it's been impossible at times, frustrating, but we've managed to come to terms, so now it's up to countries to work to make this plan a success.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 6, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "Dragoș PÎSLARU", "mepid": "197663", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, dear Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis, ‘Europe’s destiny is in our hands’ are words that were spoken in this assembly 40 years ago by Simone Veil. One year ago, when the pandemic hit our continent, these words couldn’t be more accurate. We, as representatives elected by European citizens, have all a duty to deliver a proper recovery and consolidated resilience to our citizens, to our entrepreneurs, to the young people and children of tomorrow. This was indeed the European Parliament’s ambition. Together with my colleagues, Siegfried Mureşan and Eider Gardiazabal Rubial, we understood that the recovery will not work if we are not comprehensive. We understood that resilience couldn’t be achieved without ambition. We spent hundreds of hours, days and nights, thinking, listening, writing, discussing, negotiating, in order to find the best solution to win this battle and leave from it stronger. The RRF, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, is a symbol. It’s a symbol for the story we are going to tell our children and grandchildren years from now. It’s a symbol of the vision that we have for Europe and it’s a symbol of how we can unite behind a good purpose. And this is why we have actually found a proper solution, and we will implement this successfully. We owe this to the next generation. We have a story that our children will be proud of. A story that for me started in May 2020, when I was attending a conference about the early impact of COVID-19 outbreak on children, when I heard children’s representatives telling us that they are scared, that they are uncertain about their future and about the way in which they can continue their education. And many young people that were present there, you know, basically uttered their emotions about the fact that they might get unemployed or they might have an uncertain future. And I made a promise that day that children and youth would be at the centre, at the core of our recovery. How can we talk otherwise about the Next Generation EU if we are not going to deliver to the children and youth of tomorrow? And shortly after, when the Commission announced the recovery package, the one that repairs and prepares Europe for the next generation, we knew together that we should actually avoid that our youth and children would become what is called a ‘lockdown’ generation. And the European Parliament delivered on this promise, with the cooperation of the Council and of the European Commission. We have right now a pillar dedicated to children and youth that is beyond the pillars, the other five pillars that have been actually mentioned already, especially the social pillar that is also contributing to the fact that no one will be left behind. And the story continues and brings us to the present. And this is actually really important to see how things developed, because in August 2020 I conducted consultations in 13 Member States and I was actually talking to stakeholders and citizens and social partners, and this was a big effort to hear the citizens, to listen to them. And that’s why we actually put this in the mandate of the European Parliament in the negotiation. As part of our ambition right now, you will find in the Regulation the fact that we need to consult stakeholders and citizens in the elaboration of the national plans. And this is important and this is the message that the Parliament is sending, and the hope that we eventually put forward should allow the citizens to express their view. Last but not least, this facility – the RRF – is about unity. And European unity comes when we let our values guide us. In the European Parliament team we had different political views, but we stood united and we have been united in a team, and then at the beginning of the negotiation with the Council and the Commission, I specifically said: this is not Parliament on one side, Council on the other side, Commission on another side. We are all together, Team Europe, and we’ve been doing the negotiation in the interest of citizens. And this is actually shown in the regulation. And I am so proud that we acted as Team Europe, and I’m sure that we will act as Team Europe for the implementation. And obviously for having the trust of the citizens, we need to have transparency and we need to have the scrutiny, and we need to have legitimacy and democracy and accountability linked to that. Because we are strong together, and if we are going to work together with the 27 Member States, then indeed we should remember that this is not a cash machine but an instrument that requires full transparency and access to information. 2020 will remain a sad memory about losses, about uncertainty, about fear and insecurity. But the Recovery and Resilience Facility: it’s a symbol, it’s an ambition, it’s something about listening to citizens, and it’s a story about promise and vision and about European unity. And this is right now becoming reality. This is what we want our generations to come to remember. This is our role: to ensure that it’s going to be well implemented. I would like to thank again Siegfried, Eider, all the shadow rapporteurs, the chairs that have been guiding us, all the other colleagues and teams and our assistants and policy advisors that work together. We have the chance to be remembered as the ones that set the example for the next generation. I’m quite proud to present the mandate of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee. If there is one lesson we ought to have learned by now, it is that we are indeed stronger together, and there are threats that we can only take as a Union. This is something that the pandemic has not only reminded us, but actually made us apply in practice. Our unity is provided by the strength of our society, and what society needs right now is the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF): an instrument that puts social cohesion at its core; an instrument that shows how youth and children are a priority for our policy; an instrument that will make the European Pillar of Social Rights become a reality. Because if we are to speak about resilience, this is the pillar on which our resilience relies. The Employment Committee saw that this facility is the solution for citizens, and I think that this paves the way for the ambitious action plan ahead of the Porto summit in May. We have a choice to make, so let’s make the right one. Let’s adopt for our citizens the Recovery and Resilience Facility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "Pascal CANFIN", "mepid": "96711", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

The first is that, for the first time, we are investing together, united, in future investments. The second reason why this is historic is that we are connecting this recovery plan with the transformation of our economy and in particular with the Green Deal: 37% of these investments will be for the climate and 100% of the European money will not have to harm the environment and the climate. These are key results, which make a huge difference and make the United Nations classify this European recovery plan as the second greenest in the world. The third reason why this is historic is that we are going to pay back this stimulus package, not by making our citizens pay taxes, but by making those who today do not pay taxes pay: the digital giants and the big polluters who import raw materials such as steel to our markets, and who do not pay taxes.

First, by adding a definition of resilience that was not present in this text. For us, resilience is about being able to produce what we need to cope with tomorrow's crises. The crisis we have just experienced has shown how dependent we have already become, for basic necessities, on other major world powers. It is, of course, the sovereignty of our Member States that is at stake for the future. We have also included a \"future clause\" in this work to ensure that the funding that will be mobilized is actually used in a way that will produce the prosperity of future generations, which will enable them to repay the funding we transfer to them. In fact, this recovery and resilience plan continues to pose a major problem: we have together agreed on debt without agreeing on the terms of its repayment.

The final result was not so centralised and gave Member States flexibility at the same time as keeping reasonable opportunities to control and govern from the EU dimension. It’s also crucial that we look at the grants part of the RFF, that there should be a new approach from the Member States, not only old plans which no longer fit into reality. It also very much touches the transport sector, where we have a huge opportunity to take the environment-friendly approach to mobility, but particularly taking into account that CO2 emissions in transport are still very high in proportion to other branches of the economy. We should also have to check Member States’ cooperation with our social partners and others in preparation for national plans for recovery and resilience, and also that it should cover all the envelopes. Finally, in the transport sector, we have to remember that the ratification of own resources opens us to access for the Commission to go for RFF money to financial markets, to borrow this money.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a once-in-a-generation crisis with deep social and economic impact, which will leave a mark on our societies for years to come. But the crisis also demonstrated that the European institutions could live up to the challenges, showing unity, solidarity, decisiveness, working together on an ambitious common tool. With the help of the European Commission, the Parliament and the Council worked together to put forward the Recovery and Resilience Facility that will help us to heal our wounds and stand back up stronger, ready for the future. This is Europe at its best. The RRF is unprecedented in several ways. First, for its size: almost 40 percent of the MFF and the Next Generation EU combined. Second, for being the first EU financial instrument financed by common debt, even if temporary. Third, for its capacity to provide much needed stimulus and the right incentives to address structural issues in an ambitious and forward—looking way. Fourth, for its ambitious policy agenda on climate and digital transitions. And finally, for how quickly it was done. After intense and constructive trilogue discussions, we found political agreement on the text, which will be voted on today in this House and soon in the Council. We are very happy to highlight the excellent cooperation between the Presidency and the Parliament to ensure a speedy entry into force of the RRF. Now begins a new journey: a journey that the Parliament, the Council and the Commission will make, together with each and every Member State, towards stronger, greener, fairer and more digital and competitive societies. There is indeed a lot of work ahead of us. National parliaments need to continue the ratification process of the Own Resources Decision. Member States should present their national plans as soon as possible, and we all need to contribute to ensure their quality without slowing the process down. The regulation now reflects many elements that are important both for the Parliament and the Council, such as the six pillars, the European added value and the reference to the European pillar of social rights. Also important is the link with Invest EU, as well as the involvement with local authorities and civil society. The Commission will have to properly take these elements into account in its swift assessment of the plans. The Parliament will also play a key role in ensuring transparency and accountability through its structural dialogue with the Commission. As for the Portuguese Presidency, I can only reiterate that we are committed to strengthening the EU through a swift and efficient implementation of the facility, ensuring a high degree of inter-institutional cooperation. We are also focusing on bringing the RRF to citizens and business as soon as possible, and we count on your support in this endeavour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Executive Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, the Recovery and Resilience Facility is a centrepiece of Europe’s economic recovery plan Next Generation EU. It is key for ensuring successful, sustainable and inclusive recovery so that Europe emerges stronger and more resilient from the crisis.  The compromise reached by Parliament and the Council in December is a significant achievement. It is a balanced agreement that cements our determination to combine ambitious reforms and investments to secure our way out of this crisis in a lasting manner. The agreement is an important signal that the EU’s institutions are united at this time of crisis. Let me highlight some of its main points. The compromise reflects the EU’s ambitions on the green and digital transitions. It sets a binding green target of 37% and a binding digital target of 20% at the level of the individual national recovery and resilience plans. It reinforces the green dimension, particularly by improving the methodology for climate tracking. It introduces new safeguards for digital measures that will help preserve Europe’s security and strategic autonomy. While the discussions on governance were not easy, we found a compromise that ensures that the voice of Parliament will be heard – and listened to – throughout the implementation of the Facility, while respecting the constraints given by the institutional balance. The scope of the Facility has been restructured in six pillars and Member States are required to provide balanced recovery and resilience plans that respond to these policy areas of European relevance. They will also help to explain how their plans contribute to implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights, on which the Commission will shortly present an action plan.  At the same time, the compromise preserves the anchor of the Facility in the European Semester, including the need for Member States to address in their plans at least a significant subset of the challenges identified in the relevant country-specific recommendations. Finally, the compromise agreement protects the EU’s financial instruments by making the approval of the plans contingent on adequate national control systems. Now that almost all Member States are preparing their plans at full speed, Parliament’s endorsement of the agreement is very important. It is also essential that Member States ratify the Own Resources Decision as soon as possible so that the Commission can start carrying out its funding operations. We need to put the Facility into effect as quickly as we can. European money needs to start flowing to Member States to help in their recovery, support their businesses and people, and re-start their economies in a direction that is sustainable and resilient. The Commission is in constant contact with all Member States to discuss the preparation of the plans. To date, there has been substantial progress and we have a relatively clear view of what 18 of the 27 Member States intend to include in their Recovery and Resilience Plans. However, there is still a lot of work ahead. Even those Member States whose plans are most advanced are now working on translating investment and reforms into operational milestones or on complying with other requirements of the Regulation. We are there to help. Developing high-quality national plans with a long-lasting impact will be key to the overall success of the Facility. They will make the European Union and its Member States more resilient. For this to happen, we need to find a proper balance between reforms and investment. The plans also match our joint ambition to accelerate the green and digital transitions. Member States need to include genuine green and digital reforms and investments to match the targets. The plans should not include a patchwork of small measures with little impact. Indeed, they should reflect a clear strategy for embracing the twin transitions and implementing reforms in line with the country-specific recommendations. Along with work on preparing and assessing the plans, the Commission will also work on the delegated acts required under the Regulation. First, the recovery and resilience scoreboard will be the main tool to inform the public on progress in implementing the Facility across the six pillars. Second, the Commission should develop common performance indicators that will be published on the scoreboard. Another important and related work-stream will be to create a methodology for reporting on social expenditure. In all of these areas, the Commission will work constructively and transparently with Parliament and the Council to achieve the best outcome.

And we can't miss this opportunity.  Madam Secretary of State, countries like Portugal should use this instrument, for example, to create an instrument for the solvency of small and medium-sized enterprises. Don't delay this process anymore. And here is a question: when do they provide for the own resources decision to be ratified by all national parliaments? It is that without it there will be no possibility of having this European mechanism of recovery and resilience.  For the first time, the European Commission will use a guarantee from the European Union budget to make a loan for Member States to promote investment, and interest and repayments of EUR 312.5 billion for grants are assumed by the EU budget. These financial resources need to be used well, otherwise it will be impossible to repeat this show of solidarity. So I ask Mr Vice-President of the European Commission: will the European Commission be attentive? Will it oblige Member States to come up with good plans, to comply with regulations? It is that there are countries that are not listening to local authorities, they are not listening to the regions or the social partners and without that hearing, and without that hearing, it will not be possible to approve, the positive opinion of both Parliament and the Commission.

If we do not remedy their desperate situation, we will see a huge wave of insolvencies that will take our productive fabric ahead and make many families suffer. What can we do? The regulation we adopt today requires reforms and investments. The solution of the solvency problems of SMEs and self-employed persons also requires reforms and investments. While it would be the easiest thing to do, investment should not be limited to projects designed for large enterprises: States must ensure that SMEs and self-employed people will also benefit from European money, and this requires one thing to begin with. It requires, at a minimum, that they receive all necessary information; right now they're in absolute darkness. As for reforms, in Europe, from here we have been calling for a second chance for small businesses and insolvent people. We cannot condemn a small businessman to civilian death because the debts have become unbearable. Unfortunately, our insolvency systems make it very difficult, almost impossible, for SMEs to free themselves from these burdens. What changes do you need? First, the European Commission, Mr Dombrovskis, must require countries that entrepreneurs be able to get rid of their debts in an agile and fair way to start over.

I regret, however, that the conditionalities included, if not applied flexibly enough, could create problems for Those Member States that decide to activate the Recovery and Resilience Facility both in the form of a subsidy and as a loan. The basic problem with the RRF regulation is that it incorporates compliance with the recommendations of the Country Report of the years 2019-2020, therefore prior to COVID-19, and this crystallizes the criteria for calculating the output gap contained in the CAM (Commonly Agreed Methodology), which instead turns out to be the subject of criticism from many member countries. In accordance with this pattern, the suspended Stability and Growth Pact would be re-proposed in all its pro-cyclical vigour. On the basis of a reasonable change in the CAM methodology, it is therefore possible to leave the Member States more room for manoeuvre, without the current serious risk of generating hyteresis in excess unemployment and amplifying the fall in domestic demand.  It is also important to point out the constraints on growth due to the next generation EU agenda which, by type of planned investments not calibrated to the real needs posed by the fall out of the pandemic, will not promote the hoped-for growth but strong disputes with the Commission and among the Member States about the level of fiscal consolidation inevitably corresponding to the due financing of interventions rigidly schematized in the New Generation. The crisis generated by the pandemic can therefore be an excellent opportunity to finally reformulate all the economic governance on which the single market is based.  It should also be pointed out the issue raised by President Lagarde, who states that no debt cancellation is possible because it is prohibited by the Treaties. The same cannot be said to make renewals of those government bonds purchased under the PEPP programme perpetual, de facto, while, of course, always using the capital key criterion. It would be a question of freezing sine die of good debt - just to use mario draghi's definition of the debt contracted to support growth. It is a question solely of political will and not of technical impossibility.

We are going to launch the famous Eurobonds, because they are that, \"Eurobonds\", –shared debt to make transfers.  Gone are the years of the Troika, the years of wild austerity that caused us to suffer a much deeper financial crisis and get out of it later. Somehow, all those who for years have been denouncing austerity in Europe can sing victory. With a European Central Bank finally intervening in debt markets and with debt-sharing financial instruments to make investment, today the European Union and the Eurozone, above all, are much better equipped and the European project has many better prospects.  Much remains to be done, of course, and the risks are great. The largest, in my view: too early a reintroduction of the Stability and Growth Pact which, if decided, must be urgently reformed because it no longer serves to tackle and to give perspective to fiscal policy at European Union level.  We have achieved much as a Parliament in negotiating this regulation and I would like to stress this: greater climate ambition, with a new methodology for calculating climate expenditure: with a principle of not harming, which will exclude much of the polluting investments; with greater participation of local and regional authorities in the management of funds, also with new social objectives. I believe that the European Parliament has done an excellent job and I would like to congratulate myself on that.  Now, of course, it is up to us as a Parliament to monitor the implementation of the instrument and, of course, we are going to be very demanding with the Member States. Complying with climate spending rules; that meet gender equality, which is one thing we are concerned about in implementing the plan as well. But we will also be demanding with the European Commission and the kind of reforms, above all, it will require.  There's a lot of work. Of course, to amend the tax legislation of many Member States. After the leak yesterday from Openlux, I think we have a lot of work there. But above all we do not want, Mr Vice-President, is to return to the kind of anti-social reforms that did so much damage to our economies.

Mr President, the rapporteurs and other speakers have already discussed at length the characteristics of this fund, which is absolutely necessary to get our economy back on track, as it is called.

I see this fund as a new opportunity for the Commission, a new opportunity to manage this instrument, to ensure that the quality, sustainability and effectiveness of the projects are guaranteed. I hope that this second chance will be seized, because the Commission has missed the first and great opportunity to propping up that recovery – namely promoting rapid and efficient vaccination throughout the Union.  Do not get me wrong: I fully support European coordination. It would have become much more difficult for small Member States, in particular, without coordination. But that is why it is just as disappointing that the Commission has not given sufficient substance to this coordinating role. Started too slowly, all kinds of manoeuvres which ultimately increased the backlog and uncertainties about contracts – with a confrontation with the pharmaceutical sector as an inevitable consequence. And along the way, they also managed to damage trust. Despite all the statements and apologies, it's really not a good track. When it took office, the Commission set itself the objective of evolving into a geopolitical player. That sounded like music to many of us back then.

Mutualised debt is debt and is being contracted on account of budgets and cohesion policy of the future if we do not finish the task of approving the own resources that can pay it off.  The second good news about this recovery fund is that the punitive regime which has been approved by this Parliament, negotiated by the Socialists and the right and approved by the main groups in this House, has fallen into the Council and, at a time of patting championships on the back, is news that should embarrass this Parliament. We have been pressing from the point of view of European solidarity, it is a pity that the Council has shown the seriousness of this precedent to this House.  One important aspect is that, despite the fall of the punitive regime, there is still an umbilical link to the European Semester and the threat of the return of the famous macroeconomic conditionality.

This law is the centrepiece of the EU recovery fund, and it lays the foundation for something new. When I entered this House one and a half years ago, there was no common European fiscal policy and no needs—based solidarity in times of crisis. When the financial crises hit in the past – and we all know they hit hard – the only support our countries could find lay in unloved and undemocratic tools like the ESM. With our vote today, this will change. The RRF is no ordinary law. It is a political, federalist, European innovation, a game changer for our common European economic policy and solidarity in Europe. Our vote today may very well mark the beginning of a more permanent architecture to raise EU funds and to direct them where they are most needed, irrespective of nationality. This law sets new, unheard-of standards when it comes to investment. It requires countries to address the adverse effects of the crisis on women, to invest in the next generation and to support the ones most hit via its social pillar. It ensures that over the next six years, EUR 250 billion  need to be invested to fight climate change based on an improved investment tracking methodology, while not spending one cent on harmful activities when it comes to the environment. It ensures that over the next six years, another EUR 135 billion will be invested towards the digital transition. But this law is not only about investment, it’s also about reforms. It asks countries to tackle the weaknesses that they have, because we can potentially get out of this crisis with investments, but we will not be able to weather the next one without reforms. So with today’s vote, the ball is in the court of the countries, and they need to draw up their national recovery and resilience plans. But I would like to give them four short messages on this process. First, the struggles we can see in some countries show that these plans need to be publicly debated and scrutinised. You need to involve the public, and this cannot just be backroom deals. Second, all countries need to tackle reforms – also Germany, the Netherlands and France. Third, invest fresh money. Don’t just repackage existing stimulus packages. And fourth, we from the European Parliament, we will be watching, because we care. We will scrutinise every euro spent.

It is rarely predicted by what causes it or when it will come. This time, the crisis was triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The best way to prepare for crises is to keep your own finances in order to be able to afford to revive when you need to. Malinen, docent in economics, sees the stimulus package as a support package for the euro, because unfortunately the single currency, the euro, took away the Member States' own currency. One of the most important tasks of the currency is to be flexible in crises and recessions. This would be a much more economically sound way of evening out competitive differences rather than transfers. In the single currency, the weakest countries will become increasingly weak and stronger, as capital injections will seek out more productive countries. To compensate for this, the state will have to take on debt and once sufficient debt has been taken out, there will be a debt crisis.  Currency courses have two options. The Transfer Union or it will be throwned into an exit mechanism. I did not support the euro support package for 2011, nor do I support this stimulus package, because I am not in favour of a transfer union at all.

But debt is only a deferred tax.  Some talk about own resources. That means a new tax. By using this EUR 672 billion, we must first and foremost think of our children and grandchildren tomorrow. And to our retirees today, who will try to make the bill pay.  More than ever, we need to change this stateless globalist model that is trashing our economies. We must reintroduce national sovereignty in our economic model in order to restore a real local economic fabric, solid, capable of withstanding the health crises as well as the follies of financial capitalism that kills real entrepreneurs and the real creators of jobs and wealth.

It has required great effort from the European institutions and European leaders to show historic unity. As a result, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RFF) can become a plan providing unprecedented financial support. EU Member States will have the unique opportunity both to lead their countries and nations out of depression and to advance their economies in environmental, digital, social and employment terms.  We cannot fail this opportunity. Unfortunately, there are many ways to fail. Let’s take one example. An EU Member State government is planning to spend EUR 2 million from the RFF on creating a digital tool for long—term forecasts for a social insurance system. It’s probably a great and fantastic project itself, but it has nothing to do with either the COVID crisis or with recovery or resilience. It is just a project taken from a shelf at one of the ministries, which can be tagged as digital and sent as an application for guaranteed EU money. That was one particular example from the government I know best, but we can presume that there is definitely not going to be only one project like this across the Union. There will be hundreds and thousands of projects like this, applying for hundreds of millions of euros from the fund.  This is exactly how the Recovery and Resilience Facility plan should not work. We need to rebuild our economies, not to finance doing business as usual. The RRF is designed for the long—term goals of the continent: to serve them, not to serve the short—term goals of the governments.

Covid-19 has also increased demographic challenges, which pose perhaps the greatest danger to maintaining a European way of life in the future.

So if all goes well, the regulation could enter into force as early as this month, with the publication date in the Official Journal likely to be in late February. We could then look ahead to the remaining steps before a formal submission of the plans for the assessment by the European Commission. It will require a great deal of effort both to get Member States’ plans ready for formal submission, and to get the plans assessed and approved quickly. This will be the focus of the Commission. The European Parliament’s involvement is very important and so the Commission is ready to continue our exchanges in the context of structured dialogue. The communication on the Recovery and Resilience Facility must be strong. So I trust the voice of Parliament to support Member States and the Commission on these efforts. Ownership lies at the heart of the Recovery and Resilience Facility. This is why it is important to work closely with local, regional and national authorities, social partners and relevant stakeholders at all stages of preparation and implementation. A key element is ratification of the own-resources decision. And we must not lose sight of this.

This Parliament makes history today.  Several points have been mentioned which seem to me of great importance. Firstly, that the RRF should be managed efficiently and transparently respecting the role of the three institutions. The Commission will have to report regularly to the European Parliament and Parliament will have an important role in verifying and scrutinising the whole process.  It is also important that, in addition to digital and climate transitions, the European pillar of social rights is at the heart of the RRF. This regulation is very clear as regards the social quality of expenditure, in particular in promoting social cohesion and gender equality. It is also important, as has been said here, that the RRF is aligned with the Multiannual Financial Framework and the Next Generation EU with regard to respect for the rule of law and the defence of the Union's financial interests.  Finally, several members of this Parliament mentioned the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. They are the backbone of our economies and without them there will be no recovery. We're in agreement.  The Council is ready to continue work with the European Parliament and the Commission in finding the best solutions to address the many challenges that will accompany us over the coming years. We must therefore have a sense of urgency and work on the implementation of the regulation.  As has already been said, Member States now have to ensure ratification by their national parliaments of the own resources decision and, at the same time, to present good national recovery and resilience plans, ensuring that reforms and investment quickly reach regions, cities, businesses, citizens, making a difference in the recovery of the crisis and reorienting our economies to a more sustainable future , more innovative, more supportive.

My fellow Members, I would like to thank you for your support. The European Union is about to adopt the Recovery and Resilience Facility, a €312.5 billion grant and a €360 billion loan, to kick-start the economic recovery following the COVID crisis. What we have been constantly saying since the beginning of the health crisis – that global challenges must be answered together – now seems to be coming to fruition. Let us not forget that the Europe of our children is at stake. It is therefore of the uminent importance that, as described in the Recovery Fund Regulation, Member State governments fulfil their obligations to develop a recovery plan on the proportions of distribution of supported programmes only after consultation with local and regional authorities and NGOs.  The distribution of EU support under the Recovery and Resilience Facility should comply with standards of transparency and fair competition. In order to fulfil these conditions, the European Commission recently called on the Government of my country, Hungary, to increase the transparency of public procurement procedures and to reduce corruption, so that hungarian households and businesses that are most in need actually have access to EU funds. I would ask the Commission that, if the Orban Government does not comply with these consultation and transparency obligations, the Commission should allocate EUR 6.3 billion to Hungary directly to local and regional authorities and NGOs, so that Hungarian citizens are not punished for the corrupt policies of the Orban government.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "István UJHELYI", "mepid": "124705", "text": "  Writing. – The recovery package for the coronavirus, including the creation of the RFF, is undoubtedly historic in the LIFE of the EU.

I also consider it particularly essential to consult widely in the Member States on the spending of the resources included in the RFF.  I know that there are states where the government is in open and responsible consultation with advocacy groups, civilians and a wide range of citizens before submitting its reform plan on the use of resources.

It is extremely regrettable that, in relation to the use of the thousands of forints of reconstruction funds in Hungary, the Orban government is almost not involved at all. Moreover, it is once again using money from the EU only for its own propaganda campaign, denying that the funds for development are provided by the EU programme.

On 27 January, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal ruling of last October which restricted abortion to cases of fatal defects came into effect. This has prompted a wave of women’s demonstrations in several Polish cities, as was the case last November.  Abortion and reproductive rights are highly sensitive and complex issues across Europe, including from a legal perspective. The European Court of Human Rights has consistently ruled that the Council of Europe member states enjoy a wide margin of appreciation as to whether and under what circumstances abortion is permitted under their national law. But once a member state decides to allow abortion, it has, according to the European Court of Human Rights, a positive obligation to create a procedural framework enabling a pregnant woman to effectively exercise her right to have access to lawful abortion, in compliance with relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. As far as the European Union is concerned, primary law confirms that Union law in principle does not interfere with constitutional provisions and other national legislation of EU Member States relating to abortion. The Charter of Fundamental Rights does not provide an autonomous right to abortion, even though it contains various rights that are potentially relevant for reproductive matters. Pursuant to Article 51(1) of the Charter, these rights apply only when Member States are implementing Union law. In accordance with Article 168(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Union action in the field of public health should respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. In this regard, the European Pillar of Social Rights states that everyone has the right to timely access to affordable, preventive and corrective health care of good quality. Indeed, the EU has no competence on abortion policy. But as a woman and as a member of a government, I would affirm that women’s rights are fundamental human rights and that sexual and reproductive health rights are at the core of gender equality and human rights. Also, the Union has a strong policy in terms of gender equality with a cross-cutting approach to all policies. The Council has in several instances reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of the right of every individual to have full control over, to decide freely, and to have full responsibility on matters related to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health; free from discrimination, coercion and violence. In this regard, let me stress that we certainly need a gender—sensitive approach in our responses now more than ever, and I thank the Commission for all the initiatives and actions included in this gender-equality agenda. The Presidency also calls for support for women’s NGOs in their advocacy role, ensuring that they can access EU funds – including those of the European Social Fund – in the new programming period, the rights, equality and citizenship programme, and other funding and schemes.

The ruling of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal of October last year stipulating that the abortion law is unconstitutional has now come into effect, bringing a near total ban on abortion. Abortion will no longer be permitted in the case of a severe and irreversible impairment of the foetus. In practice, this means that 98% of abortions so far carried out in Poland will become illegal.  The EU has no competence on abortion rights within a Member State. Legislation in this area is up to the Member State concerned. When making use of their competences, Member States must respect fundamental rights which bind them by virtue of their national constitutions and commitments under international law. High-quality sexual and reproductive health services are essential to women and girls and to men and boys, and this goes beyond abortion and includes access to contraception, education and prevention, as well as the treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and fertility and sex-specific cancers. We must take an intersectional approach. Women with disabilities, for instance, or with a minority racial or ethnic background can be more vulnerable to violations of their sexual and reproductive health rights than other women.  As regards the Constitutional Tribunal, back in December 2017 the Commission already formally considered in its reasoned proposal under the Article 7 procedure, that the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal is seriously undermined and the constitutionality of Polish laws can no longer be effectively guaranteed. As the 2020 Rule of Law Report recalls, these concerns have so far not been resolved.

One can get the impression that such a socially important topic is trying to cover up a number of inedibility, and this is wicked.  I will repeat what I said so recently in the European Parliament: no one has the right to be the conscience of Polish women. Increasingly, I hear that Poland is not a good country for mothers, and pregnancy instead of being a state of emergency and awaited becomes a state of risk and fear. When we look at the statistics, we see that Polish women are giving birth to fewer and fewer children in the country, and in 2020 we achieved the lowest growth in 20 years. Unfortunately, this problem is being downplayed.  We know how many women have trouble becoming pregnant. Nevertheless, the in vitro program, which had very good results and was an opportunity for its own offspring for thousands of couples, is being abolished. It closes our eyes to the problem of access to prenatal research, perinatal care, adequate support for mothers raising a disabled child or sex education. No woman will become pregnant because that is what politicians would like. Neither the law nor the social allowance will change that. It is time to create smart solutions that will allow women to choose and, above all, give them the feeling that they are safe in this choice.

The publication of the judgment of the Constitutional Court of Poland and the support of the Polish Government implies a de facto ban on abortion. The decision is made by a court which should not be called that, since it is fully controlled by the Law and Justice party, that of Mr Kaczy-ski, who does not respect the separation of powers. And it is an issue that this Parliament must deal with.  Let's consider something else. With the ban on abortion, we are not managing to end this practice.

The Polish Government, like some parties here in Parliament, does not care that women suffer an incredible amount physically and mentally as a result. There is simply no respect for women's bodies, no respect for women's well-being and no respect for women's rights in these conservative, anti-feminist movements, including here in Parliament. On the backs of women, they are implementing their non-ethical agenda. Less than three months ago, we met in Parliament and condemned this violation of women's rights. But they're still going to keep going. Now we see that it's not just words. Despite massive street protests, the judgment has now been officially passed into law by the Polish government. So the Polish Government is simply completely out of our way. It is a new low in the systematic wave of attacks on women's rights in Poland and on the rule of law. We cannot accept that a bunch of pseudo-tribunals are going to serve in European Member States supported by a strong anti-abortion lobby organisation in Europe.

Unfortunately, this is not the case in Poland today. Last October, the Polish Constitutional Court, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, made an important decision with consequences for the lives of many Polish and European citizens.

Dear colleagues, reliable institutions matter and are crucial for credible rule of law and judiciary. Important decisions such as on abortion must be taken through mechanisms that enjoy the trust of the people, but 78% of Poles opposed the Constitutional Tribunal’s decision, and many have taken repeatedly to the streets to protest it.

And as humans, as dignified citizens, we must understand that complexity, and have flexibility for the circumstances that are not clear cut, like fatal foetal abnormality – where a much-longed-for child cannot survive. Are you so afraid of women that you want to put them through the trauma of giving birth to a child that cannot survive? What made you and the Polish state the sole arbiter of moral decisions?

In the context of Poland, what the Government has decided to do is effectively to force Polish women to go abroad, force young Polish girls to access abortion pills on the internet and use them in the privacy of their own home without medical supervision, maybe bleeding for hours in a bathroom, unable or unsure of what will happen to them in the future.  So I urge the Polish Government to look and decide to change this ban on abortion because it is fundamentally putting Polish women at risk. I condemn the Government’s attitude to this and I support the women and girls of Poland in their protest to ensure their basic human rights and values in Poland as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 124, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "Leszek MILLER", "mepid": "197540", "text": "   – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Forcing women to give birth in all circumstances, an act of cruel state violence, will result in thousands of women facing a dramatic choice and the need to seek medical help outside their own country.

This charter represented the equivalent of what we call the ‘end of the history’ after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The vision of a common space from Lisbon to Vladivostok has not materialised and Russia has not fulfilled the expectation of becoming a modern democracy. Instead, there is a deep disappointment and growing mistrust between the European Union and Russia. Many of the traditional pillars of Russia—European relations are giving way. Conflicts in Ukraine, the situation in the South Caucasus and Moldova—Transnistria are fuelling EU—Russia tensions, but they are also their product; as is Belarus. Russia’s economic ties with Europe have been severely hit by the sanctions. Energy shipments that have been for decades the backbone of the strategic relationship between Moscow and Europe will be deeply affected by the greening of the world economy. Maybe during our discussions we can come to this issue.  Political dialogue has come to a standstill since the 2014 conflict in Ukraine. Since then, the Russian economy has been shrinking. Today, their GNP per capita is 30% less and the adversity of the present political climate makes values and principles a sore point once again.  And then there is the Navalny case. It is in this context that I decided to travel to Moscow last week. The purpose of the visit was twofold. First, to convey eye to eye, face to face, the European Union’s position on matters of concern to us: human rights, political freedom and the situation of Mr Navalny. This I did and they didn’t appreciate it. The case of Alexei Navalny was at the centre of my tense exchange with Minister Lavrov.  Second, as part of the preparation of the discussion on the next European Council on Russia relations, scheduled for March, I also wanted to test if the Russian authorities are interested in a serious attempt to reverse the deterioration of our relations and seize the opportunity to have a more constructive dialogue. The answer has been clear. No, they are not. They are not if we continue to put the political situation and human rights issues in the package. But human rights are part of our DNA and we cannot refuse to talk about them. My visit included consultation with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meeting with civil society representatives, think tanks and representatives of European business, journalists and a number of European Union ambassadors. I also paid tribute to Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered six years ago, shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin. His tragic assassination, never clarified, was a warning of what we are seeing now.  This struggle was taking place in a particularly tense context, and this visit presented obvious risks. I took them. I took them, on the one hand because we condemned the handling of the Navalny affair and, on the other, because it allowed me to assess, first-hand, the challenges of engaging with Russia. I had no illusions before the visit. I am even more worried afterwards. What do I take from my interaction? First, the Russian Government is going down a worrisome authoritarian route. The space for civil society and freedom of expression continues to narrow and there seems to be almost no room for the development of democratic alternatives. The Russian authorities have shown in the Navalny case that they are merciless in stifling any such attempts. Indeed, the current power structure in Russia – I would like to talk about the ‘power structure’ in Russia, not about Russia because Russia is the Russian people – combining vested economic interests, military and political control leaves no opening for the democratic rule of law. The strong pushback on any discussion related to human rights and democratic values indicates that they consider this to be an existential threat. Second, the visit confirmed the long—running trend whereby Russia is disconnected from Europe with little or no progress on conflicts in our common neighbourhood, and, as I said, they are disconnected because they consider our liberal democratic system as an existential threat to them.  During my meeting with Minister Lavrov, the discussion became heated as I called for Mr Navalny’s immediate and unconditional release, as well as for a full and impartial investigation into his assassination attempt. I also asked him if I could meet Alexei Navalny. They addressed me to the court. This was impossible due to time constraints and the fact that Mr Navalny was sitting in front of the court at that time, but a senior member of my delegation met with Mr Navalny’s lawyer during the visit and we will continue maintaining contacts with the team to signify our support.  We also had exchanges on foreign policy issues. I insisted on the need to advance toward full implementation of the Minsk agreements, to fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity. I underline the need to heed the call of the people of Belarus to freely choose their President.  However, on a few issues, notably on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we have managed to establish effective cooperation over the past years. There may be other issues, such as supporting Israeli—Palestinian dialogue, where we could expand our engagement, but the overall environment of the visit did not allow us to explore this further. In my exchange, one thing became clear: there is no intention on the Russian side to engage in a constructive discussion if we address human rights and political freedom. The news of the expulsion of three diplomats on the basis of unfounded allegations came when we were ending our talks and they didn’t come through an announcement from the Russian side. We heard it from the networks. I understood it was a clear message. The meeting was over. I asked Mr Lavrov to reverse his decision, but to no avail. That same night, I issued a statement denouncing such a confrontational move.  Now, allow me to look at the conclusions I draw from the visit. I’m very concerned about the perspective of the Russian authorities’ geostrategic choices and the implications of the action they will have for us and for Russian society. We are at a crossroads in our relations with Russia and the choices that we make will determine the international power dynamics in this century, and notably whether we will advance towards more cooperative or towards more polarised models, based on closed or on free societies.  First, we will discuss this issue at the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 February and at the European Union Council in March. There we will provide guidance on the way forward and it will be for Member States to decide the next step, but, yes, this could include sanctions. I will put forward concrete proposals, using the right of initiative that the High Representative has. Containment efforts should include combining robust actions against disinformation, cyber-attacks and other possible hybrid challenges. Second, at the same time, despite any difficulty, it is of key importance to preserve a space for official engagement where it is in our interest. Russia remains our biggest neighbour. We must define a modus vivendi that will avoid permanent confrontation. Third, but not last, we must find a way to continue engaging with Russian society. Russia mostly forms a European country and an important part of the Russian population wishes to maintain strong links with the European Union and harbours genuine democratic aspirations. We should not turn our back on them. Maybe the Russian power wants to disengage and to disconnect from Europe, but we should not disconnect from Russian civil society, from the Russian people.  We have to find a way to advance on these issues and, in doing so, to preserve our unity and determination. Without unity, there will not be determination and, without determination, we will not be able to address a good policy. Russia has been trying to divide us. They seek to divide us. They haven’t succeeded. On Ukraine and on human rights issues, they haven’t succeeded in dividing us. This seemed to be a clear objective during my visit. We should not fall into these traps. On my side, I will continue defending the need to speak and maintain open channels of communication, looking each other in the eye, especially on issues that are conflictual. Defending Navalny’s rights in Moscow when his trial was unfolding is a way of showing that foreign policy cannot be reduced to issuing written statements from a safe distance, from my office in the Berlaymont or the External Action Service. I think it was important to show our concerns, directly in person, at the right moment and in the right place. I hope this discussion will provide enlightenment for the future decisions of the European Union Council and to look forward to how to handle our relationship with Russia.

The visit as such, High Representative, but especially the infamous press conference, sparked outrage among many of my colleagues in the PPE Group, and you will hear this later. The behaviour of Foreign Minister Lavrov was unfriendly, uncooperative and unacceptable. We duly noted that you put forward several points of our concern: the demand for the release of Aleksei Navalny and the 10 000 arrested citizens, the Russian aggression in states in our immediate neighbourhood. But, was it not to be expected that Lavrov would produce an attack on the EU? It would have been appropriate to address the long list of Russian misbehaviour in response and to rebuff Lavrov’s ‘What about-ism’ on Latvia, Cuba and Catalonia? Russia is the aggressor in Ukraine and elsewhere, not us. Russian authorities have people murdered at home and abroad, not us. Russia secures dictators in power, not us. Things are now crystal clear: no more wishful thinking; no more appeasement. This Russian leadership does not seek dialogue, even less so before the Duma elections. These Russian leaders are adversaries of the EU and want to divide us. We Europeans must now act together and defend our values and interests. We demand a clear message of unity and determination from the Council and our leaders. We expect Member States to allow use to be made of the European Magnitsky Act – you said you will initiate it, thank you very much.  Let every judge and prosecutor playing their role in political trials against opposition and peaceful demonstrators feel they have booked a place on our sanctions list; and then grill the big fish, the profiteers and big supporters of the regime. Let them feel the same: no more trips to the EU; an asset freeze; real anti-money laundering action in all of our Member States. In parallel, let us step up support and dialogue with civil society. Our interests and cooperation were genuine, so must now be our resolve.

Russians have had enough of Putin’s kleptocracy, while ordinary people face economic hardships.  Moscow abused the visit of High Representative Borrell to humiliate and offend the European Union. It expelled three diplomats during his visit, and Lavrov called the EU an ‘unreliable partner’, while Russia is doing everything to divide us. But to put the blame on Borrell for this? Would it also have happened if the EU leaders had taken a tougher stance? But instead, the Council has so far failed to put any meaningful sanctions on Russia after the assassination attempt on Navalny. Orbán prevented the EU from issuing a joint statement. The Cypriot government has been issuing golden passports to Kremlin enablers for years. French President Macron just recently renewed his call for a dialogue with Moscow, and last Saturday Moscow resumed work on Nord Stream 2, with the support of German Chancellor Merkel.

The Renew Group pointed out that the wisest thing to do would be to postpone it if you don't have the margin of action to put pressure on Navalny's release from prison.  Obviously, keeping diplomatic channels open is important, we do not deny it, but an official visit to Russia in such a tense context is also a symbolic gesture. But this visit has, in our view, given the wrong diplomatic signal.  The coherence and strength of the messages that the European Union sends about Russia are extremely important for those fighting for democracy in Moscow, but also in the eastern Partnership countries. You went to Moscow directly in a media trap mounted by Putin's regime, just two days after Navalny's conviction and hundreds of arrests by protesters.  Under Putin's leadership, Moscow too often trampled on international law and the rights of its own citizens. Illegally annexed Crimea, maintains conflicts, organizes cyber attacks against our institutions. Russia commands assassinations across the Union and carries out disinformation campaigns against Europe. I know that, Mr. Vice President, even from the Reports of the External Action Service. You cannot say that you did not know how sensitive such a visit was in these circumstances. By expelling three European diplomats during your visit, the Kremlin has once again shown us, as you mentioned, that it is not yet interested in a constructive relationship with the European Union.  For years we have been trying to build strong, influential and credible European diplomacy. The visit to Moscow, in these circumstances, and its consequences have unfortunately affected the credibility of the Union as a factor of diplomatic influence.

But this time, I'd like to pay tribute to you. Your recent trip to Moscow was, I think, courageous, realistic and necessary. Yes, I am one of those who believe that the European Union cannot have unified diplomacy. You saw it yourself, since your allies were all ready to stick a knife in your back when your movement wasn't even over. Inconsequentic enlargement, constitutionalized Atlanticism, a public desire to return to the Cold War now prohibit the European Union from adopting a realistic policy. So you had little chance of success and it was certain that Russia, so regularly insulted by the European institutions, would not give you a gift. That is precisely why it was necessary to take this risk, to go to Moscow and to make contact with our Russian partners. That is precisely why we had to get out of hypocrisy. If Europe looks towards the Atlantic, it must also look towards the East, at least as far as the Urals, according to General de Gaulle's formula. It is obvious that we are not naïve and we know that Russia will pursue its interests in its relations with Brussels. It is a matter of stopping pursuing, as far as we are concerned, the interests of other countries in our relations with Moscow. To say these simple things is to want a policy of independence and dignity for our Member States. To say these simple things is to affirm that we must stop being the laughing stock of the world by giving moral lessons to the whole world, while we continue to make sweet eyes to Turkey or Pakistan. Foreign policy is a matter of power. The Russian power is here. Germany knows this with Nord Stream. France knows this in the Middle East and Africa.

While working on this, the EU should not keep falling into political traps, further narrowing space for our political actions, but rather strengthen common foreign and security policy. Energy overdependence, divergent strategies of the Member States towards a vaccine, and Russia’s very active role in disinformation campaigns and support for anti-European forces should be on our ‘to do’ list for the next Council meeting.

Unfortunately, the Union's approach to the themes announced by Lavrov has not been heard by European citizens because Mr Borrell has not spoken it.

The visit was organised without proper preparations to prevent traps set by the Kremlin and went under a complete Russian script.  The collateral damage and disappointment about the visit is really massive. Maybe it is easiest to explain through the perspective of EU citizens, those inquiries full of regret and criticism about the EU not being able to meet their expectations that I receive. I struggle to provide my fellow EU citizens with a reasonable explanation of why the first diplomat of the European Union went to Moscow against the advice of several Member States and this Parliament, particularly when the visit failed to open the door to freedom for Aleksei Navalny and to halt the violence against peaceful protesters in Russia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "Patryk JAKI", "mepid": "197516", "text": "   – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab It's time to end this theater of hypocrisy.

I have prepared a list of ten major points for review of the strategy, with immediate, medium-term and longer-term actions. First point, no more illusions about Putin’s regime. Putin will not be different, but Russia can become different. Second, the EU has to impose immediate sanctions on those from the regime who are responsible for the Navalny case. Third, the EU immediately has to stop the Nord Stream 2 project. Fourth, the EU has to move in relations with Russia from the ‘Putin first’ to the ‘Democracy first’ paradigm. Fifth, the EU should put the defence of democracy at the same priority level as the fight against climate change. Sixth, the EU needs to agree with the new US administration that the global defence of democracy should be top priority.  Seventh, before the Russian Duma elections, introduction of new type of preventive sanctions against stealing and bribing elections. Eighth, the launch of justice hubs for the people of Belarus and Russia on the territory of EU countries. Ninth, much larger-scale EU investments into the success of Eastern Partnership countries, which can inspire Russian people. And tenth, the EU needs to have a strategic vision of its future relations with democratic Russia, which could also inspire Russian people.  Based on these ten points, the EU can change its policy on Russia. EU policy change will help Russia to change itself.

The last thing we need to hear from a European politician speaking in Moscow today is a criticism of our ally in Washington. When I see the frustration of the Belarussian and Russian people and the unstoppable force of Lukashenko and Putin’s regimes, I expect from the representative of European diplomacy clear messages about sanctions, political prisoners, disinformation, Russia’s dirty money, and its attempts to undermine the European way of life.  I want to convey my sincere support to those fighting for democracy and fundamental rights in the streets of Minsk, Moscow and other cities and towns across Belarus and Russia. Russia is a regime that kills and jails its political opponents. The European Union cannot engage with it in a manner of business as usual. And, by the way, our messages to Russia also have foreign policy implications for actions in our neighbourhood and in the Western Balkans. Believe me, the fight for the European hearts and minds of our neighbours will be easier with clear red lines towards Moscow.

High Representative, let me say that you were not well prepared for this journey and underestimated Russia's reality, the power structure, as you yourself said today. You may have gone to Moscow with a vision to establish constructive dialogue as some Member States call for it. But it's time to pour some pure wine. Your visit has also shown that Russia, with its current leadership, is not a credible partner, because Putin sees us, in the European Union, as an enemy. Instead of being held accountable for the Russian regime forcibly suppressing the democratic opposition, for locking up students, the Russian Foreign Minister is lecturing us on what democracy in the European Union should look like. And, unfortunately, you watched in silence as the diplomats of the Member States were expelled.  It is not about criticising you today, because I think we are aiming for a common goal. We have missed a chance to show the way to the future for real partnership and dialogue. This journey begins with the release of political prisoners and free elections. These must be our terms. This debate of ours today is supposed to be about what we are going to do for this future. You yourself have acknowledged that your journey has not been successful and that you have learned your lesson. And I appreciate that statement.

Putin is the world’s largest Russophobe because he is afraid of Russians.  The change in EU policy must aim for changes in Russia.

So I will use my own language. Thank you very much for all the comments you have made, for the comments, very different from each other, covering a wide spectrum of interpretations regarding this visit and relations between the European Union and Russia. I take good note of them, and we will take them into account in the preparation of future discussions in the Foreign Affairs Council and in the preparation of the Council of the European Union. However, let me tell you that, when I have been listening to some of you, I felt that the one who had expelled the European diplomats was me, because it really seemed that I was the one who had expelled the European diplomats. You forgive me, the one who expelled the European diplomats was Mr Lavrov. What was in reaction to my public statements on the Navalni case? You may, but I suppose you'll agree that you've done them.  And please, some of the things I've heard about what, according to you, I said or didn't say at the press conference, just, they do not reflect reality, they do not say things as they were, because, clearly, in the transcription of the press conference it is clearly collected how I said twice to Mr Lavrov, who was there, and had told him at our meeting, that we were absolutely, more than concerned, against, denouncing the trials that were taking place against Mr Navalni, the attempted poisoning he had suffered and the repression about the demonstrations that this had generated in civil society. On two occasions: at the beginning and at the end. How can you come here to tell me that I did not talk about Mr Navalni's problem or defend the opposition and public demonstrations? You guys, no, you're not talking about the same thing. There's a transcript, read it. Let's see, what's the problem? For some of you the problem is that the visit took place, that the high representative has decided to make a visit to Moscow. Do you know how many visits by official delegations at ministerial level or higher have there been in the last two years to Russia by Member States of the European Union? Nineteen, nineteen times there have been visits to Russia. So what's the matter, do you have to go or you don't have to go? Or can everyone but the high representative go? Then why do they have it? My colleagues can go, but I can't. Nineteen times. So it seems that going is not something that is so forbidden. Rather it's a pretty normal thing: nineteen times, nineteen times. The problem then is that maybe it was the wrong time. Well, there are opinions on that: some may think it wasn't because Mr Navalni was being judged, and others may think that it was precisely an appropriate time to make our position clearly, directly and personally apparent. It's easier to write statements from my office, without moving from it, certainly much more comfortable and less risky, but to think it's fair right now when you have to, frankly, doesn't seem crazy to me. Someone may think no, that there was a lot of risk, that to see what was going to happen, than better not to go, or not to go now, to go later, when Mr. Navalni would have already been convicted. Well, look, I have had a different assessment and, by the way, supported by the majority of the members of the Foreign Affairs Council: there are not only a few who opposed it here, there was a majority who were in favour. And it seems to me, frankly, that it seems to me and continues to seem to me that, if the defence of human rights and the defense of political freedoms is in our DNA, there are times when we have to stand up and go and explain what we say in the communiqués to make it clear to the recipient. Has that harmed the opposition in Russia? Has that weakened Mr Navalni's position? Frankly, I don't understand why. Then we can discuss whether, at a time when we publicly express our positions, we should have done things differently, and there are interpretations as well; certainly, in the light of the general assessment, I should surely have approached it differently, but I do not understand a joint press conference as a debate or as a pugilato; I explain my position and repeat it, I convey the message I have come to convey: that the European Union is in deep disagreement and condemns Mr Navalni's assassination attempt, the trials to which he is being subjected and the repression of civil society and demonstrations. I say it and I repeat it, because that's what I went to say. And I also say, because that it is also what I have gone to say, that, despite that, there are areas where it would be possible to imagine cooperation for the benefit of both parties, and of course, the IAIC is one of them. I do not understand what someone has said that, in the case of the PAIC, I have been supporting Russian positions against U.S. positions. But please criticize me with foundation, do not make up the facts to support your criticisms. As coordinator of the PAIC board, I have tried to keep this treaty alive despite the defecation of the United States. Russia believes that the European Union is too divided for it to make a firm policy in front of it. And they also consider, and they also say it to your face when you argue with them, that we are an appendix to the United States, and that we will always condemn what they do and we will not when the United States does, because they are our friends and allies; we have two pesos and two measures. And I think that's also something that has to be called into question: we are allies of the United States, but we are not 100 percent aligned with them in all the positions they take and in all the decisions they make, no. There are cases where, if we disagree, we have to say it and we do it. And we do; we do this when we believe it is necessary and convenient to do so, and that is what some people may somehow be surprised by because they have an overly one-sided view of events, but my obligation is not to exercise a fluoric attitude towards anyone, it is to build bridges when possible and to mark firm positions when necessary. Yes, you can believe that the opportunity was not the good one; you might also think it was. It can be understood that the result has not been good, and it must certainly be accepted and admitted that the media interpretation and the majority in this House is that it has not been. But it wasn't, why? Wasn't it because you didn't have to go? Wasn't it because you didn't have to go then? Wasn't it because we haven't addressed the issues we had to deal with? Wasn't it because we haven't defended Mr Navalni's cause and the opposition? There are different reasons, different facts, that we have to analyze one by one if we do not want this to become a pimpampum of which the only beneficiary is the Kremlin, who will be happy to perceive our divisions. Because, deep down, what it is about is acting with unity and determination; because autocratic or authoritarian countries believe that democracies are weak, inherently weak, because of their own functioning and the division that entails, but historical experiences show that this is not the case. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakdown of the Soviet empire, what has become clear is that democracies are more resilient, we are stronger, because we inherently have a unity above our differences, but we cannot let our differences weaken us, and in this case, as in all, what needs to be built, before and after my trip to Russia , is the unity of the Member States and the unity of action between the European institutions. And that must be done, from now on, in the next Foreign Affairs Council, with the guidance and guidelines of the Council of the European Union at the end of March. And from then on we will have to seriously analyze what our approaches are to Russia, for which we inevitably had to talk to them. Yes, and the result has been that it is, if we put the question of human rights on the table and, in particular, mr Navalni's case, the Russian answer is: 'There is no talk of anything else'. You talk about humiliation, but rest a surely it has not been comfortable, nor, for Russian power, to see how someone goes there directly, expressly and personally and tells you what we have said since communiqués many times. No, frankly, I don't think we should go and tell them in the face what we tell them by correspondence; I think it was time to defend, with all our strength and with the strength of the physical presence of a high representative, our position on Mr Navalni's case. Regardless of all the mistakes, inadequacies and any other but that can be found, I believe that if we really consider that human rights and public freedoms are at the heart of our political project, the situation of Mr Navalni and the Russian opposition demanded a strong and strong presence. Do you think I would not have liked to enter a melee with Mr. Lavrov and openly dispute some of his observations? How, for example, to compare the case of Mr Navalni, who suffers an assassination attempt and who passes, one after the other, trials that can continue to convict him for no reason or foundation, with that of any Member who sits in this House and some of his colleagues who are freely campaigning in Catalonia right now? Do you think this comparison makes any sense? For anyone it is clear that it does not have it, it is clear that it does not have it. But I didn't want to get into that discussion because I didn't come to mind, I preferred to repeat the message I went to carry again. The European Union expresses its condemnation and protest and calls for an investigation into the circumstances in which Mr Navalni was poisoned and to be released because his trial is neither a fair trial nor a guarantee, and calls for respect for the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens; and at the same time, yes, it believes that there are issues on which it is necessary, inevitably, to seek areas of cooperation, but to cooperate it takes two. If Russian power has not wanted to do so, we take good note and will have to look for other ways to develop this relationship. Nevertheless, I believe that we have extracted positive elements from this visit. We know better the terrain we set foot on, we know better what reactions we can expect. And for all that, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what needs to be done from now on is, in all instances of the European institutions — Parliament, Council, European Council, Commission — to analyse with intelligence and serenity what our future steps have to be in order to decide to define our relationship with Russia.

Second, we cannot allow Russia to exploit economic interconnectedness as a political tool or coercive instrument.

The war has been raging for almost six years with a devastating impact, 24 million people – which means 80% of the Yemeni population – are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than four million are displaced. Beyond this terrible humanitarian crisis, the war in Yemen has become a source of instability in the whole region and we need to take decisive action to avert a mass famine. The situation can still deteriorate if restrictions on imports of basic commodities and humanitarian access persist. The COVID-19 pandemic has already exacerbated the humanitarian situation in Yemen. And additionally, the Safer oil tanker stranded in the Red Sea is a ticking time bomb that could cause an environmental disaster.  Since the start of the conflict six years ago, the European Union has not only made diplomatic efforts, but also provided nearly EUR 1 billion to Yemen, as a response to the crisis through humanitarian and development assistance. You can be sure that we will keep working to support the only way out of this crisis, which is a political settlement for peace and stability. To this end, we fully back the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths, in support of a ceasefire and a political solution. Current prospects for a rapid breakthrough in Yemen are certainly, and unhappily, slim.  The latest attacks by Ansar Allah showed how challenging the situation remains. But at the same time, we feel a growing sense of urgency in the international community to find a way out. The latest announcement from the Biden administration, ending support for Saudi-led offensive operations, on the appointment of a special Yemen envoy, show a genuine interest from our partners to address the crisis. We also welcome the announced revocation of the designation of Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organisation. This designation could have catastrophic consequences in the context of Yemen, as the country is highly dependent on commercial food imports. Yes, it has to be very clear that to declare an entity to be a terrorist organisation can create a blockage on trade, because nobody will dare to face US sanctions. And this is one example that has to be criticised about some decisions of the outgoing Trump administration.  We strongly condemn the 13 December attack on the new government. The unprecedented mission of eight European ambassadors to Aden, that demonstrates our strong diplomatic support. We are ready to push for a concerted action to unlock the stalled process and to nudge the parties to implement a permanent cease fire and begin political talks. I am confident that progress towards peace in Yemen will also help de-escalate the tense situation in the wider Gulf region. I will personally continue engagement on all these issues, along with Commissioner for Crisis Management, my colleague Janez Lenarčič and other partners, and I am looking forward to working with you on this critical file.

Yemen is facing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises in years. Today, 400,000 children are struggling to survive. The incomes and opportunities of the families have practically disappeared. There is a general food shortage, with millions without access to drinking water, fuel and fuel. The civil war has so far claimed more than 233,000 lives. One problem cannot be highlighted, all of which simultaneously make normal life impossible in Yemen. In the midst of Covid, it turned the country into hell. We cannot ignore the fact that the country has been ruled for years by terrorist organisations on an extreme scale, persecuting religious minorities. The epidemic has further worsened the vulnerability of Christians and other religious minorities.  According to humanitarian organization Open Doors, local officials simply refuse to hand over aid when it comes to Christians. Such violations of humanitarian principles are, I stress, not a religious issue, but a matter of human rights. The Union simply cannot tolerate this. Since the Union has neither an army nor a decisive influence on military processes, and Mr Borrell has rightly stated this here, instruments must be used for which he has a great deal of experience and a long tradition. Europe simply does not need to be heroic or threatened, but the effectiveness of humanitarian action must be strengthened. A humanitarian response developed in cooperation with the locals, based on real needs, should be provided.

We may be at a turning point in the tragic situation in Yemen, a country tormented by a bloody civil war since 2015 and hit first by a cholera epidemic, then by COVID-19 and also by famine. The situation on the ground, in all parts of the country, is dramatic and it is no coincidence that what Yemenis experience on a daily basis has been repeatedly described by the United Nations as the worst humanitarian crisis of the last thirty years. In this context, we can only be relieved that the new US administration has decided to change course, in relation to the disastrous regional policy pursued by Donald Trump and that it has already taken important decisions. In this regard, Mr High Representative, I would very much like us, the Europeans, to be able to act together and clearly affirm our position and our determination to do everything in our power to ensure that a solution to the conflict is likely to put an end to the ongoing humanitarian crisis. In the resolution that we have finalised and which we will vote on, we affirm simple and clear concepts: First, in the chaos of Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates bear a heavy responsibility. Without denying the specific responsibilities of all Yemeni actors, their war with Western weapons and the deadly raids of their planes have caused immense damage to the population, especially the most vulnerable citizens. While strongly supporting the peace process, I believe it is our duty to continue to insist on an effective embargo on the sale of arms to these two countries, to support the referral of the situation in Yemen to the International Criminal Court so that no actor involved can go unpunished for the war crimes he has committed on Yemeni soil and in the meantime consider that the leaders most directly involved can be subjected to the measures under the Council's new human rights sanctions regime.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2021-02-09.json", "name": "Barry ANDREWS", "mepid": "204332", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator is clear in his view that the people of Yemen are being starved deliberately. The UN funding call for 2020 was 40% underfunded, as you know, and this has brought Yemen to the brink of famine. But it’s not just a matter of funding. As you know, starvation has been used as a weapon of war. The United Nations Security Council called this out very clearly: that it is a breach of international humanitarian law and it is a war crime. The resolution today calls on the EU to do three things: to contribute to a sustainable political process, to ensure adequate funding on the humanitarian side, and also to join the war against impunity because starvation is not the only war crime that is being committed in Yemen. There are multiple examples, catalogued by the Yemen Data Project, of assaults on civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, markets and even weddings, and this cannot go unpunished.  This resolution is also unequivocal in calling for an end to arms sales. The EU common position sets out eight very clear criteria that must be satisfied in order to allow arms sales to third countries, and very few of those criteria are met in relation to arms sales that are used in Yemen. I think we have to be absolutely clear about that.  Conflicts in the 21st century are very complex and long running.

And yet, for some inexplicable reason, this issue does not make it onto our agenda. We are not even treating it as an urgent matter, which always surprises me very much.  Let me make my position very clear. The international community has let Yemen down. The High Representative is often content to repeat the UN Security Council's statement, with a commitment to Saudi oversight of the entire conflict and a commitment to Yemen's territorial integrity. This was expressed despite assurances that a Yemeni solution to this Yemeni problem must be found.  The High Representative will surely agree that there is a lot of support among the people of the South for a separate state, and that the only political group currently in serious talks with the Houthis is the Southern Transitional Council. If the talks are to be successful, then all options must be put on the table, including a two-state solution.  Let me conclude by giving you a few figures. Since the beginning of 2015, the European Union has allocated €896 million to Yemen. During the same period, some 3.6 billion dollars worth of aid were sent to Yemen. Is this really a policy from which we can hope for a lasting peace for Yemen?  What is needed is a genuine political dialogue between the Yemeni factions, with an agenda set by the Yemenis.

But it’s also part of the story that this war is fought with weapons made in the European Union. The Eurofighter from Airbus is used to bomb hospitals in Yemen. French Mirage bombers are used by the United Arab Emirates to do exactly the same. Both airplanes are equipped with MK-80 bombs manufactured by RWM, the Italian subsidiary of German Rheinmetall. And the French company DCI is at this moment training Saudi soldiers on how to better launch rockets into Yemen.  So we actually can do something as the European Union to stop this war. That’s why I think the message from our Parliament’s resolution needs to be crystal clear: no more weapons, no more spare parts, no more maintenance until the war in Yemen is over. And I want to say to Mr Borrell that I really hope that the message from the next Foreign Affairs Council will be just the same, because this is the only way we can build credibility, to put pressure on Iran and everyone else who wants to make money or politics with the suffering of the people in Yemen, to get out of this beautiful country and let the people of Yemen sort out their conflicts.  And there’s actually a window of opportunity, and Mr Borrell, you mentioned that. The new US Administration is doing exactly this. They are working on a suspension of all arms deals to Saudi Arabia and the UAE and a diplomatic initiative, a new diplomatic initiative, to end the war in Yemen.

What Yemen got was more austerity, privatisation and land grabs by foreign investors. Ansar Allah put a stop to the plunder in 2014. They negotiated a deal with Hadi and others, making elections the top priority. But the Saudi—led coalition went to war to stop the prospects of peace, power-sharing and independence in Yemen.

In this horrific proxy war, in which hunger has also become a weapon, the gap between necessity and assistance is constantly widening. The humanitarian aid provided by international donors is by no means sufficient to counter an increasingly critical situation. This is a race against time, where the price paid for inaction is measured in human lives, ladies and gentlemen.  Increasing humanitarian aid is certainly important, but it is not enough.

The European Union, which would like so much to participate in the concert of nations, is once again demonstrating its powerlessness and inefficiency in resolving this conflict. Powerless because totally discredited by his naïve wonders at the Arab Spring, the results of which are not a democratic advance. Powerless by his criminal support for the Syrian rebellion. His guilty silence in the face of the destabilization of Libya by Islamist terrorists and his glaring powerlessness in the face of the establishment of Daesh have finally erased his word and influence in the Middle East. The European Union persists in uttering condemnations that sound false and are in fact wishful thinking. Only Member States with influence in the region, including France, have legitimacy and credibility to try to resolve a conflict that is now mired. And that uncertainty will grow.

All powers were transferred to the commander—in—chief of the army. The opening of the democratically elected parliament was cancelled, hundreds of people were arrested, including the President and the State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the chief channels have been shut down and Facebook blocked.  This event abruptly turned back the clock of history in Myanmar. The path towards democracy, which had started in 2011, and the will of the people, as expressed in the November elections, has been reversed once again by the military power. The military has already appointed new ministers, trying to establish facts on the ground. It’s crucial to act swiftly and strongly and in coordination with our partners.  Specifically, I already issued a statement already on 1 February. On 2 February, the European Union issued another statement agreed by all Member States and contributed to a G7 statement. So first my statement quickly, engaging only my responsibility but quickly, secondly, a 27 Member State statement engaging the responsibility of the Foreign Affairs Council, and then contributing to a G7 statement.  Yes, we are currently reviewing all our actions and we have three tools to use. First, to consider additional targeted sanctions on individuals and business owned by the military. As you know, in this country the military are a big economic power and own an important part of the economic infrastructure of the country. Second, to review our development assistance and, third, to assess the use of the Everything but Arms trade preferences.  Our policy response should follow some basic principles: first, to try to effect change, second, to maintain channels of dialogue, and, third, to avoid affecting the broader population, which are not guilty and they should not be punished. We are looking carefully at all these actions and, if the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 February gives the political guidance, we will ensure we are doing nothing to legitimise the actions of the military, while trying to maintain support for the people of Myanmar. The review is taking into account how closely we work with the government and its institutions from a legal, financial and technical perspective, as well as the impact on beneficiaries. At the same time, we should avoid rushing into measures that would adversely affect the most vulnerable part of the population. This often happens when you take restrictive measures. In the end it is the poorest among the poor who bear the consequences. Withdrawing preferences would damage the civilian garment sector, while leaving military business unscathed. Five hundred thousand workers would be at risk, mostly women, so we cannot afford to take these kinds of measures.  Third, coordination. We have been in close contact with all partners since the outset of the crisis. We have engaged with ASEAN, India, the US and Australia, and also discussed the situation yesterday with the Chinese Foreign Minister. We all agree on the need for quick responses to avoid allowing a fait accompli that could last quite a long time. We now need to develop a robust response to this unacceptable seizure of power, which reverses ten years of democratic transition.  This is what I had to inform you, honourable Members, about the situation in Myanmar. I am looking forward to your debate.

To revise a result of an election, a democratic election, on its own initiative, citing baseless accusations and flimsy justifications– that is simply undemocratic. This is unacceptable. It is good that we are calling out together, supporting the people of Myanmar and also working towards and supporting them and calling for the restoration of the democratic situation in Myanmar. But we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. That is why I am very grateful to you, Mr Vice-President, for what you have said. We must keep a differentiated view. The resolution that we will adopt this week on the situation in Myanmar identifies possible sanctions and restrictions, such as the lifting of trade facilitation such as Everything but Arms. It is a possible means of expressing our firm protest. However, it is also important to me that such measures must not simply be imposed in a knee-jerk manner, but we must weigh up very carefully what the consequences are for the people on the ground. After all, the sanctions that we have often imposed have sometimes failed to reach the target in the past and, instead of the military and the parallel economy, have hit civil society and the civilian economy hard, especially. At the same time, a new sanction will further weaken our position as an economic power in the region. We already have just eight percent of foreign investment in Myanmar. China, on the other hand, is already the second largest investor in the country after Singapore. And if we look at the background to the coup and the current developments, I have the impression that China will be preparing for the new situation very, very quickly. Will try to take advantage there. That is why it is very important to me that we enter into a dialogue, that we also make this clear, but that we really consider when is the right moment to introduce sanctions. In this sense, I say 'yes' to a close observation of the situation. In the end, however, blind actionism must not help Beijing and China, but we really must look at the people of the country.

This decision obviously has no influence on the recent events and the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi. To see it as a cause-and-effect link would be to overestimate the diplomatic influence of the European Union, which, by dint of setbacks and ridicule, no longer weighs anything. This is evidenced, Mr. High Representative, in your pitiful getaway to Russia. The European Union, a self-proclaimed champion of freedom and democracy, is subject to the worst fundamentalisms. When it comes to the serious subjects of international relations, it is emotion and well-being that take over. It was this emotion that made you choose Aung San Suu Kyi as the Sakharov Prize, it was this same emotion that made you withdraw it. Always that emotion that sees you stutter today in the face of what you have been unable to predict.  It is this well-being that has made you always choose the same victims around the world by systematically forgetting some others. Your European Union prefers Uighurs to persecuted Catholics in China. She prefers the Rohingya to the Karen people, who have been persecuted for decades. She prefers the Black Lives Matter and their procession of violence to the middle classes, dispossessed of everything. Today, you are forced to slalom between opposing ideological positions because never dictated by the realities and complexity of international relations.  The coup in Myanmar and the brutal restoration of the military junta are of course totally reprehensible. And the European Union would have the means to express it in place of moral injunctions, which autocrats make fun of. Let's use concrete measures. Trade preferences allowing Myanmar to export to the European Union without tariffs under the \"Everything but Arms\" agreement must be suspended. Not only will the military junta be effectively sanctioned, but this decision would also better protect the interests of some of our Member States. Ladies and gentlemen, these events are a new diplomatic lesson for the European Union, which is clearly struggling to make progress. As a slave to its ideology, the European Union cannot give lessons in freedom, since it represents no people. The European Union is not intended to become a voice in the world, leaving it to the nations to defend their interests in a world where they are regaining an ever more important place.

I could highlight the Japanese brewing company Kirin Holdings. I’m sure you may have tasted its products when having your sushi. Kirin Holdings is among those companies that have already been withdrawing their joint ventures with the military because they find it intolerable to be complicit in anything that has to do with a coup. Furthermore, the EU needs to launch an investigation on the Everything but Arms (EBA) programme. There should be an investigation into the trade preferences. Are they benefiting the Myanmar military’s conglomerates or ordinary people? I have no opinion on the outcome of this investigation as standing rapporteur in the Committee on International Trade, but I think it’s urgent to do that investigation.

In a number of resolutions throughout the last few years we have, for instance, strongly condemned all past and present human rights violations, especially against the Rohingya population.

I call upon the military to respect human rights and the rule of law, and I call upon the military to release all those unjustly detained.

The lack of news of the president-elect in last November's free and democratic elections, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the arrest of hundreds of political leaders are a cause for concern. The introduction of martial law in the country's major cities is a cause for concern, a decision taken with the sole purpose of suppressing the protests that are filling the streets throughout the country, causing numerous injuries hit by rubber bullets and tear gas. This escalation, which threatens to undermine the fragile path to complete democracy, is a cause for concern. Above all, however, the role of China, which on many sides is referred to as the true director who brought General Min Aung Hlaing to power, is a cause for concern, and the veto in the UN Security Council of China itself only increases these suspicions. It is well known that China is implementing a strategy of global hegemony in trade, finance and military terms, and access to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean via Myanmar fits perfectly into this context. The deliberate lack of transparency on the management of COVID to the detriment of the entire global economy, the violent repression of Hong Kong, the questionable management of human rights and the continuous aggressive attitude on the commercial level require a strong, cohesive and rapid response from the whole West.

The grave situation and the grave regression in human rights caused by the military coup – if not now, when? Some of you have asked that. But look, the EBA withdrawal is certainly a powerful instrument, which can foster positive change in partner countries. With Myanmar, it was actually delivering some, although limited, positive results, notably on social and labour rights. But the power of this instrument lies in the threat of the withdrawal – not in the withdrawal itself but in the threat, for example, in the process of monitoring before the actual decision is initiated. But take care because the EBA is a blunt instrument. Inasmuch as it affects the economy or at least the economic sector widely, even if used to cover only some specific tariff lines, it is not the best suited to be applied surgically to target specific individuals, companies or business interests. In the case of Myanmar, the aim is to target military interests as they are responsible for the current situation, not the whole economy.  According to the information available, military interests are focused on sectors that would not be affected by EBA preferences. In fact, most of Myanmar’s exports under the EBA regime are in the clothing sector, which employs more than 500 000 workers, mostly female workers, poor people. If we take this decision, they will suffer, not the military. In sum, withdrawing the EBA preferences would hit Myanmar’s economy hard, putting half a million low skilled workers at risk of poverty and leaving military interests almost untouched. Is that what we want? No. So take care when you ask to use some elements of our toolbox.  Another issue that has been raised by honourable Members is how the European Union should review its policy towards Myanmar if the legitimate government is not restored. It’s a legitimate question but, at present, our policy has two short—term objectives. Let’s concentrate on them: the immediate and unconditional release of those jailed because of the coup and the development of some form of dialogue. That’s what we should be focusing on. The policy options I outlined in my intervention are aimed at driving change in the short term in order to avoid the military government becoming a fait accompli and it becoming impossible to get rid of them.  There have been other military rules in Myanmar and these previous military rules lasted over five decades – five decades, 50 years, half a century – despite strong sanctions from almost the entire world. This shows that sometimes sanctions don’t work. We have to avoid repeating this situation. Our key objective remains to restore dialogue.  Incidentally, the need for dialogue was also the key message given by the respected Cardinal Bo, and it’s clear that the current crisis emerged from the military’s reluctance to cede power to the civilian side, but also from the breakdown of all channels of dialogue between the civilian and the military.  Dialogue has to be restored. There are many people who believe that dialogue is bad and you should not talk with the bad people. Well, sometimes you have to talk with the bad people precisely because they are bad people.  If the situation does not change, we will reassess the situation and re—examine our toolbox, having in mind the same principles I outlined before: be strong to affect change, and be careful to avoid undue impact on the general population and the most vulnerable. On the third issue, Ms Rookmaker asked me if I believe it’s good to coordinate with the US. Yes, for sure. In Myanmar we, the European Union, cannot seriously pretend to create the dynamics of change without coordination with the big powers, and the big powers there are the US, China and ASEAN.  From the outset, we, the European Union and our External Action Service and I, have been striving to coordinate this action and consult with as many relevant parties as possible. Naturally, we were closely involved in working with our G7 partners, but not only the traditional ones: the US, the UK, Canada, Norway and Australia. We also wanted to engage with other relevant stakeholders – India, China, ASEAN – and, in the case of the Rohingya crisis, the military coup in Myanmar is, first and foremost, a regional security issue. In addition to the humanitarian crisis, it’s a regional security issue and regional countries have the right and the duty to be first in line to respond. But this response has not been overwhelming. China, as you could have expected, did not even qualify the event as a coup, but a major government reshuffle. A reshuffle – you know, they change the government and it’s just a reshuffle. ASEAN was not able to reach consensus on any statement and resorted to a statement of the Chair. I know that sometimes it is difficult to get an agreement and it is the Chair who has to take responsibility, but is not the same thing. Brunei, for example, with very toned down language, was in in fact agreeing with Myanmar. In ASEAN the principle of non—interference in the internal affairs of other countries prevails.  There were many other issues. I would be delighted to continue answering them, going deeply into the subject. For example, should we, the European Union and the Member States, recall our ambassadors from Myanmar? Yes, it would send a strong signal, but I do not favour recalling our ambassadors. It would cut our channels of communication at a moment where we should facilitate dialogue. Once again, don’t lose the possibility of keeping dialogue open, even with the evil. It would also reduce our capacity to appraise the situation on the ground and our ability to gather information, but this is something that has to be checked permanently in order to fine-tune our tools to the situation.  There are many issues. Why do we, the European Union, only deploy a small electoral mission instead of a fully-fledged observation mission? You know how important our electoral observation missions are and how much I praise the work that we are doing there. The civil servants of this House and the Members of this House engage in these kinds of activities. However, the COVID—19 pandemic and the strict lockdown in Myanmar prevented the deployment of a fully—fledged exploratory mission, which, as you know, is a prerequisite for the observation mission.  But we were nevertheless able to engage with all relevant stakeholders and they are finalising their report. Our reporter will very much take into account what is happening in Rakhine State. The elections where they are open to the participation of the Rohingya and to the Rakhine people, but the actual result would have most likely further eroded the share of the military—backed party, if they could participate fully. In a nutshell, we have been a strong supporter of Myanmar’s democratic transition in the last 10 years. Yes, we had strong disagreements with the civilian government, notably after the 2017 events against the Rohingya, but we will not stop advocating for the return of the government and for holding the perpetrators of the worst human rights violations accountable. We are calling for national democracy to be upheld by Myanmar. With all its shortcomings, Myanmar remains a positive experiment in the region and we have to help them by acting strongly, quickly and in coordination with all our partners.  Thank you very much for your attention and thank you for holding this debate on something which is far away from us geographically but, once again, close to our minds and principles if we really want to be considered an institution that has human rights as the basis of its behaviour.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which (The speaker speaks in a language which is not an official language) Ukraine has chosen the European path. How do you support this? With the Association Agreement, we have established a comprehensive cooperation that leads to results step by step. If the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens are concerned, this path is irreversible. Only the prospect of a European way of life holds the promise of stable democracy, a fair rule of law and personal economic and social progress. Strong civil society and genuine reformers in politics are making every effort to realise the hopes of their citizens. On the other hand, there are menacing challenges. From the outside, Russia is the constant aggressor with the occupation and annexation of Crimea, which is contrary to international law, and the conquest and occupation of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, which goes hand in hand with a ceasefire that does not deserve the name. Just last Saturday, two Ukrainian soldiers were killed again. We are now mourning more than 13 000 civilian and military deaths, well over a million internally displaced persons and a largely lawless population, which is subject to arbitrariness of Russian-controlled henchmen in the occupied territories. Within Ukraine, Russia is practicing a diverse, open and covert hybrid warfare with allies in politics, business, and the media. That is why I would like to make it clear, for the current occasion, that there is a great deal to be said that the closure of three television stations belonging to a straw man under Mr Medvedchuk's control is not about curtailing the diversity of opinion, but about preventing continued media destabilisation in the interests and mission of Russia. There is plenty of room and reason in Ukraine for criticism of the president, the government and Verkhovna Rada. For this, Ukrainian democracy does not need media platforms that want to hand the country over to the Kremlin's revisionist interests. Ukraine has come an astonishing path since the revolution of dignity. Our support, including our financial support, is well-invested. We also provide comprehensive human resources in advising in a wide range of areas of business and administration. Our aim is simply to establish a democratic state that functions perfectly normally according to the law. There is very broad, fundamental support for this policy here in the European Parliament. Real friends support each other, but also tell each other the truth and the criticism when things get difficult. The real reformers know that we do not give good advice in our interests, but because we want to strengthen it and contribute to its success – also to defend against their enemies. There is an urgent need for action to combat corruption. We support NABU, the national anti-corruption office, and similarly independent institutions. They must not be hindered in their work. We support the Work of the High Anti-Corruption Court, which must set an example with its judgments for a fundamentally reformed judiciary, including prosecutors, sooner rather than later. The High Council of Justice must be reformed, as must the High Qualification Commission of Judges, which selects new judges and judges them in office. Without them, the whole reform process can be blocked. The system of electronic declaration of assets is effective and must not be undermined by a constitutional court working against the reforms. Decentralisation, coupled with municipal reform, is on the way to a great success story. It must not be jeopardised by unclear hierarchies or competing competences. The release of trade in agricultural land opens up great potential for rural development, even if the downstream economy is developed and the value chain is deepened by small and medium-sized enterprises. If the second stage of health reform fails, it is not so much the concept of reform that is the case with particular interests that want to channel certain financial flows into their pockets. Environmental protection must be an instrument for preserving Ukraine's great natural treasure and for using it carefully and sustainably. That is why we need the protection of the primeval forests in the Carpathians, the much more determined fight against illegal deforestation and the prevention of destructive tourism, and the development of ecological, sustainable tourism. Dear President Selensky, Olympic Games as in Russia, which fill the coffers of oligarchs and only a straw fire do not belong to Svydivez and not to Borshawa.  Ladies and gentlemen, our report identifies many other details in which we want to deepen the association. I would therefore like to thank you for good and trusting cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, colleagues in the Foreign Affairs and Trade Committee, in the Parliamentary Association Committee and other committed Members and officials in the European Parliament and also in the Verkhovna Rada. A big compliment to you, dear Valdis. This praise goes to the Support Group for Ukraine and the External Action Service. We all work together for a good cause, a stable, democratic and European Ukraine.

The EU has stood by Ukraine since Russia began its military aggression and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Ukraine remains high on the European agenda. We continue to provide political, financial and technical assistance as support for its reform agenda to build a more resilient economy. We have stepped up support, especially during this crisis, where the EU is showing solidarity with Ukraine during the pandemic. Our support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders has been steadfast since the aggression began in the country’s southern and eastern regions. The ceasefire that has been largely holding – although with a recent spike in violence, but it has been largely holding since July – is an undeniable breakthrough. It brings tangible improvements on the ground. However, the overall pace of progress towards a peaceful and sustainable resolution of the conflict remains too slow. While Ukraine must be praised for its constructive approach and President Zelensky’s efforts, Russia must reciprocate. The EU expects Russia to use its considerable influence over the armed formations that it backs, as there is no place in 21st century Europe for using force to alter the boundaries of a sovereign country. Enforcement of our sanctions in response to the undermining of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity by Russia is consistent and unwavering. Sectoral sanctions were rolled over in December 2020 by the European Council. The duration of these sanctions against Russia remains linked to complete implementation of the Minsk Agreements. The individual sanctions regime has only become wider over the years, in response to further Russian undermining of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The sanctions regime targeting the Crimean Peninsula is also consistently enforced. We have also put a new sanctions regime in place that allows the Council to impose asset freezes and travel bans on persons it deems to have committed serious human rights violations. If Member States call for it we are ready to make use of the EU global human rights sanctions regime against Russia. The EU stands firmly by Ukraine on its reform path, providing unprecedented financial and technical support. We are supporting Ukraine with a new market, a financial assistance programme worth EUR 1.2 billion to help mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. Its first tranche of EUR 600 million was disbursed in early December.  The EU Ukraine Association Agreement is an unique platform for Ukraine to advance on its reform path, bringing our economies and societies closer together. The agreement is producing results. Our bilateral trade saw many years of uninterrupted growth stimulated by the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. The pandemic set back this development last year, but we hope to return to positive tendencies soon. The agreement has an immense potential, and the EU is ready to explore all possibilities to continue enhancing our sectoral cooperation and economic integration.  As you rightly indicated in the report, implementing the agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, must remain a top priority. We will discuss the next steps for developing our bilateral relations in the post—pandemic period at this week’s EU—Ukraine Association Council.  Tomorrow, Prime Minister Shmyhal and I will also launch the process for review of trade liberalisation for goods, which is foreseen under Article 29 of the Association Agreement, five years after its entry into force. The EU also stands by Ukraine in fighting the pandemic. We have reoriented several ongoing and future assistance programmes, with more than EUR 190 million going to Ukraine to help meet its COVID—19—related needs. The EU has also deployed the Civil Protection Mechanism to transfer equipment and supplies to Ukraine.  In addition, we are exploring options to help Ukraine to receive early access to vaccines. As part of the COVAX programme, Ukraine will receive 170 000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in February and 2.2 million to 3.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine during the first half of the year.  We are looking forward to see vaccinations start in Ukraine this month. However, we are concerned about the impact of Russian disinformation and about the vaccination process in Ukraine. We are ready to assist in the fight against this disinformation and vaccine scepticism.  Parliament’s report strikes a very fine and accurate balance in praising achievements and acknowledging shortcomings. It rightly highlights that Ukraine has delivered many important reforms over the past years. These have all been hard fought and Ukraine’s leadership should be praised. However, I share your assessment that, despite notable progress, widespread corruption continues to hamper Ukraine’s reform process. Its key institutions must have strong and independent leadership and a chance to do their work free of political, economic or other interference.  As the report says, smuggling only benefits criminals and oligarchs. It must be stopped. For this, it is vital that National Anti—Corruption Bureau be fully independent. Over the years, the Bureau has demonstrated its effectiveness and produced tangible results. The fight against corruption is a core condition for EU macro—financial support.  Recent developments in the rule of law and anti-corruption show that comprehensive judiciary reform is long overdue. The Venice Commission and a G7 roadmap complementing the EU delegation’s constant advice to authorities and politicians give clear guidance on what has to be done. We recognise the complexity of the task.  From the start, Russian interference was designed to destabilise, divide and weaken Ukraine. So the best response is to stay united and keep working towards the prosperity and stability that come from sound economic policies. The EU is ready to support Ukraine in doing this.  We urge all reform—oriented political factions to come together and give a clear signal of Ukraine’s determination to make its reform path irreversible. This will be one of the main messages that I will convey to Prime Minister Shmyhal tomorrow.  The EU is helping Ukraine to create the right conditions for prosperity and peace. Ukraine has our support – political, financial and technical.

Unfortunately, the developments of the last year show that, in addition to the Covid epidemic and the economic situation, there are serious problems to which the EU should react decisively.  I am thinking here of the spread of extremist views and methods, restrictions on freedom of media and opinion, unprecedented political pressure on the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia and constant intimidation. The excesses of the Ukrainian security services against Hungarian organizations and their leaders, or the death list of the extremist site Mirotorec.  The Hungarian community in Transcarpathia has been subject to language, education and representation restrictions for years and is treated as an enemy, even though the current minority law and the constitution guarantee wide rights for national minorities. The Hungarian community in Ukraine wants nothing more than to preserve their existing rights, to participate as partners in the legislative process affecting minorities and to live peacefully in their homeland. He has been receiving great help from the Hungarian Government for many years, which also proves that the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia plays the role of bridge not only in the relationship between the two countries, but also in the EU.

In 2013, it was a form of fanaticism that took over the Commission. It went against all the historical, cultural and political evidence and wanted Ukraine to immediately sign an association agreement which had the main objective of keeping Kiev away from Russia. It was to ignore the importance of the links between a part of the Ukrainian population and Russia, especially in Crimea and the Donbass. Since 2013, the European Union has squandered European money for ideological objectives unrelated to the country's reality. As our colleague Mike Wallace demonstrated in committee, behind the generosity of the Commission lies in fact a more sordid reality. Privatization of agricultural land, privatization of forests and the prudent liberalisation of the Ukrainian economy are the counterparts that globalism imposes on the Ukrainian people. The conclusion will be bitter for this people. Ukraine was to be a link between Western Europe and Russia. Instead, this country is under infusion of European public money, which we know is being used without serious control. Hundreds of millions of euros of loans were disbursed, without any consideration, for COVID-19. Since 2013, the European Union has not enriched the country. It has increased the rent of the oligarchs.

I make it clear that more than half a million Romanian speakers live in Chernivtsi, Odessa and Transcarpathia.  The solution to ending this social dispute between minorities in the territory of Ukraine and the political power in Kiev is the immediate annulment of articles of the Education Law that prohibit or limit teaching in the language of minorities.

During the visit of The Minister for Temporary Occupied Territories of Ukraine Olexi Reznikov to Croatia last October, the Croatian Government emphasized its support for territorial integrity, also the European path of Ukraine. Croatia also expressed its readiness to share the experiences of the peaceful reintegration of the Croatian Danube into the constitutional order of the Republic of Croatia in January 1998.  Despite the positive progress we have seen after the summit of leaders of the Eastern Partnership countries, Member States and European institutions within the Framework of the Croatian Presidency of the Council, which took place in Zagreb last June, problems remain that remain a strong challenge to the future progress of our relations.  More tools are needed to encourage crucial reforms, and we see this in particular in the example of the Countries of the Western Balkans and here ukraine. We see and warn about the problem of corruption, the difficult consolidation of the rule of law, the implementation of socioeconomic reforms and the strengthening of the role of citizens in a democratic society. With growing geopolitical turmoil in the region, but also across the European Union's neighbourhood, further strengthening our partnership with Ukraine should be one of our foreign policy objectives.
