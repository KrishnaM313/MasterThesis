Mr President, Brexit means Brexit like Theresa May said. But Brexit also means making choices about our future relationship. We want a deal but not at any cost. The European Council was extremely clear, we are 100% united and we expressed our unwavering support to our chief negotiator Michel Barnier and we re-confirmed all the principles of his mandate. In fact, we face three extremely difficult issues: the level playing field; governance; fisheries, and we need to find solutions in line with our principles. On the level playing field it's a matter of the integrity of the single market, a question of fair competition. Our UK friends say they want to maintain the highest standards. If that's the case, why don't they commit to them? We don't need words, we need guarantees. The same goes for governance; the internal market bill, which clearly violates the withdrawal agreements, reminds us just how important this is. What's the point of negotiating, signing and ratifying an international agreement if it is not implemented in full? In case of violation of the agreement we need to be able to bring the dispute to binding independent arbitration and get a swift resolution. Lastly on fisheries. Brexit was not our decision and it was not our fishermen's decision. Stopping access to UK water would cause extraordinary damage to our fishing fleets. Yes, we want to keep access to UK waters for fishermen, exactly like the UK wants to keep access to a huge and diversified markets for its companies.  Mr President, dear Members of Parliament, in June 2016 the United Kingdom took a democratic decision to leave the European Union. We respected this sovereign decision in 2016, and we respect sovereignty now, UK sovereignty now. Our UK friends say they want an ambitious and close relationship. We welcome this because we want the same, but the UK wants access to a single market while at the same time being able to digress from our standards and regulations when it follows them.  You can't have the butter, the butter money and the creamer's smile. You can't have your cake and eat it too. In fact, the United Kingdom now has an important choice to make about its own future. It's not about choosing a negotiation tactic, it's about choosing the model of society, the model of economy for their own future. Do our British friends want to regulate state aid? And do they want to maintain high standards in health, food security or climate, in close relationship with Europe? If so, why not commit to them in our future agreement?  Ladies and gentlemen, we are determined to ensure that all businesses - British, Chinese, European or from anywhere - follow the same principles when operating in our market. It's only fair.  Time is very short and we stand ready to negotiate 24/7 on all subjects, based on legal texts. The UK has a big decision to make. It's their free and sovereign choice and we will always respect them whatever choice they make but that sovereign answer will determine the level of access to our internal market, this is just common sense. We want a deal that is fair and balanced but we are also ready in case of no-deal.  Ladies and gentlemen, our strategy 'with Africa and not for Africa' was another important topic of our meeting. We need more than a partnership with Africa. We need a new alliance with this continent. Africa is more than just a neighbour. Africa is a natural partner because of our geography, our history and our cultures. Today, our two continents are more interdependent than ever and there is enormous potential for even greater cooperation. We need to harness the vast opportunities for the benefit of people on both continents and the economic dimension of a partnership will be key. Investments and financing would be crucial in the digital and knowledge economy, in renewable energy and in transport, health, agri-food systems.  One word on debt relief - we fully support international efforts on debt relief, especially in the context of G20, and we are ready to intensify talks in order to deliver on that, but all global players should do their part. We also stand ready to further support efforts on rule of law, peace and security, good governance and, of course, human rights. We want to work with our African partners on mobility and addressing all aspects of migration. We want a mutually beneficial partnership that's balanced and comprehensive, guided by the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility and we stand ready to step up cooperation in the multilateral organizations and fora. We will complete it together with our African partners at our next meeting with the African Union later this year.  We also had an orientation debate on climate. We want climate neutrality by 2050, as we decided last year, and to get there we need to update our 2030 target. We discussed the Commission's 2030 climate proposal, including the emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030 and we'll come back to this topic in December.  We will come back to this subject in December, our aim being to reach an agreement on this subject at The European Council level before the end of the year. It will be a difficult debate, we measure it well. We will have to take into account the different starting points and circumstances in different countries, but keep in mind this ambition to make the Green Pact for Europe the engine for development, the engine for prosperity and well-being in Europe and, more broadly, in the world. It is also the meaning of climate diplomacy that we are trying to activate with great force and ambition. Colleagues, as you know, not only has COVID-19 not disappeared, but we are even dealing with the second wave and it is brutal. It is painful, once again, for the victims, for their families, for carers, all over Europe, for all those who are directly mobilized to deal with this hard crisis that is hitting the world and which is also hitting Europe. As you have seen, in several European countries, severe restrictive measures have again had to be taken to contain the spread of the virus. We had an intense debate on the subject, we felt that we should continue to significantly strengthen efforts for more cooperation and coordination at the European level. That we must try to make progress in order to improve the capacity to deal together with the issue of travel within the European Union; cooperating to try to harmonize quarantine issues and having rules that are more coherent between European countries on the subject and above all - this is, in my opinion, the key issue for the coming weeks, probably in the coming months, pending a vaccine that can make a lasting difference, on the issue of testing and the issue of tracing. fundamental and extremely important. We had the opportunity to have an exchange fuelled by the work of the Commission and by the work of the German rotating presidency. We agreed that very regularly, including through videoconferences at the heads of state or government level, we would come back to this subject to try to provide the right impetus for projects to be carried out. This question of COVID-19 naturally brings me to the question of consequences as well. It is not just the harsh psychological consequences for our citizens, not just the harsh social consequences, in relation to the economic impacts that are hitting and will hit hard economic activities, which will singularly affect sectors more sensitive than others to the consequences of this difficult situation. This naturally brings me to the question of the European budget and the European stimulus fund. We have had the opportunity, Mr President, to have an exchange with you on this issue. I hope, once again, that the next few days will be an opportunity for all of us to be truly committed in order to be able to live up to it, to guarantee European credibility, to ensure that the strong and historic guidelines, I want to stress once again, taken at European Council level in July, also thanks to the , it is true, the impulses given by the European Parliament before July, can give rise to an implemented decision. In fact, it is a question of ensuring that, as soon as possible, European citizens and European businesses can benefit from the positive effects of this ambition for recovery, for economic support, for support for prosperity and well-being, throughout Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, President of the European Council, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have pleasure in addressing you today on behalf of the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who is, as I am sure you are aware, in preventive self-isolation. There is a question that is on every European’s mind today: when will the pandemic finally pass? No one has the answer. The second wave has come. Infections are rising at a worrying speed again and our Member States again have to take action to contain the second wave and eventually to stop it. Since the first wave hit us, Europe has achieved a lot. Let me just name our main strands of work: vaccines, European coordination and our resilience to prevent future crises. First, progress on vaccines. We now have three contracts in place with pharmaceutical companies and three more are being finalised. This means that, if they manage to develop a vaccine, there will be doses reserved for Europeans. It also means that all Member States will get a future vaccine on the same terms and at the same time. Last week, the European Commission delivered a vaccination plan, a European framework on who should get the vaccine first. Our vaccination plan is based on science and on common sense. Health workers will take precedence. High on the list will also be people over 60, people at risk because of their health and of course essential workers, people who cannot socially distance and people who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic background. We want to protect these people because it’s not only a matter of social justice. We believe it’s the smartest way to ease the pressure on our health system and slow down contagion. Second, progress on European coordination. Last week, the Council adopted the Commission’s proposal on colour codes and data exchange. This means that all Member States are now speaking the same language when it comes to their citizens’ health and it means clarity for people who need to travel across the border. It is now essential to implement these decisions in full and it is also essential to agree on common rules on testing and quarantine. From Spain to Sweden, we are all facing the same disease so our precautions against it should also be the same. But we are also aware that we still have a long way to go. It will be months before a vaccine is found and distributed. We must be very disciplined and help everyone to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible in the coming weeks and months. If we fail to do so, we run the risk not only of losing the achievements in the area of health protection, but we are also risking Europe’s economic recovery, which we launched with great effort before the summer break. No one in Europe wants a second lockdown. People don’t want that and companies don’t want it either. That is why I call on European citizens to behave responsibly. Protect yourself and others. But there is also a lot at stake economically in other areas. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, has just touched upon them, namely our negotiations with the United Kingdom and our climate target for 2030. Let me first update you on our negotiations with the UK. The deal we are trying to achieve would be absolutely unprecedented. This was the will of the EU and the UK when agreeing on the scope of the future partnership in our joint political declaration and it is still our will. No other economy is as closely aligned to ours as the British economy. It is only natural after almost 40 years as a part of the single market. UK companies produce the same products, within the same value chains, and with almost no transport costs to reach our market. We need to ensure that the European Union and the United Kingdom’s companies face fair competition on the EU market. This is why we have put so much emphasis on ensuring a level playing field and on governance and conflict resolution.  Together with fisheries, these are the main outstanding issues where we are still far apart. On each of these issues, we still have to test whether it is possible to find common ground with our British friends. This needs hard work. We have made it clear that we are ready to engage intensively to find solutions. There is no time to lose. Our objective is still to reach an agreement that will pave the way for a new fruitful relationship between the EU and the UK. We will continue to work for such an agreement, but not at any price. My good colleague and friend, Michel Barnier, will provide you with additional information on the subject. If you allow me, I will now turn to the Withdrawal Agreement, which must be fully operational as of 1 January 2021. Deal or no deal, the Withdrawal Agreement must be respected.  (Applause) It is not only a matter of trust, which is of course key, but also of political responsibility vis-à-vis our citizens and peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Therefore I welcome that, at the last Joint Committee meeting, we managed to strike a constructive approach. Now it will be vital that this translates into concrete workable operational solutions. Finally, let me say a few words on our climate ambitions. Two weeks ago, this Parliament voted for a very ambitious recommendation. The European Council has not yet reached an agreement on targets and percentages but, rest assured, the Commission will continue to push for Europe’s Heads of State and Government to unite behind an ambitious climate objective of at least 55% by 2030 and this agreement must come before the end of the year.  Last week, we presented two more stepping stones to pave the way towards 55%, the renovation wave and the methane strategy. Our next steps will include revision of the Emissions Trading System, the strategy for offshore wind, the revised regulation for the trans-European energy networks, the mobility strategy and the new proposal for the circular economy. We have a plan that can lead us to 55% and, thanks to Next Generation EU, we have the resources to turn it into reality. We know how we can achieve this goal, but it is also important to remind ourselves why we are doing it. We are going for at least 55% because this is the only way to contain global warming. We made a commitment in Paris and we want to keep our word, but we are also doing this because it makes sense economically. If we go for at least 55%, it will strengthen our first-mover advantage in clean technologies. Our companies will be the leaders in tomorrow’s markets. We will become less dependent on energy imports from the rest of the world. As we work here in Europe, they are also engaging on the global stage so that other countries match our ambition. Europe wants to lead the way and today many others are following our example but never forget that in the near future companies will compete on international markets based on who has the best green technologies. We have to increase the pace of green innovation to remain competitive. It is the right thing to do and the smartest choice as well. Fifty—five percent is an insurance on Europe’s future. I have to repeat and underline that it’s decision time. Europe must be ambitious for our planet, for our economy and for our next generation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Michel BARNIER", "mepid": "72776", "text": "   Head of the task force for relations with the United Kingdom. Mr President, thank you also, Mr President, and to Maroe 'eef-ovi' for allowing me to say a few words now about this negotiation for which I am responsible under your authority. I would also like to begin by personally thanking Maroe 'Eef-ovi' for the work he is doing, I can tell you, with great determination and rigour to lead the Joint Committee on the Implementation - the Proper Implementation - of the Withdrawal Agreement. This is a fundamental point in its connection to the negotiation, because as all your group chairs reminded you together a few weeks ago, it is a matter of trust. To build a new agreement on the future relationship, we need confidence in the implementation of the existing agreement. The European Council, as Charles Michel said, was a very important moment for this negotiation: this European Council reaffirmed to our British partners and friends that the European Union wants an agreement, an agreement in the mutual benefit of each party, respecting the autonomy and sovereignty of each side, and which reflects a balanced compromise. However, there will be no agreement at any price, as our President Ursula von der Leyen has made very clear and repeatedly. This is the position at the heart of the mandate entrusted to me, confirmed by your Parliament and confirmed by the European Council, also reaffirming our constructive attitude to continue the discussion and negotiation. I would like to remind you that the attitude of the European Union in this negotiation has not changed and will not change until the last day. We will remain calm, we will remain constructive, we will remain respectful but also, of course, firm and determined in defending the principles and interests of each of the countries of the European Union and the European Union itself. We will seek the necessary compromises on both sides to reach an agreement until the last useful day and our door will always remain open.  As has been said at the time by President Charles Michel and by Maroe 'Eef-ovi', we are ready to intensify our discussions at any time and on all subjects, and to do so on the basis of legal texts, since it is a matter of agreeing, of negotiating an agreement in the form of an international treaty, and therefore a legal document. We and my team were ready to come to London on Monday, early this week. What will not change, either, is the framework we have set on behalf of the European Union for this ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom, which is in accordance with our decision-making autonomy; respecting the integrity of the internal market; and which preserves the long-term economic, political and social interests of all countries, citizens and businesses in the European Union. These principles have been stated and stated by the Union since the very moment when the United Kingdom chose - as is its sovereign choice - to leave the European Union more than four years ago. These principles are, of course, from my point of view compatible with respect for British sovereignty, which is a legitimate concern of Boris Johnson's government. What is at stake, ladies and gentlemen, in this negotiation is not the sovereignty of either party in negotiations. We have said this from the outset of the political declaration: any future agreement will be done with respect for the european Union's decision-making autonomy and with respect for British sovereignty. What is at stake is simply - but it is already a lot - the organization, the right organization, our future relationships after the divorce, which is acquired. We want as intense a relationship as possible for our economic cooperation, security, joint investments, research, education and one day, no doubt, cooperation on foreign and defence policy. We have, of course, the red lines mentioned by Boris Johnson on the role of the European Court of Justice, on the legislative autonomy of the United Kingdom, on fisheries. For several months now, we have been constructively committed to the negotiating table to see how these British red lines that we know could be compatible with our own principles and interests, with the will to reach an agreement between us. For it goes without saying, of course, that any international agreement involves constraints between the two parties, mutually accepted constraints. So much for the overall framework of the negotiation. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, despite the difficulties, that an agreement is within our reach. If we are, on both sides, ready to work constructively and in a spirit of compromise, if we move forward in the coming days on the basis of legal texts, as is our wish, and, finally and above all, if we are ready, in the coming days, to address and resolve and the most difficult subjects. Time is limited, very limited, it is even limited more and more every day, and that is why we have to find solutions with the British, if they want, solutions for the most difficult problems. I said yesterday again to the coordination group chaired by David McAllister and its members that I thank - very much here - as I said at the Conference of Commission Presidents, that we have made progress in recent weeks with the British on police and judicial cooperation (I know the vigilance of your Parliament): we have made progress on the issue of the European Convention on Human Rights , data protection, Europol, Eurojust and extradition. Here we are: we see clearly the outline of an agreement. We have made progress on transport: the UK government is committed to a specific level playing field, particularly in the field of road transport, this is important for us; on the UK's participation in some important EU programmes: Horizon Europe, research, Erasmus; and finally on thematic cooperation, such as public health, which is so urgent at the moment, or cybersecurity. These are the issues where we have made good and positive progress through negotiation. On other issues, there are still disagreements, although we also see prospects of finding approval, particularly on trade in goods, services, energy, and coordination on social security. Finally, there are three subjects, as Charles Michel mentioned earlier, on which we must make progress because there are real differences: level playing field, fishing and governance. The level playing field - let's say in a slightly less techno way that it is economic and commercial fair play, at the heart of our future economic relations. The British often mention the Canadian model in their speeches, but we have a unique proximity with the United Kingdom, as Maro-Eef-ovio said earlier: 0 kilometres. Zero kilometres between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, therefore between us and the United Kingdom, and an economic interconnection built with the British for 47 years, which makes this situation unlike any other. That is why this agreement we want will be unprecedented. It is also the first time in our history that we are negotiating a trade treaty with a third country by establishing from the outset the principle that there will be no, or the proposition that there will be no tariffs between us and no quotas. We have never done that with any third country, not canada, or with Japan more recently. And then we are negotiating this agreement with a third country for the first time, I repeat, in a context of regulatory divergence: this is not, as in all previous agreements, encouraging convergence, it is about controlling the divergence that the British want to regain and will regain with Brexit. That is why the level playing field remains a fundamental requirement, as the President of the European Council has pointed out. We have noted with interest in recent weeks that the British have become more aware of this requirement and have evolved to recognise the need for fundamental principles on state aid control, beyond what exists in existing free trade agreements or in the WTO, and also non-regression standards with real guarantees of national implementation and a dispute settlement mechanism. But the intentions must now be translated into negotiation. It is also necessary for each party to be able to adopt unilateral measures in response to the risk of distortion of competition. This is the first major point of divergence, but I believe it is possible to find a path. Similarly, the governance of our future agreement is the key: it is a global structure for a comprehensive agreement, it is a binding mechanism for resolving disputes with an effective sanctions system. Here, too, Maro-Eef-ovi recalled earlier the risk attached to the withdrawal agreement and its respect. That is why we are obviously going to be demanding, in this negotiation for the future relationship, on dispute resolution and governance, because we have this warning from the British that we are concerned about. And then fishing, the last important sticking point: there will be no economic agreement without a sustainable, equitable, fair solution for fishermen on both sides. We will therefore insist to the end to ensure a sustainable prospect for our European fishermen. It requires reciprocal and stable access to water, and it requires a fair distribution of quotas. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, and thanking you for your trust, I would like to remind you that our door remains open and will remain open until the last useful day, to work together with our team, which is also your negotiating team. We are ready to work very hard, day and night if necessary, to finalise a draft agreement within a time frame which must allow the necessary time for democracy, that is to say to your Parliament and also to the national parliaments and the Council, to express itself. Of course, we will continue to inform you transparently, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of the progress of this negotiation. To reach an agreement, you have to be two, and then you have to agree at the end. We are not sure we will, but I think it is possible. That is why we must also be prepared to accept the consequences of a possible No Deal and continue at the same time our preparations for this scenario, which we do not want, by the end of the year. And we have been carrying out this preparation work for many months in good cooperation with all parties concerned and with the Member States.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our attitude and your unity, the unity of the 27, the unity of the political groups here, are the key to the success of this negotiation, which, as we know, is not only about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union for the generations to come, but also, more broadly, the future of the European project.

Whenever there is a crisis, whenever people face difficulties, they expect that the European Union to help them.  This was the case ten years ago during the economic and financial crisis. This was the case five years ago during the migration and refugee crisis, and this is the case now during the Corona crisis. The fact that people expect us to deliver in times of crisis, shows that they believe we can deliver. It shows a genuine trust of the people in Europe, in the European institutions, and this is why we need to provide now what people expect of us – provide solutions.  These are times in which we have to trust science; trust the authorities; work together; stay united; keep in mind that facts matter; defend together a rules-based society; trust politicians who have solutions, and say loud and clear – the institutions of the European Union delivered in overcoming the crisis and, under Michel Barnier’s leadership, in keeping the EU together in the negotiations for finding the best possible relationship with the United Kingdom for the future.  The developments of recent days have shown to us that passing relatively well through a first wave of Corona crisis, is no guarantee of passing well through the second and through the third wave. The developments of recent days have shown to us that the Corona crisis is not a short-term crisis, but it will be at least a medium-term crisis, with consequences, potentially, for the long term. When people expect us to do more, when we have a crisis where it’s clear that united we can pass through it better, when people expect us to do more, we need to equip the European Union with the tools it needs to overcome the crisis. And one of our essential tools is the budget of the European Union. In the EPP group, we are committed to a quick conclusion of the negotiations on the EU budget and on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, so that both instruments can enter into force on 1 January 2021.  We do respect the many good elements of the agreement of the July European Council. However, we want to find solutions to allocate further resources where they are needed. We saw in recent weeks that the EU health programmes need more money, and this is why Mr President Sassoli, I would like to support what you publicly said yesterday – the creation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility of Next Generation EU should not become a burden for the budget of the European Union.  I would like to support what President Sassoli said yesterday. We should not place the interest payments for Next Generation EU within the EU budget. We should not have less money for farmers, for researchers, for students, because we have created the Recovery and Resilience Facility. As the rapporteur for the Recovery and Resilience Facility, I would like to tell our colleagues in the Council that we are working and respecting our schedule here in the European Parliament. We will be delivering. We have no delays here. We will adopt our position in November.  Be ready for the final negotiations with the Council, and the message to the people is, we will provide the facility that will help them overcome this crisis, and which will protect them for the next crisis.

Curfews and mobility restrictions shake the working and social lives of our towns and cities. The second wave puts the health system back against the ropes. If more than two million contagions were counted in Europe a month ago, we are now with more than four.  International Monetary Fund forecasts, published last week, point to a collapse in the euro area. Moreover, the health and economic crisis pushes us to the precipice of social drama with an increase in poverty and inequality. As the European Poverty Reduction Network reminds us, it is unacceptable that nearly 22% of the population of the European Union is now at risk of poverty or social exclusion.  And if all this wasn't enough, the horizon darkens with the prospect of the abrupt Brexit by the end of this year. There's no complacency. The European Union must learn from the mistakes of the past and yesterday.  Mr Barnier, you are also supported by the Social Democratic family in your last effort to achieve the best relationship with the United Kingdom. But let us not do so at the cost of sacrificing one of our foundations: the internal market. In no way should we accept unfair competition, distorted state aid or social and environmental dumping. Alongside the mistakes of the past, we must also avoid yesterday's mistakes.  And I think it is important to make a reference today to something that the Council did not address, but what this Parliament continues to insist on, and it is the need, today more than ever, to address this Conference of the Future of Europe in order to have instruments that are really in line with the times in which we live.  Mr Michel, the European Council cannot return to the austerity which our welfare state has convulsed since 2008. If we often claim that education is the best antidote to extremism, why do they propose reducing Erasmus? If we tend to say that science is key to the ecological and digital transition, why cut Horizon Europe? If we are now debating the need to give the European Union strategic autonomy built from our health, why give up strengthening the health programme? And don't forget the support we must also give to those who suffer the most in Africa and Latin America. Because let's be clear that no one is going to be safe until we're all safe.  Let's take advantage of the recovery plan and budget to save lives and jobs. And to compensate for the over-indebtedness generated by the crisis. Listen to the International Monetary Fund. They are now calling for higher taxes, that the most affluent individuals and the most profitable companies protect the most vulnerable. And in the European Union we have the tools to make it possible: own resources.  We have to end the digital tax hole. It is not acceptable for U.S. multinationals to declare half their profits in Europe in a single Member State with an unfair corporation tax. President Von der Leyen pledged to relaunch the Google rate if the OECD failed to reach an agreement this year. Now you must comply. And don't go into a false dilemma about allocating funds. Taxpayer efforts cannot serve to finance countries with governments that violate the rule of law. Yesterday we knew that almost eight out of ten European citizens are in favour of linking funds to full respect for democratic values. Let's act on it. A delay in the arrival of aid would frustrate the hopes of millions of Europeans and Europeans and push them into anti-Europeanism.  Tomorrow is not written.

The EU was always willing to negotiate, but Mr Johnson’s government preferred political games. From the beginning of the campaign of the referendum, until now, he played games.  The EU wants, and needs, a strong partnership with our UK neighbours, but, for that to happen, we need a serious partner, and serious partnerships should have a clear understanding.  Firstly, we will not ratify any trade deal as long as the Withdrawal Agreement is not fully respected, especially the Protocol on Northern Ireland. Secondly, my Group will only give its consent to an agreement that protects the interests of European citizens, and is fair and beneficial to our economy. Any possible deal should ensure a level playing field, as you said, Mr Michel, have an effective mechanism of governance, be fair when it comes to fisheries, and respect our strict data protection norms – and we insist on that.  If the United Kingdom wants a deal – which is in the best interests of UK citizens also – its government needs to sit at the negotiating table until one is reached, and stop playing delaying tactics. And Mr Michel, you have our full support in your work. Let me say some words on the pandemic also. Europe is on the brink of a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coordination of free movement, requested by my political group and Parliament, is a step forward, but we must strengthen operational coordination at EU level. We have to urgently prepare in order to mitigate the serious social and economic hardship this second wave will cause our citizens.  The Commission and Member States cannot allow themselves to work in anything less than a coordinated manner and learn from the mistakes we witnessed last spring. The cost of national selfishness is too high, and it is simply unacceptable. Furthermore, I hope it is now crystal clear to everyone that we need a European health policy to complement national ones, and this coordination on health will not be enough. We need investment, common investment, and we need an element in the budget for a real European tool on health policy.

The position of Brussels has always been, throughout these years of negotiations, to punish the British people for their choice by making the break as painful and complex as possible for London. Having tried to tie the United Kingdom to the common market with the famous backstop, the Commission is still trying to keep the United Kingdom on a short mark by seeking to impose, for example, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights or by wanting to keep a say in its state aid policy. But the truth is that your inflexibility never paid off. Boris Johnson had demonstrated the fragility of this alleged intransigence at the end of 2019, securing just after his election the renegotiation of the deal that had been concluded with Theresa May and which you claimed was immutable. As a French parliamentarian elected in Normandy, I am now very concerned about fishing, which is a major issue for our countries and mine in particular. Germany has already indicated that it is in favour of concessions, and you, Mr Barnier, had recently suggested that it was necessary, I quote, to 'be realistic about access to British waters'. So it will be either the weakness or the no deal, the lack of agreement. And of course I am not happy about the prospect of failure, but contrary to what has been said over the last four years, the consequences of a no deal would probably be much worse for the European Union than for the United Kingdom. You have taken the problem upside down, instead of negotiating a comprehensive agreement by imposing your ideological dogmas, the general agreement should have been conditioned on the specific issue of fishing, but you do not dare the balance of power because you fear above all a future trade war.  The European Union claimed to bring us prosperity, stability, strength and a place on the world stage after the United States, after China, and recently Turkey, well the United Kingdom today shows that the European institutions, both by their functioning and by their political orientations, organize the collective powerlessness of our nations and therefore of our continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, with regard to climate, those were very poor Council conclusions indeed. Or can I even call them conclusions, because the only thing that leaders could agree on was that they had actually talked about climate. We are in the midst of a rapidly progressing climate crisis and postponement of action is a mistake. This year again looks set to break any sort of records with regard to climate crisis, be it heat waves, droughts, intensity, extreme weather events, Arctic shield loss, etc.  So, let me be very clear. Deciding to talk about climate later is failing to grasp the urgency of this task. We have to act now and we have to act decisively at all levels and also in all policy areas, and the compromise reached by the European Parliament on reducing greenhouse gases by 60% by 2030 is a good step forward. Some of you have said it’s an ambitious target, but it’s not so ambitious: it’s a more realistic target if we really want to save our planet. Member States should sign up to it quickly – to the 60% goal – so we can finally start acting. The climate doesn’t wait and neither should we.  And yes, the economic transformation needed for that is no walk in the park, especially for regions with a long-standing tradition of carbon-intensive economies. That’s why the Parliament is insisting on having a proper-sized Just Transition Fund, among others, as part of a new EU budget, because you need to put the money where your policy targets is. You need to put the money where you want to have the EU fit for the tasks ahead and that requires adequate funding. Any government should know that. We need to have a climate spending target of 30% and a biodiversity target of 10% in order to be up to the tasks ahead. And EU funds also need to advance our Union values. That’s why compliance with rule of law must be an essential criteria for allocating the funds and these are critical elements in the Parliament’s position on the EU budget and recovery fund. It is just inadmissible that the Council disregards such fundamental concerns.  As for Brexit, it’s very sad to see that so much time has passed without any agreement being reached on our future relations. We’re approaching the end of the time limit and I just want to remind us that of course the UK Government could have asked for an extension and they decided not to, but it’s also clear that we cannot accept a deal that would endanger the single market, social rights or environmental standards. So further work is needed on that and we are still extremely sad that Brexit was decided, but now we need to see that we also ensure the Union’s togetherness. We are again holding this meeting under very exceptional circumstances. We’re in the midst of a big, big medical crisis. Let us learn from the EU response in the spring, let us now be more coordinated, more cohesive and make sure that border restrictions are avoided. It’s an exceptional year in many different ways and the Council needs to step up if it is ready to face these challenges.

If you know that Prime Minister Johnson has written a great biography of Winston Churchill, you can imagine what he is going to do. So we have to prepare for a no deal. If we look at fisheries – because I really want to talk about that – the two positions are far apart. The United Kingdom claims the sovereignty of its own fishing waters. The EU really wants to leave the current situation that way. But there is a Brexit. So the British are allowed to claim their fishing waters. Now I have an important point. The Netherlands must not throw its fishermen overboard because the European Union is fishing behind the net. We don't know what's coming out of the bus yet. I hope you're successful with a deal. But if not, then there is another world, Mr Barnier. I'm very glad you understand Dutch so well. If no agreement is reached, I do not want to point the finger of blame. But then there is a different situation and then the Member States, the fishing countries, should have the right to negotiate bilaterally with Great Britain. Norway offers a good model. The Norwegians agreed fishing quotas with Great Britain last year. Flanders and Denmark, including those that fish there, benefit from this. So we have a model, because you must know, Mr Barnier, that French fishermen can fish a lot in the Atlantic, but we are in a trap. And that trap is getting smaller and smaller. So we cannot give that up! The Netherlands will never give up its centuries-old tradition of fishing and sacrifice on the sacrificial block of Brussels. This is a national matter that goes very deep culturally and I will defend our fishing supporters tooth and nail. Bilateral negotiations should therefore be possible if you fail.

Mr President, I will dwell on two points, addressing the Council in particular, Mr Michel.  First point: stop \"stroking\" Erdogan, because you are sending the wrong message and that is why he is escalating his unilateral challenges, not only against Greece and Cyprus but also against the European Union itself. What happened, Mr Michel and Mr Šefčovič, to the list of sanctions which Mr Borrell presented orally, about two months ago, to the foreign ministers? When are we finally going to see it written at the summit, to approve it next to the positive agenda of dialogue that you are proposing to Turkey? Why is the summit — and in particular the German Presidency, and with your tolerance — constantly postponing and referring the matter to the future? Since June you took it to September and now you call us \"date in December\". You finally need to show more rigour towards Erdogan and consistency of reasons and projects.  Secondly, the severity of the second wave of the pandemic calls for stronger measures to protect society, the economy and public health. That is why, in addition to the positive step of the Recovery Fund, the European Parliament, with a large majority and with the agreement of five political groups — the European People's Party, liberals, Socialist Greens and the Left — is calling for a more ambitious budget.  That is why I ask you, from the Council, to listen to the statement made yesterday by the President of Parliament, Mr Sassoli, and to stop bullying Parliament and not to accuse it with fake news that — supposedly — he does not want a deal. In order to reach an agreement, mr Michel, the Council must also be moved. Parliament has moved from its original proposals, but in order to meet in the middle of the bridge and quickly have positive decisions, such as those demanded by the citizens (see yesterday's Eurobarometer), both the summit and the Council should take some steps towards compromise instead of blaming the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 13, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Kostas PAPADAKIS", "mepid": "125093", "text": "   Mr President, the dangerous developments in Greek-Turkish also confirm in the European Council communiqués the deadlocks in the policy — of all Greek governments over time — of involvement in American-NATO projects and competition. From a once so-called 'wind-up port', the European Union has today become a 'slow-moving ship' for its apologists. They thus wash away the strong economic and geopolitical interests linking the European Union, Germany, Italy, Spain and others with Turkey.

The virus is faster, more effective, more constant than our measures to prevent and control it, and the arrival of winter will only increase the advantage it carries over us. But politicians continue to confuse reality with desire: as much as we want the nightmare to end, it's not going to end if we don't treat it as the health, economic and social emergency it is.  We were wrong when we pretended it would end the summer and made a mistake again telling the lie that the vaccine will arrive before Christmas. We're presenting vaccination plans and we don't have any vaccines.  We have to prepare for a fight that's going to last for years. In Spain, for example, the virus in just eight months has killed fifty thousand people. There are a million infected; three hundred thousand people are infected each month. What do we do discussing other things?  Gentlemen of the Council, do you not think it is time to have a common strategy to combat the pandemic? How many more people have to die in Europe?  The lives and health of millions of people are at stake on our continent, the collapse of health systems, the survival of our small and medium-sized business fabric, which millions of families can afford for food, clothing or heating.

Today that number is down to 73. Prime Minister Johnson then gave assurances that all it would take to come to an agreement was a little oomph and self imposed a deadline: first, in July, and then on 15 October. But instead of a real engagement in the negotiations, the UK decided to put forward an internal market bill which breaches international law, jeopardises the Good Friday Agreement and ruined the good faith between the negotiators. And here we are in the midst of a second wave of the corona crisis with all its economic consequences, and the UK Government, for reasons no one can really grasp, decided to walk away from the negotiation table one minute before midnight, because we do not need a deal in 73 days: we need it within two weeks. Only then will this Parliament be able to ensure the agreement’s full democratic scrutiny. Because, President, let this be very clear to the UK Government: since the beginning of the transition period, the European Parliament has diligently and consistently taken its responsibility in reaching an agreement because we believe that finding one would be in the interests of both the EU and UK citizens. But under no circumstances will we now be bullied by Mr Johnson into rubber stamping just any last—minute deal after the UK Government chose to run down the clock on the negotiations since February. And our position has not changed. We have always been very clear regarding our red lines. Top social, labour and environmental standards, fair competition, effective governance, a sustainable agreement on fisheries and full compliance with the Withdrawal Agreement. Parliament remains fully committed to a comprehensive agreement with the United Kingdom. But let me draw a clear line in the sand. If the UK Government does not remove those provisions in the internal market bill that are in clear breach of international law, this Parliament cannot and will not consent to any agreement. And finally, let me underline once again that we, the European Parliament, just like the Council, are absolutely united in our support for our negotiator, Michel Barnier. Mr Barnier, we wish you the very best for the coming few weeks of hopefully intensified negotiations with a good outcome.

Today, negotiations are on a ridge road between a ditch and a precipice. When negotiating, you have to be wary of miscalculations. Boris Johnson committed three. The internal market bill was supposed to scare Europeans and weld its political majority. By threatening to violate international law, he has united the Europeans and frightened his majority. When driving at high speed on a narrow lane, you avoid breaking the traffic code. The British government thought it would put pressure on the Europeans by setting a deadline for negotiations on 15 October. October 15th passed and the Europeans remained calm. Negotiations can resume at any time. When you want to get there safely, you avoid making unnecessary stops. The British government sought to divide and rule, putting the subject of fishing at the centre of conversations, but no one was fooled. The big issue, the one that concerns each of the 27, is the risk of unfair competition at the gates of the single market. However, this subject is not settled, nor is it fisheries, nor is it how we resolve our differences in the future, even though, because of the British retreat on the withdrawal agreement, the confidence we would like to have is not the same. For us, the gap would be a no deal and the precipice a bad deal. Because we do not want to kill our companies if they were faced with unfair competition in health, social or environmental matters. Because we do not want to kill our fishing sector, which does not have to suffer the consequences of a decision, Brexit, which it has not taken. Then there remains a narrow path, that of an agreement respectful of the sovereignty of everyone but capable of serving the interests of all. This narrow path must be covered in a very short time.

I’ve always been optimistic that when it came down to it, a deal would be reached. This I drew from the competency and fairness with which I have seen Michel Barnier do his great work. But recently our confidence lessened in this regard because of the shifting sands of Boris Johnson’s desires and his collection of supporters in parliament who seem more than willing to not only contradict themselves, but also contradict the foundation of the United Kingdom’s reputation by voting to willingly breach international law.  On paper, with our years of close cooperation, the remaining issues on Brexit seem achievable. The sharing of fishing rights and policing state subsidies to industry should not be deal breakers to close allies of 47 years. The real problem is the lack of trust in the seriousness of any commitments that the United Kingdom might give, which was most distinctly displayed by the abrasive introduction of the Internal Market Bill and the legal justification for same. Sometimes we get the sense that the United Kingdom is more concerned with short-term optics than long-term substance. Nobody in the EU, Ireland – and indeed the United Kingdom if they are truly honest – wants an extremely disruptive no-deal. There is a danger that a last-minute agreement could break down into a multitude of legal disputes within a year or so. This must be avoided.

And now we are negotiating how we can make it more difficult and difficult to do business with each other. It simply does not make any sense, but it is the British's own choice, and we must respect that, but we cannot and must not respect the fact that British companies should be able to compete with Danish companies on terms that are not equal and fair.  I have visited Danish fishermen in Thyborøn, shipping companies in Esbjerg, farmers in South Jutland, I have spoken to industry all over Europe and the service sector, everywhere sounds the same basic message: Brexit is hard, Brexit is going to cost money, Brexit is going to cost welfare.  From the EU's point of view, we must stand together – we have succeeded so far, not least thanks to the great efforts of the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. And we must make one last attempt to find each other in a deal. It will not be easy: as colleagues in the Chamber have said, there are huge knots in terms of fishing.

They move in a sea of unknowns in all areas, from the future of the fruit and vegetable productions of my Canary Islands to fishing.  And speaking of fishing, today I think it is more necessary than ever to reiterate our position: no general agreement should be reached with the United Kingdom if there is previously no stable, lasting and balanced agreement on fisheries that maintains access to water and the allocation of quotas and catches. The Council sent a very strong message in this regard and our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, too. It's our turn today from here.  The organization of fisheries is much more than the establishment of a percentage of TACs and quotas. The current common fisheries policy responds to a delicate balance between economic benefit, social welfare and the preservation of fish stocks, and that balance cannot be lost. Fishermen in the European Union and the United Kingdom have shared the waters of our seas for centuries, and the new agreement cannot be overlooked.  The common fisheries policy is already a compromise between Member States, including the United Kingdom, which until last year has participated in all the negotiations on its most important aspects which also take into account their priorities and interests and which could continue to benefit for years.  In this sense, the European Union's position is not maximalist, as some might think. We in this Parliament build this system together with the United Kingdom and we cannot now downgrade or refnege that commitment, neither they nor us.

The last time that you did this, you lost New York, I presume, when you got your negotiations with the British. So, if I have a suggestion to make, Michel, it’s the following. If we make a deal with the British - and I hope that there is a deal in the coming weeks - then we put in this final agreement, in this treaty - it’s an international treaty - a disposition that automatically that treaty ceases to exist if the British don’t follow all the commitments that they have taken, including in the Withdrawal Agreement. In my opinion that is absolutely necessary because otherwise, if there is a deal, if there is an agreement, and the 27 will have ratified it, and they don’t follow their commitments, it will be a huge mess and it again be necessary for 27 decisions by the 27 Member States to stop that agreement.  So I think that, after what has happened with the Internal Market Bill, it’s in the interest of the European Union to foresee such a disposition in that final agreement as fast as possible.

Well, in my honest view, the UK Government has lost the right to be disappointed – the moment it introduced a bill to unilaterally override an international agreement that was the fruit of more than three years of negotiations; a bill that puts the UK’s international credibility at stake; a bill that was met with strong rebukes from the European Parliament and the American Congress; a bill that was rejected by the Scottish and Northern Irish Assemblies, and yesterday by the House of Lords; a bill that undermines trust and hangs over the negotiations like a sword of Damocles. We have stated it again and again: this House will not ratify an agreement if the Withdrawal Agreement is breached, or threatened to be breached. A no-deal Brexit after four years of negotiations would be a drama for our fisheries, for our hauliers, for our people and, last but not least, for politics.

It was the UK that decided to leave the EU, it was the UK that decided to be a third country, and now it’s the UK Government demanding that an entire economic bloc of 27 countries change its way of doing business.

This is not their choice and they cannot become collateral damage in this story. What seems fair to me is that the UK can only get access to our market of 450 million consumers if fair competition for our companies is guaranteed and our fishermen can continue to fish in British waters.

Erdogan takes three steps forward, one step back, but it is to resume better then and when he advances, it is on Europe that he walks. We cannot forget, in particular, the fate of Armenia, which is now being hit by Turkey's actions. Azerbaijan has caused so many civilian casualties in Armenia, in Nagorno-Karabakh: what is Europe doing in the face of this? Well, she deplores, she urges, she calls for appeasement. So many ways to hide his denials, so many ways not to say the word \"sanction\", the only effective, the only one that must be pronounced. Mr President of the Council, Turkey is a crisis every week, it is the deaths of innocent people every day, and here it is Munich at every moment. I believe it is time to save the honour, it is time to finally act. We have no right to remain powerless any longer, we do not have the right to take Turkey's propaganda on our own, especially when it supports - Mr Erdogan recently said - terrorism in the face of the measures recently announced.

Ms García Pérez and Ms Jongerius have reminded us how important it is to bear in mind that this health crisis, this pandemic, also has very dire social consequences, like possible social exclusion and poverty, and how important it is that we put in place policies where no one is left behind.  Yesterday, in this Chamber, I presented the Commission Work Programme for the next year. I would like to reassure the House that we are going to put enormous emphasis and focus on the Action Plan on the European Pillar of Social Rights, where it would focus on the new European Child Guarantee and other important steps, which I believe would be very important for the future. We are already working on putting the first foundation stones on a new, stronger health union for Europe. We are proposing operational steps on how improve the work of our European Medicines Agency (EMA) and our European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), but also on founding the new advanced research biomedical BARDA agency, which I believe will help us not only to be at the cutting edge of research, but – if at any time in the future we are faced with the same challenges – will also mean that we have much faster and much better answers.  I agree with all of you who have been stressing the importance of citizen—to—citizen solidarity – support, but also responsibility – which we have to show to each of us. We can do much more in the European Union. We see how the SURE scheme was important for preserving jobs in Europe, and we can be encouraged by this first interest in European bonds, which I hope is a good indication of how this instrument can work well in the future, and not only of how we can finance the Next Generation EU, but also of how we can combine it well with the next multiannual financial perspective.  The calls, from many of you, to make sure that we negotiate in an honest and speedy way in order to make sure that we have these two powerful instruments at our disposal as of 1 January 2021 was absolutely crucial. I would like to reassure you that the Commission will do its utmost to get the co-legislators closer and to play the role of honest broker. We will be ready to assist in any way possible so that, as of the beginning of next year, we will have all financial instruments at our disposal and we can fund all the operations and all the programmes that we were discussing today. That would, as Mr Mureşan and Ms García Pérez have been calling for, also comprise new own resources. We are working on a roadmap which would cover a digital levy, a carbon border adjustment system, revision of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and some other measures which we know are very important, not only from the political and economic point of view, but also from the point of view of making sure that these new own resources will help us to fund the right and correct policies for the future.  I would say that almost every Member of the European Parliament who intervened today addressed the very important issue of our future partnership with our friends in the United Kingdom. I think that this debate clearly demonstrated strong trust and support for our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. It’s well deserved, and, as they say in his country, bien mérité. I can assure you that President von der Leyen, myself and all our services are ready to work for a fair deal up to the last minute. We know – and we listened to your very loud and clear position – that we are interested in this unprecedented partnership – the deepest that was ever negotiated – but not at any cost. Therefore, regarding the concerns of Mr Bourgeois, Mr Scholz and others on fisheries, I would just like to tell you that, without a fair deal on fisheries, there will be no fair deal on a trade agreement. It’s part of the deal. We know that, and this is how we are going to negotiate.  At the same time, I totally subscribe to the calls for urgency. Time is really flying by, and every day of lost negotiations is a day of lost opportunities to find the necessary compromises. Our chief negotiator and the President – and I was listening very carefully to the President of the European Council – have been very, very clear on that as well. Therefore. I would again underline that now it’s time for responsibility towards our citizens and towards peace and economic prosperity on the island of Ireland. This is what is at stake. This is what we have to bear in mind when negotiating.  I would also like to thank you for your support on the proper and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. Mr Cioloş and others made it very clear that there cannot be a new deal unless the last one is properly respected. It is very clear and very simple, and we all should understand it very well. At the same time, I have to say that this Monday I was encouraged because we had a good, constructive discussion with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove. We are advancing very well on guaranteeing citizens’ rights, as we promised to UK and EU citizens in the Withdrawal Agreement. We agreed to maximise and intensify the frequency of our meetings at the level of the negotiators. We have also been providing clear political steer on what needs to be done to ensure that the Withdrawal Agreement is properly respected, implemented and operationalised. We will be very vigilant at every single step. I know that our British friends say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Therefore, let’s see how far we progress and what we can achieve between now and mid—November, when we agreed with Chancellor Gove to see each other again in the form of the next Joint Committee. I hope that this will assuage the concerns that were presented by Mr Kelly, Mr MacManus and Mr Hansen.  I would like to thank Ms Keller, Mr Urtasun and others for your support for our ambitious goal for our climate agenda. Yesterday, when I was presenting the Commission Work Programme for the next year, I made very clear reference to the very ambitious Fit for 55 chapter in our Commission Work Programme. I think, without any exaggeration, that this is the most ambitious host of measures we have ever presented in the area of climate goals, and I hope that – with your support – we will be able to achieve them. Concerning the right focus in the interventions of honourable Members, Ms Hautala, Mr Bullmann and Mr Zorrinho on Africa. As you know, one of our priorities when we started to work as a Commission was to develop our relationship with our African partners, based on the Strategy with Africa, and I would underline the word ‘with’ because we really want to have a deep partnership. That was behind the first trip of our President, which she took to Africa and behind our efforts in development of a deeper and stronger partnership with our African partners. The clear example of this is that, if we are talking about vaccines, we are talking about vaccines for all – including for our partners in Africa. I know that Africa is something that is very close to the heart of the President of the European Council, who very wisely put it up for discussion among the European leaders, and he got a lot of support for that.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the messages that have been sent. First, a brief word on Brexit because it seems to me that this is a demonstration of the full capacity of the European institutions to cooperate and to express together, as we do, the quiet strength of the European Union. We have principles, common sense principles, principles to which we are attached, and it is in this context that Parliament, the Council and the Commission, with the very strong involvement of Michel Barnier, we are situated. We will therefore support, on the side of the European Council, all efforts, because we do believe that an agreement is desirable, but we will indeed defend the points of concern that have been raised by many of you and which I myself have highlighted with Michel Barnier and Mr 'Eef-ovi' in introduction to this debate. The second point, to which many reacted rightly: the battle against COVID-19. We are at the heart of this battle, we must remain fully mobilized. When the battle broke out, starting in February/March of this year, initiatives were taken, decisions were made. The European Commission's mobilization on the issue of vaccines is essential, but we can see that even if vaccines are developed sometime next year, it will take time for them to reach their full effectiveness. And we are now faced, there is no doubt, with the second wave, which imposes harsh measures, again, restrictions, with hard impacts both psychologically and economically and socially. That is why we must indeed work hard, be even more mobilised on the issue of cooperation and in particular, from my point of view, on the issue of tracing, testing, quarantine, intra-European traffic. There is no doubt that in the coming months, even if vaccines are available from next year, we will have to continue to use this lever to reduce this threat, which is a tough threat to Europe, which is our citizens, which is our businesses. That is why, as Dacian Cioloo has pointed out, we have indeed considered that, at each of the European Councils, at the level of heads of state or government, the point will have to be debated, raised and discussed in order to try to give the necessary wise impetus on this subject. Moreover, since the pandemic started, either by videoconference or by physical meeting, this point has been systematically debated and discussed at the beginning of each European Council meeting. The third point I want to make following the questioning on the subject is what I understand is the situation in the eastern Mediterranean. I have been a member of the European Council for almost six years now, of which I have been President for less than a year. For the first time, a few weeks ago, we had an in-depth strategic debate - almost eight hours of debate! - which has focused on this issue of the Eastern Mediterranean, in order to have indeed all the necessary nuance on the subject. Yes, we must be firm in defending and enforcing our Member States, sovereign sovereignty and rights! It is the firm and unambiguous message that is addressed. On the other hand, we wish to make this dual approach possible with a positive agenda, as positive as possible, on the condition that unilateral provocations that are not acceptable cease. We also maintain permanent contact within the framework of the United Nations, because we know that there is also a role to play in relation, in particular, to the Cyprus issue and the necessary settlement of this issue. Rest assured that, as President of the European Council, I will constantly mobilise to build a European consensus for a stronger, more ambitious and firmer geopolitical strategy in order to defend our values and win the interests for which we are all mobilised. I am pleased that many of you have raised the issue of Africa - Mr Bullmann, and others as well. I welcome this because I do believe that this neighbouring continent is, for so natural reasons, so obvious, a continent for which we must mobilize. We must engage in an ambitious alliance. This means, in fact, that investment issues, infrastructure issues, green pact issues for Europe, probably also digital agendas, education issues or health system, which is being tested in the context of COVID-19, must be the subject of our mobilization in a partnership of equals, imbued with mutual respect, by of course defending the values to which we are attached: the rule of law, the protection of human rights will have to be addressed in these matters, in order to advance this agenda for the benefit of Europe. , to the benefit of Africa. It is also, for me, a common-sense issue. We must all roll up our sleeves to try to meet this ambition. Several have rightly raised the climate issue. I would like to avoid the misunderstandings between us - allow my presence in this House to be an opportunity to correct perhaps some misunderstandings. It was not our intention to make a decision on the 2030 issue at this summit. I fully accept that I considered and consider that we needed a strategic discussion, not a discussion today on the issue of drafting and exact country-by-country ambition. We will have to make this decision as soon as possible, I hope at the end of the year, but this strategic discussion was the necessary step, the necessary step with the involvement of the European Commission, which we are going to need. I have noticed - this is an important point to highlight - that there is a trend towards support for the 55% proposal put on the table by the Commission, but with concerns in terms of national impacts. Hence the conclusions which highlight the Commission's engagement with the Member States, especially some of them, which are more directly concerned with the concern of the starting point. The aim, as you well measure, is that each member state, when it commits, can really be mobilised to implement the commitment, to produce results. Rest assured that I will be very personally engaged, because I believe that this point is central so that before the end of the year, at the next Council in December, we can make a decision on this subject. I have already had the opportunity to say how totally convinced I am that this green ambition for the European Union is a key ambition. We are consistent, which is also why we have activated more of what I call 'climate diplomacy'. I am pleased that, less than a year after this historic decision, in my opinion, of the European Council on climate neutrality by 2050, less than a year later, therefore, we are taking the first steps: China in view of 2060 and South Africa have spoken. We are not naïve, it is not enough, but it shows that the strength and the regulatory power of the European Union must be put at the service of our values and the interests we believe in. That is the sense of action that we also want to take. Finally, a word on an essential issue, which many have mentioned: that of the next European budget and the Stimulus Fund. I do believe that we must draw on the creativity that is the magic of the European Union to find an agreement as soon as possible in order to implement it. I would just like to ask you, with extreme delicacy, extreme courtesy and deep respect, to say everything when debating the figures, to explain all the elements. I, of course, respect the position of the European Parliament that, in its view, the amount proposed by the Council in terms of the MFF is not sufficient. It is very legitimate for the European Parliament to have this point of view and I respect it, but we read that massive cuts have been made in Erasmus, in innovation funds, in defence funds: however, when you talk about cuts, what you are talking about to talk about these cuts. If it is in relation to the Commission's proposals - very legitimate and very respectable proposals - that is one thing, but if I compare the means mobilised today, I say never, in the history of the European Union, have so many resources been made available! $1.8 billion for the next few years for Erasmus, for innovation, for digital, for climate. In terms of stimulus funds, that is much more, proportionally, than China and the United States are doing. I therefore respectfully and courteously ask the European Parliament to present, when we are debating these issues, the whole image as proposed to it by the European Council. I look forward to continuing to engage in debates with you in the service of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank all the rapporteurs very warmly. It has not always been easy discussions, especially since our original positions were very far apart, but we have tried to find a compromise, because it is important for Parliament to give an opinion on the issue of the European Semester. We agree that in the future we need an economic policy that takes into account both the challenges of the Corona pandemic, the challenges of climate protection, growing social and regional inequality and digitalisation.  The world has changed over the last twenty years, and politics must face up to these new realities. What new realities do I mean? The Corona crisis has worse economic effects than the 2008/2009 crisis. So far, we have succeeded in giving a European response in solidarity to the crisis. Part of this answer is that we are prepared to take on European debt together in order to get out of the crisis as quickly as possible, and that we tolerate a significant increase in the debt of each Member State. The corona crisis is a symmetrical shock, but it has different effects in the different Member States. However, this will also have consequences for the debt targets set. Some of these objectives set at the beginning of the 1990s will not be able to remain unchanged. My opinion on this is clear: we still need rules to limit public debt, but unrealistic and unattainable objectives do more harm than they use.  Another reality is that even before the crisis, the level of public and private investment was too low. This has severely limited the growth opportunities of European economies. In the meantime, the demands of climate change have also been added – a consistent climate protection policy requires additional public investment in the tens of billions of dollars every year.  In other words, we must ensure that these future investments can be made and that we do not fail because of debt brakes or restrictive fiscal policies – we agree on that. Incidentally, this is also a requirement of intergenerational justice, because today's failure to invest, especially in climate protection, will result in devastating damage and doubly burden future generations. In the report, we have therefore stated that we need a review of the economic and financial rules and, of course, depending on the results of the review, a change in the rules. The mistakes of the past must be avoided in choking off growth processes shortly after the end of a deep economic crisis, because debt targets are being absoluteised – this must never happen again.  We need a tailor-made countercyclical policy of sustainable growth that takes into account the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals, the European Pillar of Social Rights and the Green Deal. In other words, fairness in distribution, reducing unemployment and reducing CO2 emissions must be a central part of European economic policy, and this economic policy must also become more democratic. All this must be reconciled with sound budgetary and fiscal policies. However, this is not only a question of expenditure, but also of revenue. That is why the report emphasises that we can no longer tolerate tax evasion and tax dumping. And we need new tax revenues, especially where only the European level can guarantee fair taxation, for example through the introduction of a digital tax, a financial transaction tax or harmonisation of corporation tax. Incidentally, this will also help to really service the European debt that we are now taking on.  As I said, these were difficult discussions in committee. Despite some differences in starting points, however, it has been possible to find sensible compromises.

We've heard that sentence many times in the last few years. Dear Colleagues, we do not want to repeat the old mistakes of the past. We must therefore learn from the mistake that Europe made in dealing with the economic crisis of 2008-2009. Remember, after the real estate bubble collapsed, Europe was threatened by an economic collapse not seen since The Second World War, and we Europeans successfully defended the banks and successfully protected the functioning of the economy. We just forgot about the most vulnerable, we forgot to reach under the arm of those who lost their jobs, their homes, their houses, who were in a hopeless situation. Europe will never make this mistake again. And now history is testing us again. We do not yet see the economic and social impact of the coronavirus crisis. One thing is certain, if, ten years after the previous crisis, we can say that Europe has successfully recovered the economy but failed European citizens, then we must never again allow the same thing to be seen 10 years after the current crisis of the coronavirus. That is why, in my report, I would like in all respects to help the most vulnerable, the most vulnerable. That is why I am calling, for example, for the introduction and regulation of the European minimum wage at European level. I would like us to invest much more money than ever before in education, social investment, health. In the latter context, the report supports the creation of a European Health Union. We've learned our lesson. Furthermore, we propose that older people living below the poverty line should also receive a fair and sufficient pension. We propose that Member States adapt their tax systems so that it does not increase the gap between the richest and the poor, but rather reduces it, because that is our task. And that is why we support the rule of law, because it is the rule of law that can protect the most vulnerable, the poor, the vulnerable against the strong, against the powerful. I know very well that we in the European Parliament overwhelmingly want the same thing, a strong and successful Europe. But let us finally understand that there is no strong and successful Europe without strong and successful European citizens. If we cannot say that all European citizens are strong and successful, then Europe will not be either. I therefore ask you to support my report.

First of all I would like, also on behalf of Commissioner Schmit, to congratulate Joachim Schuster and Klára Dobrev, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, on their outstanding work on economic and social policies.  We know that we are facing unprecedented challenges. The human costs and the economic consequences of this crisis are huge. Recovery, from the economic point of view, began indeed last May, but uncertainty is still surrounding us and the speed of recovery is slowing. On 5 November I will present our autumn forecast and I have today a few clear messages coherent with the report Joachim Schuster presented.  First, we need a supportive fiscal stance. It should continue. We should avoid premature withdrawal of supportive measures. We can’t risk a double—dip recession. Second, the general escape clause will remain in place for 2021, as Valdis Dombrovskis and I made clear to Member States recently. Next spring we will assess the situation. Third, we should use NextGenerationEU to transform our economies, not to go back to normal but to build more sustainable, resilient and competitive economies. We increasingly see the social consequences of this crisis. Employment has been falling and unemployment is on the rise, even though so far it has been contained by the massive use of short—term work schemes. We are strongly supporting this effort with the SURE instrument. You saw the success of our first emission of social bonds yesterday.  Population groups that were already vulnerable before the pandemic are particularly hit, for example young people, women, and generally all those in precarious jobs, or disadvantaged children held back from benefiting from digital education. Mitigating the social impacts of the crisis will be one of the overarching objectives of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).  We would like to highlight three elements which we see as key for success. First, we need a skilling revolution to tap the job opportunities offered in the recovery, and particularly to face green and digital transitions. This is the objective of the recent Skills Agenda proposed by the Commission. Second, we have to enhance the quality of jobs – fair minimum wages are an essential element. We want to reduce wage inequality and poverty for the most vulnerable workers. This is why the Commission will put forward a European framework for a minimum wage later this month to make sure work pays off. This proposal will fully respect national traditions and the role of social partners in collective bargaining.  The third point is addressing poverty and inequalities. One essential element is to eradicate poverty from the start of life. Too many children across the EU grow up in poverty, creating barriers for their career and social integration. The European Child Guarantee, which we will present next year, will make sure that all children, whatever their background, have access to the same services and the same opportunities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 63, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Markus FERBER", "mepid": "1917", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, it is gratifying that we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have once again managed to bring a report to plenary. This has not always been taken for granted in the past, and i would like to thank all those who have taken responsibility for being able to make our comments from the economic side. On the other hand, I think it has already become clear during the negotiations that we no longer have quite this common basic understanding of why the European Semester actually exists. The European Semester has been created as the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, because, ladies and gentlemen, we can, of course, do the next generation a green deal and sustainable development goals and everything, only if we do the next generation a beautiful globe, but because of high over-indebtedness, we have not done the next generation any favours either.  If even amendments are now being tabled in plenary, that the ECB should simply put the debt to zero that it has bought up, then they are showing the real face of what is really at stake, namely a state economy that can take money into its hands without regard for the next generations, because it is easy to set it at zero if it is parked at the ECB. I tell you quite frankly that I come from a country where this was done in the post-World War I period. This led to hyperinflation and poverty, real poverty, unemployment, and then a dark time on this continent in 1923.  I warn against just saying we have to save the world, whatever it may. We must always keep economics and ecology in harmony, and that is unfortunately our problem with this report. I am glad that the committee has managed to strike this balance. I hope that this will continue to be the case in plenary. The rapporteur is right to say that we must carry out a review, that we must prepare for the 1920s and provide the answers. It can no longer be answered with the questions of the 1990s of the first millennium. But you are pretending that you already know the answer before the relevant institutions have even dealt with it here. So what do we have to face to a review when parts of this House already know what needs to come out? Sorry, then I don't need a check.

It is time, we believe, that it is about people again and not the interests of the multinationals. Europe is more than a market and more than a market with a currency. It is the challenges we face in the Netherlands and in Europe to get out of the crisis honestly, and we will not forget anyone. That's the way the PvdA wants to go. We want higher minimum wages, so that no one has to choose between hot water or hot food at the end of the month. We want a ban on zero-hours contracts so you can make plans and be sure of your income. And we want more affordable social rented housing, because then start-ups can really start a future.

What we in the Renew Europe have done in this year’s report, is try to combine the existing macroeconomic core of the Semester fiscal discipline and healthy debt levels, with the urgent demands of today, like the need for public and private investment, social protection, as well as the need to tackle climate change. Let me mention a few issues of great importance for us.  First of all, the promotion of reform is still the most important task of the Semester. The country-specific recommendations were often extremely weakly implemented. Member States should have tailor-made solutions for reform in order to promote competitiveness and growth in all European countries, also using Next Generation EU money.  Second, the report urges the review of the existing conditions of the Stability and Growth pact, since the crisis has shown that there are changes to be made. However, it must be done in a careful way, which would effectively motivate the Member States to comply with the requirements of the Stability and Growth pact.  Third, the need to tackle climate change, which is already an overarching, horizontal priority. We need to find its proper place in the framework of the European Semester. Therefore, we urge the Commission to develop a Climate Indicator, which would be supplementary to the existing Semester framework.

He basically tells us, ''OK to save the planet, but only if it doesn't ruin our public finances and it doesn't ruin our economies.'' What I am saying to him, Mr Ferber, is that if the planet becomes uninhabitable for human beings, there will be no more savings, there will be more public finances, it is as simple as that. And he would like us to believe that, of course, the only people who know how to handle well are the Conservatives. We are also convinced that when we are part of an economic and monetary union, we need common rules that must promote the stability and convergence of our economies. One element in this sense is, of course, the stability of our public finances. But who can still say that allowing the pandemic to take hold, the social divide deepening, the climate crisis getting carried away, natural resources depleting or biodiversity collapsing will have no impact on our public finances? I agree with your EPP colleagues only on one point: reducing inequality or our ecological footprint is in tension with the indiscriminate pursuit of growth at all costs. But pursuing an economic and budgetary policy that ensures the stability and even the economic competitiveness of our societies requires a European semester that can take into account the whole picture, and that is what the Commission is obviously proposing. On this account, the statements of Mr Ferber or his colleague Enik-Gyri remind me of those who, after the trial of Galileo, were delighted, despite common sense and science, to see the triumph of the thesis that the Earth is the centre of the universe: pitiful and unworthy of a great European party.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 68, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Eugen JURZYCA", "mepid": "197767", "text": "  for the ECR Group. – Madam President, Member States need a return to budgetary responsibility as quickly as possible and a plan to reduce public debt, which is expected to exceed an astronomical 100% of euro area GDP this year.

Any chain of monetary policy has now broken down, so that every injection of new money no longer has any effect at the level of inflation and politics is unfortunately completely subordinated to the power of the banks, which are now a bottomless pit that is getting richer and richer at the expense of the citizens.  So if we want to get out of this situation, I would say catastrophic, we must do a few simple but also courageous things: firstly, we need the ECB to be freed from the blackmail of private banks, the Member States must be freed from market blackmail and we must avoid abandoning the concept of unsustainability of public debt, abandoning the concept of European funds, the ESA, the SURE , the recovery fund's share of loans make no sense under fiat money regime, and then zero, eliminate all differences in the cost of money, under the single currency regime.

I see it quite differently, for two reasons: firstly, each Member State is committed to the principle of the social market economy through its membership, and secondly, every single citizen of the European Union has acquired fundamental rights through their citizenship of the Union, including fundamental social rights.  That is why I think it is our job, our primary duty as A Parliament, to look closely: how far is it really with these principles of order and what is the point of respectforing these fundamental social rights, including and especially in the most serious economic crisis in the European Union? That is why I think that today's report has really made an important contribution to this, and we have also built a bridge to what is on the agenda in the coming weeks and months.

In any event, this should not avoid the debate on the fiscal rules that the report also advocates: a revision of the fiscal rules allowing the Stability and Growth Pact to be adapted to the orderly management of the economy through the Union as a whole.

This report is our response to the social challenges created by the shock of COVID and our message is clear: to ensure a European recovery that meets the challenges by leaving no one behind. The European Semester will be the instrument of recovery, that is fine, and this report reminds us that social and employment must be as much the priority as our economic stimulus policies. We have to make sure that we all go in the same direction. A revival is an innovative transformation that is economically, just socially and ecologically responsible. For this, three simultaneous priorities. First, the urgency of recovery. The historic recovery plan, adopted last July, will have to support workers, specifically the most insecure, in order to preserve their jobs, wages and working conditions. Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty, supporting the poorest, strengthening the employability of young people must remain our priorities. Second, to maintain our course. This shock requires quick responses. However, we must not give up on our longer-term goals at all. Our economic and social policies must contribute to the objectives of sustainable development, the implementation of the Green Pact and the realisation of the European social rights base. Third, the acceleration of the implementation of the social agenda. Deep inequalities and the weakness of our European social model have been revealed. We must move forward on our agenda for social convergence and the fight against poverty.

The only tool that has been effective and timely so far is the ECB's extraordinary sovereign bond purchase programme, without which the eurozone would have jumped. In order to withstand the shock of the pandemic crisis, the Stability Pact had to be suspended.

This strategy cannot exist without rules. Even in the current epidemic and crisis, these Member States have been given sufficient flexibility to increase the financial space. In the course of the negotiations, I have seen that the main objective of the left is to break down the essence of economic policy coordination and fiscal rules one by one; the People's Party is not a partner for this. The left wants the instrument of coordination between Member States, the semester, which we created to prevent and deal with crises during the Hungarian Presidency, to be filled with all sorts of fashionable topics. If the left succeeds in realise its ideas, we can say goodbye to competitiveness. No free lunch. Funding all left-wing ideas would trigger a wave of spending that would ultimately lead to job losses. We cannot allow our economic policy to become a mess of competing goals. These ideas have been voted down by the Economic Committee, and the left is now trying to smuggle them back with amendments. Irresponsible economic policies would jeopardise the restoration of the Union and ind due to future generations. Hungary citizens of The United States learned what it was like under communism and then socialist-liberal governments, and did not ask for it again. And our fellow Liberal Members are already thinking of a common finance minister in the European Federation, i.e. they would significantly reduce the powers of the Member States. This goes against the treaties and would break the balances in political and economic policy coordination between the Member States and Brussels. Such ideas, in times of crisis, are a waste of time and energy from important things to do, not helping them to recover. I would therefore ask my fellow Members not to vote for the amendments, not to be partners in irresponsible economic policy ideas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 1, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Marc ANGEL", "mepid": "202073", "text": "   – Madam President, the past financial crisis and the answer the EU has given show how cuts in public services had a negative impact on our economic, environmental and social recovery. No progress in poverty reduction and social inclusion shows that many of our social welfare systems are not robust and resilient enough to absorb social shocks during a crisis and also transition. This is why we Socialists and Democrats urge Member States to stop considering public services as a cost but, on the contrary, as an investment to guarantee a decent life for all of us in the Union. And a decent life means wellbeing that includes access to quality education and jobs, as well as social security, healthcare, housing, justice and social services, and also especially for vulnerable groups.  To achieve this, it’s important to change the mind-set of many EU leaders and to come forward with a model that puts social and environmental challenges on an equal footing with economic ones. This is the only way to align our EU policies with the three dimensions of the SDGs and to avoid a lost generation. If we want our next generation in Europe to be strong and resilient, we must invest in their future and therefore must consider Child Guarantee and Youth Guarantee amongst the most precious instruments we have.

Meanwhile, I repeat that the general escape clause will remain, as should the supportive fiscal stance. It is important, I think, that in view of our future discussion, we now concentrate our efforts primarily on implementing what we have already decided, and I’m confident that the Commission and Parliament will work hand in hand in the coming weeks in taking the necessary legislative steps to have these instruments in place.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would just like to mention two things, both of which Mr Ferber mentioned. He said that the EPP has saved us from making debt, as he said in the press and saved us from a new debt trap. I think that is a very good support! The only thing that is ineffective is the criticism, because no one in the working group has asked for such a thing to be done, because that would also be pure nonsense.  We have only said that there are new realities, namely that the EU is in debt, that the debts of the Member States are rising properly and that we have new requirements that we cannot ignore. This requires that we also change our debt rules, and I am curious to see how the EPP argues that we want to maintain a 60% debt target. I am looking forward to this debate.  By the way, many members of the EPP have already realised that it is different. Above all, for example, Chancellor Merkel in Germany, who only rejected European debt at the beginning of the year, but has since endorsed and even proposed it, because she understood that the world has changed. The second thing is that there is a strange contrast between economic policy here and social and environmental policy on the other. At the same time, however, everyone is calling for sustainable growth. What is sustainable growth? Sustainable growth is socially and ecologically compatible. How can we actually achieve this if we do not take this into account in economic policy, what is socially acceptable and what is required from an environmental policy? This is where contradictions are built up that are absurd.  This can either only be understood in such a way that one has not yet understood it or that one actually does not care about sustainability in growth. However, this is extremely difficult from a competition point of view, because companies will only be competitive in future if they operate sustainably, otherwise there will be no competitiveness.  That is why I would like to conclude with a request to the members of the EPP: do not dig into the ideological trenches of the past, but get out. You can take the first steps today by supporting many of the proposals that Renew, the Greens and the S&amp;D have made. I would be very pleased about that and would be a real step forward for our debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "  I'm not going to do that - Madam President, I would like to thank you for your support At the beginning of the debate, I said that I am sure that everyone here in this House wants a strong and successful European Union, and the debate has convinced me that I do, and thank you very much for your support from the various parties, from the factions and from the majority of the different parties. It has been said several times in the debate that the budget deficit, public debt, balance must take precedence. I would also like to reassure the doubters that we are all aware of our responsibility for the future, we are all aware of our responsibility for how the European Union manages. But let's look at what makes a country competitive, innovative, what makes the European Union competitive and innovative? From competitive and innovative people. And what makes people competitive and innovative? If they're smart, if they're healthy, and if they're balanced. This is the european Union's competitive advantage. If we keep doing everything the way we've been doing, we're going to be in trouble. While we have focused on the budget deficit in the last 10 years alone– with relative success – we have seen millions of European children missing out on quality education. How they become smart, competitive, innovative Europeans; I'm going to miss them. While we have focused on the budget deficit, we have allowed a number of Member States to take resources out of health care and today health care is not available to everyone on equal terms in many places, and now we are literally fighting a life-and-death battle against a new virus. How will the European people, who will be able to operate a smart, healthy, innovative and competitive economy in the future, be so smart and healthy? And when I say that we need balanced people, then while we have constantly turned our watchful gaze only and exclusively to the budget deficit, youth unemployment is skyrocketing, while worker poverty has increased over the last ten years and the gap between rich and poor in Europe has not decreased, but has increased. We did something wrong. And now is the opportunity to do something right, to set ourselves goals that are not only about improving economic indicators – and about it – but also about improving the lives of the people of Europe, because what is the point of running an economy well, if not so that people can live well, predictably and safely.

In this context, it is necessary to stress that poverty is not only an economic category and also causes a number of other negative effects, both on people's physical and mental health and on their social security.

We will measure its economic impact for the EU with our autumn forecast in a couple of weeks. The last forecasts released a few hours ago by the IMF states that the negative growth for the euro area will be in 2020 of minus 8.3. Just to compare, we had a negative growth of minus 4.1 in 2009, so during the financial crisis it was less than half the crisis that we could have according to this forecast in 2020. The social consequences will be deep and leave scars. Poverty increase according to the World Bank will be, in the world, around 120-140 million and this could put at risk the efforts to eradicate poverty that were done in the last 30 years. And the social consequences will be deep also in our Union, well beyond the numbers of increased unemployment rates because we know that, yes we have an increase of unemployment rates, but we have increasing gender gap, we have difficult situations for precarious jobs and for children, less educated, so we have deep consequences all in all.  This unprecedented crisis triggered unprecedented reactions and several measures as you know were taken by the Union, beginning with the first decision in March of having much more flexible rules, both on the fiscal and on state aid, and then easing the use of remaining cohesion funds and then the decisions of several loans, including the SURE package in support of short-work schemes.  And then the big decision of Next Generation EU that the Commission proposed at the end of May and the Council adopted at the end of July, and is now under discussion with the Parliament. And these common tools are on top of national responses. I think we should be very well aware of this and on average these national responses amount to around 4.5% of GDP in the Union, and together Member States’ reaction and common reaction makes our stimulus packages comparable and in some case even stronger to those of other global players.  But uncertainty is still there. It is not decreasing. It is may be growing uncertainty in the last weeks, for sure we will not have a so-called V-shaped recovery. We will have to coexist with the virus for a certain amount of time and we have to be very clear in the effort to avoid a double dip recession, keeping supportive fiscal stance and confirming as we did, as Commission, our general escape clause for next year. So now at stake is the implementation and the quality of our decisions. As far as the RRF is concerned, we have to find the right balance between the national ownership, which is fundamental in this initiative – we are not writing memorandum here in Brussels for these plans – and the common priorities and the country-specific recommendation. The balance will be key if we want to have a good result with this Recovery and Resilience Facility.  Our goal in general and in conclusion is to transform our economy in these terrible and difficult crisis, as always happens with crises.

Especially now that the pandemic has unfortunately taken off in many places in Europe.  For me, as a Social Democrat, it is important that the recovery is based on measures that include everyone, regardless of background, and the solutions must be forward-looking. We're going to build a new green economy, not go back to the old one. It is about strengthening social Europe. Today we have an imbalance between people's chances of a good life, both within the EUROPEAN Union and between the Member States. We know that equality brings high benefits for social development, health and the economy. So we have everything to gain from having common ambitions.  We must therefore, as the Commissioner expresses, raise our ambitions in the work on the social pillar. It is a more social and equal Europe, and in order to achieve this, we must seize the opportunities of the European internal market, promote job creation, increase investment, make the transition to the digital society and, above all, make the transition to the climate change.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to speak from Marseille. I wanted to stress that, in the face of this unprecedented health crisis, the Union has reacted quickly. From the outset and within its competences, it has tried to counter the economic and social consequences of COVID-19. Firstly, with the adoption of emergency instruments such as SURE, in support of partial unemployment schemes, then REACT-EU or the rapid adaptation of aid to the poorest. Secondly, the European Union reacted with the presentation of important stimulus tools. Europe is here! I call for the recovery plan to have a strong green and social component by devoting a significant part to environmental objectives and the implementation of the principles of the European social rights base. For my conviction is that there will be no economic recovery and exit from the crisis without the deployment of social measures. I repeat this because I am beyond certain reluctance and the systematic referral to the competences of the Member States alone. Social is horizontal; social is cross-cutting. I would like to emphasize four points. Firstly, some of the resources available through REACT-EU must be directed towards combating the rise of the invisible, the great poverty and the precarious, through the FEAD and the ESF. Secondly, we need, of course, an ambitious multi-year budget, with an ESF that meets the needs and new own resources. Thirdly, investments in digital and green transitions must include powerful components of training and retraining of workers, especially young people, with all the instruments we have: the Fair Transition Fund, the Youth Guarantee, the new skills strategy. Fourthly, the crisis has urgently highlighted some shortcomings in European policy. I am thinking of the Europe of health, of course, which needs to be strengthened, but also of the fact that we need to deploy two new directives in the work of social Europe: one to introduce fair minimum wages in each country of the European Union, the other to guarantee better working conditions and stronger social rights for platform workers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 104, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Jörg MEUTHEN", "mepid": "190518", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group, I would like to make a i-see of the Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very Today we are talking about the EU's ability to mitigate the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. Such a request comes from a superficial view supposedly noble. But the question that needs to be asked here is this: why should this task be a task for the EU in the first place?  Firstly, the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis vary widely from one Member State to another. Secondly, and more importantly, social policy is not the eu's job at all, but social policy is a national task, and that is where it belongs. Each state must and can give its own response to the social challenges. What you are actually doing here is quite another matter and, if I may say so, it is blatantly contrary to national sovereignty. You are acting as a generous savior here, only to gain control over further funding and thus to expand your own power. In this way, you are only striving to pave the way to the EU's statehood, using the COVID-19 crisis in a targeted manner.  But the problems of this crisis must and can also be solved by and in the nation states themselves. If the Member States take different measures, that is a good thing. Competition for the best solution is always better than a false centralised strategy for all. You can see your wrong approach by setting up an almost gigantic EUR 750 billion recovery fund without even a single word being said about what exactly is to be done with these EUR 750 billion. All this, in order to finance a reconstruction that is neither your task nor, despite all your Cassandra calls, will actually be necessary in this dimension.  You are in the process of opening another chapter in the history of the decline of your presumption of power.

We in Europe are facing more than 200 000 corona deaths, 5 million corona cases, 15 million unemployed and countless people on short-time work. Europe's citizens look to us, to the European institutions, and whether and how we manage the crises – crises in the majority. This is an economic crisis, a social and distribution crisis and a climate crisis. The European Parliament has repeatedly made it clear in recent months that there are large European majorities for a more social Europe, a Europe in which we share the costs of crises in solidarity and support each other. So we now need to invest heavily out of these crises. And our actions should also focus on the victims of the crises and those who carry us through these crises on a daily basis – including women, for example. There is therefore an urgent need for a European care deal and massive investment in health, care and public services – as this crisis has shown. And if we want to combat rising poverty effectively, we must quickly launch a social-policy offensive, which must go far beyond short-term measures– for example, on short-time working. That would be, for example, European unemployment reinsurance, that would be a Europe-wide minimum wage and that would be an initiative on minimum security. I warmly welcome the Council's agreement on a framework for a minimum European guarantee – a minimum income. And we hope that the European Commission will also come forward with proposals quickly.  However, the climate crisis also requires us to set clear the course for green jobs, and I want – and I believe this together – that we should use the Covid 19 crisis as an opportunity to promote European integration and the transformation of our economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 106, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Beata SZYDŁO", "mepid": "197553", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Firstly, solidarity, secondly, solidarity and, thirdly, solidarity.

But we should continue to work on preparing and carrying out precisely such projects, such plans, which will take into account the solidarity and justice that I have already mentioned.

Fortunately, on this occasion we have been able to push forward an agreement for the essential Recovery Fund, which can be fairly distributed or can benefit them again.  Why do we say this? Because Europe is a place of enormous asymmetry and there are usually a few who benefit from public resources.  This is particularly serious in sectors such as industry, where we often see relocations that have taken advantage of subsidies, condemned thousands of workers to unemployment, and left us with no capacity to produce what we need. An example of this, here in Spain: Alcoa.  However, we believe that the crisis can be an opportunity to change things. The pandemic has shown that only public control guarantees the well-being of all. That is why we need an industry subject to public control and planning and, of course, that responds to the challenges of the climate emergency and creates quality jobs.

Yesterday sure's reception was extraordinary on the financial markets, but there is still no clarity on cross compliance.

For example, a pan-European minimum wage as a minimum measure to protect workers. However, in order for the measures to be effective, they must be implemented immediately and without conditions which make these proposals impossible. This means in practice 'mitigating the economic and social impact' in the face of this unprecedented and exceptional situation, and creating resilient economies and social systems through investment — particularly in public health.  The attempt to exploit the pandemic to impose small memoranda on the Member States is rejected. The role of the European Central Bank is equally important and decisive for the real economy.

This means that governments have much greater room for manoeuvre than without it, but this same opportunity also has obvious risks. We must prevent governments from using this European money to build new like-minded elites, to build client networks that, among all, can be perpetuated in power. This money , the European funds - must by no means be the money that finances a long election campaign to any government.

For both shipping lines and airlines, for example. These sectors are the most impacted and the collapse of the players in place would mechanically generate the collapse of trade and thus an even greater economic shock.

There the management of Covid has become a political field battle, followed with outrage by the rest of the countries of the Union.

Many general issues have already been raised, so let me mention a specific case, an issue that should certainly affect us in this Parliament. I mentioned the situation of border operators here five months ago. Border operators have also been hit hard in this crisis. I am thinking of entrepreneurs with, for example, a company in the Netherlands, who pay tax in the Netherlands and pay social charges in the Netherlands. But those who, because they live in another country, in this case often Belgium or Germany, are not eligible for Dutch support. For many of them, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep their heads above water. I had hoped that this situation would be resolved by five months later, but the opposite is true: the Dutch Secretary of State stubbornly insists that the Tozo scheme (temporary bridging scheme for self-employed persons) is an assistance scheme and therefore does not need to be exported. It is therefore logical that these people look to Europe for help. Because the only reason they are not getting this support is because they are using their treaty rights in the area of free movement, treaty rights for which we must ensure that they are guaranteed. I was therefore very pleased that the European Commission, in response to my question, made it very clear that the Netherlands was wrong. That there are elements of social security in this scheme and that these people should therefore be able to be helped. It has not changed the attitude of the Netherlands and the Secretary of State and the border entrepreneurs are still out in the cold! I have therefore lodged with you, with a large number of them, additional complaints with the European Commission. I would therefore like to call on you, Commissioner, today: look carefully at these complaints, read the harrowing stories of these entrepreneurs and help us take steps to ensure that these people are still helped.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 126, "date": "2020-10-21.json", "name": "Jonás FERNÁNDEZ", "mepid": "125046", "text": "   – Madam President, I think it is right to recognise that we are, first of all, facing a health crisis with a deep recession in which economic policy can barely put cotton.

Because I would also like to remind you that inflation is still in the euro area on negative ground and we are still a long way from that 2% target. Therefore, there is scope to implement greater fiscal policy, but also greater monetary policy. And when the health crisis begins to subside and we begin to see some certainty about the future—and we all hope it will be sooner sooner without later—we must recognize that this crisis will leave deep scars on our societies, on a few generations, the youngest, that they will have suffered two crises in just a decade.

On the one hand, the Recovery Fund can become the economic recovery fund of the countries' economies and, on the other hand, it now needs, here and now, a new strong corresponding fund which can be called the 'social recovery fund'. This fund will immediately be able to channel money into the market for our unemployed, as there is a risk that the unemployment funds of all countries will collapse, for small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers, vulnerable groups, pensioners, the socio-economic whole. This is particularly important because the economic recovery fund (EUR 1.4 trillion) will take too long to bring money to market.

As a cautionary example, I would like to mention the Austrian truck company MAN. MAN received huge amounts of taxpayers' money, EU support for reconstruction, and now the company is leaving, leaving 2,000 people in unemployment.

In addition, it is mostly women who are not only double and triple burdened, but are also the first to be dismissed. They are our heroines of this crisis.  Where exactly is your support nice?

From the level of the Republic of Croatia and the Government of the Republic of Croatia, it also acted quickly and efficiently to support, first of all, the private sector, workers and employers in order to preserve jobs.

So this is my first point. The crisis is not behind us because this crisis is not like a war that finishes at a certain point and, with the end of the war, reconstruction begins. In this case, we will have a certain amount of time where emergency policies and recovery policy will go hand in hand. I think the awareness in the Parliament of the importance of a common reaction is very strong. I have to say that this common reaction came first of all from a sentiment of solidarity, which is a very good and European sentiment, but also from a common interest: the common interest to preserve the single market, because all we are seeing now shows that our concerns about the fact that this crisis could have uneven consequences among different sectors and Member States have been confirmed. So we are seeing that distances are there. Again, this common interest is not behind us. This is one of the reasons why we should continue to support the recovery with our fiscal policies in the next period. I think that several interventions mentioned the need to make the best possible use of the Recovery and Resilience Facility. What the Commission is committed to is finding the right balance because this is not a memorandum written in Brussels that we have to impose on Member States. These will be proposals coming from Member States and the Commission will work to make sure that these proposals are coherent with our common priorities and with countless specific recommendations, and not only linked to tactical or short-term goals.  But I repeat that the starting point will be national decisions, national governments and national parliaments. Several honourable Members rightly say that we need stronger coordination, but we all know — and you know better than me — that it’s always necessary to find the right balance between the demand for stronger coordination and the demand to preserve a national role. We are not a federal state. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, according to political and cultural points of view, but the fact is that we are not. So we have some sectors and some areas where the coordination is easier and others where it is more difficult. I think on this occasion we should go further in coordination, especially on health care safety measures, border coordination and the whole situation concerning travel, which is really very difficult among Member States. But of course this is an effort that the Commission can easily make, if Member States allow us. I appreciate the fact that I understand Parliament is strongly advocating for this stronger coordination.  Several honourable Members took the floor on social issues and our social model. I think that overall in this crisis our social model showed its difficulties, but also its strengths. I think we can be proud of our social model if we compare the social consequences of this crisis in other parts of the world where we don’t have social services or even where we have authoritarian models in government.  In my view, the European social model confirms its strength, but of course we have to reinforce it. We have to confirm the commitment to make the social pillar crucial in our semester. We have to be aware that the crisis is increasing social inequalities and that we have winners and losers. We have winners from this crisis, not only rich people in general, but also sectors of our global economy. For example, the digital global platforms are winners in this crisis. We will speak about this when we speak about digital taxation, own resources, etc. but, for sure, they are the winners in this crisis and other sectors that were mentioned here — culture, entertainment, travel, tourism, SMEs, and I am sure that I am forgetting something — are the losers in this crisis. This means that they will need support for a longer time than others. We can’t change and phase out the support in these sectors too soon.  Finally, I think that there is broad consensus on the fact that our goal, the goal of this unprecedented common response, is not only to revive our economies and go back to where we were at the end of 2019. We are all aware of the difficulties and some of them were mentioned here. Climate transition is not easy in many countries, but we are also aware of the tremendous responsibility that we have during this crisis to seize the opportunity to change our societies and our economies for the better.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be here today from Berlin with you to have this important debate, which affects all of us every day. Whether in our morning coffee, in chocolate, in grilled meat, even in car seats, in many of our everyday consumer and consumer goods lies the destruction of our forests. And we consumers often unconsciously contribute to this. Forests are being cleared, burned and rolled down all over the world to make way for agriculture. It is made room for the cultivation of soy, coffee, cocoa, palm oil and other raw materials. The same applies to cattle, whose meat and leather are also traded on the European market and contribute to 10% of global deforestation. Since there are no uniform rules or reliable labels, we cannot be sure that the coffee beans, soybean food and cowhide do not come from areas such as the Amazon, which have been deliberately converted into agricultural land there. So it is that the rainforest is literally burning on another continent for the steaks that we put on the grill here in Europe. Europe's largest meat processors and steakhouse chains regularly source their products from leading Brazilian meat producers, who are associated with the destruction of forests, even though they have committed themselves not to cut down forests. Deforestation is even in European cars: recently, NGOs revealed that a well-known German car brand buys the leather for some of its luxury cars from Italian suppliers, who in turn source their material from Paraguayan farms, which ruthlessly extend their agricultural activities to the forests of the Gran Chaco. In 2019 alone, ladies and gentlemen, an area the size of a football field was destroyed every two minutes in Paraguay. And that's just one of many examples. In 2019, there was a loss of primary rainforests the size of Belgium. Countries such as Brazil, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia are one of the hardest hit. Europe contributes to this global deforestation through its consumption. And no one in Europe should be able to opt for or against a deforestation-free product before the supermarket shelf, but at the moment there are no European rules prohibiting this. The European Commission announced in its communication on the protection of international forests last year that it would take action against it. And the work plan presented – and we are very pleased about this, Mr Sinkevicius , confirms this.  But we in the European Parliament have not been idle and prepared. We are voting this week on a report that contains demands for this legislative initiative, ensinrating a simple principle: if a company wants to bring products to the EU – after all, the largest in the world – it must demonstrate that the entire supply chain, including suppliers, business partners and traders, does not include products or services related to deforestation or the destruction of other valuable ecosystems.  But the destruction of forests, the green lungs of our planet, home to 80% of rural biodiversity and one of our strongest allies in the fight against climate change, is not only an ecological disaster, it is also a social one. The destruction of forests is often the result and cause of human rights violations. That is why companies must also be able to demonstrate that their products are not linked to violations of labour rights, land grabs and violence against those who live with, with and in forests. Where human rights violations or destruction of nature are part of a supply chain, even though a company would have had influence over it, European companies should be able to be held liable for this damage under civil law and pay compensation. Contrary to what is often claimed, companies are therefore not held responsible for transactions over which they have no influence whatsoever. They should only comply with their own due diligence obligations. A law without a liability rule would be little more than a toothless declaration of intent.  These rules should also apply to financial institutions. People need to be reassured that their facilities will not be used to fund environmentally destructive, human rights-violating activities. Globalisation could thus be made fairer and more sustainable thanks to strong European standards. In this way, we make a difference and organise a green deal that not only applies within Europe, but also fulfils our global responsibility. Many companies share the position that responsibly produced goods are not nice—to—have for marketing reasons, but a necessity for the survival of our planet. The legislative framework outlined here would support companies that are already doing their business responsibly. At the same time, fair competition would be created against those who have so far profited at the expense of nature and people.  The European Parliament is therefore in charge this week of putting pressure on the Commission to adopt an ambitious proposal. Ursula von der Leyen said in her candidacy speech that if we support them, she will take legislative proposals from Parliament seriously. Parliament should call on them today to remind them of this promise. And today we should give Mr Sinkevicius an ambitious proposal in the further work, so that we do not have a bitter aftertaste when it comes to enjoying chocolate or coffee, and that we in Europe take a global leadership role against deforestation, for nature conservation and respect for human rights. And that is what we have the opportunity to do today.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr \"The forest whispers of the labors of ancestors. When I walk in the local forests, the traces are everywhere of generations' work for the well-being of future generations.\" So a friend of mine expressed himself when I asked some acquaintances what the forest means to them. I come from a country that is half forest. Forests are one of our main resources, creating growth and benefits and which generations of forest owners have managed with care and long-term care long-term long-term care long before the word sustainability became an international concept.  The forest is the lungs of the earth, a pantry, an energy resource. The forest is home to invaluable biodiversity and a place of peace of mind. As a carbon sink, forests are absolutely crucial for saving the climate. At the same time, however, an increasingly warmer climate threatens the future of forests. Deforestation is a global problem, a threat to the climate, a threat to the survival of species. But also a threat to long-term economic growth. Illegal logging does not only lead to environmental problems. It also leads to poverty, loss of tax revenue and risk of increased corruption.  Getting more countries to cooperate in sustainable trade in forest products is extremely important, and doing so together with industry and in cooperation with civil society is necessary. The EU framework, FLEGT, which aims at sustainable forestry and combating illegal logging, is part of this. That is why we need to develop and strengthen this cooperation and make it easier for more countries, companies and foresters to conduct and trade forest products in a sustainable way. It benefits us, it benefits us all and it benefits future generations.

Let me congratulate you, Ms Burkhardt, and the entire Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on your important report, which calls for an EU legal framework to halt and reverse EU—driven global deforestation. It is good to see that we agree on the importance of this subject, and that we share a sense of urgency.  Our EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 stresses the importance of increasing the quantity, quality and resilience of our own forests. But while the area covered by forests in Europe increases, forest degradation and international deforestation threaten the well—being of all of us. Deforestation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, causing climate change. It is pushing animals and plants to extinction and affecting the rights of indigenous peoples in some parts of the world. In short, it is akin to choking life on Earth.  Deforestation is also a complex problem, and there is no easy solution. No major economy in the world has yet managed to eliminate products linked to deforestation for its supply chains, and yet this is exactly what we have to do and what we plan to do. EU demand and consumption, our way of life, should not trigger deforestation and forest degradation. In fact, this should go for everyone. We have to break the link.  Your report and the legislative initiative resolution which this House will adopt tomorrow is an extremely important contribution in this regard. We particularly appreciate that through this report, the European Parliament has been truly effective in drawing attention to the issue of deforestation. Public awareness and support are crucial if we really want to change things. The report addresses highly relevant issues and contains a number of important messages. It is certainly true that the limited uptake of voluntary schemes failed – failed to deliver on the promise of reducing deforestation – and that mandatory action is needed. Getting the product scope right and ensuring that it is scientifically based and regularly updated will definitely be a key aspect of any future action. It is also true that we should not forget that high carbon stock and biodiversity rich ecosystems, other than forest, marine and coastal ecosystems, wetlands, peatlands or savannas are equally threatened.  Let me be clear, we are determined to act and to use the EU’s economic weight to help protect, restore and sustainably manage the world’s forests. As you probably know, we have already started preparatory work on a new legislative proposal to curtail the placing of products associated with deforestation or forest degradation on the European market. This objective is enshrined in the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and farm—to—fork strategy. We are currently working on an impact assessment and we have launched a public consultation that will run until 10 December. The adoption of this proposal is currently scheduled for next year, 2021, the second quarter.  In the current impact assessment process and in line with our better regulation principle, we are of course assessing a variety of policy options. These include due diligence and bilateral agreements with third countries, but not only. We are, for example, studying the system put in place by the EU regulation to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as well as different forms of verification systems, among other options. In parallel, we are also conducting a fitness check of the rules in place to fight illegal logging, namely the EU timber regulation and the FLEGT regulation, to take action into account of our past experience and better understand what has worked and what has failed. We expect to finalise these fitness checks in early 2021, so that their results can duly inform the decision—making process. We have been implementing the due diligence system of the EU timber regulation for more than seven years and have been negotiating and implementing flexible, voluntary partnership agreements for much longer.  Let me be clear, we will certainly not shy away from proposing strong mandatory action to address the problem, but we need to make sure that whatever we propose works, that it has the necessary impact on the ground and that it is compatible with our WTO obligations.  Let me conclude by saying that the report of the European Parliament constitutes an important contribution and goes beyond the legislative work of the Commission, meaning it should also translate in the work of other sectors, including working in partnership with producing countries to reduce pressures on forest and help them implement sustainable forest—based value chains – ones adopted by this House. We will carefully analyse your recommendations and will duly consider these when developing our proposal. Honourable Members, between 1990 and 2020, about 10% of the world’s forest cover was destroyed – an area bigger than India. If deforestation were a nation, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US. We cannot underestimate this challenge, and we have to act. This is also why our efforts to curtail the risk of deforestation and forest degradation feature prominently in the Commission’s work programme for the next year, which the College adopted only two days ago. It is our responsibility to do our part to change this course and it is in our hands to do it effectively, already in upcoming months. Let us not waste this unique opportunity. Let us do this together.

We can also produce protein in Europe itself, which is possible, and we must go down these paths.  Palm oil - another big issue. We have decided not to use palm oil any more than renewable energy. That should actually be done sooner. However, it is also quite clear that free trade agreements, Commissioner, such as the Mercosur Agreement , must be dealt with differently from what is now on the table.

We in the EU are contributing to this destruction by consuming soya, palm oil and meat. Even if our share is only 10%, it is clear to us that we must act, we must reverse this trend, we must protect forest areas!  With this draft new EU legal framework, which we jointly adopted in the Green Deal resolution, we are taking the right steps. We want the entire supply chain to be traceable for products that are particularly hazardous to forests, especially the place where the product originates. We want to make sure that it does not come from an area for which forest has been cleared. If we could achieve such a set of rules for all companies that want to bring their products to the European market in the future, then we would have made real great progress in terms of our responsibility as Europeans for forest protection worldwide. But, ladies and gentlemen, for this we need companies as partners, because the state cannot monitor every tree and every farmer.  We need tougher measures when the risk is greater. We need actionable measures that can also be implemented for small and medium-sized enterprises. We need an impact assessment in advance, we need legal certainty through clear guidelines. I think we are wise to use existing certification systems, improve and standardise them if necessary, and ideally label the 'EU-certified'. We have made a long-distance impact in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and The European People's Committee on the Environment. It is not only the forest that is to be protected, but also human rights, especially the rights of indigenous peoples. That is right, because we must also face up to this responsibility. However, we should not create facts through the back door and bypass the lead committees in formulating binding due diligence, as this report is intended to do.  Ladies and gentlemen, this new legal framework combines the great hope and expectation that we will significantly reduce deforestation, which is the result of consumption in the EU, and thus have a standard-building effect on the other 90% of consumers worldwide.

They are the lungs of this earth. There is an ongoing and very worrisome trend, with the loss of global tree cover and the destruction of forest in many third countries outside of Europe. This has dramatic consequences for our climate and our ecosystems. It also has grave social impacts. Almost one in every four people in the world today depend on forests for their daily livelihood and income. Indigenous people around the world – for example, in the Amazon – are heavily dependent on forests, and deforestation threatens their livelihood. There are also completely flagrant and abhorrent human rights violations due to conflicts linked to the situation. In the Amazon region alone, we have seen how more than 300 people have been killed in resource and land use conflicts in the last decade. This is really awful and can never be accepted. Although this deforestation takes place in other parts of the world, we see here in Europe that we have a responsibility to act. Our own consumption is a big part of the problem; it contributes to at least 10 % of global deforestation. Therefore, we must look at ways to better ensure that we halt global deforestation, including through our own consumption.

Mr President, Commissioner, I think we all want, when we have a cup of coffee, when your children or mine eat a chicken cutlet, to know whether or not we are contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon. Today, unfortunately, as we do not know, as no European rule prevents products from deforestation in the Amazon or, in Africa, the Congo basin or, in Asia, Indonesia, it is very likely that, without our knowledge, we will contribute to it.

Good morning, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I call on us to appreciate the importance of the text we are debating today and for which I congratulate its rapporteur Delara Burkhardt. We can defend forests for their beauty, we can defend them for the mysterious bond they forge between us and the origins of the world, we can defend forests because we defend the rights of nature. But let us also be convinced that we must defend forests because by protecting them, it is our very existence that we protect, because forests are the lung of humanity and the planet. Between 1970 and 2012, 58% of vertebrate animals disappeared due to deforestation. So can we imagine preserving biodiversity without preserving the world's forests? The answer is no. Can we hope to meet our climate commitments without preserving the world's forests? Again, the answer is no, because forests cover 31% of the Earth's surface and are, after the oceans, the second largest carbon sink on the planet. To continue to destroy them is to condemn us to lose the battle of the climate.  I would add that deforestation exacerbates the threats to indigenous communities, victims of attacks, sometimes even murders, because they claim to defend their lands and their rights. Deforestation is the other name for the violation of people's rights. Who claims to defend human rights must therefore put an end to it. Let us be clear: our forests continue to be destroyed for the benefit of trade; short-term profits still prevail today. Industrial agriculture alone is responsible for 40% of global deforestation, the European Union 10%. So yes, Europe must lead the way.

It is time to put an end to this disaster, but the solution is certainly not to label which products are zero deforestation and which are not, thus leaving the consumer the choice, as some suggested, but to ensure that those products made by deforestation, conversion and degradation of natural ecosystems cannot be sold on the European market.

The main driver of deforestation is the expansion of agricultural land and the production of three commodities: soy, beef and palm oil. The Union has a share in this as it imports up to 10% of the global consumption of products associated with deforestation. We will ask the Commission to come up with a legal framework to prevent this and make supply chains bringing products to our markets sustainable. The global preservation of forests and preventing their degradation are some of the biggest sustainability challenges of our time. Crucial steps are needed to achieve this, but we are opposing and fighting these steps even in this very House. We should stop pretending that there exists a single ultimate solution called sustainable forest management, a remedy for deforestation. We will lose primary forests all around the world in a vain attempt to manage them sustainably. We must protect primary forests from being extracted. However, not only forests are affected by the degradation as a result of economic activities. In Brazil, the Cerrado ecosystem is a biodiversity hotspot, home to 5% of global biodiversity. The conversion and degradation of this ecosystem has been happening at a faster pace than for the Amazon rainforest and it is crystal clear that these ecosystems will be exposed to increased pressure to be turned into agricultural land. The problem is complex.  I will vote in favour of a call for a legal framework that takes account of forest and other valuable ecosystems and therefore recognises forest and ecosystem risk commodities.

However, we must actually do something good with this, rather than just creating a green fig leaf. Central to this is the law in practice, that it is feasible and does not only mean uncalculated risks and high bureaucratic burdens for our companies. Firstly, we will continue to need imports and we will depend on them: many fruits, such as cocoa, coffee, tea and others, are not growing here in Europe. Secondly, the environmental contribution of such a supply chain law will only be positive if we continue to trade with the affected regions and help them to become more sustainable.  We will be insulated by an unworkable law. If exports are indeed shifting towards other countries that have less concern, nothing will be gained for the rainforest, Commissioner.

The phrase \"cutting the branch on which you sit\" has never been more true, dramatically true. Added to this are the problems that are encountered everywhere else. Palm oil production, for example, is still in its infancy in Cameroon or the DRC. A disaster announced, when we know that this is where the rainforest of the Congo Basin is located - the second largest forest in the world, tomorrow destroyed?

Today’s debate has shown that we very largely agree on this and share those huge concerns. It is also a complex problem that requires concerted action among different players to be addressed.  Let me reply to some remarks and issues you have raised today. On the need for an impact assessment and the need to have businesses on board, I absolutely agree. I can only confirm once more that we are assessing all possible impacts and that we, of course, have to consider also the costs and administrative burden, especially on SMEs, and that we are carefully looking at the scope as well. All these elements are currently being carefully assessed in the context of the ongoing impact assessment.  On the need to protect forests also within the EU, I can only strongly reassure you that tackling global deforestation does not mean we stop looking at our domestic forests. Quite the contrary. This Commission, and I personally, are truly committed to fighting the worrying phenomenon of illegal logging. We have launched infringement procedures and are determined to find this till the end. Also, forests play a central role in our biodiversity strategy for 2030. They are a key focus of our work and, as you know, with Commissioner Wojciechowski I am preparing a forest strategy which updates the previous one and will take into account the recent resolution adopted by this Parliament.  On social aspects and the impact of deforestation on indigenous peoples, yes, the environmental dimension of global deforestation is closely interconnected with fundamental socio—economic factors – with poverty, corruption, human rights abuses and stability. This is why our initiative is so important, and this is why the fight against deforestation has to be fought together with indigenous people and local communities. They have to be part of the solution.  We are not playing delaying tactics, quite the contrary. The Commission is determined to act. We are putting to use our previous policy experience, we are leading exchanges among stakeholders and we are trying to design smart legislation that can ensure meaningful action on the ground. We need to join forces. I would like to thank you once again for your support and your contributions in today’s debate, but also for the legislative initiative resolution that you will adopt tomorrow. We look forward to taking it into account and to continue our close cooperation with this House over the next crucial months.
