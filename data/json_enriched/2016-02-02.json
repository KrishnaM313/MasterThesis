Undeclared work, in its increasingly diverse forms, today deprives them of their fundamental social and labour rights, often putting them in conditions of de facto exploitation, leading to serious market distortions, causing companies that comply with the rules to overcome extremely unfair competition from employers using such work and depriving tax and insurance systems of due revenue and payments. It is to these disadvantaged communities and institutions that we owe this platform and its early and effective activation.  The need to set up this platform becomes even more urgent in view of the escalating threats not only to labour mobility, but also to one of the four indivisible fundamental freedoms– that of the free movement of people and of the very existence of the Union. And I would like to share the view that it is this awareness of urgency, which has increasingly been shared by both fellow parliamentarians and the Luxembourg Presidency and the Commission, that has become the driving force for reaching a constructive agreement around the final draft decision presented to Parliament today. The compromise thus reached commits all Member States to be responsible members of the Platform.  The platform is intended to expand Member States' capabilities to address the many painful problems caused by undeclared work through enhanced union-level cooperation between the relevant national authorities, together with the social partners and with the participation as observers of a wide range of agencies and organisations concerned.  Accordingly, the mission of the Platform was defined as to prevent, restrict and counteract undeclared work and to promote the conversion of such work into declared work.  The proposed platform option, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, will not have the power to lay down rules and norms. Instead, it is called upon to offer the necessary basis for responsible consideration of information, experience and solutions as the basis for shared conclusions aimed at effectively addressing the challenges of undeclared work. The activity within the scope of the Platform includes a wide range of concrete actions in the implementation of its mission. It depends on the decisions of individual Member States to use, where appropriate, the conclusions resulting from such actions and on the institutions of the European Union to take into account those falling within the responsibilities of the Union.  It is true, there were doubts – is the platform at all necessary, will it not undermine the freedom of action of the Member States, is there really room for added value at Union level for action to tackle undeclared work? Rest assured that, in the course of the consultations, the full scope of such doubts and reservations was the subject of the most detailed and comprehensive examination, which made it possible to reach a widely shared consensus and thus to agree on a mutually acceptable and therefore workable draft decision. As a result, the question ultimately boils down to the following: are we truly committed to a common cause against gross violations of fairness in undeclared work, or will opponents find themselves in the position of benefiting all those who exploit so-called labour and therefore make profits as a result of extreme unfair competition, while depriving budgets of income and payments due.  That is, are we about to prevail on the power of the law, or in the prevailing cases, do we leave freedom to rule the so-called \"law of the jungle\"?

Personally I do not like the term social dumping – we are talking about people here, not about goods – but when it comes to undeclared work, we should not camouflage its dramatic effects by using soft words. Undeclared work deprives workers of any protection. It deeply affects the quality of their employment; they can be made to work long hours in bad health and safety conditions without any recourse to justice. People receiving envelope wages, or cash in hand, are sometimes left with little or no pay at all after months of hard work. As a matter of fact, they might not have the right to redundancy payments or unemployment benefits or to any other benefits. They are not building up their pension rights. Undeclared work is not only unfair to the workers involved, it is also unfair to businesses that do play by the rules. We know that small and medium—sized companies are the first to suffer from such unfair competition. Undeclared work also undermines the sustainability of public finances and social security systems, as no taxes or contributions are paid on undeclared activities. Although undeclared work is hidden – which makes it difficult to measure precisely – we know it is widespread in all Member States and difficult to eradicate. Estimates suggest that the shadow economy may reach 15% to 20% of GDP in some Member States. That is why the establishment of a European platform to enhance cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work and to tackle undeclared work is such an important and big step forward. It will encourage cooperation between Member States through exchanging best practices and information, developing expertise and analysis, facilitating innovative approaches to the effective tackling of undeclared work, and contributing to a horizontal understanding of matters. It foresees a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together the expertise of different enforcement authorities such as labour inspectorates, social, tax and immigration authorities. Such a multi—disciplinary approach has already been implemented with good results in some Member States, and I am glad that the European Platform builds upon those good examples. It is only through a holistic approach, across borders and across disciplines, that we will be able to tackle this complex phenomenon effectively. I would like to stress the importance of the inclusion of bogus self—employment in the activities of the Platform. This too is an area in which the development of expertise and exchange of best practices is needed. Finally, I note with satisfaction that the social partners will play an important role in the platform and that close cooperation with Eurofound and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) is foreseen. I would like to thank Parliament for all its efforts in making a timely agreement on the platform possible. In particular, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Pirinski, and to Ms Ulvskog for chairing the trilogue so competently. I would also like to thank the entire negotiation team for their efforts and constructive approach. The Council will now adopt a decision on the platform on 24 February, allowing for the official signature, to which I look forward during the March plenary. In the meantime, we are already preparing for the first meeting of the platform to take place before the summer. I am committed to doing everything possible from my side to make the platform a success. The platform will regularly inform you about its activities and submit its work programmes and reports to the European Parliament and the Council, as well as to the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.

Madam President, precarious work has deteriorated much during the economic crisis. Irresponsible employers blackmail people in need of work, and fear of unemployment pushes workers to work in conditions of illegality.  The platform to combat undeclared work will try to put order in the jungle of unregulated work. Firstly, it is important to extend the role of the platform. The Initial Proposal of the European Commission defines as undeclared work any legal work not declared to the official State authorities. Undeclared work, however, now takes too many forms of employment, e.g. five-hour work is declared, but in reality it is eight hours, overtime is done but they are never paid, there is false self-employment, a cut in contributions up to and including the extreme phenomenon of unpaid work.  The platform is now obliged to examine all this. Member States, the European Commission, employers and workers together with employment agencies must sit around a table to understand the situation of undeclared work across Europe. Today, when introversion prevails and nationalism comes back, it is crucial that we listen and learn from each other. In addition, we must try to develop joint actions to combat cross-border undeclared work.  Is that enough? We wanted strict mandatory actions imposed by the European Union. I also regret that a representative of the European Institute for Gender Equality has not been included as an observer of the platform's work. We believe that women's bodies should be heard every time they have to contribute with their experience and suggestions. We're not reconciling, we're just getting started.  I would like to say a big thank you to our rapporteur, Mr Pirinski, who was a model negotiator. I would also like to congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency and say that when people believe in the same cause and work with determination they may not achieve everything they wanted, but they certainly make it difficult for offenders.

Working on the black is certainly one of Europe's most important problems, which has very serious budgetary implications. However, even more than the budgetary implications, of course, are the important consequences that working on the blacklist has for the people who do this work. Social dumping is inadmissible in Europe these days. But it is governments that are primarily responsible for preventing black working in their country. People who, in different life circumstances, agree to this form of work, are usually not well enough aware of the long-term consequences this entais. And of course... these long-term consequences are much worse than those in the short term, when people get some money so they can survive. However, as has already been mentioned, these forms of work are very different and are very differently addressed by the states. It is therefore right that we, even at European level, establish some common guidelines, some guidelines for preventing black work. And by setting up a platform, that is exactly what we will achieve. Of course, I also advocate that the involvement of the social partners is extremely important, but it is also right that we have maintained the principle of subsidiarity.

After all, undeclared work has huge consequences for our European economies. Unfair competition is on the increase massively in many sectors, and this has consequences not only for companies that want to offer fair offers, but also, in fact, many social consequences for the workers concerned. Before this platform, the European level has carried out almost no initiative to combat undeclared work and unannounced employment, even though we are actually living in a European labour market. If we look at national labour controls, their competence ends at the respective national borders. The platform can really only be a first step, but it is a step in the right direction. I share what one of the previous speakers said: we need more commitment to combating undeclared work. In fact, the identification of letterbox companies, controls on national services and also cross-border labour controls are still unresolved. It is good that all Member States must participate in the platform in a binding manner.

There has been a great deal of cooperation and I think we have all benefited from that. Undeclared work is a very serious subject which impacts on all the Member States. It particularly affects tax evasion – which is a real problem – benefit fraud, illegal immigration, and of course it undercuts legitimate businesses and entrepreneurs and undermines workers as well. So I think that this platform is a really good example of just how the European Union should operate. It recognises the sovereignty of Member States and it adds value by sharing experience and best practice and cross-border cooperation. So this is where we can really see an enhancement through this platform – an enhancement of cooperation between the Member States – while recognising their individual sovereignty. We need to recognise that the level of undeclared work varies from state to state; for example, in the UK, according to the OECD data, the level of the informal economy is about 1.7 %, whereas in some Member States it is as high as 30%. My group had four priorities. First, the scope of the platform would be limited and focus on enforcement, exchange of best practice, and knowledge-sharing, rather than creating and mandating standardised approaches. Second, it is important that it fully respects the principle of subsidiarity and the competences of Member States. Thirdly, although participation is compulsory and mandatory, which is fine, the activities are entirely on a voluntary case-by-case basis.

The fact that membership is mandatory means that all Member States must participate, and therefore they must be involved in exchanging information and developing expertise and analysis, and that in itself will contribute to a horizontal understanding of all matters related to undeclared work. However, while participation is mandatory, any recommendations for action that are supported by the platform are voluntary for Member States to implement. This approach is much more carrot than stick, and I believe that those Member States having participated in the development of tools for sharing information, and for the enforcement of shared practices to tackle undeclared work, are much more likely to implement such action themselves. The platform will not contradict any national legislation and will not propose harmonisation of any laws, but it will provide a strong framework for enhanced cooperation. The extent of undeclared work in the EU is up to 18% of EU GDP, and it is important to remember that undeclared work has negative outcomes both for workers themselves and for society. Many of the workers are in a vulnerable position: they often have to accept poor working conditions and there is very often no commitment to health and safety, no social protection, no pension contributions, precarious working conditions, etc., whilst society loses out because of tax and social security forgone and also unfair competition between companies. In our next debate we look at the anti-tax-avoidance package, which recognises the importance of coordinated action.

It is deeply damaging not only to the individual worker who loses his rights, but also to our community. We are losing sustainable and good jobs and we are losing important income tax. In this light, it is a very good and positive initiative. Coordination is really needed.  But why not go even further? Why do we not set the Member States really free and give them a free framework to introduce controls and require registrations when they think it is true?

Many of them, of course, come from the Luxembourg area, where our own President Juncker was prime minister for 15 years.

The reason companies avoid tax is that private companies can put their money to better use than the public sector ever will. The GBP 55 million a day Britain sends to this place is a prime example.

An employer, on the one hand, and a worker, on the other, both agree to pay no taxes, no taxes and no payroll taxes.  What for? Because work no longer allows the employer to prosper and workers to live. To supposedly adapt and support globalization because of your fiscal policies and austerity policies that destroy jobs by the millions, what are the choices of an employer and a worker?  The employer can either file for bankruptcy and disappear, or relocate and destroy jobs in his country, or call on seconded workers, to the detriment of national workers, or, and this is the purpose of our report, not to declare these workers. On the other hand, the worker, with or without a job, can either emigrate to better skies, but it is not simple, or take advantage of unemployment insurance, but that is not enough, or go around all the aid associations to feed, dress and stay, but as a family, it is complicated, or work in the dark, simply to fill their refrigerator.

Madam President, when undeclared work throughout the Union rages at 20%, while in Greece it exceeds 36% and in profitable sectors such as tourism 44%, particularly hitting women and young people and the Union's main aim, as it states, is to reduce so-called non-wage costs by exempting employers and the State from the cost of insurance, it is literally a mockery to worry about reducing undeclared work. As even \"aspirin\" measures are not proposed by the platform. It treats it only as unfair competition between companies, as a vehicle for squeezing wages, as an incentive to partially convert black work into flexible work, part-time and rotating employment, blocks, exploitation of apprenticeships, social cooperative entrepreneurship, slave trade offices.  Of course, black work will continue to exist because it's in your system's interest. For example, in Greece the increase of insurance and tax contributions to 75% of the total income to self-employed and farmers, with the new SYRIZA-ANEL plan, will increase undeclared work, remove them from insurance, pension and care. The new general reduction in wages and employer contributions, the increase in unemployment is a tombstone for the insurance system and the Funds.

Undeclared workers are also more often exposed to precarious working conditions and the exploitation of rogue companies. In some cases, we can even.m.

The more commodification is caricatured through the globalization of trade, the more the criterion of profitability and productivity takes over the necessary rules of respect for individuals. This globalization takes the lead on the recognition of professional activities as the cornerstone of a country's economic prosperity and the sustainability of quality social protection. This structured social protection is one of the most remarkable characteristics of the social evolution that all European countries have shared over the past two centuries. Inherited from the Christian humanism of mutual aid and relief to the weakest, it was structured with the industrial revolution of the 19th century. But globalization is sweeping away these hard-won social advances with opaque and subterranean profits. The cost of a worker has become the adjustment variable, associating fraud with indecent contributions and wages.  The fight against undclared work is an urgent obligation and all the more important because the new digital industrial revolution is an extraordinary boon to create all the conditions for widespread fraud. It is the very survival of our economies that is at stake. Europe appears to be a very bad step in regulating and curbing the phenomenon. Only states can hope to be effective.

The creation of this European platform is not additional legislation, but a link of cooperation between states, which should lead our far-right colleagues, who are strong proponents of any new European legislation, to vote for it (I do not understand their inconsistencies). This platform will show that the European Union is opening its eyes to this system of unfair competition and that it intends to provide a concerted response between states. In addition, let us not forget that the fight against unreported work must also be played upstream. Indeed, much of the problem also lies - we must have the courage to say so - in national legislation that is often unsuited to the world of work and to the evolution of society.

The platform we are adopting today must be seen as a first step in combating undclared work, because it is finally putting all Member States around the table. It will open an in-depth dialogue between their various administrations and will also limit the use of fake self-employment and mailbox companies. In border areas, this cooperation will clarify responsibilities and limit the current legal uncertainty. However, this platform should not remain an empty shell. It must become operational without delay and allow for a real strengthening of controls and sanctions. It will probably have to focus on the frauds related to the secondment of workers one day as well. But beware, a simple platform won't solve everything. States must also engage in a genuine policy to combat impunity, to adapt taxation and to promote entrepreneurship to encourage a return of workers to legality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Siôn SIMON", "mepid": "124948", "text": "   –  Madam President, first can I just note that it is a bit odd that today’s debate on this matter occurs after the negotiations have been so painstakingly – and, on behalf of Mr Pirinski, brilliantly – concluded in the trilogue.

Secondly, I would just like to respond to our colleagues from UKIP, although as usual they are not actually here for the debates. (Mr Etheridge: Yes we are!) Not the ones who spoke; neither of the ones who spoke have stayed to listen to the rest of the debate, they have done their little bit of theatre and buggered off as usual. They gave us a load of nonsense about how we must not have these measures because it is anti-competitive. They tried to give us lessons about competitiveness and economics, and as usual they do not understand competitiveness and they do not understand economics. The whole point is that, at this end of the labour market, you need regulation in order to have a level playing field. The people who suffer from this lack of regulation, as well as workers, are precisely those small and medium enterprises whose competition is not from massive multinationals, it is from people below them in the labour market not paying taxes, not paying social costs and thereby getting an unfair advantage.

One reason is the empty public coffers and the high level of indebtedness in many Member States.  If you look at the figures for undeclared work in the Member States, they are already very frightening: Greece with 24.6% of gross domestic product, Italy 21.6%. But my own country, Germany, also has a lot of catching up to do; we are currently at 13%.  There are also positive examples in Europe. For example, Austria with less than 10%, which is 7.5%. The creation of a platform with the binding participation of experts from all Member States is therefore, in my view, a right and important step. It is about the exchange of best practice examples.  It was important for me to note that the new body primarily supports tried and tested and functioning methods of undeclared work at national level and creates a constant flow of information between the competent authorities. Harmonisation of control methods has been successfully avoided, which might have led to a weakening of best practice in the Member States.

As the 2013 Eurofound report on the topic pointed out, there are no obvious explanations regarding the dynamics of undeclared work. For example, contrary to what most people would expect, undeclared work does not necessarily go up in times of austerity, and reduced taxes and increased deregulation do not automatically lead to less undeclared work. However, what is obvious from the figures presented is that there are some Member States which are more efficient than others in dealing with this problem. The size of the undeclared economy in Austria compared to its GDP is almost five times less than the endemic proportion reached in my country, for example. If through this platform we succeed in transferring some proven practices across sectors and Member States and regularising a part of the grey economy, we would not only bolster fair competition and ensure more sustainability for public finances, we would also put an end to the exploitation of millions of undeclared workers who do not have the social protection or health and safety guarantees that others enjoy.

As far as I am concerned, with the creation of this platform, Europe is taking an important additional step in the fight against undeclared work, bogus self-employment and other fraud.  It is the government's job to guard against the rules of the game, but in a single market, fraud does not stop at national borders. That is why I think it is right for Europe to take responsibility for this too. Responsibility towards workers who are denied their social rights by undeclared work and fraud. Malpractice is particularly pre-occurs in dangerous occupations and in vulnerable groups, such as low-skilled women or migrants. But also responsibility to the Member States which are losing their income as a matter of fraud and whose social security is so under pressure. Freedom of movement within the EU is our greatest achievement and we must not allow it to be undermined by unfair practices. Cooperation is therefore the key word. That is why I call for this important fight not to get bogged down in contradictions between Eastern and Western European Member States, for example. Everyone has to go in the bath.

It is linked to the huge unemployment that exists and the pressure on employers to have black work. At the same time, undeclared work also means a huge loss of contributions to insurance funds. We see this, in particular, in Greece, where we have a huge tax evasion. A tax evasion that undermines the entire functioning of the insurance system.  In my view, of course, if the state wants to, it can hit tax evasion and it can do so effectively.

Both dossiers will ensure, including this platform to combat undeclared work, that there is a better level playing field for business - certainly SMEs crave it - that everyone pays their fair share, both to the social security authorities and to the tax authorities, and that undeclared work is combated and preferably converted into regular work, into quality jobs, which is better for everyone.  The platform involves all the relevant authorities, including the social partners. It is good that they also have a voice, because they know the reality at the grassroots better than anyone else. The platform provides a structure, but not a straitjacket, to put your hands together and act effectively. The platform does not replace member states' inspections. Nor does it take powers from the Member States. It does, however, ensure that the possibilities available to the Member States are supplemented. It will encourage the Member States - and this is the intention - to make their inspections more effective and, why not, to be inspired by each other's best practices for their policies. By working together, everyone will win, I'm not just convinced of that. I hear you share that view.

As the Commissioner began her initial intervention this morning, she highlighted the particular severity of the complex problem of undeclared work and the corresponding need for clear talking and for very definite and unequivocal conclusions, and she stated further intentions for action. I would like to highlight what I believe has been the underlying conclusion: that the various direct impacts of undeclared work on workers, tax and social security systems, and unfair competition, finally come back down to a threat to the very fabric of society in each of the Member States and throughout the European Union. If I am not mistaken, yesterday evening President Draghi began his intervention by pointing out that, at present, the European Union is faced with increasing infringements relating to social cohesion – economic, territorial and social cohesion. It is not by chance, I believe, that he began with that point, because whatever efforts for job creation, investment and fiscal responsibility we want to implement, if the basic fabric of the society in which we are trying to implement such measures is being destroyed, then they are hopelessly forsaken. Therefore I believe, as has been pointed out, that this platform has seemingly built an acceptable balance between the concerns for individual Member States’ rights and the need for Union input so that the problem is better tackled. I see that the time is over. I can only second the intention which was mentioned. We hope the platform is put into action before the summer.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I made a commitment to you some time ago, in a previous debate, to provide the quick answers you expect to the challenges of tax evasion and evasion. The package we adopted last week is making that promise a way. This debate is an opportunity for me to present this answer and it also confirms, in line with the measures adopted last year - you remember our two packages in March and June - that it is possible to act quickly and clearly on corporate taxation.  First of all, at the beginning of this debate, I would like to welcome the decisive role of the European Parliament on these issues. Your House has given valuable support to the Commission in redefining the contours of fairer, more transparent and more effective taxation in terms of content, but also in terms of political impetus. This topic could not and could not progress without your commitment. Our institutions, the Commission and Parliament, as you know, are often in tune. On what? On the absolute need to adopt concrete measures to really combat abusive tax optimisation and strengthen tax transparency, which is our common goal. The measures recommended in various reports presented to this House last year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Special Committee on Tax Rulings and similar measures by their nature or effect (TAXE) have highlighted these convergences and, unsurprisingly, many of the measures contained in the package reflect - you can and will see - the recommendations made by this House. So I'm very happy to be here this morning, in tune with you, but let's now come to the package itself. Our desire for reform is very simple and deeply shocking: some companies today do not pay their fair share of taxes, or even pay taxes at all. This is a situation that has become, for many of our fellow citizens, absolutely unbearable. This strategy, which I would describe as a circumvention strategy, takes advantage of an international and European tax system that is clearly no longer adapted to today's economy, that is, an economy that is global, mobile and complex. In response to this, to combat this inadequacy, the package I am presenting to you rests on four pillars. First, effective taxation, not theoretical, taxation of companies. It's very simple: companies have to pay their taxes where they generate profits. Second, a qualitative leap for tax transparency. Thirdly, a healthy and fair tax competition, and finally a fine articulation between the internal dimension of the European Union, which we must address, and the external dimension, which we must also take into account. I come back to those pillars, in that order. First: effective taxation. The initiatives presented last week will ensure this effective corporate taxation. This means that, in reality, there must be a strong link between taxation and where the profits are generated. To this end, we will rely, with your support, on two instruments: a directive and a recommendation.  We first drafted a proposal for an anti-tax evasion directive. I do not want to go into the details of the provisions here, but the proposed initiatives will, in particular, prevent companies from transferring their profits to subsidiaries located in low-tax states, and then prevent companies from circumventing certain laws limiting the deductibility of interest, using so-called \"hybrid\" instruments or entities and , and, finally, to counter the practices of certain companies that transfer their assets from one state to another in order to avoid paying, precisely, the tax on those assets. These measures, as you can see, are in line with the recommendations made last year by the ECON and TAXE committees. In truth, we are following through on your own work.  This directive is supplemented by a recommendation to prevent misuse of tax treaties. You are familiar with these practices: some companies set up artificial structures to access the most advantageous tax treatment, under various tax agreements with other Member States or with third countries. Our recommendation tells Member States how to make their tax treaties more watertight to these tax treaty shopping practices. The second pillar is decisive and fundamental to me. It's the fight I want to fight during this mandate, which is tax transparency. At the heart of our action is the country-by-country information directive. This text is a manifestation of our commitment to a real revolution in tax transparency within the Union. In concrete terms, the measures I am presenting to you this morning will enable the exchange of key information on certain companies between the tax administrations of the Member States. What is it about? I want to be specific. The draft guidelines implement OECD recommendations on the publication of country-by-country financial information. You know what is at stake: it is about allowing administrations to better control irregular transfers of profits between companies. So today we are proposing to transpose the standards as recommended by the OECD. It's a first step. I know that many of you want to go further in terms of transparency and make the country-by-country reports of companies public. I will tell you things in the simplest way - and you already know it - that is also my wish. I have expressed this on several occasions in this House and outside, and I have been trying in my political practice for a long time not to have double-talk. I am therefore in favour of publishing country-by-country information. A number of parameters must then be taken into account, and the Commission will submit a proposal on this point in the spring.  What is the problem? Our services are looking at the best approach. We have conducted a public consultation, we are conducting an impact study and the problem must be this: is there a contradiction between this increased publicity that you want - like many others, like many others, like other members of the Commission, you know that some have spoken out in this area - and the competitiveness of our companies and their ability to invest. If so and if there is this contradiction, we will have to wait a bit. Otherwise, we must move forward resolutely. That is what this impact study must say. You know my wish, you know my will, I think at the same time that we must act on this matter with a lot of pragmatism and not by letting ourselves be guided by ideology. Transparency and competitiveness are two objectives that we must pursue together. The third pillar is that we want to restore healthy and fair tax competition between companies within the internal market. I am talking, both about competition between economic players, such as businesses, and between Member States. Let's first look at what's happening at the corporate level. There is now a profound imbalance in the tax burden between SMEs and multinational companies. When I talk about certain companies — I will be more specific now — multinationals have the means to aggressively plan tax. That does not mean that everyone does, I do not want to be in a trial of intent. I am simply saying that they have the means, with the legal services at their disposal and with their own internal organization, to do so. It is therefore SMEs, which represent the core of Europe's productive fabric, that are at a disadvantage. To put it another way, there are significant distortions of competition against companies that pay their fair share of taxes. We estimate that the tax burden on SMEs is up to 30% higher - that's a considerable number! - than that which weighs on multinational companies. This situation is unacceptable and cannot last any longer. The measures proposed by the Commission therefore directly target the increasingly aggressive tax regimes of multinational companies that have the means to evade tax.  The package will also restore fair tax competition between Member States by protecting their taxable base. This is the principle of base erosion and profit transfer (EBITB), which you know. Some Member States have already taken the measure of tax evasion and have adopted measures to counter its effects, but others have not followed or - to be more than lenient - not yet followed and this has resulted in a particularly unfair situation where the anti-abuse measures taken by some Member States are, in fact, undermined by more permissive legislation that is taken elsewhere. The package I am submitting to you will therefore allow the Member States to return to an equal footing within the Union, and that is a necessity. Finally, the last pillar: we are developing a genuine external strategy of the European Union. Our initiatives aim to provide a comprehensive response to a global problem. Let's be frank: we need a common approach at European level vis-à-vis the outside world, in addition to the internal measures that will be taken by the Member States.  Our new strategy therefore tackles the risk of external tax erosion and promotes greater cooperation between the Union and its international partners. I am thinking, first of all, of the non-cooperative third countries, which pose a real threat to the balance of the internal market. The Commission intends to work with its international partners to promote good international tax governance. That is what is happening at the OECD; that is what is happening in the G20. I say this here firmly: we will not hesitate to toughen the tone in the face of states that persist in the wrong direction. As you can see today, the package presented to you hits hard, with a series of solid and consistent measures.  Our new European strategy thus proposes the establishment of a European list - and I stress the two words: European list - of non-cooperative third countries. So far, as you know, I have taken the initiative to have a list that is, I would say a kind of best of, medley of national lists with their inequalities. Some have no non-cooperative states, others have 85. Some have certain criteria and others have less or have different criteria. It was not satisfactory, but at the same time it made a difference. This has provoked a debate and changed a number of states that have felt targeted and have already come off this list. I do not want to name names, because there have been virtuous behaviours. However, the European list I am proposing would be based, as the European Parliament has suggested, on objective and fair criteria decided by the Member States, as well as on an ongoing dialogue with these countries: effective corporate taxation, tax transparency, sound and fair tax competition, and external strategy. These are the four pillars of the anti-tax evasion package that we are submitting to you.  I would now like to say a word that may be a little more technical - but behind the technique, there is often policy - concerning more precisely the implementation. The package allows for comprehensive and coordinated implementation of OECD recommendations. What are the parameters that we have to deal with? To put it simply, we must both avoid the effects of variable geometry, because not all Member States of the European Union are members of the OECD, and take into account the specifics of our internal market. To avoid a partial or disparate application of EBITB measures, which would de facto doom our package to failure, a common approach was therefore essential. In addition, some specific initiatives go further than the EBITB recommendations. It is also because we have fed on the debates that have taken place in this House and the discussions in the Council, and it is also because we are a Union, therefore with a stronger integration than a system like the OECD. In our previous discussions, some in this House had questioned the competitiveness and economic attractiveness of the Union. I would like to reassure them that the initiatives proposed this morning are not hostile to them. On the contrary, I deeply believe that transparency and competitiveness go hand in hand. The provisions I suggest will avoid a patchwork of national legislation, which would seriously damage the internal market and therefore the economic activity of European companies. All this shapes a tax system in Europe that will be favourable to companies that play by the rules and not favourable to those that play with the rules. So it is clearly the first ones that we must focus on. A few words to conclude, first of all to look before us towards what awaits the Commission, towards what awaits you for 2016. This anti-tax evasion package, which is, as you can see, very ambitious and very comprehensive, arguably the most ambitious and comprehensive that has ever been proposed by a Commission and examined by this House. However, it is only the beginning of a series of initiatives that we will present to you in the coming months. We will have another big event this year: you know that 2016 will be the year of the rebirth of the ACCIS, the Consolidated Common Base (CCCTB). THE ACCIS has the merit of providing a comprehensive response to the problem of profit shifting within the Union, while providing companies with an optimal framework for their economic exchanges. So I want to keep or rather pick up the tempo on this project. The Commission's services are currently working on a proposal which should be a proposal step by step, because we have seen that a one-block approach has not convinced the Council and what I want, as always, in tax matters is to marry the desirable and the possible. The possibility, ladies and gentlemen, I must say, is through the agreement between us, but also through the consensus of the States, since you know the decision-making process in this area, which requires unanimity. Some may regret it. That is how our institutions are made and of course we must respect that sovereignty. But one step at a time! Through the package that is the subject of our discussions today, the Commission reaffirms more than ever its commitment to the fight against fraud and tax evasion. I have already said this before you, I hope forcefully, and I repeat it even more forcefully: we must fight these forms of economic inefficiency that create social injustice. The most honest actors, the taxpayers, now have to bear the costs of these distortions unfairly and these are considerable sums that are lost for growth, for public services, for hospitals, for security, for schools, for public transport and for the economy in general.  We need to re-inject more justice and transparency into international taxation and our own European taxation. The measures presented in 2015 were already a very significant step in this direction. In particular, I recall the long-awaited directive on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings, to which your Parliament has provided so much. The package we have just adopted represents a further major step in this demanding but indispensable path. I fervently hope that Parliament and the Commission will continue together in the coming months on this path to finally make tax transparency and a fairer international tax that we want: a reality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 70, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Alain LAMASSOURE", "mepid": "1204", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to welcome both the content and the timetable of the package that you have just presented to us, which is very much in the case of the recommendations that our Parliament adopted at the end of last year. I would also like to welcome the quality of cooperation between our institutions and regret the absence of the Dutch Presidency, which could have told us what consequences it intends to draw from these proposals during the six months of its mandate. Parliament will play its part during this period, extending the debate to all national parliaments, those of the 28 Member States of the European Union and, beyond that, those of all the countries that the OECD has associated with its work. We will do so in May. We must understand that, under the pressure of public opinion after the LuxLeaks scandal, pressure that we relay in our institutions, a change of mindset is taking place for everyone. The Google case is a comical example of this: for years, our countries have competed in great secrecy to be the one that would be the most tax-efficient with regard to these types of multinationals, and now we are going to see competition, at least apparent, to be the one that makes these kinds of multinationals pay the most. This makes urgent the second part of your proposals, Commissioner, that is, the harmonisation of the corporate tax base within the European Union. With regard to the publication of business results, we will see that, in the face of this change of mindset, some multinational companies will make their results public, country by country, and will see it as a trade argument. The others will be forced to follow.

In fact, the Commission has played a leading role and has responded to the public pressure, which this Parliament interprets, so that taxation is not a factor of relative injustice and a factor of incoherence in the internal market where so much is harmonised and where we control each other with regard to budgets as well. And budgets aren't just expense, they're also revenue. I also welcome the Commission for having been concerned about giving a European response to the OECD initiative, but I think that Europe must stop being a follower of the OECD to be leading, within the Framework of the OECD, in combating fraud and tax evasion, and it is also in this sense that I interpret the current proposal. We must go further and the path has been written in this Parliament's TAXE report. The Commission recognises this and I thank the Commission for that very fact. In fact, there are still elements, such as the definition of what a tax haven is, what is a permanent establishment, in which we would like the proposals to be stronger, but we believe that it is not yet possible to ask for this.  I would also like to stress that this Parliament hopes, and also reflected this in its text TAXE, for the Council to take on this change in the philosophy of European policy. We have to go further. The CCCTB has to come to fruition. The report, country by country, has to be public. We must move forward in dimensions that are the only ones compatible with the internal market and with a single currency, and in that respect we regret and we are surprised at the absence here of the Dutch Presidency. This is because, and I quote the TAXE Report, Member States with a key role in facilitating tax evasion must assume their responsibilities and lead efforts to strengthen tax cooperation in the European Union.

Companies are not cash cows. It is they who provide jobs, prosperity and you make it right.  We must ensure that everyone pays their taxes fairly, including multinationals. That they can't evade those taxes. We do this precisely by sharing information, by working together between tax authorities, by opting for more transparency. But also by staying vigilant. And I stand firm: we remain vigilant on three points: 1. Smaller Member States must also remain competitive and taxes must be reduced. That is why we need healthy tax competition between Member States. It would therefore be a bad idea to harmonise taxes at European level;  2. We must not be blind to that international context. If the Commission wants to impose more obligations, which go beyond what has been agreed internationally, then we are primarily in the foot; 3. We are counting on the Commission to keep its word and, in any case, that no additional burdens will be placed on the shoulders of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which The European Commission's proposal for two directives is a major milestone in the creation of fair tax competition in Europe. That was also the bottom line, the conclusion that we drew as the TAXE Committee – with a report that was adopted here by the majority of the house. First of all, therefore, congratulations, Commissioner Moscovici, on your proposals, which also incorporate the OECD recommendations into a binding law. From the perspective of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, the key is that the 28 national tax laws create loopholes – not as before – that can then be used by a few – especially international corporations – to reduce their tax burden to virtually zero. For example, when the Sunday Times reports that six of the uk's top 10 companies did not pay corporation tax in the UK in 2014, even though they report global profits of GBP 30 billion, it shows the whole dimension. And there are clear indications on the table that small and medium-sized enterprises, which cannot use these tax avoidance schemes, are being penalised. The effect is estimated at 20-25%.  That is why, from the point of view of a social market economy, it is essential that we create framework legislation at European level that has led to a level playing field, to fair competition. During our visits, for example in Switzerland, we have seen how such a competition can be organised. The automatic exchange of information is one thing, but also a common corporate tax base. However, we do not see them in these proposals. Hence the question: when can we expect this? And now the attack is also coming from the UNITED States; this is where the US government wants to put pressure on – it sees its corporations at a disadvantage. We expect you, Commissioner, to make a statement on this here, because we believe that the United States, too, must move so that together – the United States and the Europeans – we can achieve a better global framework that prevents aggressive tax avoidance in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Fabio DE MASI", "mepid": "124858", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

More and more people, whether in the USA or Europe, are also outraged by this. Only the Juncker Commission continues to do business as usual. This is their third tax package, and yet LuxLeaks could continue to repeat itself. With their interest rate barrier, corporations can continue to shift 30% of their profits to low-tax countries. In doing so, they are scratching the edge of what the OECD still considered permissible. They also fail to tax group subsidiaries in tax havens: the tax may be 60% lower than the tax of the country of residence; at a tax rate of 12.5%, as in Ireland, only 5% tax is due. In the OECD, it would originally have been at least 10%. Every secretary pays more tax than Google and Co. Mr Juncker said LuxLeaks should actually be called EU leaks. He is right. However, they continue to pretend that there are no tax havens in the EU, and there is no sanctioned blacklist. The EU cannot therefore claim a leading role in combating aggressive tax competition.

Mr President, Commissioner, the proposals you are putting forward are another step towards ending the tax avoidance of large companies in Europe.

However, when you look at them closely, the texts on the table are incomplete. As it stands, they will not put an end to the most cynical tax practices. Parliament, I hope, will weigh its weight to strengthen this text. Here, I do not want to downplay anything, but to say that if things do not move fast enough, the primary responsibility lies more and more clearly with the Member States which, behind the speeches, continue to engage in destructive tax competition. The ultra-beneficial tax adjustment (3% over ten years) granted by the British Minister Osborne to Google is part of this dynamic that tramples on the spirit of European cooperation. Mr Moscovici, you must now give the means to as many people as possible, including the European Parliament and civil society, to put governments under pressure so that in the coming months the anti-EBITB action plan will be completed and that, in the coming years, the newly drawn rules will be respected in each of the 28 Member States.

The diversity of culture across the European continent means each country has its own strengths. For instance, the French have their wine, the Germans industry, the Spanish tourism. These have not become clichés without some truth behind them. Each of these cultures needs to be able to reflect its strength in its own tax system. Tax is a subject for each country to address multilaterally, not via the EU, because the EU’s solution to every problem is to harmonise. Competition between states in taxation also encourages them to get better value for money when they deliver public services. In this single market, Google was free to pay its corporation tax in the lowest tax bracket it could find. The EU’s solution will not be to close loopholes but to hike taxes across the EU, chasing companies who pay their fair share out of the EU entirely and taking thousands of jobs with them. If anyone thinks EU powers over corporation tax are a good thing, just look at what they have done with VAT. Under EU law, Member States have to beg permission from the Commission to reduce VAT, but there is free rein to increase this tax. Look at the UK’s Green Deal: a 5% VAT rate on energy-saving materials. Obviously this is a welcome policy to keep heating bills down and make sure people are warm in the winter; but what did the EU do? It took the Green Deal to the European Court of Justice, and now the Green Deal is gone – killed off by unelected judges. The EU’s record on tax kills jobs and stifles innovation.

At the same time, the Italian authorities are suspected of having evaded taxes amounting to EUR 227 million between 2009 and 2013. Google recently compared it to the UK government, where €170 million in taxes were repaid. Google, like other corporations, uses tax-saving schemes in various European countries. In the course of the LuxLeaks affair, this has entered the public consciousness. According to a study by the European Parliament on behalf of the TAXE Special Committee, the EU loses up to EUR 190 billion each year through profit shifting, special tax arrangements, inefficient tax collection and similar practices. The EU and the Member States can no longer afford this. That is why a firm approach to aggressive tax planning is needed for free tax competition and fair tax competition. The Commission's proposed approach to this matter, namely fair tax competition, is based on three central pillars. On the one hand, this is to ensure effective taxation in the EU. Parliament has also been very active in this with the TAXE-1 report, and a TAXE-2 will certainly follow. And the Commission is now following with the anti-avoidance directive. The main issue is that profits should also be taxed where they are incurred. A second point is greater tax transparency. Here, too, Parliament has already been active: the Ferber report, the automatic exchange of information, and the Commission now wants to revise the directive on administrative cooperation. This is an important step. It is also important that country-by-country reporting comes, and it is also a good moment that the Member States of the European Union will implement this automatic exchange of information within seven months. A third important point is the guarantee of a level playing field, as has already been mentioned. SMEs usually pay 30% more tax than multinationals, which must be abolished.

On the one hand, we have those who say that companies are dairy cows, we have to come to even less taxes. I would point out that the average multinationals pay 1% or less! Yes, what does it mean even less? No more taxes at all? Then, on the other hand, we hear that the Commission is going to be buisness as usual. This is how we talk about our own work here in the House! In recent months, with the TAXE Committee of Inquiry, we have only created the climate for the Commission to present proposals today – and as early as last summer – that go beyond anything that has been possible over the last ten years. We must work together with the Commission on this. We need to ensure that companies of any kind that operate multinationally pay a fair tax rate, which can vary from country to country, but they must be subject to fair taxation and pay taxes. If we want to do that, however, we must look at the Commission's proposals calmly and carefully. Then we can certainly call on the Commission to be bolder and to help it go beyond what is on the table today. That, for example, companies with an annual turnover of more than 750 million are used not only for public reporting on where which company pays how many taxes. Let us take all the big companies as we have defined them elsewhere, from an annual turnover of 40 million. In doing so, you would have subject most of the multinational actors to a reporting obligation and you would have the transparency to be able to derive the necessary measures from this. Transparency is the key word.

The Commission is right when it asserts that Member States cannot tackle this problem alone. But I hope, Commissioner, that you also realise that the EU cannot tackle this problem alone either. It has to be dealt with at the international, rather than the European, level. My fear is that there are those in the Commission and in this Parliament who see this problem as another excuse for more Europe. I do not support plans for a common corporate tax base.

By acting through the OECD, we will ensure that Member States not only fulfil their obligations but also remain competitive in the international markets. We must ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of taxes. The best way of ensuring this is to keep tax rates low and tax codes simple.

Let us not be afraid of words, I think you are one of the Commissioners who pursues the most ambition to restore order in the House of Europe, through a fairer and more inclusive taxation.  Of course, not everything is perfect, but all your actions are moving in the right direction - it is important to stress this - and I encourage you to go even further in this matter. Some of your proposals follow the recommendations of our special committee, others are more cautious. Thus, we proposed in our final report to set up an automatic and comprehensive exchange of information on tax rulings between Member States. Last year, one of your proposals took up this measure, but avoiding some recommendations, which is unfortunate. I am obviously thinking of the publicity of these exchanges, but you are here to tell us that you want to continue and move forward, and I am delighted. This new package of proposals is obviously another step in the right direction to counter tax evasion and avoidance. I am thinking in particular of two other measures included in the report of the special committee TAXE, namely the automatic exchange of information in the context of the publication of country-by-country information and the chapter on the consolidated tax base.  Unfortunately, however, I do not think there are certain elements that are crucial to prevent multinationals from organising the parade. I am thinking in particular of the clear establishment of the profit zones of multinationals, which would force them to pay their taxes in the countries where they are engaged in economic activity and not in a tax haven. We know that Google is a champion of this kind of practice, but it is not the only one, and we all know that a multinational that does not pay taxes in the country where it operates economically obviously undermines the social model of our societies, namely financing for all health, social security , education, employment aid and security. Finally, our regret, Commissioner, is the tax package that you have just presented and which is not intended to harmonize corporate tax in the European Union. This is a difficult measure to implement, but it would allow for healthier and fairer competition. We can see that there is still a long way to go in the field of tax evasion.

The problem, of course, is that when it comes to tax justice, after SwissLeaks, after Offshore Leaks, after LuxLeaks, the preliminaries keep going. But at some point, you have to act well, at the risk of obviously seeing the object of your desire go away, disappointed. What would \"act\" mean in this case? That would mean, and you said it yourself: to impose a country-by-country publication on companies, a public publication. You said you were in favour of it, and I believe you. Multinational companies must therefore declare not only how much profits they make, how much tax they pay, under what name they operate, how many people they employ, what tax arrangements they benefit from in all countries, and this information must be available to all our fellow citizens. We need to fully implement the OECD recommendations. However, I note that in the package you are proposing, which this time deserves the name of the package, you forget certain things: the obligation, for example, to have anti-abuse clauses in all bilateral treaties is, in your package, only a recommendation and not an obligation. I also see that the rules on foreign-controlled enterprises are not fully taken up either. We have to go further because the OECD has not taken care of everything. I take the example of this new means of tax evasion called 'patent boxes', the 'Patent Boxes', which the OECD completely ignores. I think it's up to you to fill those gaps. I would remind you that the OECD is an organization that makes recommendations, while you are at the initiative of the legislation. Finally, we must impose a common and consolidated corporate tax base, i.e. agree on what profit is and distribute that profit on an objective basis among the Member States by applying, of course, a minimum rate. All of this, you mentioned more or less directly in your speech. You tell us that you want to consume the act, and I believe you. But then, go ahead, don't hold back! It's really time to go! Of course, the question we can all ask ourselves is whether the Member States are, like Pierre Moscovici, in love with tax justice... Here, judging by the reaction, for example, of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Netherlands, but also of my country, to the recent decisions of your colleague, Mrs Vestager, I have reason to doubt it...

The harmful phenomenon of tax avoidance by companies using aggressive instruments reduces budget revenues in the Member States of the European Union and creates unfair competition between companies. I agree that attempts by individual countries to solve this problem individually do not produce results.  I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal to drastically reduce the scale of this phenomenon by adopting a legislative package including a draft anti-tax avoidance directive and a proposal to amend the Directive on administrative cooperation. The draft anti-tax avoidance directive, in which the Commission proposes six specific instruments to reduce aggressive planning, is crucial. These include limiting the possibility of deducting financial costs from tax, eliminating the phenomenon of double tax avoidance, controlling foreign subsidiaries created to transfer profits and controlling the transfer of assets abroad, prohibiting the deduction from the tax base of certain flows within corporations. These lines of action deserve support, especially as they are consistent with the guidelines prepared by the G20 and the OECD under the BEPS programme.  However, I would like to make it clear that they must comply with the Treaties and, in particular, with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. In particular, there can be no question of harmonising tax rates. The arrangements adopted must not in any way affect the sovereign right of The Member States to determine the level of taxation.

This is a very important step to a fair tax system in Europe, with the four pillars you presented. There is no doubt that multinational companies’ tax avoidance is a major threat to our welfare state and to fair competition in Europe: EUR 2 000 per capita per year. This is what it costs us in tax fraud and tax avoidance: EUR 1 trillion a year. It is outrageous how much it costs our societies. Imagine what this money could be used for – schools for our kids, education for our young people, investing in jobs and welfare. Furthermore, I think there is a very important principle at stake here. When citizens see that multinationals pay almost zero per cent in tax, they question the fundamental function of the state and our institutions. When citizens see that Belgium has given 35 multinational companies illegal tax deals, they see that multinationals appear more powerful than the state itself. Citizens see that the tax system is unfair. They see injustice. Countries and companies violate the law. They need, of course, to be punished. So what can we do to fix a broken system? I think first of all we have to bring transparency and light. Why? Because multinational companies operate in the shadow of the economy. They use the loopholes they can. As rapporteur for the report on the EU—Switzerland Agreement on the automatic exchange of information, I know that transparency is the way forward. Transparency and information are the building blocks for cooperation between tax authorities in our countries.

The OECD guidelines close and imprison this information in the context of tax administrations, they do not make it known to the citizens, and that is not good. Transparency has an extraordinary deterrence effect. I understand the Commission's concerns and it is right that the work on the impact assessment should be completed. However – you know this very well, and I remember it for everyone – when the same work was done for the banks, it was concluded that transparency did not create problems for competitiveness, but rather made it stronger. The same must be done for businesses. We need to broaden the area of application and then we need transparency as a basis. Finally, since you said – and I agree – that the package is timely, if the issue is timeliness, when you have finished work on the impact assessment, do not make an ad hoc directive, but place the conclusions of the proposal within the shareholders' rights directive, which is already under discussion, and we will have recovered months and months.

The absence of the Dutch Presidency is most disappointing, given that it is the Member States which hold the blame for this. Commissioner, I welcome your proposals. They underscore the need to share tax information across EU countries, making it harder for multinationals to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions or to avoid paying tax completely anywhere in the European Union. We do have to face the fact that it is the legislative framework that allows multinationals to circumvent paying tax legally. So we have to close the loopholes and ensure that it is implemented consistently across the EU, and having an agreed list of tax havens is a significant step forward in the fight against tax avoidance.

Commissioner, dear colleagues, I also welcome the decision of the Commission on the Corporate Tax package, which was of course long overdue. In this regard I also welcome the relaunch of the common consolidated corporate tax base, which was introduced in 2011, but too little has been done to enforce it across Member States. More progress has to be made here, and much faster. Until now, big multinationals had considerable tax benefits to the disadvantage of SMEs, as has already been said. The Commission has a strong role to play in paving the way for a level playing field between SMEs and big multinationals. This is a crucial factor for supporting a better business environment for every company active in the single market, be it small or large. SMEs are a major job creator in Europe, therefore making corporate taxation fairer for all companies also safeguards employment here in Europe. Moreover, entrepreneurship and start—up creation are essential for innovation and the creation of the jobs of the future. Only then will a competitive advantage of European companies in the long term be ensured. The establishment of cross-border business is facilitated by making conditions equal for all companies and by improving coordination across Europe. Europe can catch up considerably in the areas just mentioned. So far, cross border e-commerce in Europe can still be expanded and facilitated.

I am, to say the least, surprised by the absence of the Dutch Presidency, and I ask myself whether this opportunity is being exploited to the maximum. I will make two critical remarks.

We must certainly work to ensure that not only Europe is leading the way, but that third countries are also on board. To help the OECD process to achieve resounding success together.  We welcome the fact that the Commission has now presented further legislative proposals against tax avoidance. The announcements in recent months to combat tax avoidance can now be followed by action. We are counting on your vigour, Commissioner, to be able to help you achieve the necessary unanimity in the Council of the Member States. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will certainly take a hard look at the anti-tax avoidance directive. In the case of country-specific reporting, it certainly makes sense to start with a non-public exchange among tax administrations. The information is thus available where it can be used most effectively and efficiently. And we think it is right that the scope should be concentrated on multinationals. A reporting bureaucracy for all European companies would not be justified. All-encompassing reporting would not comply with the principles of improved regulation and proportionality imposed by the Commission itself. All-encompassing reporting would make tax-paying small and medium-sized enterprises stand for what some large corporations have triggered with their aggressive tax practices.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to welcome you for this high-year debate, close to 50 speeches which have made it possible to address in depth a large number of points, and what I see, of course, in respect of the various sensitivities, is a consensus on the need to continue our joint action against tax fraud and evasion. , which is a major topic.  The package adopted by the college last Thursday, under the leadership of Jean-Claude Juncker, whom I welcome, provides us with additional tools to shape a fairer and more efficient tax system within the Union and internationally. We must continue to work together for taxation that is responsive to the realities and challenges of the 21st century, which also facilitates growth and jobs. There have been so many interventions that I cannot respond to each, but I just want to make three points: the first, for those who are concerned and whom I want to reassure, concerns the impact of this package on the competitiveness of European businesses. No, tax justice and transparency in tax matters do not stand in the way of economic efficiency. Today we are witnessing a real global movement against tax evasion and I want to tell you that the European Union is not alone in this fight against aggressive tax planning. More than 100 states and territories have already committed to implementing the OECD's recommendations quickly last October at the G20 summit in Antalya.  I am convinced that a coordinated approach to the implementation of these recommendations at European level will, on the contrary, guarantee our companies more legal certainty, less administrative burdens and, I would like to stress once again, fairer tax competition.  This package that is good for justice is therefore also good for investment. As many of you have said, and this is my second point, the ball is now in the Member States' court. For my part, I am confident in their good will, not out of naivety, but because I think that this is a very consensual subject with strong pressure from European and international public opinion. This goodwill was demonstrated by the rapid adoption in seven months of the Directive on the Automatic Exchange of Information on Tax Rulings. Nevertheless, as you know, and I cannot hide it from you, unanimity at 28 is always a huge challenge.  As far as I am concerned, you will be able to count on my full and determined commitment, particularly in the Ecofin Council, but I will surely need your support, I would even say your constant political pressure and your reformist momentum, so that the fine statements made by some national governments are followed up. So I'm counting on your active support to make rapid progress. Third thought: many interventions have focused on the publication of country-by-country information and many have called for publicity. I told you what my wish was, and that is not rhetoric. I told you what my personal position was, she's sincere. At the same time, let us be aware that we must respond with pragmatism. Yes to transparency up to advertising, provided it does not penalize investment and competitiveness. We must therefore, once again, be very realistic on the subject and that is what the Commission will do. From tomorrow, we must move towards an exchange between administrations. That is what the OECD is suggesting. We will have the opportunity to return to the debate later this year, but Parliament is of course understood and the positions that are expressed on all the benches will be heard as well. I want to end by referring to an interesting and important debate that Mr Lamberts humorously raised about how the French approach love. I do not want to be scabrous and go too far into this metaphor, but it is true that foreplay is often a necessary condition for a successful act and I would add that the French sometimes take action, since the fertility rate in France is among the highest in Europe, but I do not want to push this metaphor any further, because - as I said - there are risks. Besides, love and politics are not exactly the same thing. So in political matters, we have to move quickly, and I have spoken to you today about the common act.

Current accounting systems to measure profits and expenses date from when manufacturing was the main sector of economies. As services and digital activities, accompanied with a globalised mode of production and marketing, become increasingly predominant, the task of determining profits and expenses is now much more complex. In the circumstances the easiest way by which to claim to be curbing tax evasion by MNCs is by imposing tax harmonisation, using existing accounting methods. This is unfair. Indeed, the characteristic of any corporate tax package should be flexibility, equally applicable to all, not only to the bigger economies, as has happened with SGP rules.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 130, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Romana TOMC", "mepid": "125104", "text": "  Writing. – I welcome the whole package presented by the European Commission.

Ten years ago I left these chambers to take a new post in my country. There was no euro or migration crisis, no idea that European borders could be changed by force, no talk that the European project might fail. Also, there were no smart phones, no revelations of internet surveillance. There was no Uber, or as we call it, ‘Über’. Ladies and gentlemen, for nearly three quarters of a century we have repeated the mantra of Europe as a project for peace. For the first three quarters of a century, Europe – half of Europe to be precise – thrived and grew, with our security in large part outsourced, even under the shadow of an aggressive, totalitarian Soviet Union. For the past quarter century, in the absence of any external threats, we have pursued the reintegration of Europe – also to bring back to the fold those nations forced against their will to live under totalitarian rule. Today, however, we are confronted with new existential, external – and, as we were reminded in Paris last November, internal – threats. We are at a loss, we are fearful, and Europe for so many is no longer the answer. I hear ringing in my ears William Butler Yeats: ʻTurning and turning in the widening gyre/ The falcon cannot hear the falconer; /Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;/ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the worldʼ. So let us face this new reality. Europe is amidst a transformational crisis. Do we pull together or do we let others deal with it? A transformational crisis where we shall put to the test all that Europe has achieved, step by step, since Monnet and Schuman. We are approaching a tipping point where either we become stronger or we let fissiparous forces prevail. It is crucial to admit that in this transformational crisis much was foreseeable. We knew there were serious problems but we put off dealing with the internal European crisis of the euro until it was almost unmanageable. We thought, at least until recently, that was the greatest threat to the European project. We were wrong. We knew too, and for a long time, that huge income and democracy differentials between Europe and its immediate neighbourhood to the south and east were a time-bomb, ticking away, stayed more by the restraining influence of authoritarian regimes to the south, across the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Today massive migration in the form of flight from the horrific slaughter of civil war and the systematic brutality of Daesh, mixed with economic migration from poverty and lack of economic opportunity, threatens Europe like never before. Schengen is under threat. Some countries refuse to take refugees, others are overwhelmed by the numbers flooding into their countries. Solidarity is crumbling. Some refuse to help, others justly say that solidarity is a two-way street. Structural and cohesion funds are also expensive manifestations of solidarity. Ladies and gentlemen, we are aghast when we hear of the numbers. A million refugees and migrants to Europe this year, predictions of another two million in the next two. Yes, these are truly large numbers. Yes, they will strain social cohesion and our budgets. And yet we have seen far worse and we have prevailed. In the Europe of 1946, Germany alone had 12 million internal refugees and another 12 million displaced persons of 20 different nationalities. To resolve this, in three years UNRRA, the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, spent, in today’s money, some EUR 50 billion. I mention this number, illustratively, to give us all a sense of perspective to understand what a daunting task our grandparents faced when Europe had no institutions, sometimes not even sovereign governments. And all of this before the Marshall Plan even started. So, ladies and gentlemen, let us now gather our wits and strengths, leave behind the indecision, finger-pointing and ducking of responsibility. We will handle this migration crisis if we show the resolve of our forebears. We must act in solidarity with those Member States that bear the brunt of the crisis, and we must accept a functional form of burden-sharing. (Applause) We also must take full control over the EU’s external border; we cannot be borderless both inside and outside the Union. (Applause) We must also have a functioning common asylum policy, especially when it comes to rejecting spurious claims and returning illegal immigrants. Is this so difficult when we look back to what Europe faced in the years after the Second World War? Ladies and gentlemen, after the horrors of the Paris attacks, I fear the refugee crisis will only further fuel the rise of populist and extremist politics. We will see the argument – indeed we already have – that we cannot accept refugees because they are terrorists, forgetting conveniently that the refugees streaming into Europe today have fled the same regime, the same brutality and murder witnessed in Paris, but writ large. Political speech today sometimes adopts language that a few years ago was found only in anonymous on-line fora. Democratic, centrist leaders advocating calm and responsible policies are increasingly under pressure, if not attack. Extremist parties and politicians exploit the current refugee crisis like they exploited the economic crisis; they exploit the dissatisfaction of voters with the often anodyne and milquetoast resolve of European leaders. Citizens expect decisive responses to crises. When traditional parties do not provide them, they look toward those whose rhetoric sounds decisive yet carries within it the ‘decisiveness’, so-called, of reaction: of simple, often un-European solutions the Union was created to rid Europe of forever. I say this all, inter alia, as the son of refugees, who fled terror in their homeland in Estonia in World War II, which is why I have this American accent. My parents did not always feel welcome when they reached Sweden, but they were given a chance. My hope is that a few decades from now there will be a president of a democratic Syria speaking Arabic with a German accent. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, while we should have foreseen the euro crisis and the migration crisis, one crisis we did not foresee – indeed to this day it beggars belief – was the invasion and Anschluss of Crimea, followed by the invasion of the Donbas. I shall not dwell on this today, but I must state that in doing what it did two years ago this month, Russia violated every foundational  European security treaty, beginning with the UN Charter… (Applause) … the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, and the 1990 Charter of Paris. And it violated as well the 1994 Budapest Memorandum that granted Ukrainians territorial integrity in return for eliminating what was then the world’s third largest nuclear weapons arsenal. In other words, we in Europe can no longer assume that the treaties that have underpinned European – I underline European – security since World War II still hold. The EU has been swift and united in its response to Russian aggression, and this has had a deterring effect. The sanctions have proved to be effective. But EU relations with Russia will remain strained for some time. Strategic patience is the keyword. Some call for dialogue, yes, but dialogue itself is not a policy, at least not a policy to counter aggression. That much we should have learned from Munich in 1938. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken of European crises: some we should have foreseen, others we could not. I would turn now and for the rest of my talk, look at our future and a long-term crisis we can avoid, if we take it seriously before we discover ourselves in its midst: Europe’s decreasing competitiveness and productivity in a rapidly-changing, interconnected digital world. Together with Kaushik Basu, the Chief Economist of the World Bank, I have just finished co-chairing the preparation of the Bank’s first longer study of the economic potential of information technology and for improving society and governance. The report also outlines the pitfalls of falling behind. In general, Europe does well in this long, extensively-researched study, a year and a half in the making. But make no mistake, Europe stands to become a second-tier player, with not only the US but also India and China taking leading positions, if we do not keep up. The digital revolution could be a blessing for the Single Market: today, we can see nascent pan-European markets in sectors like health care, banking and transport that only a few years ago seemed inherently local. Yet, sector-by-sector, our legislation remains fractured between Member States and unprepared for the digital age. We are losing out to the absence of a single market and losing our best and brightest to where the opportunities for them are greater. I saw this with my own eyes when a 23-year-old who had gotten a little start-up money and I invited him to visit me, said: ‘I am sorry, Mr President, I am moving to the United States’. I said: ‘Why?’ He said: ‘That’s where the opportunities are’. Six months later he had USD 4.6 million invested in his company and three years later he sold it for USD 100 million. He could have stayed in Estonia if we had had a single market and the financing. (Applause) And I would argue that story is repeated over and over again in every single Member State of the Union. Sixty years ago, when the Treaty of Rome laid the basis for what we now call the four freedoms of the movement of people, goods, capital and services, there was no digital anything. Computing was in its infancy. Today we live in a completely different world. Unless we recognise how profound a change has occurred, especially in the last 10 to15 years, Europe will fall behind and so too will our citizens. Meeting the challenge of the digital revolution requires the ingenuity of Europe’s entrepreneurs, its businesses, civil society and all levels of government. Market forces and business models will be the primary drivers of change and our response, but legislation, all European legislation, must support them. To reflect the magnitude of this change, I propose we add to the four fundamental freedoms a fifth freedom: free movement of data. This fifth freedom could be folded into the existing four freedoms, but today it is distinct enough and all-encompassing enough that I think it should be given a separate status. Data is neither a person, a physical good, capital nor a service, but to help all those move data, data must also be able to cross borders. The Commission’s proposal for a Digital Single Market will shore up the foundations of the free movement of data, but it must become an abiding value of the internal market, not simply a target to be met by a certain date.   But from the citizen’s point of view, what would that fifth freedom mean? For one thing, the free movement of data would mean that we can access services we have paid for throughout the EU. It would mean that online commerce would not be restricted by the country of our bank account, and that national boundaries would no longer determine – arbitrarily in the digital world – which European citizens can purchase digital goods and services and who cannot. Today, however, it is easier to ship a bottle of olive oil from Sicily to sell north of the Arctic Circle than to send an iTunes song across the border. (Applause) And personally,  as I am blowing my nose, I can tell you that in my country we have digital prescriptions, which means that I can go to any pharmacy without a prescription written by my doctor and take it out. But I cannot do that as soon as I leave my country, whereas I see no reason why I could not go to a pharmacy in Strasbourg and get, when I desperately need it, a prescription that my doctor has written out for me in Estonia. It is all possible: technologically there is no problem; it is in our laws. (Applause) Yet the free movement of data is not just about commerce. Like every EU fundamental freedom, the free movement of data comes with rights and responsibilities, chief among these the right to and responsibility for data protection. Indeed, ownership of one’s own data and the freedom to decide over its use are essential preconditions for unlocking the value of these data. The new Data Protection Regulation – and I congratulate you on concluding negotiations – recognises this principle in title and substance. It will give individuals real ownership of their data – the right to control its use and pass it on to third parties. This should create new markets and, applied to the public sector, reduce the burdens of paperwork and reporting that now cost European citizens and businesses frustration, time and money. It should also dramatically increase transparency. We must strive to create a data economy where the free movement of data also works for non-personal data. There is tremendous value hidden in the big data generated by our cars, our homes, our refrigerators, increasingly connected devices and industry: what in Germany is already called today Industrie 4.0.   Europe must invest in the underlying technologies that create confidence in the security of data flows, especially encryption and block-chain technology, which really would give us genuine security, and we must promote their use. Finally, just as the free movement of goods needs ports and roads, we do need modern digital infrastructure to make the fifth freedom possible. 5G and fibre connections need to be truly ubiquitous in Europe. This applies especially to the last mile connection, to our homes and businesses. Our rural communities that have benefited so immensely from the common agricultural policy require in this new world the same access to the internet as everyone else, those in the cities. Inclusiveness is vital. It is vital that the benefits of this digital dividend are shared by all. Estonia’s experience at least makes me optimistic. Since 2005, we have allowed online voting in nine national, regional and European elections. You might think that this would benefit the young urban elite, the ones who are accustomed to using modern technology, yet extensive sociological research has shown over and over that there is no demographic or urban-rural divide. The pensioner living in a small village is just as likely to vote online, Skype with her family and stay in touch with her doctor remotely as are her grandchildren. I mention Skype, by the way, because it was invented in Estonia, but like so many other good things it now resides in Renton, Washington, in the United States. At the same time, Ladies and Gentlemen, we must ask: where is the digital revolution taking us? What is the future of work in a digital era? What will happen to the taxi driver’s and the factory worker’s job? And tomorrow, with developing technologies, to the doctor and to the accountant?   Each previous industrial revolution has increased employment, replacing old jobs with new ones that are higher-skilled, better paying and more challenging. But we do not know yet if history will repeat. We are still at the beginning of the digital revolution, and I have the humility to admit that there are no certain answers. But I do know this: the digital revolution, like the crises of the Eurozone, Crimea and refugees, call upon us to put forward the best in us at a time when politics play to the basest of our instincts.  Yet let us not suppose that these challenges will be insurmountable. This is a time to step humbly in the courageous steps of our predecessors, in 1957, in 1989, in 1991, and in 2004. They faced uncertainty, and they stepped forward. If we cede to the populists who say that Europe cannot be trusted with its citizens’ interests, Ladies and Gentlemen, then no crisis, foreseeable or not, will find an adequate solution. Be they migration, the euro or even military aggression, not to mention the challenge of technological change, solutions that revert to the nation state will bring us back to a pre-World War II era. An era where short-termism, beggaring-thy-neighbour, leads inevitably to a tit-for-tat and a loss for all. Back to an era where, once again, might makes right. Where that leads we have seen too many times in Europe’s history. Let us hold no illusions of what faces us if we hesitate or stumble, if – to quote Yeats again from the same poem, ʻthe best lack all conviction, while the worst/ Are full of passionate intensityʼ. The choice is ours.

Border control is in the interest not only of the Member States at whose external borders it is carried out, but of all Member States which have abolished internal border control. Borders should help combat illegal immigration and human trafficking and prevent any threat to internal security, public policy, public health and international relations between Member States.

Air pollutants can travel thousands of kilometres before they are deposited, so the problems caused by air pollution need to be addressed internationally. The Convention, which entered into force in 1983, is the first international instrument with binding legal force to set up a framework for monitoring and reducing the harmful effects of cross-border air pollution. Eight protocols have been added to the Convention. The purpose of the 1998 Aarhus Protocol is to control, reduce or eliminate the release, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants. The accession of the Community to the Protocol was approved by Council Decision 2004/259/EC of 19 February 2004. Decision 2009/1 should be ratified by the Parties. The revised Protocol contains seven new substances, updates implementation requirements, restrictions and expands the range of substances subject to annual emission restrictions and reporting obligations.

The cooperation agreement precisely encourages this type of cooperation and contains detailed commissions on operational cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine, such as the transfer of a Ukrainian liaison officer to Eurojust and the exchange of data. Article 26a (2) Eurojust decisions dictate that the Council must approve such agreements with third countries or international organisations.

One possibility is the Cooperation Agreement between Eurojust and Ukraine, which has significant positive potential for both the Ukrainian judiciary and Pan-European cooperation.

Eurojust, as an agency of the European Union, aims to strengthen cooperation between Member States in the fight against international crime and needs effective tools to operate more widely and also outside the EU. We must bear in mind that many criminal groups are of a cross-border nature and operate on the territory of several countries, only some of which are EU Member States.

Here are the facts: the deputy is accused by the Qatari government of defaming qatar by suggesting, on a radio show and on a television show (both in January 2015), that Qatar finances terrorism. The French authorities have requested the waiver of immunity following the prosecution brought by a third country. In accordance with Article 8 of Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union and Article 26 of the Constitution of the French Republic, it is prohibited to bring any civil or criminal proceedings against a member of parliament arising from opinions expressed in the performance of his duties. Article 8 of Protocol No 7 provides that \"members of the European Parliament may not be sought, detained or persecuted for opinions or votes cast in the performance of their duties\".

This is particularly important for the intensively developing domestic work sector, where women, often migrant women, work in the first place and which is difficult to control, as the work takes place on private premises and the employee is also a private individual.  The experience of Belgium and France shows that it could be effective to disseminate and universalise cheque systems to include care, education and care services. Care services are particularly important because they cannot be postponed or abandoned: This is a key barrier to women's access to the labour market and the first reason for driving them into the grey area, as workers and employers.  Finding the right solutions in the form of clear rules, tax facilitations and incentives will not only lead thousands of women out of the grey economy, giving them social protection and a contribution to their pension, but will also help reconcile professional and family roles.

The platform serves to exchange information and good examples between national authorities working in the fields of employment, taxation and migration, but also with the social partners. The importance of labour inspection services and financial support is emphasised. Bogus self-employment is also known as undeclared work. In addition, the link was also made with the EU employment targets and the European semester. Since undeclared work knows no borders, European cooperation is very important. The platform must not become a talking club and must also propose concrete actions. At the urging of the Greens, there will be a specific focus on domestic work and women, who are particularly disadvantaged by working 'in the black'.

However, the results are not encouraging. In the EU-28, the ecological impact is twice as high as the biological potential. Only 23% of species and 16% of habitats are in good condition.

Human life depends heavily on biodiversity due to the many valuable ecosystem services: clean air, fresh water, raw materials, plant pollinators and flood protection are just a few of them. Biodiversity is under considerable pressure both globally and in Europe. At crazy speed, species are dying out. It's all about human activity. Habitat changes, pollution, overfishing, invasive alien species and climate change are the main causes of biodiversity loss. In 2011, the EU developed a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, to restore it as much as possible by 2020 and to reverse the global trend of biodiversity loss. Today we can find that, unless special additional efforts are made, the EU will again fail to implement the agreement by 2020. The numbers are very obvious.

France, which has so delayed the adoption of a law on the protection of biodiversity, is one of the worst European pupils.

Priorities identified by this year's report include prioritising the achievement of the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as providing more information to the public with a view to raising awareness of the issues and including all decision-makers at European, national, regional and local level. Significant measures in this area include encouraging farmers through the common agricultural policy to respect biodiversity, as well as protecting the marine environment, avoiding the introduction of invasive species, protecting pollinators, combating deforestation and supporting research and innovation.  The main problem, however, remains the implementation of existing regulations. This is why there is a need for better coordination of national policies and better enforcement of European legislation through the use of proportionate penalties.

The flow of refugees, the loss of life and the abuse by smugglers are a human tragedy which took the European Union and the Member States aback. We should continue to provide a safe haven for those in genuine need of international protection, and at the same time it cannot be denied that the large numbers of migrants place considerable strain on our societies and on European cooperation. I think this is specifically true of the sense among many in our populations that this issue is not under control and that it is not managed sufficiently. Frontline Member States – those along the Western Balkan route and the destination Member States – have been particularly affected by these events. It is clear that no single Member State is able to tackle this crisis on its own. Only with a combination of actions, executed in a coordinated way, can we manage the situation. We need common European solutions to tackle this crisis, and all Member States need to take their responsibility. We have said this before, and we know that time to address this crisis is running out. We have to manage the situation better before spring, when large numbers of migrants are expected to take to the seas to reach Europe and possibly be killed en route. The influx of migrants must be reduced, and our measures should not only aim at the short term but also at the longer term. The Council therefore insists that we continue our joint efforts aimed at reducing the influx, better managing the situation in our Member States, and implementing the decisions taken at the highest level. Yes, we need to strengthen our external borders work, work with Turkey to make sure the agreements we made with them are implemented, ensure that the hotspots function properly, including registration and return, and make credible progress in our cooperation with third countries on readmission and return. Some irregular migrants have no right to international protection and are unlawfully abusing our asylum systems. We should, furthermore, start implementing the relocation decisions properly and do further work on tackling the root causes of migration. There are some positive signs. At the moment, four hotspots are operational. Italy has declared two additional locations as operational, while a third one is ready for operations. Moreover, Italy has reported that all disembarkations are now running via hotspot locations, and registration and fingerprinting is at 100%. In Greece, despite continued high arrivals, work has been able to progress significantly on two additional locations. However, concerns remain on the timeline of the other locations. We commend the actions taken by Italy and Greece, yet efforts must continue unabated, not only by those frontline states but also by all the other Member States in supporting them, notably by responding swiftly and positively to the requests for assistance by the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and the calls for experts by agencies such as Frontex and EASO supporting these states , and by swiftly implementing the relocation decisions. On relocation: certain Member States are successfully relocating groups of migrants and experiencing growth and new spreads among the migrants. However, only 400 applications have been relocated, and the number of Member States which have not yet pledged any places is high. It is not acceptable that decisions adopted by the Council and Parliament are not implemented by all Member States. More should be done to relieve the pressure on Italy and Greece. All Member States must participate in the relocation. The Presidency started this week to have bilateral consultations with all Member States that have been lagging behind with pledges on relocation, resettlement and personnel towards EU agencies. As a final note on this topic, I would like to highlight the threat to the humanitarian situation along the Western Balkan route. As arrivals remain high and temperatures have dropped, efforts and coordination must increase further in order to prevent further loss of life, specifically the commitments to provide fully winterised reception. Capacity should be fulfilled as soon as possible, especially taking into account the increased controls along the different borders on the route and the partial or potentially complete closure for migrants wanting to continue north. At present we are discussing intensively with all these countries to avoid further humanitarian disasters. In line with the conclusions of the December European Council, the Presidency is fully committed to contributing to the implementation of all the necessary measures to safeguard and maintain control over the Schengen external borders. The Presidency is striving to address in particular the implementation of rules aimed at managing migration effectively and ensure European integrated border management of the EU’s external borders. Following up on the Council’s request to rapidly examine the recent Commission Border Package proposal, the Presidency immediately scheduled a series of meetings of the relevant Council preparatory bodies to carefully examine these proposals. Particular focus is put on the European Border and Coast Guard proposal and the amendments to the Schengen Border Code providing for systematic checks on persons enjoying the right of free movement at external borders. Given the scope of the proposals and their critical importance, work has been divided between several Council bodies in order to accelerate the examination. The Presidency can already confirm that the Member States are committed to a productive debate on the text of the proposals and a clear focus on achieving results. Substantial progress has already been made. EU Interior Ministers discussed these issues at their informal gathering in Amsterdam last week and the Council will come back to this issue at its forthcoming meetings on 25 February and 10 and 11 March. The Presidency is committed to ensuring the best and closest-possible cooperation with Parliament on these proposals, since it is convinced that these proposals must lead to tangible results as soon as possible in the light of the current crisis. On the future of Schengen, the scale of the migratory flows which have crossed the European external borders over the past months has seen several countries temporarily re-impose border controls: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, France and Sweden. This temporary re-introduction of border controls is in line with the Schengen acquis, subject to conditions involving a serious threat to public policy or internal security and limited in time. The migration pressure has not decreased and the Presidency considers that the Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively controlled. A series of measures are being put in place to address the issues identified by the European Council in December. The Presidency is strongly committed to securing the integrity of the Schengen system, a system which is at the heart of the European project and one of the greatest achievements of European integration. The principle of non-refoulement is a cornerstone of international refugee law, and I appreciate your wish to raise this important issue. On this matter, particular reference should be made to Article 33 of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951: ‘No Contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion’. The same principle was fully integrated in the EU acquis. Let me recall in particular that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees the right to asylum in Article 18 and the prohibition of refoulement in Article 19(2). Furthermore, Article 78 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union provides for the creation of a Common European Asylum System in accordance with the Geneva Convention and in compliance with the principle of non-refoulement. A number of legislative instruments adopted to implement that provision reflect the same concern. Therefore, EU Member States need to abide by the provisions of the asylum acquis and to respect the principle of non-refoulement in accordance with their international obligations. As far as the definition of a safe country of origin is concerned, it can only apply where the competent authorities are sure that the person seeking international protection will be treated in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement in the third country concerned. This principle should guide us when examining and negotiating the Commission proposals for a regulation on an EU common list of safe countries of origin. It should also be recalled that the Schengen Borders Code stipulates that the rights of refugees and persons requesting international protection, in particular as regards non-refoulement, should be respected when applying the code at the EU’s internal and external borders. One last word to mention is that an effective return policy is also an important feature in a balanced migration and asylum policy. The Council has recalled the importance of effective return and readmission policies, which should be implemented with the utmost urgency by all Member States and enforced in a manner consistent with the acquis. The Presidency will be very proactive, very concrete and very operational in taking this forward in full respect of the fundamental rights and dignity of the persons concerned and the principle of non-refoulement. With the above principles in mind, we will do everything necessary in order to improve the functioning of the Common European Asylum System. We look forward to starting the examination of new Commission proposals such as the revision of the Dublin Regulation, which should be presented shortly. We believe that such proposals, taking fully into account the cornerstone principles of our asylum policy such as the principle of non-refoulement and the current reality of migratory flows, should contribute to making Member States’ asylum systems more efficient. All EU Member States share the same fundamental values and have a shared responsibility to welcome asylum seekers in a dignified manner, ensuring that border surveillance is carried out without prejudice to the rights of persons requesting international protection. In that sense, we have a stress test, so to speak, when we talk about our European values. In particular the Council emphasised the importance of complying with these fundamental rights in EU asylum and migration policy at all stages, from the arrival of migrants and asylum seekers in the EU to migrant and refugee integration and the return of those with no right to remain. It stressed the need to ensure humane and dignified treatment and to reinforce the protection of fundamental rights. The fundamental rights of migrants and notably their protection from racist and other hate crime is very much our concern, and we strongly condemn all manifestations of hatred and violence against refugees and other migrants. However, we should also realise that small groups of individuals are responsible for these attacks. They do not represent the general European populace or European values – there are enough examples throughout Europe of refugees being welcomed and supported. We understand that the high influx of migrants raises concerns among parts of the European population. These concerns need to be taken seriously. However, violence is never the answer. The Ministers of Justice discussed this at a meeting last October and last December and agreed on a number of actions to improve the fight against hate crime, in particular hate crime against migrants. This includes specific attention for the reporting and recording of hate crime, as well as cooperation between civil society, law enforcement, the judiciary and assistance to victims. Action is generally needed in all these areas, but special attention should be given to migrants, as they might not so easily find the right bodies to help them if they are victims of racist or hate crime. This is also a topic of substance for the Dutch Presidency, and we have therefore today decided to organise a conference, together with the Council of Europe, on ‘EU fundamental values, immigration and integration: a shared responsibility’. It will also be the focus of the Council’s annual debate on the rule of law, and I would like to say here that when I listened to the debate this morning, that is a debate where everybody has their obligations – asylum seekers, migrants, populations of countries where people move to – in the same way. We have a stress test, as I said, at the moment on this issue because there are so many concerns raised in our societies. Finally, the Council concluded in October that one of the priority actions for the judicial authorities with regard to the migration crisis would be to ensure that, throughout the migration and asylum chain, including any administrative and judicial proceedings, the rights and best interests of children are protected. With you, I would like to express my concern about the reports by Europol’s Chief of Staff that at least 10 000 unaccompanied children have disappeared after arriving in Europe. The media indicated that many of them might have fallen into the hands of organised crime syndicates. This is shameful and we should be outraged and do something about it. It needs to be further investigated, obviously, and we need to get the facts and figures straight. This has not yet been discussed in the Council. However, if it is true, the thought obviously sickens us all. Unaccompanied children are among the most vulnerable groups, and it is deeply troubling that professional gangs might exploit them. In general it is important that EU Member States cooperate to prevent children falling into the hands of thugs. Finally, a word on the state of play regarding the Refugee Facility for Turkey and its financing. You will recall that European Union leaders in October and November 2015 committed to providing an initial EUR 3 billion of additional resources to support Syrians under temporary protection and host communities in Turkey. Following that commitment, the Commission adopted, at the end of November 2015, a decision setting up an instrument, the Refugee Facility for Turkey, in order to coordinate the provision of humanitarian development and other assistance to refugees and host communities. This facility would require a total amount of EUR 3 billion in 2016 and 2017. The annual amount foreseen in the EU budget for all external action programmes is around EUR 9 billion. Therefore, the full financing of the facility from the EU budget would put a strain on all other programmes and actions. In order to fulfill the Union’s commitments, and pending final agreement, Member States envisage contributing to the financing of the facility for up to two thirds of the required amount. Member States’ contributions would be calculated through a distribution formula based on their gross national income. The Commission has already identified the split between the years 2016 and 2017 for the remaining part from the EU budget and the sources for 2016. Member States are currently examining various aspects linked to the setting-up of the facility, including the governance of the facility and the conditionality framework to be respected. These aspects are of paramount importance in order to ensure that the financial efforts to be assumed by the EU and the Member States lead to really effective support for the refugees in host communities. The Presidency is committed to facilitating swift approval of the facility and will keep the European Parliament informed on the progress. You can count on us to make sure that on all these issues we are at the stage of making things happen. I think that is the most important task for the Presidency, with the Council and with the Commission. Decisions have been taken. It is now most important to make sure that they are put into practice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1806, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I must start by thanking you for giving the Commission the opportunity once again to discuss the migration challenge with you in plenary. The sooner we deal with the situation on the basis of the twin principles of shared responsibility and solidarity, the better we, as the European Union, will do. As long as everyone is waiting for the others to move first, and as long as some continue to act as if it will all go away if they just close their eyes long enough, then things will only get worse. A consistent and coordinated European approach put into practice urgently is the only way ahead. Next week, ahead of the February European Council, the Commission will report on the implementation of the priority actions under the European Agenda on Migration. We will be frank and objective about the poor progress we see on the ground today and about what needs to be done in the next days or weeks. This concerns both the Member States on the front line and all the others, and both the external and internal policy dimension. On the external policy level, we need to gear up our cooperation with third countries on addressing root causes and on fighting smugglers, to establish safe passage for those in need, and to make sure return and readmission are the reality for those who have no right to stay in Europe. On the internal policy dimension, the to-do list is even longer: relocation, resettlement, hot spots, returns, joint operational measures taken by Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). We continue to provide substantial financial and operational support to our frontline Member States to that end, but the scale of the problem of irregular migrants flows reaching Greece and entering the Western Balkans continues unabated. The Commission is putting every effort into achieving normalisation of the Schengen functioning and, in parallel, is preparing for all options. But let me repeat clearly: this is not about the end of Schengen or cutting off a Member State. Today the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has issued a press release. The numbers are dramatic. Thirteen times more people crossed the Mediterranean in January 2016 in comparison to January 2015. 368 people died during the first month alone, although many more were saved through our joint operations. But every life lost is one too many. The European humanitarian tradition, of which we should be proud, must be maintained even in times of crisis. Saving lives and the principle of non—refoulement are not negotiable. Today the Commission adopted a Schengen evaluation report on Greece, after receiving a positive opinion from the Schengen Evaluation Committee. The report, which is a classified document and will be shared with this House according to the usual rules, is based on unannounced site visits conducted in November 2015. Serious deficiencies were identified in this report in external border management by Greece. We are, however, taking note that Greece has already started undertaking efforts to remedy the deficiencies, and the Commission will continue its support for Greece. Greece will not be left alone to address the challenges that are related to the migratory pressure. In parallel, we are working closely with Turkey to bring order into migratory flows and help to stem irregular migration in the Aegean by implementing the EU—Turkey joint action plan. Recently the First Vice—President, Mr Timmermans, discussed with our Turkish counterparts how we can step up our cooperation to fight smugglers and address the growing numbers of non—Syrians irregularly crossing to the European Union. Our Turkish counterparts also informed us about opening up segments of the Turkish labour market to allow Syrian refugees to work. The Commission is working closely with both the Greek and Turkish authorities to scale up the returns to Turkey under the existing bilateral agreement, awaiting the full entry into force of the EU—Turkey agreement. We are exploring with Greece what further support it needs to be able to systematically return those migrants who do not have a right to stay in the European Union. Let me recall, as Commissioner Hahn will stress, that Turkey is making commendable efforts to host more than 2.75 million refugees at a cost of EUR 7 billion to date. To support Syrians in Turkey, the European Union has committed to providing financial assistance for an amount of EUR 3 billion over 2016 and 2017 to provide humanitarian, development and other assistance to refugees and host communities. Further down the stream, we have the Western Balkans route. This has been a key priority for the Commission and we are chairing weekly coordination meetings. Migrants should always be given the opportunity to apply for international protection, but if they choose not to do so or if it emerges that they are not in need of protection, they should be returned swiftly to their countries of origin or to transit countries. This will always be done subject to a prior non—refoulement and proportionate check in accordance with international law. Non—refoulement is an essential, basic safeguard and a legal obligation that we owe to each and every refugee. However, this principle is not incompatible with our efforts to ensure the much more effective return of illegal migrants throughout the European Union. We need to systematically and rapidly return those who are not in need of international protection if we are to build public trust and focus resources on the reception of genuine refugees. But we must also do more to promote legal channels of protection for those in need, such as resettlement measures. The more we can provide credible and effective support to those in need of international protection, the less they will feel the need to take the route of irregular migration. Let me conclude with a brief comment about the surge of racism and xenophobia towards migrants and refugees. It is my main worry and it did not come as a surprise to me. The Commission condemns without reservation what appear to have been mass sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve, but it is too simplistic to conclude that all refugees and migrants are threats to our public order. They are not. And those fleeing from horror and war deserve our respect even more than anyone else. We therefore strongly condemn all forms and manifestations of intolerance, including public incitement to racist or xenophobic violence or hatred. It is clear that we will need to step up our efforts here too. The European Union is facing a crisis like no other before. Either we stand firm and find solutions in line with our values or we will see ourselves and our Europe change beyond recognition back to a past that no one wants to experience again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1807, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I would like to thank the Commissioners for their excellent work and for the work she has First of all, I would like to thank the Commission because the issues on the table, the legislative proposals that are on the table, have been presented by the Commission at a very rapid pace. The agreements with Turkey, the reflections on safe third countries, the quota, the revision of Frontex, quota solutions – all the texts are available, and the Commission has worked very, very well on this. We have no problem with ideas, we have a blockade, especially in the European Council and also somewhat here in Parliament. We saw this at noon today, when the President of Estonia spoke and first pointed out the importance of solidarity in Europe – that everyone has to bear their burdens. There was applause, mainly, I have to say, from the left. When he then said that we must activate border protection, that we must protect Europe, there was applause from the right. And that is precisely our problem: we have a blockade. It must now be possible for us to overcome precisely this blockade towards the European Council, to simply take a step towards each other. If 250 000 people have now died in this war in Syria, 40 000 of them children, then this continent – east or west or north or south – must say: we must help. When a total of 60 million people in this world are on the run – 60 million people – then it is clear to everyone that a simple door-on policy – we welcome everyone – cannot work either. The two sides belong together. We must finally overcome this blockade, we must come together on this issue. The way is actually so short to understand these two things and bring them together. What is at stake? There is a lot at stake, namely the Schengen issue. Of course, if Europe does not agree on this issue, there will be more Swedish and Danish examples, there will be more border controls, there will be closures in this continent. And that is why it is a damn lot, which is why this step of overcoming the blockade must finally be taken. Once you consider what tasks have been solved in recent decades, our continent has been led from the confrontation between East and West to reunification. Today we live in an open Europe, we have overcome the euro crisis to some extent with two per cent growth, and we have set an example for the world on climate change in Paris. We can achieve a lot! And if, on the basis of these historical comparisons, we also look at what previous generations of politicians have done, we must tell the Heads of State and Government for the discussions in two weeks' time that it would be a historic failure for this group of current Heads of State or Government if they do not succeed in taking this joint step together now! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there are three honest answers to these questions. Firstly, as I have already mentioned, border security. That is one of our expectations of the European Council, that borders must be guarded and that honesty also means that people at borders are also said no when people come without visas and without refugee backgrounds. Secondly, we must strengthen our authorities. If the head of Frontex says that if he has Frontex officials on duty there in Greece, he cannot currently consult the Schengen Information System, because we, as legislators, have stipulated that Frontex should not be allowed to use the Schengen Information System, then we have exaggerated it with data protection. That must be made quite clear. We need confidence in our authorities. Data protection is there to protect citizens, but not to protect criminals. Last but not least, to Cologne: all violence must be rejected. This also applies to violence against refugees – clear to the sun. But if people who are here as guests who have guest status because they claim protection during a period of civil war in their home country, the expectation that these people will not abuse the guest right, that they accept the culture and laws of a country, is not too much. That is why it must also be clear that if someone does not respect the culture and also the laws of a country, the host country, he must then leave that country again. These are principles that our citizens expect of us and which we must also clarify in the discussions.

Neo-Nazi raids in Sweden and Germany in recent days, shameful calls by political leaders to shoot refugees and even children, all this tells us that a virus is infecting Europe, the virus of fear. Nor do I agree with the carrot-and-stick theory of refugees. Neither stick nor carrot! There is only one word and one duty for refugees: reception! Because they're not people who want to come and turn our lives upside down. They are people who are fleeing the same danger that attacks us, they are people fleeing war. Too many taboos have been broken in recent months: Schengen, the duty of humanitarian assistance, respect for human life. And in this House, therefore, we can no longer just discuss legislative matters, but we must re-discuss values, because we are here because we belong first and foremost to a community of values. If those values are no longer there, there is no longer this community and there is no point in keeping the European institutions alive either, because those institutions make sense if they are held on to the values of the European Union. That's why I make this speech.  Mr Koenders and Also Commissioner Avramopoulos mentioned the story of the 10 000 children. But is it possible that no one talks about this, that no one thinks about this? Let's think about the danger, but what? What are refugees, refugees, at risk of? About what? This must win, this cursed fear that is keeping its hands tied to those who have to decide, because the problems are on the table, the European Commission has put them. We agree, Mrs Weber, on strengthening control at the external borders. We agree on identification, we agree on relocation. What prevents this system from working? I say what prevents it, it prevents fear, fear that has been exaggerated, that has been fomented, that has been fuelled in recent months! This is our greatest danger, which is liquefying the European Union as a community of values. That's why my speech stops there. It stops at the theory of values, because this issue is fundamental, otherwise it will never work, Mrs Weber. If we do not come back here, if we do not tell our Heads of Government, our Heads of State: do not be afraid, you will not lose votes, you will not lose support if you show that the system works and the system can work. And be ware, it's not a phenomenon that's being governed in a few months. There are already flows affecting Eastern Europe, affecting Finland and other Eastern European countries. There will be more flows in the spring. So either we put this system in place or we fail. That is why my appeal is not so much an appeal to this dossier or this other dossier. All this is the result of a sharing that is either there or is not.

As we look forward to spring, usually a season for optimism, it now becomes a season for concern. As the snow melts, as the Mediterranean becomes passable and as the crisis reaches an epic scale, are we really ready to find solutions that work? Some suggest letting everyone in from every country; others suggest the EU take over all border management; others again suggest sealing all borders and turning Europe into a fortress. We need to get away from this debate of polarisation and get to work on tackling the problems. I know that Mr Verhofstadt has warned the media that he is about to bring up comments made by a Member of my group. Let me be quite clear: we will look into those comments and we will discuss it with my group with due process this afternoon. But I am disappointed at this trying to put politics above trying to solve this crisis. My group has been consistent in our approach to this crisis since it began. We do not have months or years to rewrite the rule book; we have only a few weeks to help those in need and to regain the confidence of our citizens. Compassion can only be delivered when our rules are firm, fair and clear. Schengen rules say that the external border of the EU should be protected. If Member States cannot manage their borders, then we should offer them help through Frontex, but we should not force help on democratically—elected governments. Let us be clear: if you cannot play by the rules that you sign up to under Dublin and Schengen, do not be surprised if others want you out of the game. The rules only work if non-EU countries live up to their agreements too. What can we do to make sure that Turkey, already struggling to cope with refugees from Syria, is not merely seen as a transit country? What about countries such as Pakistan that have signed readmission agreements but are slow to take back their citizens? It is time to get tough with these countries to live up to their responsibilities. The Dublin Regulation is clear that, in most cases, the first safe country is where people apply for asylum, but Dublin has failed, because one leader opened her country to everyone, regardless of whether they were fleeing persecution or simply seeking a better life. It has failed because the first countries that refugees and migrants arrive at are unable to cope. Dublin does not need to be completely rewritten; it needs changes to make it work better and to make sure refugees remain in the countries offering them asylum. In order to stabilise the situation in the short term and focus help on genuine refugees, let us agree which countries can take refugees and how many, not impose it upon them. Let those countries that cannot take refugees help with money, equipment, boats and personnel to assist in border protection, processing and returns. But they should not simply wash their hands of the problem and expect others to pick up the bill. As the Mediterranean becomes a route for traffickers again this summer, let us not abandon Italy and Malta to fend for themselves. In the EU we are never short of grand plans and great schemes, but now we need pragmatism and action: action to deliver resources; action to implement legislation; action to generate political will. So let us not seek to completely rewrite the rules. Let us implement the rules we already have. Let us cooperate to stabilise the crisis and let us focus on helping those genuinely in need, genuinely fleeing persecution or war, in the short, the medium and the long term.

He has proposed a plan, and I have to tell you, you have contradicted it, and I am pleased that you have contradicted it. Not by mentioning it, but by saying and defending the principle of non-refoulement and also by defending the fact that every refugee who comes has to have individual treatment, and there cannot be a collective push-out of these people. So thank you very much for that. Mr Kamall, you attacked me before I said anything – OK, fine. But you disappoint me, because what the chairwoman of AfD has said is outrageous and a disgrace for the European Union. She said that it is acceptable to shoot at people to stop refugees. And then you are saying: ‘Oh, we are going to look into this statement’. No, you have to condemn this statement of the AfD! That you have to do, I believe. (Applause) And then my third point, Mr Avramopoulos, and to Mr Koenders, is about the content. I think we are on the wrong track. We are not going to solve the problem in the way we are dealing with it, because it does not work. Commissioner, you are saying: ‘Yes, the Greeks are making improvements’, but you should look at the Commission’s own assessment. Two days ago, three days ago, last week, the Commission presented an analysis of the border controls between Greece and Turkey, and it does not work! People are not registered – that is one of the reasons that there are thousands of young refugees, and that is the reason for the Europol analysis and document. People are not kept in the right conditions. There is no distinction made on this border between economic migrants and refugees. It does not work. So our proposal is very simple: you have to use Article 78 of the Treaty, which gives you the possibility to take emergency measures and to take over the border, and to create a rapid response force – that is in fact what you want with the European Border and Coast Guard – and to send people there. It is Europe which has to do the task. It is a little bit too easy to say: ‘Yes, yes, they are going to make improvements. We are going to make recommendations to the Greek Government and within three months we are going to see’. Within three months there will again be 300 000 refugees coming to Greece. It is not working! You have to take your responsibility: use Article 78. Mr Koenders, that is a decision that can be taken by a qualified majority in the Council immediately, on 18 February. Instead of talking about all the requests by Mr Cameron, maybe take that decision. That is more important for the European Union than all the requests of the British Government. (Applause) And so you have to do it. If you do not do it, the mess is going to continue. It is Europe which has to organise these reception centres on the border with Greece, together with the Greek authorities. Greece cannot say: ‘Oh, it is a loss of sovereignty’. No, the outside borders are our common sovereignty, it not only Greek sovereignty. And the second thing to do – and that is also what do you need to do on 18 February, Commission and Council – is to decide to improve the conditions in these refugee camps. People are living there on USD 7 a month. How do you give food to your children, how do you pay your for housing, your clothing, with USD 7 a month! Instead of giving EUR 3 billion to Erdoğan, use that money to give direct assistance in the refugee camps. Organise it and help the United Nations to organise it, and I am pretty sure that if they receive not USD 7 a month but USD 70, 80, 200 a month for a family, they can organise themselves in an appropriate way. It is because the people do not have even the means, the money to buy food, housing and clothing that they are coming to Europe. That is the second thing to do. Use the EUR 3 billion, not to give to the Turkish Government, but to help inside the refugee camps in Turkey, and also in Lebanon and in Jordan if possible. Those are the two decisions, the game-changers. It is not by waiting months now, waiting for a new Council in March, that things are going to change. It is now on the 18th, now or never to make a change in this fundamental crisis and to show that Europe can manage it. Because do not look to the Member States – they will start a race to the bottom. Tomorrow they will close the borders, and the day after they will say: ‘OK, we are going to change this legislation on asylum seekers’. It is not the Member States, it is Europe which has to show that they can manage it, and you have to do it.

Madam President, tackling the refugee crisis, Mr Koenders and Mr Avramopoule, requires stronger and more effective European cooperation, not an à la carte Europe that wants agricultural subsidies or the Structural Funds for infrastructure for Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, but does not want the implementation of the common European decisions to tackle the refugee crisis. And, of course, such a Europe, which respects its signature in the United Nations Geneva Convention, can have nothing to do with a return to the nationalisms, xenophobia, racism and disintegration of Europe pursued by far-right extremists.  Greece and Italy need more solidarity and European help to control European external borders rather than turning into easy scapegoats. Two days ago I read the following sentence: \"Any country in the European Union that was in Greece's position would have the same problems. Greece has asked for help and we must support it,\" said Fabrice Leggeri, frontex's director general. Four months ago in this Chamber someone said 'Europe is the baker in Kos who distributes bread to refugees and European citizens who welcome refugees to Munich station', was Jean-Claude Juncker. This must be Europe and not the AFD president, Mr Kamall, who is calling for refugees to be shot at the border, and not the fascist far-right who are chasing black people at Copenhagen station.  And because several have discovered that the problem is Schengen and are calling for the abolition of Schengen or less Schengen. Less Schengen means no Schengen, and a collapse of Schengen would be a huge loss for both the Republic and refugees and the economy. The reintroduction of border controls will be a disaster for Europe and because many are talking about implementation – 'It's the implementation, stupid' – they decided in September to relocate 160 000 refugees, proportionately. What is the application? Four hundred, you told us today. Can Europe go ahead like this? Of course, Greece has already made significant progress – as we speak – in relation to the report at the beginning of November and we are confident that in March, when you evaluate, we will have completed the commitments made by the country. But you too must honour the commitments, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and gentlemen of the Commission, in order to have a more effective and democratic Europe that solves the problem of refugees, which is not a Greek or Italian problem, is a European problem.

Let me put a positive point against what has now been invoked here. Not only at my home in Germany and in my narrower home region, but also on Greek islands, Hungary, Stockholm or the United Kingdom and France, tens of thousands of citizens are volunteering to deal with this so-called refugee crisis. What began with Angela Merkel's decision last September, in my opinion, has led to the strengthening of the European civil society that has always been invoked. And they do their job in the knowledge – indeed, Mr Weber – of all the problems, all the contradictions that need to be addressed. But they do it because they want to solve this challenge. They don't push themselves, they move mountains!  And the phenomenon that I find increasingly serious from debate to debate is that this civil society does so much without any pathos, and that political debates are only so dripping about pathos, but the European Council in particular – and this is what these very citizens who are so committed to find so frightening – seems more and more like a body in which many are actually just seeking to escape from responsibility. It is important to talk about this before the next summit. This betrayal of civil society, which is more serious by the day.  The fact that we all found this decision by Angela Merkel last September surprising is one thing, but the other is that this decision has begun a period for the European Union in which we have stopped simply pushing ourselves away from the problems that have grown around us. The crisis outside the EU in the east and south will not pass quickly. The experience of the Minsk agreement is a foretaste of what is flourishing in these Syria negotiations and how long it will take. That is why, as Europeans, we must prepare ourselves to deal with these problems, which we always discuss only as acute problems, in the long term. Before the European Council, my group is calling for the Council to concentrate on four major steps and then to deliver on them. Words and deeds must be reconciled, because we must convince – on the one hand, the European citizens and, on the other, people fleeing the crisis outside the European Union. We believe that generous resettlement agreements with the UN are the most important European measure, which must no longer be talked about, but must actually take place. We are convinced that investments such as those that are now under discussion with regard to Turkey must be made even more generously and that what Mr Verhofstadt says is a move in the right direction. We cannot simply keep the refugees alive, but we must enable them to live where they first flee in their home regions. Those who do not follow this seriously fail in their approach to better management. We are certainly convinced that the distribution of refugees within the EU must finally be based on solidarity, and we expect the Council to make a difference, otherwise we will not be able to make progress. My fourth point concerns borders: we too are in favour of better managed borders. We too are in favour of European responsibility now being assumed in Greece together with the Greeks. But we know that these borders, these external borders, cannot be hermetic.  We are appalled that there are debates about shooting possibilities, shooting orders – especially in Germany! At this point, we are certainly looking for the challenge with those who, on the right wing of the European debate, are only using the refugee debate, the Schengen debate, to actually destroy the foundations of European integration. For overcoming borders has been the overcoming of war and detriment. Anyone who simply wants to upgrade borders– even within the EU – will return to the deconstructions of the last century, and the European Union should be strong against this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1813, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Laura FERRARA", "mepid": "124833", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European governance of migratory flows is a complete failure. Faced with a vital challenge to its survival, the European Union shows its true face. Its inadequate response is made up of anti-solidarity and national self-interest. We continue to deal with the migration crisis blindly, starting from the effects without ever dealing with the causes. We never talk about the causes. What are the causes? The large European countries, on the one hand, help to create problems, with arms sales, support for warring factions, exploitation of the resources of the countries of origin of the flows, and then, on the other hand, they try to stop migratory flows by protecting themselves and raising all kinds of barriers to stop migratory flows.  Then it is good, as Pittella said, to start from values. So why not turn to the PD, which is in government in Italy, and propose to stop, to put a stop to the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia, which then uses them in the war-fighting factions in Syria, which causes the migratory flows, and then proposes to solve the problem that it itself causes, together with the other countries that also sell arms , and therefore proposes unlikely solutions. It is a perverse game in which incapacity and lack of will are combined. Unfortunately, the protection of the economic interests of multinationals takes precedence over the protection of life and fundamental rights. Then we have to give a semblance of humanity, we must show the citizens how much governments care about the fate of their citizens. So what do you do? Via Schengen, so we protect public safety. But then we have to take cover, because it would damage the single market, the single currency, and then there is a fear of a mini Schengen fort between the countries of Northern Europe. Or what do we do? Let us give EUR 3 billion to Turkey, even though we are aware of the violations of fundamental rights taking place on Turkish territory, so that we discharge responsibility outside Europe's borders.  The proposals of the 5-Star Movement continue to be those we have been presenting from the beginning: stop arms sales, review of energy and economic policies, amendment of the Dublin Regulation, compulsory relocation of migrants among all 28 Member States of the European Union.

First of all, it is the disorganization, with the help of the West and the United States of America, of countries like Iraq, Syria and Libya.

Ah, how interesting! In my country, for example, France, it has been proven by one of our highest financial and judicial institutions, the Court of Auditors, that 95% of asylum seekers, whose applications have been carefully considered for months, years, with all kinds of levels of appeal, remain in France or, when they are taken back to the border , for example, at the Franco-Belgian border, they returned the next day to the country from which they had allegedly been deported.

We can only gain control if we start applying the rules on the basic principles we have long advocated. If we look for magic solutions which take years to implement, the situation will only further spiral out of control. We must fingerprint all those arriving; this cannot be optional, as it appears at the moment, but a compulsory requirement for anyone seeking to stay in Europe. Member States must come together to guard their external borders, and if a Member State cannot, or is unwilling to do this, then it must accept help from Frontex. Then we must return those who do not qualify for asylum. We must remove the administrative and practical obstacles which currently produce a pitifully low rate of returns. Member States need to stop pushing off the problem and understand that their contributions as well as assets are needed. Even though it needs review, Dublin must maintain its core principles and relocation should be the second-stage process. If countries cannot control the external border or its internal border or provide humane facilities and decent treatment, then participation in Schengen must be reviewed, and I believe that we have most of the tools we need. All we need now is for them to be used and enforced with courage and determination. May I just refer to the remarks of Mr Verhofstadt a few minutes ago? Mr Verhofstadt, really, you know, you must not be hypocritical. You can condemn another group and its leadership in relation to the remarks or behaviour of a Member, but you should not do so until you also condemn the behaviour of one of your own Members in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), when the EPP Vice-Chair was not only abused but also insulted at a meeting recently.

We have a grand coalition in Berlin that is losing itself in the dispute; the citizens are catching up with the failure of the state in Germany. This cannot continue! There is a fear situation in the population. Fear is making citizens mad, and this fear must finally stop by solving this crisis. The solutions are obvious: we need a common coastguard, we need common border management, we need a rapid aid force based on Article 78, we need a common right of asylum and migration, we need funding for UNHCR and World Food Programmes, we need shuttle diplomacy from Mrs Mogherini.

In fact, I would go as far as to say that it has put the very existence of this project in jeopardy. What is amazing is that the EU’s own actions helped cause the problem in the first place. When Chancellor Merkel and the Swedish Government committed the equivalent of cultural suicide and invited everyone who had a Syrian passport to come to the continent, it was obvious to all of us what was going to happen. People would attempt to come in their droves, people would die in the seas, there would be migrant camps overflowing, Member State would be pitted against Member State, the Schengen Agreement would collapse, and it would be a golden opportunity for the Islamic fundamentalists to bring carnage to our continent. It was also obvious that there would need to be U—turns, as we have seen performed in the past couple of months by both the German and the Swedish Governments. Now we are facing an even bigger crisis. The numbers coming this year to Europe will no doubt dwarf those of last year. We are facing a summer where the movement of people from the Middle East and North Africa will no doubt reach biblical proportions. What is the European Union offering to solve this problem? The answer is more of the same: more concessions, more EU, more money, more misery, not only for the migrants but for many of its own citizens. We have to put a stop to this madness, and the answer is not making the same mistakes over and over again: it is restoring proper border controls, just as the Australians have done for the past five years. However, for the UK to achieve this goal, we must vote to leave this organisation in the up-and-coming referendum.

Because, from what I can also understand from today's debate, It seems to me that there are two visions. There is a bit of a vision of those who have ideology and therefore say that all refugees are good people, they all need them, we welcome them all, maybe we also give them our homes. Just the other day, in my city, 22 refugees were put in a hotel and will also be offered training and work courses, something that so many Italians, my fellow citizens, do not have. You have to be careful to do these things, because then maybe someone gets angry, but you have the solution so much by saying that they are populists. Obviously it is enough to solve everything with this.  On the other hand, however, the thing that surprises me is that there is perhaps no interest. When ten thousand children disappear, when I may see that some of these people are being recruited by mafias, when I see that some people, as happened last week in Italy, are arrested for drug dealing – and they are asylum seekers – when I see the events in Cologne, I think that perhaps there is something obscure in this European Union.

Then, conversely, I also expect the Member States to be prepared to take in refugees and not to regard Greece as the country that takes in the refugees alone, as Greece's sole responsibility. That would be European common ground, that would be European cooperation. Furthermore, However, I also expect that we will be prepared to think a little further, for example to establish protection zones and to make resettlement areas outside the European Union. Because only if other states on the African continent or in the Middle East are willing to participate, can we perhaps solve a little more than just a few who may be coming to us via the Mediterranean.

That is why we must ensure that the joint action plan with Turkey, decided at the end of last year, is fully implemented by both sides: by us, the EU, and by Turkey.

The law is there, we just have to apply it. The German government has had a pull effect with its welcoming culture. In doing so, it puts considerable pressure on the Member States as a whole. We no longer have five to twelve, it is exactly twelve o'clock. In other words, the EU must now prove that it is capable of acting.  First of all, we need to make an honest analysis. We are talking about aid. Aid is voluntary and aid must also be possible, it must be permanently affordable. After all, we cannot expect anyone to help until they themselves become in need of help. And that is why it is absolutely unacceptable for a single country to set the standard for other countries. Instead, we must finally go and see what the reception capacities we have in the EU are. In order to do this, it is necessary to determine what can be done there in the individual countries. And we also have to determine what we want to do there, with the involvement of the citizens.  I do not think it is okay to set the standard somewhere from afar without involving the citizens. Otherwise, the aid cannot succeed.

Firstly, how can Schengen borders be secured if the external borders are weak? This is a question that the European Union has lost sight of as it tried to impose immigrant quotas on Member States. The fact that Greece is unable to protect and secure its borders, or that there was an impossibility in implementing security measures, can only lead us to the conclusion that the European Union should have taken more clear support measures for the Member States. We cannot be part of the crimes committed by some so-called refugees against our own peoples.

Can we still talk about solidarity, colleagues? Can we really not realize that this situation will lead to a clash of civilizations, whether we want to or not?

You must realise that Turkey is not a reliable interlocutor, does not fulfil its obligations and takes every opportunity to promote its national interests.

I was in Lesbos on Saturday and Sunday. I've seen the work of the Greek coast guard and border guards. I saw the Greek boats, more Greek boats from elsewhere than Frontex boats on site. I saw the work they were doing in collecting refugees at sea. I visited the visitor and registration centre in Lesbos, which is one of the main access islands to the European Union. In January last year, there were 700 arrivals, compared to 33,000 arrivals in January of this year. These arrivals were managed by the Greeks, little helped by Frontex, whose support should of course be strengthened. Migrants are checked, registered and photographed. The job is done.

Three hundred and sixty-eight dead, Mr. Avramopoulos told us. We are all complicit in these deaths, as we are of the ten thousand evaporated minors. The agreement with Turkey is even more disturbing: three months to confirm this — Italy did so yesterday, at last - but we have not yet begun to effectively implement this agreement for welcome. And we are not able to prevent them from still leaving Turkey in small boats, to die in sight of the volunteers waiting for them on european beaches, on the beaches of the Greek islands. The answer is not Frontex. The answer is in joint and responsible action. Fewer walls here; more action in the most effective places of origin distributed among all Member States, with the will and commitment of so many cities that have made it clear that they are ready to take responsibility. Europe is starting to pay a very high price for not existing, if not, for not acting like Europe. Let us stop passing our blame and work together: Council, Commission, Parliament, everyone, together.

Greece is struggling to control - as far as possible - a vast sea area in the Aegean Sea, where Frontex experts consider effective control to be impossible, respects international law, cooperates with European agencies and above all saves human lives.

It is no use threatening Greece, which, because of its geographical position, has borne the brunt of the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Let's all take responsibility.

It is not by announcing far-flung legislative measures that we are facing emergencies. That's the way it was with search and rescue operations. The States did not want to respond at first and only faced with the tragedies in the Mediterranean granted more support.  The same is true of Schengen now. The emergency relocation mechanism remains weak, hot spots in Greece and Italy remain without the necessary means, return operations remain unappropriated and, if that were not enough, national, isolated and selfish measures still proliferate. Without responding immediately to the urgency, states, not refugees, are putting Schengen in danger.  Of course, the reintroduction of internal border controls is a possibility available to Member States, but they are temporary measures, they do not solve any problem. Free movement within the Schengen area has always been reinforced as a counterpoint to common external borders.  The new Schengen evaluation mechanism, which we proposed in 2013 and which was recently used in Greece, has shown that the Union has the capacity to identify the problems, but as is clear from this crisis, the Union needs tools to respond to these problems when Member States fail to do so.

In fact, they threaten Greece with expulsion from Schengen even though they know that this is not foreseen. Do you think, ladies and gentlemen, that the issue of the halt to the thousands of refugees brought by the Turkish slave trade in the Aegean will be solved by the new Frontex? Where's he going to do what? Is he going to sink boats full of refugees?  So you have not wondered why thousands of refugees risk drowning in the Aegean Sea to come to Greece and do not choose to go from Turkey to Bulgaria? Why has Greece become a magnet for refugees? But because it is the only Schengen country that is adjacent to Turkey and as a Schengen country it provides travel documents that refugees get to go to Germany.  If Greece leaves Schengen, then 90% of the refugees will not come to Greece. That is why I have already proposed on 11 December that Greece close the borders and withdraw from the Schengen Treaty. The negative consequences for my country will be minimal and the benefits enormous. So let go of bilingualism. After all, Schengen has been suspended in Germany, France, Sweden, Austria and Denmark.

The EU must work credibly and with Turkey to contain the migrant waves, but we must not rely 100% on them or on others. Above all, we must rely on ourselves, especially on joint actions. Thirdly – Schengen. This is one of the European Union's greatest achievements. Today, the European Union is on the test and with it. Thank Goodness that the European Union has offered at least part of the solution with the Border and Coast Guard, which is given new powers to protect our external borders. And fourthly – regardless of Greece's future status, the European Union must be rescued at all costs. That's why we should urgently stop or stem the migrant wave.

Madam President, I believe that the refugee crisis touches us all and above all I have to say that it has touched the European Union itself. As much as we are critical or self-critical we must say yes, we may not have done what had to be done, but if everyone did what the European Union did, today we probably would not be discussing refugees.  What did others do when the European Union, in 2015 alone, provided financial assistance for the wider issue of some eighteen billion? How many discussions, how many efforts, how many actions and how many actions did the European Union take when the Arab League, the United States of America, Russia, and other European countries that are not part of the European Union, in fact, did nothing and observed with apathy or often criticized the European Union?  But we have to say something very important. The refugees are not created by Greece. Greece welcomes refugees. At the same time as some other countries are erecting walls and barriers, Greece is raising the bar of solidarity, and the tried and tested Greek people with their economy tested, with few means at their disposal, proved to be a model and an example. I believe that those who continue to shoot Greece do not love the European Union itself and those who believe that Greece should stay out of Schengen is because they want to undermine and blow the European Union up.

I have repeatedly pushed for increased control and security at European external borders – something my country Bulgaria has long done. A shared responsibility for their security will lead to more trust between Member States and ensure that one of the European Union's greatest achievements, freedom of movement, is maintained. It is therefore essential that the new European Border Office has a mandate to guard not only the Schengen borders, but also all the EU's external borders.  However, ensuring the security of European citizens requires public and political support for the actions of European border guards. Unfortunately, Bulgarian border police officers, who do the difficult task of guarding the extremely choppy terrain on the border with Turkey, are often criticized by foreign NGOs. I consider this unacceptable, especially given that repeated checks on compliance with European legislation and the effective work of border police have refuted these claims.  Last but not least, I would like to draw attention to the need to cooperate with the EU's neighbourhood, especially those that house the most refugees or are on the migration route to Europe.

Actually, we have them. After all, we actually have very good laws – of course, there is still a need to turn a screw here and there. We are in an exceptional situation, but in fact the laws we have on asylum and immigration are not bad.  However, many Member States simply do not comply with it. This is something that the citizen should do at home, simply ignore the laws and rules that have been adopted! Surely it is not acceptable for Member States not to abide by the law or to honour their commitments. The UNHCR does not receive the promised money and cannot provide for the refugees accordingly. Frontex does not receive the long-promised increase in staff and finances and, of course, no further powers. Turkey will not receive the promised EUR 3 billion. What is eur 3 billion? That sounds a lot, but let us consider how much has already gone to Greece, and let us consider how much 'cheaper' it would be for the Member States to pay these EUR 3 million instead of taking in all the refugees. In fact, I also assume that not everyone wants to go to Europe, but wants to wait near home until they can go back. Where has the much-sungend European solidarity gone? This seems to exist for some Member States only when it comes to receiving money from the European budget. That solidarity is then needed. But that must not be allowed to happen, of course! It cannot be the case that Member States should simply refuse and that others should bear all the burden on their own.

I think we all know that the Dublin system has collapsed, and now Schengen is next in line if we do not act. This situation is a direct result of the lack of solidarity and of a common European approach to the refugee crisis. It is due to the lack of efficient control of our European external borders and the fact that too many Member States are failing to take their share of refugees. While some count their asylum applications in tens of thousands, others are counting them only in hundreds or even less. Member States who are bearing the brunt of the current influx of refugees, such as Germany, Sweden, Denmark, or Austria, are being forced, unfortunately, to adopt the extraordinarily harsh asylum laws that we are seeing today. It takes effort to keep up with the huge number of refugees, unfortunately. The reason for all of the problems is that Europe is failing to address, first of all, the root causes of the refugee crisis, as well as, of course, failing to cooperate in solidarity. Only four Member States meet the UN target of giving 0.7% in ODA. Money is desperately needed for the UNHCR and other agencies.

We trusted Member States to fulfill their obligations and in some cases we have been let down. So it is clear that we need more, and stronger, measures, but that alone will not be enough. We need a holistic global approach that looks at every single aspect. On returns, yes, people must be returned strictly in accordance with non-refoulement, and yes, we must give those who seek protection the chance to ask for it, but when you are found not to be eligible for protection, you must be sent back safely and swiftly. Those who are genuinely in need of protection should be able to find it in our Europe and other safe countries. Of course there are challenges, but the way forward is to have a two-way approach. People fleeing war must be given the rights they are entitled to, but it is also fair to expect respect for the values upon which the EU is built.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which First of all, Mrs Gräßle, I can understand your intellectual reflections that, alternatively, we could perhaps have done something different. Nevertheless, I would like to thank all the almost 150 speakers most warmly for this high-level debate and, in particular, to pay tribute to those who have been here from the outset. I think we agree that there is a great deal of point in helping those countries that are directly in the neighbourhood of Syria and bear the bulk of the refugee burden. This is also out of the point of view – not from a cynical point of view, but from a deeply human point of view – that we must ensure that those who have remained in the region as refugees, including those who are refugees in Syria – and here we are talking about seven to eight million – that we are providing financial support here so that these people can remain in the region. to be able to enter the country with a peace that i hope will come soon and help to rebuild the country. This, too, is the stability that we need in the region, namely to rebuild a destroyed country of 23 million people and to ensure that peace is at least found in at least one part of the region. That is why every euro we invest here – not only in Turkey, but also in Lebanon, Jordan, and ultimately also in parts of Syria and parts of Iraq – is well-invested money, also from the european Union's point of view. I say this in particular to some finance ministers who may see things a little differently here. With regard to the Turkey Facility, the famous three billion, the Commission, after difficulties among the Member States, like different considerations, that we have finally been able to – and, Mr Böge, I will come to your criticism – to set up a billion for two years, perhaps making it easier for the Member States to set up the remaining two billion. This is a stock pile-up. It is not the case that these three billion are being made available to Turkey up front; these three billion are a maximum for two years and are intended to provide appropriate support in the face of all the undeniable burdens on Turkey to cope with the refugee influx. This money will be used exclusively in Syrian refugee camps in Turkey, for training, health care and the provision of shelter. Very importantly, this money is managed by us, by my staff in DG NEAR. Turkey has, so to speak, a consultable status. Of course, it makes sense to ask them where and how the money is to be used effectively. But the administration, the management, is with us, and the use is based on a needs assessment. This will be completed in mid-February. It also finds out where and how and to what extent these needs actually exist. These three billion, by the way, are, after all, just one element in an action plan aimed at putting relations with Turkey on a new footing. I say this because, although not in the debate today, but in the public debate, there is always criticism – especially in recent days – that we are virtually not responding or not responding to human rights violations or to the non-respect of fundamentals as a European Union. I can assure you that, particularly in the negotiations that are under way, in the preparation of Chapters 23 and 24, there will not be a millimetre of compromise sacrificing the fundamentals, the rule of law; they are non-negotiable. There are standards here that must be respected. And, Mr Böge, you are right, I too would have liked and would like us to have simpler and more manageable financing mechanisms here. But, frankly, we face the challenge: let us help or lose ourselves in institutional discussions, to set up the money in some way, additional budgets et cetera. I think it's like the question of whether the fire brigade should go to extinguish, or whether we are going to go to a comprehensive public procurement, what extinguishing products we buy and when and until when. So this is really about saying: OKAY, we have to put the money up, we have to set it up. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kristalina Georgeva and her team for doing a great job here.  This is a point that my friend Dimitris Avramopoulos will perhaps also address: the composition of the flow of refugees, particularly in the Western Balkans, has already changed significantly in recent weeks and months, and today we can talk about the fact that 40% or less of the refugees are actually Syrians. The others come from other countries. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me only last Wednesday that 45% of Afghan refugees arriving in Greece were born in Iran. Surely you can't assume that these are just babies. So here the complexity of the refugee flow has already taken on a dimension that must also be addressed politically. My final point is that in all our negotiations we will only be able to act from a position of strength if we are able to secure our own borders. This must be the top priority, because only in this way can we maintain Schengen, a Schengen that now benefits our people and who are accustomed to finding borderless mobility, particularly in Central Europe, which has found its way into daily practice. The first priority must therefore be to ensure external border security. I hope that the negotiations in the Council based on the Commission's proposal will indeed lead to a clear result and that we will reach a clear result and a clear mandate here relatively soon in order to implement things.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1981, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by expressing our thanks for this fruitful and – in terms of length and endurance – marathon-like debate. It really has been very useful. I very much welcome the fact that we all share the same objectives of honouring the values of Europe by respecting the rights of refugees and making sure that we preserve the Schengen area – one of the most tangible achievements, if not the most tangible achievement, of European integration. You can rest assured that the Commission will not hesitate to use all the means that it has in order to do so; that point has again been made very clearly today. And now some words in Greek. Είναι αυτονόητο ότι όλες οι χώρες μέλη της ζώνης Σένγκεν οφείλουν να εφαρμόζουν τα προβλεπόμενα από τον συνοριακό κώδικα. Είναι μια βασική αρχή που όλα τα κράτη μέλη οφείλουν να σέβονται. Όμως, θέλω να είμαι σαφής για μία ακόμα φορά. Ποτέ δεν τέθηκε, ούτε τίθεται θέμα αποκλεισμού χώρας μέλους της Σένγκεν από τη ζώνη Σένγκεν. Αυτό ούτε καν προβλέπεται. Πολλές δε από τις ελλείψεις που παρατηρούνται, που σημειώνονται, σχετίζονται αναπόφευκτα και με τις μεταναστευτικές ροές. Αυτό αναγνωρίζεται από όλους, και αυτές καλύπτονται και από τη συνδρομή των κρατών μελών, αλλά και της ίδιας της Επιτροπής.  Η Επιτροπή άμεσα και έμμεσα στέκεται στο πλευρό της Ελλάδας και όλων των κρατών μελών που είναι αυτό τον καιρό υπό πίεση, και θα μου επιτρέψετε τώρα αφού έκανα αυτή την επισήμανση, την τόσο ξεκάθαρη, να συνεχίσω και πάλι στα αγγλικά. Mr President, I would also like to say a few words and give an answer to what Guy Verhofstadt said at the beginning. What we are trying to achieve with the establishment of hotspots presents many common features with the concept of the European Rapid Refugee Emergency Force (ERREF) that Mr Verhofstadt has proposed to establish. In operational hotspots, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Frontex, Europol and – where necessary – Eurojust are all already working on the ground and with international organisations to swiftly identify, register and fingerprint incoming migrants. The Commission has deployed teams on the ground to improve coordination. None can – or will – take over the borders of any Member State. We want to be very clear on that. But all Member States, according to the principle of solidarity, have to – and do – offer support to the frontline Member States to deal with this unprecedented pressure. The sovereignty of Member States is ensured by the Treaties. Yes, delays exist, but it is the wrong strategy to change strategy only because of panic. On this point, I very much agree with the intervention of the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), Claude Moraes: we will succeed, and we can only succeed, together. Greece is accelerating this implementation, and debates like the one here today are once again sending the right messages to all governments to do their part of the commitments. The Commission will certainly keep playing its part and much more. We will not stop the implementation of the comprehensive approach of the European Union’s migration agenda. In March we will issue a communication on migration management, announcing further steps to be taken. Also in March, we intend to table a modified smart borders proposal. We also intend to present an ambitious migration management package, including a proposal to reform the Dublin system. A structural EU resettlement scheme, as well as legal migration and integration initiatives such as the revision of the blue card, will also be part of the package. I count on the full support of Parliament in the preparation of these proposals.

I also understand some of the frustrations that were expressed by many Members of different political persuasions. It is clear that the management of the flow of asylum seekers into Europe is a stress test for all of us, for our countries and for the confidence within and between our societies. It makes no sense to use the asylum seeker debate for narrow political agendas or narratives. That is a luxury we simply cannot afford. Blame games are easily played, and simplistic solutions are easily found, for what is in reality a very complex humanitarian problem. In my view, European cooperation and solidarity remain key. I agree with the many colleagues here who have said it is very good to have a lot on paper, but the question is how we put it into action. The Presidency is extremely active with the Member States in putting conclusions into action with Turkey and Greece on screening and border controls. Concerning the Western Balkan road, we are working in partnership with Lebanon and Jordan to – as, I think, Ms Piri said – come up with a model which ends the cynical business model of smugglers, the reason why people are killed on the seas. That is what we have to stop, and it turns out to be a little bit more complex than we thought. I share all the frustrations that people have expressed here tonight – people are still dying on the seas every day. Maybe there is no white smoke yet, but pessimistic panic does not help. There is no reason for complacency. Let me say a few words about values, a few words about hot spots, about questions that were raised as to the future of Schengen on the principle of non-refoulement and on the issue of Turkey. First, on values. The point made here by most Members, although others will not agree, is that we are faced with a stress test of our European values. We all have to realise that we cannot be comforted by the reactions on this issue in our societies from all sides right now. The Council is perfectly aware of the difficult situation of refugees massively fleeing conflict regions or migrants who, for other reasons, are trying to reach to Europe. We will do everything possible to improve the situation. I think Mr Pittella spoke about that. These are our values that are at stake, but the values are not so easy to put into practice, because it leads to confrontations in our societies, to fear and then to reactions to this fear. We will, therefore, have to balance the different identities that we have in our societies in a manner consistent with our democratic values. We could talk about it for much longer but it is key that we realise that together we must try to build a consensus around this. I have heard a lot of opposing views on this, and this is very legitimate; it is a common problem. We will have to search for solutions in our societies to deal with this. On external policy and external values, I can mention some measures that have already been adopted, such as the support given by the EU budget and by Member States in particular to help the UNHCR to respond to the needs of refugees in camps established close to their places of origin, in particular in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Just yesterday I came back from Addis Ababa where I discussed this with the African Union. Discussions, and more, are also taking place about how we can conduct very practical follow-up to the Valletta Agreement. The Commission is also providing additional support to its partners operating in origin or transit countries outside the European Union. In parallel to these measures, the European Union is contributing to the development of safe and sustainable reception capacities in the affected regions and the provision of lasting prospects and adequate procedures for refugees and their families until they can be returned to their country of origin, if possible. If necessary, we will examine and adopt measures aimed at improving their situation. A lot more can be said about the origins of this crisis as well, but we can leave that for another debate when we will discuss issues around Syria and conflict resolution there. On hot spots, yes, it is true that progress has been too slow. We can all agree on this. A network of hot spots in Italy and Greece is a cornerstone of the EU’s efforts to ease the migratory pressure, ensure the identification of those third-country nationals in real need of international protection and facilitate return operations. Well-functioning hot spots are crucial to stemming the migration flows and ultimately safeguard the Schengen area. The European Council expects a Commission report assessing the progress in the set-up of the hot spot areas which will update the information presented in December 2015, and the Council itself is also monitoring the situation on the ground, through integrated political crisis response (IPCR) reports. We are very proactive at the moment because that is a challenge right now. If you want to translate the declarations into actions you have to be very hands-on. In the European Union we are used to more long-term issues of development and of development cooperation. Here we have to react immediately, and our systems are not necessarily used to that, so we have to change that. With that hands-on way of working we can also counter some of the legitimate criticisms on things that are going too slowly. Without prejudice to the Commission’s upcoming report, we can say that since December progress has been achieved. We should also recognise this. In Italy, two new additional locations were declared operational, in Pozzallo in Sicily and in Trapani, and in Greece work is under way to ensure that two hot spot areas, in Theos and Leros, are made operational soon. Furthermore, the reception capacities in both Italy and Greece have increased, including through the support of Member States and the specialised EU and UN agencies. We are not there yet, but we must pursue this effort with renewed commitment, and we expect the European Council to deliver a strong message to all relevant actors to make quick progress on the reception and identification of migrants. Italy, for instance, reportedly now has a rate of 100% for registration and fingerprinting. This is important progress. It has also ensured that disembarkation is done via the hot spots. Greece has informed us that migrants can only leave the hot spot areas by ferry if they can present registration papers. Greece has put in place a number of measures to increase the security of documents and to check if the migrant is indeed registered. Greece should also receive additional Eurodac machines in the coming days. A lot of questions were raised around Schengen, and correctly so. It is one of the cornerstones and success stories of European cooperation, if not European integration. The continuing flow of migrants over the past months has seen several countries temporarily re-imposing border controls – Germany, followed by Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia and Sweden. This temporary reintroduction of border controls is in line with the Schengen acquis, subject to strict conditions involving a serious threat to public policy or internal security and time limitations. That is an issue. The migration pressure has not decreased, and time is running out. The only way to go beyond the maximum time limit during which internal border controls may be carried out is to adopt a Council recommendation based on a Commission proposal under Article 26 of the Schengen Borders Code. This is a scenario that involves an elaborate procedure under the Schengen evaluation mechanism. This scenario should result in a series of measures protecting the overall functioning of the Schengen system, a system which is at the heart of the European project and one of its greatest achievements, as I mentioned. On this basis, the EU Interior Ministers discussed the matter informally in Amsterdam on 25 and 26 January 2015. There was broad support for inviting the Commission to make a proposal for a recommendation under Article 26 of the Schengen Borders Code. We are committed. The Presidency is committed to maintaining the Schengen system. It will do all it can to find, in cooperation with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States concerned, a solution to the current problems. Coming back to the principle of non-refoulement, there were quite a few remarks on this issue. This remains a key principle of our politics. In order to ease the migratory pressure on front-line Member States and to ensure the identification of those third-country nationals in real need of international protection, the Council is working hard to operationalise the network of hot spots and to speed up the implementation of the relocation and resettlement mechanisms adopted in 2015. In that context, the issue of non-refoulement remains extremely important and a principle. On Turkey, the establishment of the EU common list of safe countries of origin is, as many have stated here this afternoon, a very complex issue and one that the Council preparatory bodies are currently discussing. The final decision will have to be reached later on the basis of a very precise assessment on the EU-Turkey joint action plan, as welcomed by the European Council at its meeting in October. This is, as you know, part of a comprehensive cooperation agenda based on shared responsibility, mutual commitment and delivery. I just wanted to answer a question from Mr Verhofstadt. This does not mean that money is automatically sent to the Turkish Government. That is not the case. We are in the process of working with the Turkish Government on assurances that this is not a blank cheque to the Turkish Government but funding for programmes that have to alleviate the conditions of refugees in Turkey. I think Mr Olbrycht also mentioned the MFF in this context. We had a conference in Amsterdam last week where many speakers argued that the migration crisis demonstrates the need for more flexibility in the EU budget to allow us to have the resources available to meet unexpected challenges. We will try to move that forward within the time that we have in our Presidency to see how much more flexibility we can bring to our budget, something which is so badly needed in this crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1983, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

Europe cannot view the issue of refugees as a problem that begins and ends at the Greek, Italian, Cypriot or Maltese borders. We are facing a crisis affecting Europe as a whole, which requires a one-on-one, concerted and shared responsibility response. Nationalist rhetoric, isolation and repression are not the answer. The refugee crisis needs two-dimensional solutions: on the one hand, Europe must ensure the conditions to welcome people fleeing war and violence with dignity, without prejudice and without prejudice; on the other hand, it must commit itself to conflict resolution, collaborating with the countries and regions from which these people come.

Developments in the wake of the current refugee crisis and the response to the Paris terror must not lead to the abandonment of Schengen.

In practical terms, border controls already include significant restrictions on the free movement of goods in the EU and the freedom of movement of Europeans. Traffic jams with waiting times of more than one hour, such as those occurring at peak times at the checkpoint on the A8 Salzburg-Munich, could become the order of the day in the future if border controls are reintroduced. This will have a negative economic impact on the EU's internal market and significant burdens on travellers. This is already noticeable and can be quanted in figures.

I'm sure many of those who have been present at this debate could use a sit-in and listen to what we have to say. Because equality is a priority, too, in our work and in our political commitment. Because women are 50% of the population of the European Union and politics cannot be done behind us. Therefore, the first thing we are asking is to be heard and to know well what this House's approach is to the question we are moving to the Commission today. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union require the Commission to implement policies on equality between men and women, because we are talking about a principle and a fundamental value of the European project. The current strategy was completed in 2015. In June 2015, this House was already positioned in this regard, with a debate on what the content should be and what guidelines should be that the European Commission should propose in the new gender strategy, in the new strategy of equality between men and women. A public consultation was also opened, where more than 90% of the people who participated in it established that it was essential, that it was essential and that it was urgent that this political priority should become a commitment on the part of the European institutions and, therefore, that a new gender equality strategy be launched. Since June 2015, when this House has been mostly positioned and urged the European Commission to carry out this work, we have been waiting for the Commission's response. And the Commission's reply was that, in December 2015, it adopted a working document drawn up by the Commission services, which we find very respectable. It seems to us that it has content that needs to be taken into account, but we believe that it completely loses the commitment that should be made on a political level. Because a working document has no budget. Because in a working document you cannot see what the implementation of the measures put in place will be like. Because a working document cannot be evaluated. And for policies to succeed, budgeting is needed and evaluation mechanisms are needed.  That is why we stress the need for a strategy of equality between men and women by the College of Commissioners, because this has to be a commitment of the whole College as a whole and must be debated and approved by the European Commission, which, at the moment, has a responsibility to launch the policies of equality between men and women. Because we're talking about fighting gender-based violence. We're talking about a pay gap. We're talking about reconciliation between personal and work life. We are talking about fundamental issues on the European Union's political agenda, and that we have an obligation to be able, together with the Member States, to implement. Because in recent years we have seen how, together with all the crises that occurred within Europe — the economic crisis, the refugee crisis, the social crisis - finally, the great harms of all of them are still women. And, therefore, to lose the gender perspective in all policies and to be able to understand that transversality is fundamental is an indispensable issue and that we will continue to claim on the part of this Parliament. We therefore also take advantage of this debate to ask the Commission why it has not adopted, in a public and transparent manner, a new communication on the strategy for gender equality. We want to know why this document has not been adopted, it has not been discussed, it has not been approved by the College of Commissioners. And we want to know what the Commission is waiting for this to be the case, so that you can also discuss how, through the various policies, through the work of the various Commissioners, progress can be made on the principle of equality between men and women. And we also want to know how the European Commission will work with the Presidency and the trio of presidencies to present, throughout 2016, a strategy of equality between men and women. Term. It's critical. It's enforceable. We would have liked to have had Mrs Jourová, the person responsible for this matter at the College of Commissioners, here today.

The Commission published its ‘Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019’ on 3 December 2015 as its framework plan for future actions to improve gender equality. The strategic engagement is a follow-up and continuation of the Commission’s 2010-2015 strategy for equality between women and men. The priorities in the 2010-2015 strategy for equality between women and men remain valid. The wide consultations and the evaluation that we carried out to prepare the strategic engagement clearly confirms this. While progress has been achieved, further action is needed to secure the necessary changes. Gender and gender equality is an important part of the Juncker Commission’s agenda. As you know, this Commission also embarked on a better regulation programme, refocusing its activities and instruments. As a representative of the Commission and a member of the College, I can confirm to you that the new strategic engagement is the official Commission position, which has the political support of the entire Commission. It is set out in its 2016 Work Programme: the Commission is engaged in practical work to promote gender equality. As was explained at the constructive exchange of views with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) on 14 December, we should focus on the delivery of change on the ground. The strategic engagement describes how gender equality actions will be focused on five priority areas during this Commission mandate: increasing female labour-market participation and equal economic independence; reducing the gender pay, earnings and pension gaps and thus fighting poverty among women; promoting equality between women and men in decision-making; combating gender-based violence and protecting and supporting victims; promoting gender equality and women’s rights across the world. It also confirms the integration of the consideration of gender equality into every aspect of European Union interventions. There are more than 30 key actions to be implemented in each of the five priority areas identified, as well as objectives and timelines for these actions, responsibilities in the Commission’s services and funding available to support progress. Together with timelines and indicators, the strategic engagement defines a baseline against which future progress will be measured on a regular basis. The strategic engagement builds on the targets agreed at EU level. In particular it supports reaching the European Union’s 2020 target of a 75% employment rate for both men and women. It is a concrete planning instrument for the Commission which other stakeholders are welcome to join. On 15 January 2016 the Commission participated in the Council’s Working Party on Social Questions, which held a first exchange on the draft Council Conclusions on the strategic engagement for gender equality. The Dutch Presidency expressed its intention to have the Council Conclusions adopted at the March meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO). The strategic engagement for gender equality provides a basis for gender equality actions in the coming years and in particular covers the key issues Parliament identified in its June 2015 resolution. It represents the Commission’s work programme for gender equality policy for 2016-2019.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2016, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Constance LE GRIP", "mepid": "101580", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, we are meeting this evening in this Chamber of the Strasbourg Parliament to re-debate the crucial issue of gender equality, in favour of an oral question that a number of political groups have wished to address to the European Commission and which pointed the finger and stigmatised the fact that the Commission had not published a document on a certain type of status , a communication on a strategic commitment but only a working document that sets out its roadmap and lists its commitments and lines of action for the period 2015-2019.  Quite frankly, on a personal basis and on behalf of the EPP Group, the semantic quarrels and the debates, a little anecdotal - forgive me, I do not want to hurt anyone - on the question of the status and form of this or that document, little to do. What matters is the political will, the commitment, the intensity with which a number of areas of action are identified as well as processes, methods, methodology. From this perspective, the methodology, the areas of action, the commitments published by the European Commission, by Commissioner Jourova, in the working paper correspond exactly to the priorities and concerns of the EPP Group. We want a concrete, pragmatic, effective, operational approach, through measurable, measurable objectives, evaluation procedures, we want to emphasise the need to properly transpose, to properly implement existing legislation before considering possible new legislative proposals. In short, we want to be useful, concrete, pragmatic and focus on what we can do usefully as the European Parliament, as members of the Committee on Women's Rights, as a European institution, to stimulate Member States and put pressure on them to fulfil their responsibilities.

Today, the majority of parliamentarians – the European Parliament, we – are once again calling for our right. We have a moral right to the equality strategy being continued in Europe. And we demand this right with great self-confidence. We have a majority decision by Parliament, and Parliament calls on the Commission to launch a strategy for gender equality. We also have the unanimous tailwind of the Member States, which are fully behind the strategy. And we have the support of the citizens of the EU, who, in the course of a survey, clearly voted in favour of the 'yes' vote on equality issues. Commissioner Jurova constantly asserts that an internal working document is about the same as a strategy or communication. And Mrs Jurova knows that this is not true. It is a weaker paper that she is presenting to us. It is a lukewarm paper that it is presenting to us, and it is therefore a devaluation of the issue of equality and a devaluation of the people of Europe. I personally had a conversation today with Martin Schulz, the President of Parliament, and I personally drew his attention to the maladministration. He will talk to Mr Juncker again in the near future and he will ask for fairness for Parliament, because Parliament deserves fairness. Anyone who acts against women's rights weakens Europe. Anyone who acts against equality is a sexist. Those who prevent a strategy are missing basic democratic values. We want a strategy, and we want it now. I think everything has been said on this subject. I would like to give Mrs Jurova some of the remaining 30 seconds to reflect. (The President began to continue on the agenda) No, Mr President, I have ten seconds to speak, and during this time Mrs Jurova is supposed to reflect.

Moreover, the evaluation of the past strategy resulted in a specific call to further strengthen the strategic approach adopted in 2010 and not to weaken it.

It is extremely serious because gender inequality is a trampling on women's right, and it is a democratic and social problem.  I will not bore you with statistics, but it is so extremely clear that we live in a society where women do not have the same access to power and resources as men. That is something we need to change. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and in order to get anywhere in the work on gender equality, we need political vision and concrete commitments. That is why the Council wants a gender equality strategy. That is why we in Parliament want a gender equality strategy. It's political leadership.  In fact, blocking the development of a gender equality strategy, as the Commission is now doing, is perfect for power and a display of patriarchal arrogance. No, we do not want our centuries-old traditions of oppression of women and of oppression of LGBTQ people.  No thanks, it is time to move forward, it is time for a rethink in the Commission.

After all, the only thing it has produced is a staff working document; very useful indeed if you are caught short in a public convenience without toilet paper. But I have to ask, what have the numerous EU strategies, funding initiatives and quangos actually achieved? Do I feel more empowered and safer than ever before? No, in fact I would argue the reverse is true. I am sure many of those women in Cologne, Sweden and elsewhere feel exactly the same. What did you think was going to happen when the EU opened the door to millions of people from countries and cultures where women are treated as second class citizens and LGBTI people are treated even worse? The wilful cover-up at the facts surrounding Cologne and elsewhere by politicians, the authorities and the press shows you that European politicians care more about political correctness than actually protecting the safety and rights of women. The EU is clearly trying to deny that this kind of violence even exists. What about trafficking? A UK Government report says that free movement within the EU is extensively exploited by organised criminals to bring human trafficking victims to the UK.

A European coordinator in the field of preventing violence against women and girls should lead it.

Today, there is still a big difference between women's and men's pensions, which increases the vulnerability of older women. In addition to the necessary regulations and compliance with them, it is particularly important to contribute to changing our perception of the role of women in society. The previous strategy has steered the gender balance in the right direction, which is why the guidelines for the coming years are important. What steps do you plan to take to further promote women's training? How do you intend to act to ensure that having children does not disadvantage women, either in terms of the pay gap or in retirement? These issues are also not incidentally important because the current demographic trends in Europe do not give much cause for optimism.

I know that the Member States often say: huch, there is subsidiarity, and then they slow down what is possible. I am absolutely aware of this. Nevertheless, the Commission should not be discouraged. Because women are beaten, they are sexually harassed. Women have different health problems than men. The supervisory boards still look sad: almost no women, many more men.

Why are we proposing the Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019? Because it is a reference framework for increasing efforts to promote gender equality at all levels – at European, national, regional and local level. We need a coordination mechanism and better cooperation between Member States so as to encourage Member States to improve their instruments.

It is about health, and that is why it is so important. The issue we are discussing here is very clear and straightforward. We have a legal text, called the Regulation, and in this legal text there is a legally-binding mandate for the European Commission to adopt scientific criteria for endocrine disruptors by December 2013. It is not written in Chinese. We have many official languages in the EU, but Chinese is not one of them. So it is very clear and straightforward: by December 2013, the European Commission had to adopt scientific criteria for endocrine disruptors. I must say I can be extremely flexible if there are technical reasons for not being on time, but I am very inflexible when there are political reasons behind not meeting a deadline, and of course that is the case here. The Court ruling is extremely clear: the Commission should have adopted the scientific criteria in December 2013. To quote from the Court ruling: ‘There is no provision of the Regulation which requires an impact assessment’. So I am not against an impact assessment; I think it is a very valuable tool in this case too. But before starting an impact assessment, the Commission should have adopted the scientific criteria.

This did not happen. In failing to adopt delegated acts, the Commission has clearly failed to fulfil its obligation to take measures for which it has legal responsibility.  Sweden took the Commission to the General Court in July 2014, supported by a few Member States, including my country, Finland, for dereliction of duty. The lawsuit was won in December 2015. Despite the decision of the General Court, the Commission has been very resentment with regard to the adoption of delegated acts defining the criteria. Why has the Commission been so slow in defining the criteria? Indeed, there are several examples of the Commission's desire for power to adopt delegated acts on matters not covered by delegated acts. And once, when delegated acts are rightly needed by the court, they can be pulled out of the roads, mainly by hotties. Hormone disruptors are a very serious matter. Under greatest threat are fetuses, which, if exposed, can get changes in their organs and metabolism.

Today I want to dispel all doubts – once again, dispel all doubts – regarding the Commission’s intentions. It seems that there has been some misunderstanding, so let me be very clear. The Commission has a firm intention to comply. This is a judgment of the Court – and we will do this. In the judgment of 16 December 2015, the General Court ruled that the European Commission had breached European Union law by failing to set criteria – constant criteria – to identify endocrine disruptors. And it is true. The Court stated that according to the Biocides Regulation the Commission had a clear, precise and unconditional obligation to adopt delegated acts to set the criteria by December 2013. That was three years ago. In addition, the Court ruled that there is no provision in this regulation requiring the carrying out of an impact assessment. This is also, from the Court’s side, a crystal clear position. But let me continue. I know that the reaction of the Commission to this judgment has been subject to some criticism, and this is okay; in a democracy, this is normal. In particular, the decision to finalise a nearly-completed impact assessment was called into question, notably by some honourable Members, and I have read with attention the many letters addressed to President Juncker or myself, including those from Members of this House. I have read them very carefully. I have all the papers on my table. However, the Commission would like to clarify that the impact assessment acts as a useful and even essential tool to guide its future decision on the criteria. And I fully agree with you when you mention that, yes, the impact assessment is really interesting too, especially when we debated criteria, because we need the criteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition on endocrine disruptors is not enough. Ms Rivasi was with me in conference debating different positions and how it is not easy to describe criteria. This is about criteria. The Commission decided in 2013 to undertake an impact assessment in view not only of the scientific complexity of the issue but also of the fact that this will be a pioneering work. There is indeed no legislation setting a precedent in this area; we all know that very well. First, science is not unanimous on how scientific criteria should be defined, and we heard those debates together. Diverging views still exist – still exist –within the scientific community on critical points, on how endocrine disruptors should be identified, because we must speak about regulatory issues. Second, we are defining the scientific criteria in a regulatory context, and views diverge among regulators worldwide – second options. In fact there are no legally-binding criteria in third countries for identifying endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The European Union is a pioneer in this aspect. Moreover, within the EU some Member States support a hazard-based approach and others a risk-based approach. Those differences exist today. We are facing those differences all together. The evidence gathered during the impact assessment will enable us – and here I also include the Members of this Parliament – to have a say in all the measures, to take a duly informed decision. Let me be very clear once again. The Commission is fully aware that the deadline has passed and has every intention to comply with the judgment of the Court. Have no doubts about that. The preparation of the impact assessment is well advanced and, in response to the judgment of the Court, the Commission will present, before summer this year – 2016 – new scientific criteria for endocrine disruptors. As you know, two separate axes need to be presented. First, an implementing regulation containing the criteria which will be applied to the chemical substances falling under the Plant Protection Product Regulation and under the so-called PRAC procedure. Second, a delegated act containing criteria applicable under the Biocidal Products Regulation. Once again I can reassure Parliament that the Commission is committed to complying with the judgment. We will therefore present, before this summer, criteria which will be specified in an objective manner based on scientific evidence. I am not the judge when science has different opinions, but we need to understand that today we are ready to see more and more convergent views from different schools and different debates. Our legislation in these two areas is considered to be among the strictest in the world and I will ensure that a high level of protection for human health and the environment, including from endocrine disruptors, is fully maintained. The interim criteria for defining endocrine disruptors set in the plant protection and biocidal products legislation are legally binding till those days and applicable. Of course it is not enough; of course we must move immediately to seeing possibilities of, by this summer, having some constant endocrine disruptors criteria. I hope you have found helpful and positive the transparency provided throughout the whole of our preparatory work last year. I was personally very attentive to communicating regularly and openly with you on this complex issue and I intend to continue to do so. We should aim together to adopt the best decision on this very important matter and I count on your constructive support for the next steps that will now come in the very near future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2055, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Jens GIESEKE", "mepid": "124807", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner Andriukaitis, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. The free definition of criteria for hormone-active substances, the so-called endocrine disruptors, is extremely important from the point of view of health protection for European citizens. However, the question is very complicated and very technical and therefore only serious to be answered by scientists and experts. This question is not suitable for political games or ideological debates. Since 16.12.2015, we have had a judgment of the European Court of Justice which shows that the European Commission has missed a deadline. We would not have needed a trial for this finding. What we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats made clear months ago is still true: the Commission must complete the impact assessment as soon as possible and draw up the criteria quickly. Commissioner, here I take you at your word: if you manage to do so by the summer of 2016, that is a good step in the right direction. It would be wrong to assume that the judgment of the European Court of Justice would lead to the Commission cancelling the impact assessment and abandoning the criteria altogether. It is important, as the Commissioner has just made clear, how controversial this issue of the definition of endocrine disruptors is. The often very emotional debate of recent months shows that we had more than 27 000 submissions from citizens during the consultation alone, but more than 25 000 came from a few NGOs.

Some Members said that I represent the industry; I am sorry, but that is a very unfair argument. I met several times with endocrinologists, toxicologists and biochemists. A few weeks ago I debated together with our senior advisers and organised meetings between different groups of scientists. I would like to invite you to debate very openly because we must speak about scientific evidence and about real arguments. It is very important for all of us, because I have never agreed to be on the side of industry. My first responsibility is to public health. I am very proud that I have very many allies here. I am very happy that we are maybe ready to fight against alcohol, tobacco, sugar and salt, because they are extremely damaging, especially tobacco. When we really speak about people’s health I will be very happy to have so many allies here in this House. Speaking of this difficult issue, as you will remember, last year I said that the impact assessment was not about economic and social aspects. It is about scientific criteria and how to define potency, exposure, qualification and so on. I am not a biochemical scientist, and this is not such an easy debate. Last year we organised three round tables and organised conferences together and held debates. If you think I am on the side of the industry, please show me how this can be. I am very honest. My diploma is as a medical doctor. I am responsible and I am ready to work. In our reduced assessment time we started with methodology and debated with GFC. There are 600 chemical materials to be evaluated on this. I cannot see how we could deal with it any quicker. Please show me. Please help me. I am also green like you, but I will not play a game I consider to be dishonest. I am ready to say very clearly that we are ready to move forward as soon as possible and to do our job.  It would be nice to have a result by the end of 2016 maybe. Today we decided to give ourselves until the summer to decide. Please do better. I wish to be very open and very transparent, but I ask you also to work together and to be transparent in all questions. Speaking of all questions related to health, I will be very happy to speak about electronic cigarettes and tobacco and about all the bad things we currently face. These are very difficult conditions for the European Union to speak about public health issues and how the cost of public health could be reduced in the European Union. The figures are terrible. I am ready to do my job but, believe me, first of all we need manageable regulatory criteria. I do not think this is so easy because these issues are very complex. But when I hear such populist arguments, I am sorry but I must respond that I am very open and transparent. I will never be in a lobby on any given side. But it is a very difficult job. We all must debate very seriously and deeply about how to assess, how to regulate, how to understand and how to move forward. I am doing my job. I have been in office only for one year and four months. I have lost one year and four months. I would like to know how to be more effective, but we must all be effective together. We are ready to do our job and to move forward as much as possible to come up with some criteria by the summer and to set a very good example for the wider world, because we are pioneers.

They can also pose a threat to fauna: they can affect reproduction (getting into the waters limit the fertility of fish) or even the disappearance of certain species (ED compounds with mass extinction of bees are studied). On the other hand, they are very effective, and their use reduces the consumption of plant protection products in general. A total ban on their use can mean large crop losses due to the lack of effective alternative measures. There is also a risk that some farmers will start importing funds unofficially, e.g. from Ukraine, the composition and harmfulness of which will not be known. In order to protect the environment effectively and at the same time not impose a disproportionate burden on farmers, the assessment criteria should be revised in such a way that all active substances are not included in the category of so-called endocrine disruptors, but only those that have a negative impact on the environment and human health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2089, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Jarosław KALINOWSKI", "mepid": "96771", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – If we misdefine the criteria for endocrine disruptors, thereby preventing the use of extremely useful and safe plant protection products, we will cause great harm to our farmers.

I fully trust that the French authorities have taken all the necessary measures to address this situation and are doing their utmost to clarify exactly what happened. I am personally in close contact with the French Minister of Health to monitor the situation and any new developments related to the investigations. It is important that we all wait for the outcome of this investigation before drawing any conclusions. Clinical trials are essential for the development of new medicines and to improve, compare and refine treatments using already—authorised medicines. Clinical trials are often the last hope for patients suffering from rare or serious conditions. In areas such as paediatric oncology, for example, there are clearly established links between participation in clinical trials and the life expectancy of patients. It should not be forgotten that a certain risk is associated with any clinical trial. Clinical research is a sector in which Europe is a world leader. Offering Europeans patients the best, most innovative treatments under the highest standards of patient protection remains the main objective of regulation in this area. We can all agree that transparency is an essential component of clinical research. It should be possible to know which clinical trials are ongoing, where, by whom, what their purpose is and what are the recruitment criteria. Some of this information is already available via the existing EU Clinical Trials Register managed by the European Medicines Agency, with which I am in constant contact. Furthermore, once a trial has been completed, its outcome – whether positive or negative – should be made publicly available. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has pro-actively engaged in a policy to release clinical study reports submitted to the agency as part of the application for marketing authorisation of human medicines before this summer. This will make Europe a true frontrunner as regards the release of data concerning clinical trials. This transparency initiative creates a bridge from now until when the new clinical trial regulations become applicable. This will trigger real improvement as regards transparency. All information on clinical trials authorised by Member States will be stored in a new European Union database managed by EMA, with some exceptions which were defined during the legislative process. The whole content of the European Union database will be publicly available. Furthermore, in cases of overriding public interest, all information concerning specific trials will immediately be made publicly available. The European Union database is being developed by the European Medicines Agency. This IT tool is crucial for the correct functioning of the new regulation. It will have to handle the flow of information concerning the thousands of clinical trials ongoing every day in Europe. It certainly constitutes a complex and challenging IT project. While understanding all the difficult technical challenges, I regret to say that this project is running behind schedule. All concerned parties – EMA, Member States and the Commission – will have to step up efforts to make the EU database operational as soon as possible, in order to enable the full implementation of the new regulation. To date, there are no elements indicating that the application of the new regulation would have prevented this incident in France. I am sure that EMA has, and will deploy, the necessary technical resources. The Commission will monitor this closely. I also call on all Member States, because cooperation between EMA and the Member States is sometimes very difficult. I call on them to scale up their constructive collaboration on this project. Madam President, honourable Members, let me conclude by underlining once again the importance of increased transparency of clinical trials in Europe. This will be achieved under the new regulation on clinical trials. I appeal again to all interested parties to work constructively together in order for the regulation to become applicable as early as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2094, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Matthias GROOTE", "mepid": "34728", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

I would like to express my condolences once again to the victims who have been injured. There was also one fatality.

Madam President, I will echo Mr Groote's words from the outset. Until now, in fact, clinical trials have always had good press. Those who participate, medical staff, often, or medical students, are happy to contribute to biomedical research. Then there was this accident in Rennes on Sunday, January 10: one dead and five people hospitalized during the test of an analgesic product carried out in Phase 1, that is to say on a small group of healthy volunteers. An extremely rare but serious accident, which justifies our debate tonight. I would also like to convey my thoughts to the families of the victims and to those who are still fighting for their health. This is an opportunity tonight to remind us that these clinical trials are more than ever an indispensable step before any drug market and that Europe must remain a strong place in this research. I hope that the country where I come from, Belgium, which manufactures 15% of European medicines, will continue to be recognised for its expertise in this area. I would like to ask our Commissioner two questions about transparency. Is it true, Commissioner, that the publication of all the results of drug tests, one of the flagship measures of the new European regulation which Parliament has hardly negotiated, is being postponed from May 2016 to 2018?  Is it also true that the current trend of laboratories in Europe is to set up parallel groups in Phase 1, which are groups where patients receive a higher dose from the outset without prior testing? In any case, this is what happened in Rennes, the six victims being precisely those who had received these famous higher doses.  We know that Europe is facing increasing competition from elsewhere in this sector, but you will of course agree with us that the race to validate its clinical trials must never come at the expense of the health and safety of European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2096, "date": "2016-02-02.json", "name": "Anja HAZEKAMP", "mepid": "125023", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Before a drug enters the market and even before clinical trials take place, they are routinely tested on animals.

Animal tests are unethical, they cause a lot of pain and stress in the animals, but above all are completely unreliable. The predictive value of animal models is extremely low and there is no guarantee that drugs are safe because they have been tested on animals. Using these dodgy tests, human lives are being put at risk, as was shown in France last month. According to the French Minister, this drug had been extensively tested on animals, even chimpanzees. Therefore, two questions to the Commissioner: is it true that these substances have been tested on chimpanzees even though this is prohibited in Europe?

I would also like to send all my thoughts to those families who are affected. The problem with this death is that we are faced with the non-transparency and opacity of laboratories that test their molecules, in this case a Portuguese laboratory called Bial. We obtained the protocol for the clinical trial in question, which was published by the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products in France on 22 January. However, we were not able to obtain two records: the experimental drug, which indicates the pharmacological effects of the drug being tested, and the preclinical trials on animals, particularly chimpanzees. The Agency did not publish them because they could not obtain them. The Portuguese laboratory hides behind the trade secret. However, the Commission and you, Commissioner, have the power to put pressure on the European Medicines Agency, which I contacted and who informed me that it would delay the publication of this database until 2018, which answers Mrs Ries's question.

First of all, we can be alarmed that the French health authorities were not notified until four days after the trial was stopped by the company that carried out it on behalf of the Portuguese laboratory. I believe that information on experimental protocols must be accessible to the public, who have the right to know all the effects of the drugs they are prescribed. In 2014, when the Clinical Data Regulation was adopted, we were able to advance transparency by ensuring that clinical study reports were not considered commercially confidential once the drug was granted marketing approval.  However, statements from pharmaceutical companies, as well as from the European Medicines Agency, are converging to reduce the scope of this regulation, which will come into force in May 2016, with a view to strengthening a certain industrial protectionism. The European Medicines Agency has thus provided a procedure that allows firms to censor their clinical study reports before they go online and imposes various restrictions that make these reports unusable for analysis or research purposes. Full publicity of clinical trial data is the condition for reassuring European citizens. Finally, in the wake of this tragedy in Rennes and within the framework of this regulation, which I recall, will be in effect at the end of May 2016, we will have to pay particular attention to certain clinical trials involving drugs used out of control, since they can be considered as low-level trials, i.e. less well supervised. There is a risk of abuse and new health scandals. I call on the Commission and the European Medicines Agency to pay attention to these practices.
