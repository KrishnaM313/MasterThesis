We got to know gloomy news around the world this weekend. In Turkey, 44 people died in a bomb attack outside the Beşiktas Istanbul stadium. In Somalia, in the port of Mogadishu, 30 people were killed in a bomb attack. In Egypt, a bomb was dropped at the Coptic Church of Cairo, where 25 people died. These are three more attacks in our year 2016, in which the entire world is hit practically every day by the geissl of terrorism. There is no difference in this terrorism. He meets us in Europe as well as in Africa, in Asia as well as in America. He's meeting us all! He usually meets unruly people, and he meets Christians as well as Muslims. Men, women and, in particularly disgusting form, children are victims of these terrorist attacks. I believe that I speak on behalf of all of you when I say here that there is no justification for anything that this terrorist represents. Whether they call themselves Da'esh, Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab or Freedom Falcons, or all the other terrorist organizations, whatever their names, they are fighting tolerance, solidarity, friendship and humanity in the world. They want to spread fear and intimidate us. Therefore, the answer to this terror can only be that we continue to stand by our values of tolerance, solidarity, friendship and humanity. This will be more difficult with every bomb attack and every victim, but if we stopped, ladies and gentlemen, by these values, then the terrorists would have won. That is why I would ask you to make a contribution by the European Parliament to continue this fight for tolerance and respect and against this inhuman terror. We should also not fail to mention that, for example, in the Nigerian uyo through a collapsed church roof 160 people died during a church service. This is all news that is profoundly shaking us, and on behalf of all the Members of this House, I would like to express our deepest sympathy to the victims and their families. Ladies and gentlemen! I would also like to inform you that today I sent two letters — one to the Egyptian President and one to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. You will recall a year ago we discussed the case of Irish citizen Ibrahim Halawa, a 17-year-old young man, who took part in a demonstration in Cairo, who was then arrested, was charged as a minor and is now 21 years old. Now the trial begins, and the young man is threatened with the death penalty because he took part in a demonstration. I call on the Egyptian Government to honour its human obligation to treat this young man as a minor at the time of his arrest. Last week, an opposition politician from Ethiopia, Dr Merera Gudina, met a number of colleagues from this House to report on the serious and dramatic situation in Ethiopia. He was arrested on his return and is being held in an unknown location. I have called on the Government of Ethiopia to release Dr Gudina immediately.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": " The final draft agenda for this partsession, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 December 2016, pursuant to Rule 149 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.

There are reasons to always debate the state of law, about democracy, because that is the essence of our Union.

I now have three different requests for this process. I will not allow any further progress on a point of order on this matter, but we are now bringing order to this mess. Mr Liberadzki's request stipulates that we postpone this by one day. Mr Carver's request is to take it completely off the agenda. Mr Lewandowski's request is to remove it from the agenda now, referring to committee and back to the agenda of the next plenary sitting. Mr Lewandowski, I have just said that your request is the most farthest, but the Carver request to take it completely off the agenda is the farthest. That's clear. That is why I will now put this motion to the vote first. That was the motion for which Mr Jurek and Mrs Reintke spoke against. I repeat the motion once again so that everyone knows what we are voting on: to completely remove the situation of the rule of law and democracy in Poland.

These obligations may apply, for example, to special charges related to accidents at work, to the pensions of railway workers who have previously retired from certain heavy work, or to the costs of level crossings. Compensation arising from those obligations is divided into fifteen different categories, whose specific scope and calculation principles are defined in the Annexes to the Regulation. The regulation was drawn up at a time when railway companies were responsible for both the operation of rail transport and the management of rail infra. At the time, the aim of the regulation was to put railway undertakings on the same line with other modes of transport, taking into account social costs and the inclusion of external costs in fares. According to the Commission, since 2007 this Regulation has been regularly used by four Member States: Belgium, Germany, Italy and Poland. Among the fifteen categories mentioned in the Regulation, payments have actually been made in only three. Parliament's first reading position was adopted on 26 February 2014. At the time, Parliament supported the repeal of the decree but required that the repeal should be delayed for two years. Following Parliament's approval of its position at first reading, the institutional negotiations were extended from October 2015 to April 2016 with the Presidents of the Council Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In early negotiations and stakeholder consultations at the second reading, we found that a transitional period is still needed for compensation for the level crossing costs — category four — because some Member States continue to use the regulation as a basis for compensation for level crossings. Member States may continue to reimburse crossing equipment costs on the basis of Article 8 of Directive 2012/34, but may still need time to change their national laws and administrative provisions. That is why, as rapporteur, my position is that the repeal of the Regulation shall comply with the Commission's proposal, with the exception of the provisions concerning the regularisation of the accounting for category four in Annex four. For category four, these provisions will continue to apply until 31 December 2017. This will allow Member States to adapt their legislation on the reimbursement of certain level crossing costs. In this context, however, I would like to emphasise that all Member States should comply with previous regulations and make no delay in transposing Directive 2012/34.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": " rapporteur. — (NL) Mr President, today we are discussing a package of three closely interrelated proposals. It is an honour to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the middle section, which I have the honour to deal with, for their cooperative work today. But I would also like to draw attention to the cooperation with my colleagues Kyllönen and Sassoli to bring this package to a successful conclusion. It wasn't a simple package. Today we are talking about a further opening up of the market in the field of European rail. It is an extension of the first, second and third railway packages, and it is a next step, because there will not be a full market opening with this railway package either. In the meantime, the people of Europe also think somewhat differently about this market opening than when these proposals were written, and that is something we need to look closely at. There is a tension between the opening of the market and the public service. Many people think that public services will increase due to the opening of the market. However, we certainly do not have that guarantee, especially since there are many exceptions to the opening of the market. Member States, or at least the competent authorities, may choose from a range of exceptions in order to avoid or avoid public procurement. We have discussed all this extensively in technical consultation, and I am pleased that the national supervisors will have a greater role in this fourth railway package. This applies in particular to the exception to direct award, but also to the availability of rolling stock for the new entrepreneur entering the market. The social chapter was a difficult chapter. We have negotiated this for a long time and, in particular, with my colleague Liberadzki from the Social Democrats, we have spoken intensively. I assume that we have now struck a balance between the dynamics of the opening of the market and the protection of workers. What I have noticed in this dossier is that Directive 2001/23, which deals with the protection of workers, is being applied very moderately by the Member States, and that is an essential point for the social protection of workers. Market opening is ok, but certainly not at any price. To conclude, I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Luxembourgers and of my own country, the Dutch, for having moved this difficult dossier smoothly after three years. That wasn't easy. I have outlined what we have done: further market opening, particularly in order to break state monopolies, protection of workers, but not marketing the case to death in the sense of absolute liberalisation.

There has been close cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency, in particular the Dutch Presidency and the Luxembourg Presidency, which opened the trilogue, and all allowed them to to complete a complex path, but which went in the direction desired by Parliament. We know very well that the railway systems are very complex and the number of employees of European companies shows this: in Italy there are about 70 000, in France it is estimated about 150 000 Employees, in Germany 170 000, in Belgium there are about 30 000. So we are talking about large national companies which, of course, offer the possibility of European know-how of particular esteem. Considering the numbers, it is clear that the reform, as it was conceived, would have also caused a great deal of debate, but this is natural, especially in those countries that preferred to consolidate their own position, avoiding market openness and the consequences of competition. As I said, the scale of the reform is really historic, since it touches on all the aspects that remained uncovered in order to achieve a real liberalisation of the market. One of the most contentious points in Parliament has been on the separation between the infrastructure manager and rail enterprise. In the end, after multiple interventions on the text, Parliament and the Council shared the position that there should not be complete separation and that existing models can continue to coexist, but that is momentous put safeguards in place to ensure that infrastructure managers are impartial and can operate independently. I also recall, to clarify the philosophy of reform on a point on which incomprehensible controversy is being made, that the network remains public; network and maintenance remain public and not only for the costs impossible to incur for any private person, but as a recognition of a public good that we are committed to protecting. It is the service to go to the race instead. And linked to the structure of the railway undertaking there is a sensitive issue such as financial transparency, which is inescapable for the European Parliament. We have always reasoned at European level on the whole text and have determined that the distribution of dividends made with public money do not go to holding companies to avoid private use of funding public, but they go directly to the state. The social fallout of liberalisation, as you will understand, is remarkable; on social issues, after careful debate, proposals on the certification of cabin crew and respect were accepted the requirements on honourability for the maintenance of the railway licence. I want to stress, and I apologise if I take a few more seconds, that the text of the European Parliament has for the first time proposed a wording aimed at protecting rail workers. Of course I thank Parliament for the support it will give to the rail package and I want to thank all those who have cooperated in this reform in many months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, today’s debate marks the culmination of the really hard work and engagement of our three institutions over the course of the last five years to modernise and revitalise the rail sector. This is essential to meet our objective of smart and low-carbon transport mobility in Europe and to make rail competitive again. I would like to thank the Parliament for the support and contribution it has given on this important and highly complex legislative file.

Deep thanks go also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the Council presidencies of the last few years. The fourth Railway Package will complete the internal market for rail services with the opening of domestic passenger service markets. Already by 2020, all European railway undertakings will have the possibility to offer open access services throughout Europe. The principle of the competitive tendering of public service contracts in rail will also become applicable in 2023. With the new governance rules, we will provide fair rules of the game for all rail operators. Market opening is not an end but a means to boost the attractiveness of the rail sector. On the one hand, established railway companies will shape up and become more consumer-oriented in order to withstand competition from new entrants. On the other hand, a better offer of services will help the rail sector become more competitive vis-à-vis other modes of transport. The fourth Railway Package will encourage railway companies to embrace innovation. It will not only stimulate a better use of new technologies and digitalisation, but also develop innovative business models. As a consequence, existing and new railway companies can become more successful European, as well as global, players. The fourth Railway Package also means new opportunities for investment and growth of the railway sector. This will be good for EU citizens who will reap the benefits of more efficient passenger-friendly and cost-effective railways. They will have access to more and better mobility options, such as new types of multi-modality services and customer segment-specific services. More efficient railway companies can be expected to lead to lower fares for travellers, in particular on commercial lines. The Commission is aware that some of you are concerned about the possible impact of market opening on jobs and working conditions in the rail sector. Experience gained in Member States which decided to open their markets before the legal EU deadline shows that working conditions have not deteriorated. On the contrary, the wages of skilled workers, such as train drivers or traffic controllers, have increased. The fourth Railway Package will actually be good for jobs. By providing favourable conditions for the rail sector’s growth, we will secure more high-quality employment and new jobs. Because of the expected traffic growth and the current demographic trends, there is a risk of a shortage of staff in the rail sector. In this context, railway undertakings, as well as infrastructure managers and operators of rail-related services, will actually have to propose attractive working conditions to be able to recruit the necessary staff.

This means that we have the fifth attempt to finally get what is urgently needed, namely that the scarce resource of rail infrastructure can be used optimally across borders. I wish we could get this right now with the fourth package. I would like to remind you — and Mr van de Camp has already mentioned this — that, with the technical pillar, we have also created the technical conditions for rolling stock to be recognised across borders. So now the point is to set the organisational framework. I can only encourage everyone to confirm the agreement we have reached with the Council in the vote on Wednesday. It would be an important message at the end of this year that, after lengthy negotiations, and Commissioner has drawn attention to this — after five years — we are finally able to achieve another small gradual market opening in this area. We have to be clear about one thing: if, on the one hand, we spend money on infrastructure through the Connecting Europe Facility and through the European Fund for Strategic Investments, and if we place a particular priority as the European Parliament in the rail sector, then we must also enable railway companies to be able to: to make the best use of this infrastructure in the interests of citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — Mr President! Of course, the fourth rail package represents, so far, a synthesis of the transition programme in rail transport and an attempt to build a single European railway space. And as to the assumptions in this respect, we do not have any doubts anymore — after all, we want to increase the importance of railways in the transport market and in the transport of persons, and in the transport of freight. The railway is practically at the moment the only branch of transport to show such a small level of internal cohesion within the European Union. This package consists of two parts: technical and political. The technical part definitely brings facilitation, simplification, makes rail slowly similar to aviation, to the automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time this part recognizes standards, standards. The second aspect is the political part mentioned by President Sassoli, containing an element that is called public service - public service obligations. And to that part my group has some reservations. What do these objections apply to? They concern the so-called freedom of transfer of crews between one operator who ends the concession and the new operator. We insist on ensuring the duty of taking over the crew. Why?

This fourth rail package is the end of a long process begun 25 years ago by the European Commission. We would have liked to have had a real European rail, a rail that is competitive in relation to road and other polluting transport, because, I recall, rail transport is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport, the least emitting CO2 and fine particulate matter. We have made no choice but to advance the share of the train in Europe, and if we want to achieve greenhouse gas reduction targets, we have not given enough resources, even though we have the Paris agreements. This aspect, which we are going to vote on Wednesday, on passenger transport is the most important, because it will be experienced directly by European citizens, in their experience as passengers, and by rail workers, who are making a leap into the unknown. On this file, we will be judged on pieces, and it is wrong to say that we will be able to revise this legislative package if it goes wrong. It's wrong! We are committed for at least twenty years, as long as all the stages of opening up to competition provided for in this package are unfolded. All this has been understood by European rail employees. They get our attention because the legislator did his job wrong, and they are afraid for their future. What was done wrong? The first thing is that the European Union has confused “liberating” and “liberalising” rail. A very easy example: in 2006, freight freight was liberalised in Europe. Ten years later, traffic fell by 30%. We liberalized without release, and the opposite effect was achieved. This example must therefore be taken in mind when passenger transport is opened up to competition. The risks that will weigh on passenger transport are of two types: first of all, the risk of deterioration in public transport. Public service networks will be opened from 2023 and the selection of the operator will be done by public procurement. There is no doubt that competition will be done by price and not on quality or high level of service. It will be expected that less safety on board, fewer services on less profitable segments, as the text gives no guarantee on these aspects. However, the solution is simple: it was necessary to impose specifications with the fullest possible mandatory European public service criteria, and that was removed from the text. We cannot vote on this text under these conditions. Another worrying example is social pricing. Other operators will not be obliged to offer social pricing. What does that mean? More low prices for students, the unemployed, people with disabilities or the elderly. We touch the very heart of the public service and our European solidarity system. Finally, for workers, it is serious what is happening: a railway agent has no guarantee that in the event of a change of operator, his employment on the network, which he is used to serve, will be preserved. We are in the process of creating a precarious profession that can be relocated with precariousness that will come back to each procurement. What do we want to show citizens? That the European Union protects them or is it precarious?

And all of you, while you strive to oppose yourself politically, you are asking with one voice these directives which should not be called “railway package” but “rail dismantling”. For that is what it is about: an ever more advanced dismantling of the railway sector to offer it to the financial powers, on the pretext of free competition. Assumed European elites or useful naive of the globalist system, you are underway to fight global warming but encourage international journeys, when it might be more beneficial to promote proximity or the local. When it is argued that competition has allowed rail freight to advance, what I see in my country, France, is a 20 per cent collapse in rail freight in five years. Some will be satisfied with the inclusion in the competition regulation of the obligation on companies to comply with social laws and collective agreements. But still glad that companies must abide by the law! To put such ineptia on paper is proof that it has as its sole purpose the political display that will allow some of you to say to their constituents: “but we have built social protections,” when you know from experience that these pseudo-protections will remain purely theoretical. The increase in service providers will in itself result in increased fraud and social dumping, especially as regards international journeys. Do not be surprised that, year after year, betrayal after renunciation, those you call populists are becoming more and more. These are the policies that you conduct blindly, following the dogma of competition applied to the public service, which disgust citizens, who pay the high price.

The moment we can complete the internal market, really integrate the markets, that’s the time we suddenly forget this political rhetoric and we find all the excuses and we really think that the national interests are those of the historic national railway companies. Well I must say one thing: if these companies are not able to compete between themselves then we can hardly expect that the railway can compete vis-à-vis other modes of transport. And I think we would all agree that the most sustainable mode of transport is the railway. We are making certain progress. I mean if I look at the PSOs I would have expected a bigger step, but it is a step and I think that we should all support it in order to comply with what are our interests, but also our responsibility vis-à-vis the focal point, and that is the consumer.

The train is a good way to achieve it. And it is therefore essential that we bet on this means of transport making it accessible and useful for everyone. The fourth rail package proposes reforms necessary to achieve a better rail network, but, by any chance, the liberalisation of the railway sector is also being fenced. And it does so on the pretext that free competition will mean improving the quality of service and competitive prices. But the experience of privatization of public services is clear and demonstrates this. When the UK privatized its railroad, services deteriorated, affecting security; prices and salaries of executives of the privatized companies multiplied, some of which later broke. Total, it ended up costing the state twice as much as when it was public. In the end, the Labour Government, in the face of such a disaster, decided to renationalize it again. A public service is not for business; it is to meet a common need, which in this case is transport. If we add business profits to the railway, the result will be that the contracting companies will obtain their profits by raising prices and cutting quality of service and firing workers. And on top of that, governments like the Basque Country will let the less traveled lines die to drive the high-speed train. Final result: more car and less train.

Yes, at last we have the political pillar which should have been the framework precisely for establishing the conditions of the technical pillar, because neither interoperability, nor security, nor even the mandate of the Railway Agency can never overcome border and nationalising obstacles and obstacles. The truth is that the Commission's mandate — and it is not you, Mrs Bulc, but rather your predecessor — on the part of the Commission should have been more innovative in business and more Europeanistic and more generous in the social sphere, rather than trying to limit itself to imposing mere liberalisation of rail transport with a restrictive approach to service obligations public. And that is the result: renationalizing and defensive on the part of the Council, and this Parliament is trying to improve it. Hence, governance is moving forward, even if we would have liked to go further. Beyond transparency; but, at least, it is moving forward in giving the possibility of introducing a vision into cross-financing between historical operators and their infrastructure operators. And, too, it advances in public service obligations, albeit with contradictions, returning to national fears, and we are much afraid that they will serve more to secure financing to operators in rich and debt-free countries, exposing more to those of indebted countries. However, we must recognize that progress has been made and that we have therefore gained some time, even if it is a smaller step than we would have wanted. But many things are clarified for the remaining tasks, which are definitively tackling the social debt, which had to be taken into account from the beginning and prepared it from the first package, in order to avoid precisely the renationalizing withdrawal that we have had.

Unfortunately, after the first time in Parliament, but after, above all, that all the Member States have come to committee in the Council, all getting alterations to the original text, until completely distorting it, we can say that the agreement reached with Parliament is not a compromise, it is a compromise.

SNCF now employs 10,000 people in its leading holding company, which is supposed to be a light administrative governance structure for two independent structures, and Renfe announced two days ago that it would reunite its infrastructure manager with its transport operator.

It clearly shows the importance you attach to the railway sector. Allow me now to reply to some of your comments and hopefully provide some clarification on what this package delivers.  First, let me clarify some of the comments that were made by Mr Liberadzki and some other Members of Parliament. On PSO, the text clarifies that all existing binding provisions at EU and Member State level remain applicable after market opening, as does their scope of application. The provisions on staff transfer of the Directive on transfer of enterprises apply to the situation of a change of freight public service contracts if the conditions of the Directive are complied with. This would essentially have to be a transfer of assets and rolling stock to the new public service operator. It is also stated that Member States can go beyond the level of staff protection, defined at EU level by Directive 2001/23/EC, for instance by requiring a transfer of staff and social rights even if Directive 2001/23/EC would not apply. Moreover, Member States are encouraged to assess the need for additional social safeguards in the case of market opening – of course in a reasonable manner. Experience shows that they do take action with mandatory measures. The new PSO Regulation also spells out more clearly the transparency requirements on social rights and obligations, where a change of public service operator contributed to better staff protection. In no way does the Fourth Railway Package lead to less social rights and protection for workers. On the contrary.  The original Commission proposals were even more ambitious, that is for sure, than what you have on your table today. I know that some of you, including all my Liberal colleagues, would have liked to go further in reforming the regulatory framework for rail, but there were also many who were not ready to take bolder steps immediately. In the negotiations, we took into account the diversity of railway systems and structures across the EU, as well as the calls for flexibility and gradual change for the benefit of a single market. The text ready for the vote is what I believe EU stakeholders can absorb and implement at this stage. However, I am also confident that we very largely shared the same ambition for the future of rail and I am convinced that when the package is implemented, it will bring the railway sector into a brighter 21st century.  Let me now make a few other comments. Rail will only be able to contribute decisively to the decarbonisation of transport – and I wish Ms Deli were still here – if it becomes more attractive, also from a service—offering point of view. This requires new investments, more efficiency and more innovation, and this is what the Fourth Railway Package is about. Other transport modes don’t sleep. They are picking up on decarbonisation and I believe in the long run, the differences will be in the amount of investments and in the amount of attractive services offered, so I hope railway will pick up on that and use this advantage, which it still has. Let me also be very clear. The package does not address the issue of railway ownership. This is a very important message. There is absolutely no obligation to privatise railway operators. What we are establishing is an equal level playing field and competitive market conditions for the benefit of our citizens and businesses. This is what the fourth railway package is about.  In the same manner, national and local authorities will still have the possibility to determine what are the needs for public service. With this package we ensure that the public services are improved and that value for taxpayers’ money is increased.  This is why I would really like to encourage you to adopt the three texts by a very large majority being approved in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and I am really looking forward to your support and positive vote and to really together make this important step forward to finally give the railways a push to be back as a full player in the single transport area arena.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 68, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Merja KYLLÖNEN", "mepid": "124736", "text": " rapporteur. — Mr President, I would like to thank my rapporteur colleagues and the shadow rapporteur colleagues, the committee's secretariat and the Commission and the Council's negotiating parties for their very relevant cooperation.

Over the past 150 years, Europe has to thank the railways for much. The sector has been in support of European industrialisation and egalitisation, according to some estimates even the generalisation of literacy, and has served as a real integrator of regions and countries, reducing the mental, physical and cultural distance between countries and between them. With good reason, you can say that rail transport in Europe is undervalued today. We therefore hope that, with this package, we will bring forward a movement that will bring a long-acting and stable regulatory framework to the European rail sector, on which it is possible to develop the sector on genuine customer terms and create a real European rail renaissance.

First of all, the remarks made by my Liberal colleagues, Mrs Meissner and Mr Riquet. I myself would have liked a little more ambition in the fourth railway package, and the Commissioner said that the Commission's proposals were more ambitious. I also believe that the European Parliament's first reading showed that same ambition. Then we got the trilogues and in those years something has changed. The Member States, which were initially very strong supporters of the opening of the market, scribbled back a little. I do not blame those Member States because the debate on market opening versus services in Europe has changed in recent years. Then you can push on about that, but it's good to implement what we have now and look further. The second point concerns the social component. I fully understand the concerns of colleagues in the S&D Group, but on the other hand, we must also be honest. There are national regulations, there is subsidiarity and there are the guarantees given by the European Commission.

I must say, however, that it is truly a bit unbelievable, I say this with sympathy, that after three years and two months of work and seven months of trilogue, we come to this House to argue that the fourth package incites privatization: this I have to say is a bit unbearable. I am sorry that there are no colleagues who have spoken on this, because, I am also telling the public, no national or European union initials have ever claimed that the fourth package should lead to the privatization. There are comments, for example, on the transfer, as the rapporteur, Mr van de Camp knows very well, but we are not talking about processes that lead to privatising anything. Let's talk about opening the market, liberalizing services and, say it at home, here network and maintenance will remain public. That's the philosophy and outline of this fourth package. We will open the market from 2019, that is why some observations, such as the one made by Mr D'Amato, are, let us say, be out of place, because reciprocity would have been there in a transitional period, but since we decided to open from 2019, until 2019 everyone behaves as they decided to behave. Then as for Mr Bilbao, who graciously and diligently followed the whole debate, we are the question of unbundling — because your criticism, the criticism of the Liberal Democrats is on this aspect — we discussed it, but indeed the economic incompatibility was really great. And then what have we done, we have given powers to national regulators and the novelty aspect of the fourth package compared to the previous one is precisely the power of national regulators, their centrality in the system and that should make you say it's a step forward, it certainly isn't a step back or remain firm, as Mr Riquet knows very well, who has followed all our work with great expertise, willingness and with great experience. I would like to say, President, and I would like to thank everyone who has intervened, really, because we have a great chance, and I apologize for the time taken. We have the possibility that our companies in a European market will give jobs, work, not take off jobs, because we need to make sure that our companies participate in a more market great, because our companies, even the strongest ones, in their domestic and domestic market can't take it anymore.

Never ending stories sometimes end. After 15 years — and the last three and a half years with me as rapporteur — we are now being presented an acceptable result for port regulation. Resistance from ports, terminal operators, pilots, dockers and their unions has paid off. We were able to prevent: the forced liberalisation of port services, the introduction of self-handling of ships, the extension of the concession directive through the back door and a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy. To this end, we have jointly developed a flexible framework for ports, which also takes into account their differences. We have created more financial transparency when it comes to public financial support. And found an unbureaucratic approach that improves the position of port users vis-à-vis port operators and stakeholders, with a supervisory authority that deals with complaints adequately and seriously. We have been able to strengthen workers' rights, incorporated the right to strike and emphasised the importance of education and training. The competitiveness of ports also depends on good jobs and on well-trained dockers. Not everything could be realized according to our ideas. We would have liked to have given aid greater autonomy. However, in addition to the result now before us, the European Council was not prepared to do so. Too bad we could have seize the opportunity. I would like to comment on three points that are important to me in connection with the Port Regulation. Firstly, I enshrined training and training in the regulation because I learned firsthand during my visits to European ports that there are some subcontractors who do not have to apply any training and training rules. It's good that which is also taken into account in our text. That is why we also believe that liberalisation of training is not the right way and would seriously jeopardise safety in the port. Secondly, in the regulation we call on the Commission to clarify when public infrastructure — particularly in access infrastructures — does not meet the state aid situation in the first place. The Commission as a whole seems to have also recognised the importance of access infrastructures, otherwise it would not have included them in the analysis grids, for example. But then, please also in communication, where, according to the Commission itself, it belongs! We therefore call for a revision of the notice on the concept of aid, as it is officially called. If the Commission already refuses the recital to the GBER — that is, the block exemptions. Thirdly, we were able to prevent the extension of the concession directive through the back door in the port regulations. It cannot be that the Commission — not please, Commissioner, but your colleagues — now seems to be trying to run the whole game through the GBER. That is why we are going to tell you today that with the adoption of port regulation, the issue has not been settled for us. Last point: we all have the same goal. Strengthening the competitiveness of ports, and for this we need good working conditions and a stable and coherent legal framework and planning security for both public and private investors.

The Commission welcomes the agreement reached in the trilogue – 15 years is a really long time. Maritime ports are vital for the European economy, for an efficient internal market, and to connect Europe to the world. With their logistic and industrial activities, maritime ports provide employment to three million Europeans. They are also critical for developing short-sea shipping as an alternative to road transport as part of our strategy to decarbonise transport. This is why maritime ports are extremely valuable assets to be preserved and strengthened. That is what we will achieve with the regulation discussed today, and that is why the Commission considers this file a priority under the work programme for 2016. First, the regulation will ensure greater transparency for the use of public funds in ports. Many receive considerable financial support from both national and EU budgets. Transparency will contribute to a genuine level playing field between European ports. It will also help to make public funding more efficient. The Court of Auditors stressed the need to address this issue in a recent report. Second, the regulation creates a common framework for the provision of port services. This framework brings legal stability for the tendering of port services. It will end today’s unclear situation where port policy is not decided by you, the legislators, but rather by judgments of the European Court of Justice on a case-by-case basis. Third, it will ensure better training of port workers in line with the work undertaken by the social partners. Finally, the regulation will contribute to our decarbonisation strategy. We need to green the shipping industry and promote short-sea shipping. This requires investment and the right type of investment in ports, and investments need transparency. Many of you attach great importance to clear and simple state aid rules. The Commission shares this attachment. We have been working a lot on the issue of state aid in ports over the last months. My colleague, Commissioner Vestager, and I are making sure that the views of European ports are adequately taken into account. Replying last week to a parliamentary question from Mr Fleckenstein the Commission clarified the framework for state aid in ports, including the general block exemption regulation. The situation is as follows. A new set of infrastructure analytical grids was published on 2 December 2016. With this document, the Commission explains which infrastructures are considered to be non—economic and which should therefore not fall under the state aid rules. This infrastructure includes defence infrastructure, such as dykes, and access infrastructure to ports, such as a river flowing through the port that can be used by anyone. Last week, the Commission also completed its second public consultation on the General Block Exemption Regulation. Its objective is to identify which public investments in port infrastructure are considered state aid, but which are unproblematic and therefore do not need to be notified. We are now analysing the replies to improve the text further and adopt the regulation in 2017. The result of the analytical grid and a revised General Block Exemption Regulation will be more legal certainty and more clarity. But there will be no change in the decision-making practice of the Commission. With this work we are doing exactly what you have been calling for under recital 45 of the port services regulation. However, for institutional reasons and to recall the better law-making principles agreed between the Commission and the co-legislators, we will record a statement from the Commission regarding this recital. The text is balanced. It is the result of three years of discussion with all the stakeholders. All major organisations representing the European port sector stand behind it; the trade unions, port authorities, port terminal operators and port service providers. It received a strong support in the Transport Committee and was accepted unanimously by Member States. So now it is time to conclude the legislative procedure in first reading.

It is important that we have reached a substantial agreement with the Council through intensive efforts. It should be clarified that this legislation does not impose a specific model of service management, because port authorities remain independent and thus reinforces competition. The regulations provide for the limitation of the number of service providers, the possibility of public service and provisions providing for the control of the avoidance of disproportionate administrative burdens and additional costs for small ports. Also, the new regulation has to be said that it provides fair conditions of competition, specific rules of transparency and legal certainty and a stable legal framework, which does not have disproportionate contradictory interpretations, and thus strengthens investment. You will allow me to make a special mention of my country of Greece, which is a long naval tradition. My country can benefit from this, because this new system of rules, which includes twenty-five ports, strengthens the performance of port services, creates an attractive environment for investment and, above all, contributes to economic growth which is so much needed. my country today.

In my view, this was mainly due to the 'one size fits all' approach that the European Commission has always advocated. But Europe and its ports are very diverse, and we have taken that into account in the proposal we have now before us. Because the proposal that the Commission came up with the third time still largely boils down to that 'one size fits all' approach. However, we have been able to make sufficient adjustments, making this proposal good for Europe, good for the Netherlands and good for ports such as Rotterdam. What have we improved? In the original Commission proposal, ports were to be opened to a whole range of service providers: rowers, dredgers, sheds. That is quite conceived, but it must also be able to work in practice. Some ports, for example, are too small to allow all this. Safety must not be comminded either, so multiple piloting services in one port are not always sensible. As a result of our modifications, there are now all kinds of possibilities for exceptions and, for example, a port like Rotterdam can now go on with a single pilotage service and also has control over who can and cannot work in the port. At the same time, we have ensured that there are not too much administrative burdens. For example, the Commission proposed that the port authority should provide workers in the ports with relevant training and training. Yes, that is a nice idea, but many ports in my country, for example, are not about that at all. So we removed that and a comprehensive set of requirements for independent supervision has been reduced to realistic and reasonable proportions. One last, very important point is that the provisions on financial transparency have improved and have remained upright. Ports must continue to open up their finances, which is crucial for a level playing field. We do not want Member States under the table financially benefitting from their own ports.

First of all, I would like to thank Knut Fleckenstein. I have to say that we have come to an end with the port package — similar to the railway package — a very long history, or can finish it today. With the port package, however, it was different from the railways. We were quite unanimous in Parliament from the outset. First of all, we agreed that we did not need a port package at all, because everything is actually working well with the ports. A few things could be improved, but we all fought back at first. We have now received the package from the Commission. In our opinion, there were sometimes too many regulations in place that just went more in the direction of one size fits all. Peter van Dalen just said it, but that doesn't quite fit. Ports are very diverse, have very different circumstances in terms of natural conditions and also in terms of economic positioning. I guess — we agreed on that too — what works, you shouldn't completely change that. It is, of course, important that some things have already been improved and, in general, the European rules should be laid down differently and better harmonised. That was the case, for example: we now have more transparency in finances — that's good. We have more legal certainty for investors, which is also good. Then the investors come and do something in the ports. We have more clarity in the calls for tenders, which is also very reasonable. We therefore have better conditions for competition. The fact is that Port Package 3 has actually finished, the predecessors did not make it to the vote — so they really could be signed and finished in the trilogue. The ports need planning security and need a few rules of the game that are similarly observed everywhere , and you have now. But it has been made so flexible, Knut Fleckenstein has said that there are indeed basic conditions in which everyone can exist well in their diversity. I think that's a very important thing. In some cases, we Liberals would have wished for even more competition and fewer exceptions. There are some things that have been taken out. One exception, which I like, is that a captain, if he is very experienced, can operate at certain ports without pilots. This is one thing you just need, because those who have been driving certain routes for a long time can do it alone. Not in major ports like Rotterdam, of course, but many other ports give it up. Finally, it has been said that the subject of the Block Exemption Regulation is not quite complete.

We have sought greater clarity over state aid regulations so that public money given to European ports does not distort competition between them. As for the liberalisation of port services, perhaps we should apply the principle of subsidiarity, leaving countries free to choose whether or not they run ports as part of the public infrastructure.  As Greens, we also sought to have environmental criteria when setting charges for port services and were sorry to see this removed. Worse still, the references we had added to the need to ensure strict adherence to EU law to protect the environment were also removed. A glimmer of hope can be found in the support for the use of short—sea shipping and inland waterways and railways for the delivery of goods, reducing the need for long distance road freight and the traffic congestion and unnecessary emissions it causes.

It should be emphasized that there are some important derogations, such as drainage services, and some flexibility, such as in the case of piloting services, but the introduction of greater transparency, regulatory simplification, the opening of markets and internationalisation in an intermodal European framework within the framework of TEN-T can really be a flywheel for recovery and economic growth of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": " (ECR). — (EL) Mr President, port activities contribute directly to employment, to attracting investment and to GDP growth, so it is important to have transparency in the financial relations of public authorities, port authorities and port service providers so that create a level playing field and, of course, attract investment.

I have listened very carefully to what you have said, so allow me now to address a couple of your concerns and comments. First, the regulation does not impose a one-size-fits-all approach. We know that every port in Europe is different. The regulation respects this, including the public or private ownership of ports. It is really important to know that this regulation applies only to the ports of European interest, which were identified as such in the trans-European network by the European Parliament and the Council in 2013. This refers to 329 ports out of 1200 ports in Europe. This is a very important message that needs to be taken on board. The regulation also includes tailor-made provisions to avoid putting unnecessary burdens on the smaller ports in the trans-European network with a more local dimension. Second, on the point of private ports which do not receive public funds, let me stress that they do not have to apply the rules on financial transparency, and this has to be very clear. I would greatly appreciate if you can pass this message on clearly. However, private ports as private undertakings should apply the same rules on the provision of port services, including ensuring adequate training. On the other hand, we see no good reason to allow a private undertaking to potentially abuse its dominant position vis-à-vis others on the mere grounds that it is private. So let me add to this two more comments on social aspects: firstly, the regulation will improve the training of the employees of the port service providers; secondly, it respects the tradition and ongoing social dialogue in each Member State. It allows – but does not impose – the transfer of the rights of workers from one undertaking to the new one in case of change of contracts. The discussion shows that the agreement of the trilogue between Council and the Transport Committee strikes the right balance. As regards state aid the process is ongoing. I can reassure you that the Commission will do as much as it can within its remit to integrate the latest comments made by the Parliament and the interested parties, notably in the final version of the General Block Exemption Regulation. Maritime ports are vital for the competitiveness of the Union and sustainable multi-modal transport. So that is why the EU is providing a substantial part of its Connecting Europe Facility budget to support infrastructure investments in ports belonging to our TEN-T corridors – EUR 760 million since 2014 – or in infrastructure connecting those ports, railways, for example. The Port Services Regulation will ensure that investors are adequately consulted. The momentum is there to create a European framework which provides a level playing field and creates legal stability for investors, port workers and users. So at the end, let me just wrap up. The Port Services Regulation creates a stable framework in which ports will be able to: first, develop; second, attract private investors; third, improve their public spending; fourth, improve the quality of port services; and finally, contribute to more efficient logistic chains and sustainable transport. Commission statement on recital 45 of the Proposal for a Regulation establishing a framework on market access to port services and financial transparency of ports The Commission considers that recital 45 should not have been included for the following reasons. First, the recital does not relate to any of the enacting terms of the regulation and hence does not comply with the principles of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making. In that agreement, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission confirmed that they remain fully committed to the Interinstitutional agreement on common guidelines for the quality of drafting of Community legislation, which provides that the purpose of recitals is to set out concise reasons for the chief provisions of the enacting terms, without reproducing or paraphrasing them, and that recitals should not contain normative provisions or political exhortations. Second, the Commission recalls that the notion of State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU is an objective one, enshrined in the Treaty and not at the disposal of the Union legislator. It can only be applied as such by the Commission or national courts in specific cases, subject to the control of the Union courts. Third, the wording of the recital may create confusion. Having regard to the Treaty notion of State aid, it cannot be claimed that public funding of all access and defence infrastructure accessible to all users on equal and non-discriminatory terms always falls outside the scope of the State aid rules. The Commission's decisional practice shows, for instance, that public funding of certain access infrastructure located within the area of a port may constitute State aid.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Knut FLECKENSTEIN", "mepid": "96840", "text": " rapporteur. — Mr President. I don't want to go into all the things that have been said here. The Commissioner has already explained many things very clearly. Mr. Marias! The privatisation of Greek infrastructure is, in my opinion, a crime against Greece, and you are absolutely right. I know that heads of government of my own party also took part in this unding. Unfortunately, it is not the right regulation to raise this issue, but I agree with you on the matter. If the Port of Hamburg were to be sold, we would send them to psychiatry. Secondly, I understand the criticism of workers' rights, mostly from my own friends. I'd like to have more written in too. But here too, of course, this has not been a regulation in this area, but we have looked together with trade unions in Italy, Croatia, Slovenia and Germany that we at least mention the things and ask those who are responsible to take care of the fact that workers and jobs are also important for Competitiveness. One thing, however, I do not understand what my Polish colleague said earlier: why our ports are now supposed to be worse off in international competition, because there is more transparency for customers. Why our ports should be worse now because there is a complaint body, because there are many more user rights. I just don't believe that.

One might sometimes wonder why, and yet the answers exist. First, because we are at the heart of the issue of sustainable development, that is, at the heart of the famous triangle that should be equilateral, defined in Rio, between environment, economy and social. Deep sea fishing is an economic activity that includes, in addition to the social function of its jobs, also a social function of food, and which, of course, has a strong environmental impact. But beyond that, there is a great concern among our fellow citizens about what we will do with our oceans. Since 2012, when the proposal to ban deep-sea fishing came from the Barroso Commission, it has been said — at least I was sure — that sustainable development, which is often only a slogan, could be brought to life the certainty that a compromise was possible — not necessarily a compromise between political groups, that is always possible, or almost possible — but a compromise on the major issues, namely, the vulnerable seabed to protect, the species to protect, but also economic activity and its jobs and the food function. It must be said that there has been a lot of noise, a lot of fury, torrents of insult, death threats I have been subjected to, incredible pressures, but, yet, we have worked in the European Parliament and in the Council, and we have reached an agreement that — I believe so — meets our priorities and all these objectives. What are the results? First of all, the maintenance of activity. It's not nothing, it was still 760 ships. Secondly, the freeze of the footprint, that is, the definition of an area where we can continue to fish in the deep sea, but which is limited to that which was in force between 2009 and 2011. A bathymetric limit that will prohibit fishing below 800 metres deep. Strengthened control and penalties for this specific fishery. A very exceptional scientific vigilance in fishing activity, with 20 percent of this activity which will be covered by scientific observers. Numerous impact studies and catch records, including non-target species. True, we did not choose ease. It would probably have been much simpler to do what the Barroso Commission had proposed, namely to ban everything, or even simpler, just as simple at any rate, to allow everything. From a legal point of view, this would have been quite easy. This is what explains the difficulty and technicality of this regulation, is that precisely we wanted to try to bring all these requirements and all these issues together. This also explains why the Council took two years to agree, which was crossed by numerous contradictions. This also explains why we used two Council Presidencies and, in this regard, I would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency, which initiated this work, and the Dutch Presidency, which concluded it, who accompanied us for nine months — during a gestation — and five trilogues. But, of course, it is primarily my colleagues and their teams and the teams of Parliament that I would like to thank tonight. We worked at a high level of technicality, all together. We worked nine months, more than ten meetings of shadow rapporteurs, we have been a bloc vis-à-vis the Council, even though our positions were not always distant. In conclusion, I would like to tell you that the reason I am happy is that there are only two losers. There will be only two losers in the vote, I hope: those who wanted to ban everything and those who wanted to authorize everything so that the profit be the only rule. Those who won are those who refuse to allow the three angles of the sustainable development triangle defined in Rio to sink into the Bermuda triangle and believe that human intelligence can triumph.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 108, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and my colleague, Karmenu Vella, I would like to thank Parliament for its role in reaching the successful and balanced conclusion of the deep—sea access file. The Commission fully endorses the compromise found between the co—legislators. Deep—sea fisheries account for only one percent of landings from the North—East Atlantic, but I know that the economy of a number of fishing communities depends to a certain extent on these fisheries. The compromise therefore reflects both the need to protect the marine environment and the interest of the fishing industry in continuing deep—sea fishing. The agreed measures, such as fishing within the footprint and the 800m depth limit for bottom trawls, the observer scheme and the control measures will make deep—sea fishing more sustainable and more environment friendly.  Deep—sea fisheries have only been regulated since 2003. Before this, the fisheries were largely unregulated and partly showed typical symptoms of the ‘race to fish’ problem, resulting in the depletion of stocks. Ensuring sustainable fishing is increasingly important for society at large, but it is fundamental for the fishermen that depend on these fisheries. We all have an interest in ensuring sustainable fisheries, and with the deep—sea regulation we have taken an important step to ensure a sustainable framework for deep—sea habitats and fisheries. In this context, I would like to give you an example of the roundnose grenadier in the Celtic Sea and the English Channel. This is the only stock for which we have full scientific advice. As a consequence, in November this year the Commission proposed to the European Council to set the fishing opportunities for this stock at maximum sustainable yield levels. In the New Year, the Commission will start preparing proposals for the next steps of the implementation of the Regulation, establishing the footprint for deep—sea fishing and identifying vulnerable marine ecosystems to be closed for fisheries.

Above all, we welcome a set of ambitious measures that strive to improve the sustainable exploitation of these vulnerable species, as well as the protection of vulnerable deepwater marine ecosystems. However, there are aspects that we cannot be satisfied with. This is the case with the arbitrary prohibition of any bottom trawling activity — including exploratory — below eight hundred meters. A ban that is too drastic, without any basis and, of course, without any solid scientific support, which is a bad precedent. How can we explain to a bona fide operator that he is carrying out perfectly legal and well-regulated fishing that from tomorrow he will not be able to operate in certain fishing areas? Isn't it easy? Well, no. But neither is it explaining to the international community that the European Union imposes rules not sufficiently supported by science.

In the case of deep-sea species, the problem is even more complex. Scientific research has long shown that deep-sea habitats and species are intrinsically more vulnerable because they generally have great longevity, late maturation, low reproduction and few natural enemies. In some deep-sea fisheries, such as those in the North-East Atlantic, the Azores and Madeira archipelagos, restrictions on industrial trawl and gillnet fisheries have been implemented for many years. The habitats and ecosystems of this region are of the same nature as those of the international waters of the North-East Atlantic. This regulation, which we are debating here today, extends some of the rules that were implemented for Macaronesia 11 years ago through European Commission Regulation No 1568 of 2005, but falls far short of it. It was perhaps the possible consensus document and I therefore welcome the rapporteur for her effort. It is already some advance that fisheries below 800 metres and vulnerable marine ecosystems below 400 metres are prevented. By reducing the damage trawling causes to cold coral reefs and deep-sea sponges, we are preserving a millennial legacy and, at the same time, helping to protect the reproduction and sustainability of fishing springs.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thomas, for having succeeded in completing this important legislation that began already last term. With fishing vessels becoming increasing, larger and more efficient, the availability of wild-caught fish has become increasingly worse. We fish up ever smaller fish, fish ever further out to sea and ever deeper down. In order for us to eat fish in the future, the management of our oceans and our shared fisheries resources must radically change and improve. It applies to stopping poaching fishing and overfishing leading to the depletion of our seas. The environments in the deep parts of our oceans are ecologically vulnerable. Because the environment is so deep cold and without light, everything happens very, very slowly. The species that live deep down in the oceans grow slowly, reaching their age of reproduction several decades later. Therefore, they are very vulnerable to overfishing, as it can also take several decades, even centuries, before that fishing stock reaches its original size after suffering overfishing. Therefore, deep-sea fishing can be more likened to mining than fishing of a renewable resource. There is a large wealth of corals and other vulnerable species that must be protected. Most of deep-sea fishing is carried out using highly destructive gear — such as bottom trawling. Therefore, I am very pleased to note that this law does not allow bottom trawling below a depth of 800 meters. It is an important step in protecting the important marine environment.

Indeed, the high vulnerability of these particular stocks leads to a long, if not impossible, recovery. Bottom trawls also result in high levels of bycatch. Finally, it is also difficult for scientists to determine with certainty a sustainable level of fishing. It was therefore decided to adjust the regulations again to limit the adverse effects of this fishery.

We have had the heavy task of finding a compromise between, on the one hand, our environmental ambitions for the safeguarding of very slow ripening species, as well as the preservation of vulnerable ecosystems, and, on the other hand, safeguarding regulated targeted fisheries and incidental fishing necessary for some of our European regions. This agreement will enable the collection of data essential to knowledge of the seabed and species that are still too unknown, thanks to the presence of observers on board ships. In addition, fishing vessels are only allowed to fish within the historic fishing footprint. When they encounter vulnerable marine ecosystems between 0 and 400 metres deep, they must now move away from them, at least 5 nautical miles, and report them to national authorities. These areas will then be closed to fishing. I am delighted that incidental fishing is allowed up to 11.5 tonnes per year while being supervised and controlled. We have achieved a balanced agreement with respect for the marine environment that makes it possible to strengthen the sustainability of fisheries, starting with an awareness of the vulnerability of the European and global seabed.

Among the novelties are the ban on trawls below 800 metres and also the limit that moves to 400 meters deep in the most vulnerable marine environments. Fishermen will also have to communicate the number of sponges and corals caught as, at a certain amount, they will be required to move to other fishing grounds. Finally, new transparency rules have been put in place, including the requirement to make public the information collected and beyond: 20% of boats will be required to have an observer on board to allow scientific data to be collected.

Deep-sea ecosystems and species are adversely affected, as most of them are identified as particularly vulnerable to the effects of fishing. Deep-sea species grow slowly, live for many years, have a low fertility index and reproduce relatively slowly during their life cycle. The practice of fishing with bottom trawls used to catch these species especially in the north-east Atlantic is now characterised by the scientific community as particularly harmful to these species. The European Union must therefore reduce as much as possible the environmental impact of fishing while ensuring sustainable exploitation of deep-sea waters.

Exploratory fishing is possible within strict conditions. Mr Serrão Santos, the specificities of the outermost regions were taken into account. For these regions the threshold to define a target is much higher than in mainland Europe. Of course I understand that some Members would have liked to be more ambitious, for example concerning more observers on board. At the same time, I also understand that some Members find that this is an extensive framework for a limited fishery, however socio-economically important it may be.

Whilst Brexit campaigners have highlighted that leaving the EU will bring fisheries powers back to the UK, nothing has been said as to where those powers will lie. It is essential in my view that powers over Scotland’s fishing resources be held by the Scottish Parliament. Fishing contributes proportionately far more to the Scottish economy than it does to the UK as a whole – and for that reason the Scottish Parliament is more responsive to the industry’s needs than Westminster. The Scottish Parliament will never allow our fishing industry to be used as a bargaining chip in wider negotiations.

The two major problems of last year were the crisis of managing migration and the unprecedented spread of terrorism. In managing migration, we have highlighted the responsibility of the Member States, but also the fact that migrants have not only rights but also obligations. In the prevention of terrorist acts, the emphasis is on the establishment of a Security Union. We also do not forget the rights of victims and their relatives. Let me say a few important social problems to be resolved, which appear in the report. We are focusing on the rights of the child, the most pressing is still high child poverty and the high number of missing children. In addition, it is important to point out the unjustified parting of children from parents. This can only be done as a last resort, and states must give parents more chances to improve and improve the situation of children. We are also vigorously addressing the rights of people with disabilities, as they are still suffering from discrimination in the EU. We are discussing in a constructive way the rights of minorities who are enriching European diversity. Do we realise that their ignored rights are merely insignificant concessions to the majority nations, but their denial can become a dangerous tool for political incitement and the excitation of nationalism in the hands of our external and internal enemies? A common minimum standard would greatly help to develop rights and enforce them where this is neglected for political consideration or avoided as an uncomfortable issue. In addition, we have dealt in detail with women's rights because we need to create social conditions for women so that self-realization and career building can be brought into line with the unique with their mission. In addition, we have not forgotten gender equality, as social inclusion also leads to profound frustration of many of our fellow human beings. A separate chapter describes the fight against discrimination and the rights of the Roma. It is also increasingly important that new technologies do not jeopardise our rights. In addition to the digital security of children and the protection of personal data, harassment or the right to forget about drones is very timely. In this report, we ask Member States to encourage human and fundamental rights education, e-governance and the promotion and simplification of participative democracy. Nor have we avoided the rule of law, as this is the only guarantee of the enforcement of all these powers. You respect me, Commissioner. It is very positive that the European Union, as a legal person, is acceding to an increasing number of international conventions, except for civil rights conventions. Thus, our accession to the Istanbul Convention can also be an example for hesitant Member States. I therefore propose that we act in a similar spirit in the case of international conventions containing the protection of the rights of children and minorities. The European Union must be at the forefront not only in economic and environmental policies, but also in terms of civil and fundamental rights, pointing a direction for the Member States.

Almost daily, we see challenges to our values and our way of life on things that we hold dear, that are fundamental, that enable us to live freely and in harmony with our fellow human beings. The way some people, some politicians included, talk about the terrorist threat, the refugee crisis and the economic situation, all tends to feed these worrying developments. Such discourse polarises societies and fuels division, hatred and intolerance. It also nourishes fake news, a reality seen through the spectacles of emotions and not facts. This only leads to a constant erosion of the values and principles that are at the foundation of the democratic societies and the European Union.  Allow me to congratulate the rapporteur on wide support for this resolution and to comment on some key aspects. Let me start with accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. As you know, the Commission remains fully committed to EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission, in its capacity as EU negotiator, is currently consulting with the relevant Council working party on solutions for addressing the various objections raised by the Court. This work is making good progress. On the rule of law, the Commission fully agrees that our common values as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union must be respected and enforced. As First Vice-President Timmermans underlined at the plenary session in October, the key issue is to identify the best means to achieve this objective. In that respect, the Commission is examining the European Parliament’s resolution on a Union pact on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights very carefully, in line with Article 225 of the Treaty and will give this resolution the serious response it deserves.  On mainstreaming the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, systematic fundamental rights checks during the legislative process are carried out to ensure compliance of draft EU legislation with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Commission’s Better Regulation Agenda includes a fundamental rights checklist that the Commission is to use when conducting assessments. The Commission also trains specific departments to ensure application of a fundamental rights-based approach to policy and law-making. In accordance with the interinstitutional agreement, the Commission also committed to systematically introducing a summary of its fundamental rights assessment in explanatory memoranda. Furthermore, when mainstreaming the rights in the Charter in relation to disabled persons, the obligations enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should be observed.  Now let me say a few words on the topic of migration and refugees. Full respect of the Charter and the safeguarding of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms have also been a stated priority for the Commission in the design of EU policies and measures in the areas of migration, asylum and integration. In particular, the further harmonisation of the Common European Asylum system will contribute to swifter access to international protection for those in need of it, safeguarding protection against refoulement and the right to an effective remedy. It will reinforce the guarantees for vulnerable asylum applicants such as unaccompanied minors and women, in terms of their reception conditions and procedural rights. At the same time, it will counter the misuse and abuse of the fundamental right to asylum, including by reducing secondary movements. In parallel to reforming the Common European Asylum System to adapt it to changing circumstances and better ensure the principle of solidarity between Member States, the Commission is closely monitoring the transposition and implementation of existing legislation by Member States.  The Action Plan on the integration of third country nationals recalls the importance of fundamental values for a successful two-way integration process. Understanding and subscribing to the fundamental values on which the European Union is built is an essential element of living and participating in the host society. At the same time, these rights also protect the third country national and foster his or her inclusion into our society.  The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights is currently working on monitoring the social inclusion and participation of migrants and their descendants in society from a fundamental rights perspective. It will publish in 2017 the results of the second wave of the largest EU-wide survey on experiences of discrimination, hate crime, victimisation and societal participation of migrants and minorities.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stipulates the obligation of states parties to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities. It requires protecting their integrity and ensuring that they are free from exploitation, violence and abuse. The European Commission implements the Convention through the European Disability Strategy for the years 2010-2020 and will soon adopt a progress report. The report also takes into account the UN Committee’s concluding observations for the EU.  Trafficking in human beings is prohibited in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and constitutes a serious form of organised crime. As required by the 2011 Directive in this field, on 2 December, the Commission published two reports, one assessing the transposition of the Directive by Member States, and one assessing the impact of existing national law establishing as a criminal offence the use of services which are the objects of exploitation of trafficking in human beings. The recommendations in your report are very timely since the Commission is working now on the post-2016 policy framework and therefore will assess them carefully.  On freedom and security, as regards surveillance measures by the state it needs to be kept in mind that such activities by police and intelligence agencies of Member States may be based on national legislation pertaining to the protection of national security, an area within the sole competence of the Member States. Where measures of surveillance are applied by the Member States in the context of implementing EU law these States are, however, bound by the Charter. On the European arrest warrant, it should be noted that it is operating correctly and successfully in general. Every year it helps in bringing thousands of suspects and convicts of dangerous offences to justice.  Let me inform you shortly about what the Commission does against radicalisation, discrimination, xenophobia, hate speech and hate crime. Following the approach elaborated in the Commission communication on radicalisation, the Commission, together with the Radicalisation Awareness Network, supports Member States’ efforts in countering radicalisation, in full compliance with fundamental rights, promoting social inclusion and avoiding stigmatisation of any group.  The Network Centre of Excellence pools relevant expertise. It identifies best practices and issues policy recommendations and practical guidance that provide Member States and stakeholders with the skills and tools to implement more effective preventive measures at national, regional and also local level. The Commission’s contribution is focused on the internet, research, inclusive education, common values, rehabilitation and reintegration, and prisons, where it can provide a real added value, mainly by enabling first line practitioners to exchange practices and develop counter-narratives. The prevention of and fight against racism, xenophobia and all other forms of intolerance are a clear priority for the Commission. The Commission therefore assists Member State authorities to improve their responses to hate speech and hate crime. An important area of focus is countering illegal hate speech on the internet. The Commission agreed with Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube in May 2016 a code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, including clear commitments by the companies to review and, if necessary, take down illegal hate speech more speedily and efficiently. We have just finalised a first monitoring of the code of conduct, which I discussed last week with IT providers and Ministers of Justice. The monitoring showed progress, but also confirmed the need to continue improving the timing of the takedowns of illegal hate speech and also transparency towards the notifying persons. Also geographic coverage in the EU is not yet balanced. I got strong support from Justice Ministers at the Council last week to continue on this path and to come back with a further assessment in spring 2017. The fight against discrimination remains a high priority for the Commission, notably through awareness-raising activities and the monitoring of the various directives in place in this area. Let me say a few words about women’s rights and children and Roma rights and citizenship - just to reassure you that I plan to conclude soon. On women’s rights the Commission is committed to priorities of its strategic engagement for gender equality for the years 2016 to 2019, which includes actions in response to challenges highlighted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Substantial progress in implementation of the strategic engagement can already be reported.  The Commission has also made many efforts towards increasing female labour market participation and the equal economic independence of women and men. The Commission monitored and assessed the progress of Member States in achieving equality between women and men, and provided input to the June 2016 country-specific recommendations on female labour market participation addressed to 10 Member States.  The Commission will continue to promote child-friendly justice and the Council of Europe guidelines on child-friendly justice, including through its Rights of the Child funding. Detention conditions are so far, however, primarily a responsibility of Member States, which agreed to respect the existing Council of Europe standards on the matter, such as the European Prison Rules adopted in 2006. Children growing up in poverty or social exclusion are less likely than their better-off peers to do well in school, enjoy good health and realise their full potential later in life. The efforts to implement the recommendations should be stepped up in particular for children with special needs, children in street situations, children in alternative care and so on. In the context of the refugee crisis, unaccompanied minors face particular integration challenges. Tailored education and training programmes, together with substantial long-term commitment from local hosting and integration systems, are needed to overcome the extremely vulnerable situation of these children.  Under EU law, all asylum-seeking children should have access to education within three months of filing for asylum. The EU Action Plan on the integration of third country nationals refers to the importance of early childhood education and care for the integration of migrant children. Having an inclusive setting so that children with disabilities have equal access to training, care and facilities, remains also a challenge. The recent Forum of the Child identified concrete actions such as the situation in the reception facilities, effective guardianship, which we will pursue further and I will discuss this with Ministers at the informal Justice Ministers meeting at the end of January in Malta. The Commission has no plans to present a specific European strategy on the rights of the child, since we believe that rather than new announcements, it is more useful to continue to focus on mainstreaming these issues right across all our policy work. On Roma rights, the Commission in its 2016 report on the implementation of the EU framework and the Council recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States identified a number of most burning challenges. To address them and bring positive changes in the lives of Roma, the Commission called on Member States to address urgently the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation, eliminate segregation in education and housing and so on. The Commission is strongly committed to support Member States, ensure the necessary commitment to Roma inclusion at the European level, and use all available means to promote dialogue and cooperation. Let me conclude with several words on citizenship. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has become a powerful safeguard, as demonstrated by its prominence in the rulings of the Court of Justice, as well as national courts. That being said, general awareness of the Charter can still be improved among national judges, as well as citizens in general. To this effect, the Commission is funding several projects accessible through the e-Justice Portal, enabling individuals to know who to turn to in case of breach of a fundamental right. In particular, in October 2016 the e-Justice Portal integrated the Clarity online tool developed by the Fundamental Rights Agency, which helps individuals to identify the competent national non-judicial bodies with a human rights remit. The scope of the tool will be further extended in the upcoming months.  We are now more than ever called upon to defend fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law with strong determination. The draft resolution of the European Parliament is an important contribution.

The European Union must be able to ensure both safety and respect for fundamental rights together. I think she is well equipped to do that and has no reason to step away from that goal.

As you know, the annual report aims to examine the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union. The European Union faces many challenges today, and these challenges can only be tackled persistently and morally by maintaining and protecting the EU's common values, such as democracy, fundamental rights, the rule of law. Therefore, these values must be protected in themselves and also in relation to other initiatives of the Member States and the European Union. In 2015, a number of Member States had problems with human rights and its various areas. Hate crimes and hate speech have taken terrifying proportions, the latter here in the European Parliament. In several Member States, the right of assembly, the free functioning of NGOs, the freedom of the media, continuous institutional discrimination, xenophobia, targeting primarily minorities, the Roma minority or the LGBTI people, or even refugees. Exclusion and vile incitement of hatred against refugees is particularly repulsive. The refugee rhetoric of the far right has flogged xenophobia and anti-Islamism in many European countries. Homophobia, exclusion and discrimination against gays have intensified in several European countries. The situation of Roma communities in Europe, who are still treated as second-rate citizens in many countries is extremely worrying. A number of European countries have still not ratified the Istanbul Convention, which could be one of the most important means of combating violence against women and abuse in relationships.

We have thus created a common foundation for respect for fundamental rights in Europe. Recent developments in some Member States should remind us that we can never take fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law for granted — especially not in the times we live. We live in troubled times, times of increasing intolerance and disrespect for our fellow citizens and those who are often looking for protection and security in Europe, times of geopolitical emergencies, political populism, including increased violence and moral protection. Uncertainty. If we are not paying attention now and really pay attention, then it may be that the rule of law in Europe is seriously threatened.

Since 2007 the social and economic crisis has been devastating. With 60 million people forcibly displaced worldwide, the migration situation is set to remain at the top of the EU agenda.

Those people who are put away as racists, as xenophobes or Islamophobes and the politicians who are working for them are accused of - and I quote from today's report - 'hate propaganda and violent political views' when it is precisely the European Union who, through its terrible open borders policy, has brought hatred and violence into Europe.

I agree with him that 2015 was particularly difficult for fundamental rights in the Union. Despite some developments, structural problems remain, led by the famous Copenhagen dilemma. Indeed, the Union cannot allow any of its Member States to disregard the fundamental criteria for its accession. While it is true that each new government can legitimately change its policies, it is also clear that new majorities cannot change the nature of the state by calling into question such fundamental values as the rule of law. For this reason, too, this Parliament recently approved the need for us to establish a mechanism to constantly assess compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. But 2015 also saw violent attacks on other fundamental rights, such as security and freedom of expression. We have been plagued by terrorist attacks, which must make us reflect on the promotion of the universal values that unite us. In particular, let me stress the phenomenon of radicalisation, the effects of which can be overwhelming and prolonged over time. Not least, we have been confronted with a large number of people on our borders — here too is our matrix: the right to asylum and the right to life.

The first is that of social inclusion and the struggle for the integration of migrants and refugees, which is a dynamic and multidimensional process, but which requires the Member States that deny solidarity and seek to build walls for those fleeing war and violence. Second, the challenge of equality, particularly for women; the rights to sexual and reproductive health, which also include the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy, some of whose denials could entail serious violations of human rights. And the third point is the fight against all forms of discrimination: against the LGBTI collective; against the Roma, against the Roma population, threatened by attitude against the Roma; against the Muslim population, threatened by Islamophobia. And, as chairman of the Intergroup against Anti-Semitism, I would like to point out the importance of paragraphs 53 and 54 of the resolution, the rise of hate speech. Attention, Commission!

This Parliament, particularly in the unique cooperation of the Committee on Culture and Industry, did something last year that many people wrongly no longer trusted us. We listened in Europe, we spread our arms, we have spread our arms with this wondrous amalgam from famous publishers such as Gallimard, Penguin Books, the Suhrkamp publishing company, we have collaborated with designers, dancers, writers, musicians, the independent music producers of Impala, who usually tell us for weird players with a weird Language, we have worked individually with authors in Parliament such as Nina George, the Englishman Nick Yapp with journalists, newspaper publishers, top researchers in the industry who are researching new materials and textiles, we have worked with the German Fashion Council, high-end industrial icons such as Hermès or LVHM, but also representatives Hundreds of thousands of small companies and craft businesses in Italy, Spain and many other European countries have spoken that create training, create jobs and not only retain Europe's cultural and craft heritage, but also operate globally successfully worldwide. The answers and the results of the report are clear. The three million enterprises in the creative industry provide more than 12 million full-time jobs in Europe. This means that no less than 7.5% of EU employees are employed in this sector. Turnover is more than EUR 1 500 billion, while the added value is approximately EUR 500 billion. It is a fact that this sector is larger than car production or chemical production in Europe. In addition, the cultural and creative industries have an impact on other industries such as tourism, retail and digital technology through their so-called spillover effects. This sector is making an important contribution to this sector for Europe's reindustrialisation and competitiveness. Nevertheless, there has not yet been a single definition of the market at European level, let alone a single policy for this sector. This report is intended to change this. We need a comprehensive economic and industrial policy strategy at EU level that takes into account all the specific characteristics of the cultural and creative industries and establishes a balanced regulatory framework that addresses the challenges of digitisation or the revision of copyright legislation in new growth and new job opportunities. Particularly with regard to copyright, the report takes a clear position. Modernising copyright for the digital age is probably the most important reform we can imagine to make life more lucrative for artists, creators and designers in the cultural and creative sector. The value of cultural and creative work has been largely diverted by users, rightsholders, artists and producers to the benefit of platform operators. This has to change. The value gap has created an inefficient and unfair market and threatens to seize the long-term opportunities of Europe's cultural and creative industries. The world's YouTube, Google, and ebays need to stop hiding behind the save harbour determination of the e-commerce policy. The sector is much more than copyright, but copyright is one of the crucial battles we have to fight for these people. The direction is clear: we need to make the creative industry a political priority in all policy areas. We need to improve access to finance, we need to include the cultural and creative industries better than before in the EU's funding and funding programmes. With our report we have the blueprint and a vision for the future of this sector designed. A vision that helps to boost growth and unlock the innovative potential of the sector. President Juncker has not wrongly described the creative people, the creative industries, the artists, the creative people of Europe, as the crown jewels of Europe. We call on the Commission to take the crucial steps to promote this most important European sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Luigi MORGANO", "mepid": "124788", "text": " rapporteur. — Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all thank Mr Ehler for his excellent cooperation, thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and thanks to the members of the two committees. The report which is tabled in Parliament's vote is not just an INI, but it is the proposal for a work programme for an industrial sector which must become strategic. Not surprisingly, it really aroused expectations and keen interest. We have come to a turning point. The age of silo policies is over: culture, industry and creativity can and should be the pillars on which to plan a new industrial policy for the cultural and creative industries that are consistent and long term, as they create a bridge between art, culture, creativity, quality production and economic and social development. And not only that: operating locally they promote the development of other sectors in the territory such as tourism, retail, services and digital technologies. The data is known, Mr Ehler has just reminded them, but I would like to add that they occupy boys and young people between 15 and 29 more than all other sectors, that these realities have resisted better to the economic crisis and, of course, they also have the element of being 95% made up of small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises. The numbers are important and studies confirm this, but if you want an empirical confirmation, it is enough to look around: culture, art, creativity and beauty are the face of Europe in the world, their specificity arises from the roots of Europe, uniqueness of European culture and arts, three thousand years of history and shared cultural heritage. Given that they will be even more crucial in the twenty-first century, it should be emphasized that they are characterized by their intrinsic dual value: on the one hand they play an essential role in preserving diversity European cultural and linguistics and to strengthen the sense of belonging to the common European identity are the vehicles through which contribute to transmitting knowledge and values and, at the same time, safeguarding the material and intangible heritage for present and future generations . Furthermore, they represent a concrete instrument, on the other hand, for social cohesion thanks to the important contribution they make to the economy of the European Union in terms of employment, investment, growth, innovation, competitiveness on the world stage. If we want to give a positive response to the dramatic plague of unemployment, especially youth, development, promotion, financing and protection of these industries, they must really enter into reality among the strategic objectives of the Union, starting with education and training. They must be strengthened in the school programmes and curricula of study disciplines such as art, music, theatre, cinema, knowledge of cultural heritage, the practices of artistic expression, the development of School-work paths, increased mobility for intra-EU students, centres of excellence. We also need policies that, ensuring the safeguarding and promotion of traditional European know-how and artistic crafts, strengthen the vocational training of highly skilled labour through campaigns to raise awareness about professional and employment opportunities in this industry and the need to have a meeting between demand and supply of work. Of course, it is not possible to imagine that this will happen without adequate funding: synergies between European programmes and funding should be developed immediately, such as the full use of 'Creative Europe' guarantee mechanism, also in combination with the European Fund for Strategic Investments. For the future, the cultural and creative industries should be considered as a horizontal strategic priority in the new financial framework and in the architecture of new programmes after 2020. Strengthening public support for European or national industries must not disdain forms such as crowdfunding or public-private partnership, but the biggest challenge remains access to credit. Most of these industries are small and medium-sized industries and microenterprises, their wealth lies in their creations: here the so-called “bancability” of intellectual property rights is grafted, i.e. the possibility of using them as collateral against investment loans, which must be ensured both through protocols for assessing the real value of these rights and through a more thorough knowledge of the sector by the banking system, to date insufficient.

In particular I want to thank Mr Ehler and Mr Morgano, the shadow rapporteurs, and Ms Comodini Cachia, the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for their work and for their cross-committee cooperation. At the very beginning I fully share your views on the importance of the CCIs. They are one of the most dynamic branches of our economy. They are sources of growth, sources of jobs, and as many of you said before, key contributors also to social cohesion. I think, as you do, that the EU needs a coherent policy to support these industries, and we are currently looking into how to give a new impulse to our work on the challenges identified by the 2012 Communication on CCIs.  Let me say at this time just a few words on the four challenges identified, because many of you referred to this, and of course they still need to be addressed.  First, better access to finance. For me this is a key issue not only for CCIs. They cannot grow if, at the same time, they do not have access to finance; so of course we have EFSI and we need to really make a lot of effort to focus our CCI efforts on these programmes. There are also many opportunities with our different EU programmes, including the Structural Funds, Creative Europe, Erasmus+, COSME, Horizon 2020 but, unfortunately, and I am aware of this this, this funding remains fragmented. Creative Europe offers a mix of financial support. In the framework we launched in June last year, the cultural creative sector’s Guarantee Facility Fund; it provides guarantees and counter-guarantees and I have to say that it is expected to create up to EUR 1 billion worth of bank loans over the next six years. We see a very significant interest of banks and many other financial institutions in this new instrument; the first agreements will be signed in the coming days. In June also we launched, and I think it is worth mentioning here, a smart specialisation platform for industrial modernisation to support interregional cooperation between the regional authorities and the industry, and especially for CCIs this is an opportunity for those regions which are interested in those sectors to join forces.  The second challenge is an adequate regulatory environment. I agree that protection of copyright and related rights are at the core of the CCIs’ revenue. I have said it repeatedly: even in the digital age copyright should continue to reward creativity and provide incentives to innovate. The recent copyright reforms aim at making the marketplace for copyright fairer and more transparent. That is why we are also firmly committed to fight against commercial-scale infringements of IPRs. The evolution and review of the IPR Enforcement Directive is in the pipeline and we have established, it has to be said, EU-level dialogues between the rightholders, intermediaries, brands, civil society, consumer groups and other interested parties. We are also in intense dialogue with the audiovisual industry. The third challenge, from my perspective, is better cross-sectoral cooperation. The Commission calls for reinforced cross-sectoral cooperation around CCIs because culture and creativity cannot be seen in isolation from other sectors of the economy and public life, such as regional development, education, industry, tourism, health and environment. Next year we will launch a dedicated call for proposals to co-fund public-private partnerships which should boost innovation in the tourist sector using the potential of cultural and creative industries. Some of you also mentioned this link between tourism and the CCIs. The fourth challenge, and many of you referred to this, is of course skills. The new Skills Agenda adopted in June aims at equipping people with new skills that industry will need in the future, and our main new idea, the blueprint for sectoral cooperation, will support skills development in the fashion industry among others - because we chose six sectors, but the fashion and textile industry is in this framework. We should however also improve creative thinking, for this is one of the top three skills that workers will need in the near future. As from next year a dedicated expert group will look at specific skills, training, knowledge transfer from traditional and emerging heritage professions. On the one hand, we have to make sure that our renowned cultural heritage skills are transmitted to the new generations, but on the other hand, the digital revolution has had a major impact on heritage. New professions are emerging requiring new skills and of course, new accompanying measures. As you know, 2018 will be the European Year of Cultural Heritage. In line with what the report suggests our intention is to use this year, 2018, to give a boost to CCIs.  To conclude, again I very much welcome the joint report. Building on its suggestions, as well as on the actions we have put in place since the 2012 communication, we will reflect on a more coordinated approach to strengthen the competitiveness of CCIs. For this we need a series of clear and comprehensive actions focusing on key challenges and also on synergies with other sectors. I will discuss these actions with my fellow Commissioners. In this framework, it will be important to improve the use of and access to EU funding, maybe also through a dedicated guide and a one-stop-shop website especially created for the CCIs.  Of course we need to work together across policies, between different levels of governance, and, it has to be underlined, with all of the industrial stakeholders. I am looking forward to this cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2016-12-12.json", "name": "Adina-Ioana VĂLEAN", "mepid": "37324", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Mrs Gabriel would like to begin by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for the very good cooperation that has taken place between her and them, which enabled us to submit tomorrow to the vote in our plenary a very positive, very constructive and coherent report on the issue of women's rights in Eastern Partnership countries. The report presented by Mariya Gabriel is part of a genuine logic of ever closer partnership and cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, and on the other hand, the Eastern Partnership countries — Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine on the other. What is the approach and what are the key messages of the Gabriel report? The stabilization of its neighbourhood is one of the main objectives of the European Union's foreign policy. In order to ensure security, peace, stability and prosperity, the European Neighbourhood Policy plays a key role, respecting, of course, the principles of international law and the fundamental values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Given the foundations and objectives of this Eastern Partnership, the issue of women's rights and equality between men and women cannot be dealt with in a secondary manner. Women's rights and gender equality are, on the contrary, a cross-cutting priority of the European Neighbourhood Policy and were identified as a major and promising area of cooperation in the Riga Declaration of May 2015. For the definition of specific goals in the area of gender equality and respect for women's rights, the report proposes a quantified approach to the implications of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Neighbourhood Instrument. Quantified targets could be defined, for example, by country and according to the priorities chosen, based, inter alia, on the gender equality index developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality. Within the framework of specific objectives defined with the Eastern Partnership countries, we could highlight success stories, successes, which allow for deeper changes, so that the constitutional legislative provisions existing in these countries continue to bear fruit and even bear fruit more and more. more numerous. Finally, it was crucial that cooperation on women's rights be addressed at a high political level and considered a political priority. Several thematic topics — if you allow me to do so, Madam President — are firstly, the area of combating violence against women. This is an important section in the Gabriel report. In particular, we encourage Eastern Partnership States to sign and ratify also the Council of Europe Convention on combating violence against women and preventing violence against women — the so-called Istanbul Convention — to put in place real, concrete practical measures aimed at moving forward in the combating violence against women. The report also devotes particular attention to the issue of human trafficking networks. Second dimension is women's economic participation. Entrepreneurship in Eastern Partnership countries often presents itself as a default choice, despite the lack of being able to find ways of caring for and caring for children or dependent persons, also to overcome the pay gaps, which are often extremely discouraging. Support for women entrepreneurs must therefore be strengthened in a positive way through specific instruments: microcredit, training and financial advice. Particular attention should be paid to women's entrepreneurship in rural areas. Third area is the participation of women in political life. Here too, this must be a priority axis. There are still huge margins for progress; 14% of ministers and 16% of parliamentarians are women in the various Eastern Partnership countries. In this regard, it is important to underline the role of parliamentary cooperation, including the EURONEST Assembly, between our Assembly and the parliaments of these countries, with the creation this year of the Women's Forum, which has contributed and will continue to contribute to greater participation of women in political life and in electoral life. Moreover, European political parties, which very often have parties from Eastern Partnership countries among their members, should be encouraged to make the issue of women's rights and the greater participation of women in political decision-making processes a priority. In conclusion, the challenges facing Eastern Partnership countries in terms of women's rights are, in fact, common with those we ourselves face as the European Union and as Member States. It is therefore necessary to have a strategic vision and a clearer, horizontal, cross-cutting commitment that crosses all aspects and policies of the Eastern Partnership, but also defines specific objectives.

I think this is important because it sheds a light on the many challenges that women have to face in the Eastern Partnership, but I also want to thank all of you for this exchange of views.  We are all aware that although women’s situation differs among the countries in the Eastern Partnership and the Eastern Neighbourhood, there are some common problems such as the high level of violence against women, the significant gender pay gaps and the very low representation of women in political and economic life. The Commission is strongly committed to move ahead on gender equality and women’s empowerment together with our partner countries and neighbours. The joint declaration of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga last May clearly mentions gender equality as a key area of cooperation. The European Neighbourhood Policy review which was adopted in November last year puts a focus on gender equality and gives particular attention to enhancing women’s participation in the economy, their access to justice and social services, and to strengthening support for women’s rights. Fighting gender inequality is also acknowledged as vital to prevent radicalisation and terrorism.  The Eastern Partnership Foreign Affairs Ministerial meeting of May 2016 confirmed the commitment to the priorities agreed in Riga and the new approach introduced by the European Neighbourhood Policy Review. In addition, it called for a clear focus on delivering tangible results for citizens. In this framework, work has been ongoing to identify 20 key deliverables by 2020. Gender is a key cross-cutting deliverable to be addressed. The implementation of the commitments taken in the European Neighbourhood policy review, together with the EU Gender Action Plan for 2016-2020, provide the Commission with the framework through which we can ensure that all words are translated into real actions.  Let me just give you a few examples of this. The Commission, during the last five years, provided more than EUR 100 million that financed more than 100 projects and programmes to directly promote gender equality and improve the situation of women and girls within the Neighbourhood. In addition to this, the EU contributed EUR 5 million to the Women in Business programme. The overall objective is to promote and support women’s entrepreneurship, and more broadly women’s participation in business, by facilitating access to finance, as well as non-financial business development services in the Eastern Partnership countries. We have a very good example here in Azerbaijan and in Ukraine.  Let me also say that today’s discussions come at a very important moment for a number of reasons. First, because gender equality is one of the topics being discussed in both the current revision of the association agendas for three DCFTA countries, namely Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and also in the development of the partnership priorities with our key partner countries. Secondly gender features as a key topic of today’s discussion in the Foreign Affairs Council, where ministers will adopt Council conclusions on the Eastern Partnership. And thirdly discussions are still ongoing on the key priorities in the European Neighbourhood Instrument multiannual programming for our next four years for the Eastern Partnership, and gender will be mainstreamed throughout support actions according to the Gender Action Plan 2016-20. The new European Neighbourhood Policy will play its part in helping to create the right conditions for positive development, lead to further strengthening the relations with the countries of the Eastern Partnership, and bring tangible benefit for all citizens, including of course women.

It is therefore very important that gender equality has been guaranteed in the constitutions and laws of all countries of the Eastern Partnership. Nevertheless, the report rightly highlights the fact that women remain victims of social discrimination. It manifests itself in the fact that in 2015 only 17 out of 136 senior ministerial posts were held, while gender pay differentiation is still high and reaches up to 50% despite the fact that on average women have higher education than men. For this very reason, the EU must continue to exchange its best practices through the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly and also, above all, support NGOs representing civil society. Even more so, it is these organisations, together with the governments of the Partnership States, who are jointly responsible for leading information campaigns to eradicate established stereotypes about the role of women in society.

Four, we are therefore going to complete the Europe which takes full responsibility for central issues, which demand it: economy, security, defence, etc. But we also know how to return maximum decision-making capacity, real power, to the internal diversity of nations and peoples.

A subtropical atmospheric river unleashed devastation on large parts of northern England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, the like of which had not been seen before.
