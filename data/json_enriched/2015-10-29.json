In the field of energy today, there is no reason to save on light, that is why. The same applies to transport. But the health consequences are numerous, according to recent research by 9 European universities. Around 20% of Europeans have a change in time, while the other 80% cannot understand that it can cause problems for someone. Health problems go from fatigue, drowsiness and disorientation, to indigestion, migraines and depression, to triggering genetically conditioned diseases such as obesity and diabetes, including heart attacks. For those affected by autism, this change is causing major problems. The direct and indirect cost of health consequences in the EU has been estimated at a whopping EUR 131 billion by this research. This may mean that EU citizens spend almost as much – around €140 billion a year – on the EU as they do on remediation of health damage caused by this single directive. The Commission's response to the public hearing was a press statement saying that the Member States were not complaining and that this Commission would not deal with such a small matter. Thus, the Commission considers the health problems of one fifth of Europeans to be a small thing. If the research of nine universities is right, the Commission also considers the damage to health to be a small matter in the amount of the Union budget. I find such a statement scandalous. Indeed, Member States may not complain, because they do not suffer from depression or diabetes. But people complain. The citizens of the European Union complain to us, to their representatives in the European Parliament. This must be enough for the Commission to begin to deal with the matter in all seriousness. I am therefore pleased to be able to ask the Commission an oral question today and call on it to show that the research of nine universities is wrong, that there are rational reasons for maintaining a change in time, reasons that outweigh the harm to the health of a fifth of the citizens of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 6, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-10-29.json", "name": "Michael CRAMER", "mepid": "28238", "text": "   Author. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to thank the JURI Committee and Chairman Pavel Svoboda for this initiative, which is shared jointly by both committees – the TRAN Committee and the JURI Committee. This, of course, also has an impact on road safety, on the transport sector, on timetables, on the working hours of employees and so on. That is why we held a joint hearing between the two committees on this subject in March this year. The expert opinions were clear: the arguments for the time change are being questioned by science and the negative effects have been clearly demonstrated there. So there is no scientific reason for daylight saving time. That is why I also share the disappointment of my colleague Pavel Svoboda at the Commission's press release, but also at the Commission's refusal to take this issue seriously. The original argument was energy saving. You can imagine that, as a Green, I am naturally in favour of energy saving, which is also the Commission's aim. But what comes out now? Many studies see no effect, and in Indiana – as has already been mentioned – it has been found that there is even a negative effect. Instead of being positive that we save energy, we are wasting energy. And that is why we need to change that. We want to examine impartially whether the current system still makes sense. We have certain problems, particularly in the transport sector. People are tired after the changeover because they sleep an hour less. This is a major threat to safety. The timetables need special rules, trains must be open for one hour at night so that the timetables that are written down are complied with; this is crazy, but reality. The working hours of employees must be adjusted and many processes in transport and logistics are interrupted. In the United States, the cost has now been calculated: EUR 1.7 billion per year costs us, and the effect is zero! Do we have so much money? I can put a thousand arguments to you about where we can make better use of the money, in the interests of the citizens. The initiatives exist in almost every Member State. I have received a great many letters, as have our fellow Members. Hence the questions to the Commission: why is the Commission not taking a serious look at the scientific results, including from the United States? When and how will it re-examine the effects of the time change? Or is it evidence of reducing energy consumption? What are the Commission's estimates of costs and benefits? What are the impact swaying advances in energy efficiency? And does that press release reflect the Commission's view? Is this the way in which it intends to deal with the concerns of citizens and Members of Parliament? I would therefore like to thank the JURI Committee and Pavel Svoboda once again. And to the Commission: look at the facts impartially! We look forward to hearing from you.

There are problems with people – not everyone – and if they want to take people's concerns seriously, then it is not enough to say that it has always been nice. For more than ten years, the Commission has not given a serious and honest answer. Studies have been presented, and some of the answers are truly cabaret-ready. It is outrageous how these health problems are dealt with. On every other issue, on any other health threat, this Parliament is stirring up and making huge uprisings. Only on the subject not. And, by the way, the central question, Commissioner, I really would like to pass it on to the entire Commission. The central question is not whether there are enough reasons to take it back, but whether there is a single reason to annoy people twice a year. You have to explain why we are switching twice a year. We do not have to justify anything! I have never understood why we need to justify restoring normality. The normal state was, it is not changed twice a year – with effort, with trouble. I don't care how much and how little. There is no reason to change. Give me a reason, a proof, why we change twice a year, then I am on your side. Otherwise, I think it is possible to withdraw this directive from circulation. This Commission is taking on deregulation. We want fewer rules. So what's the point? What is the point of changing things twice a year if it makes no sense? If there was any purpose, they would have an argument. By now, the number is clear: there is no argument for switching. But there are problems. And in this respect, Simsalabim, we are simply restoring the normal state. The single market argument is the most stupid of all, because none of us wants anything else to happen in every country. We are all saying: change the internal market for all, and of course. Of course, uniform rules throughout Europe. But, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to take this issue seriously at long last. When I started with the question, everyone just looked and said, someone spins, someone dreams. There are tens of thousands who sign, tens of thousands of people complain. Please take this seriously!

Studies have revealed that people's sleep deteriorates in spring and autumn when the clocks are moved. Senior children and children in particular find it difficult to get their internal clocks right. Studies have also shown that the change of time also affects people's mood and causes severe depressive symptoms. The treatment of depression today causes a huge expense across Europe. Does the Commission really want to increase this burden on the European Member States as well? Not only humans, but also the effects on the health of farmed animals are significant. Although Russia is not on a very high course in this House, it must be said to their credit that they have been able to deregulate daylight saving time in the past, based on the welfare of citizens and animals. If Russia can do this too, will Europe be a backward state? Now it is our turn to stop playing with human and animal health.

Every time I write about this topic on Facebook, I get a thousand likes just like that. This means that the public really thinks this is quite a big deal. I remember this very well because my own child was born on the night that my country, Finland, first moved to summer time in the spring of 1981. So it will not be forgotten. Moving clocks causes serious problems for human health. It confuses the biological clock of both humans and animals, and this in turn causes unnecessary harm, costs and risks in schools, kindergartens, workplaces and transport. The European Union has regulated the transition to daylight saving time diligently. Indeed, the current 2001 directive is already the ninth of its kind. Why should we not think that it is time to adopt the last tenth directive on this subject, which would definitively transfer the turn of the clocks' visas to history. This would benefit not only transport and communications, but also people's internal clocks. Parliament's consultation revealed that this is strongly supported by experts in the human internal clock. As my fellow Member said, if, for the sake of human and animal welfare, Russia has abandoned the movement of clocks, then we can do it too.

The first recorded use of them in the UK was in 1935 when the British Royal Navy used the DH82 Queen Bee for target practice. During the past 15 years we have seen rapid growth in the use of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), more commonly known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. Technology developed primarily for military purposes is now being applied for commercial use, pushing technological and legislative boundaries. In recognition of the rapid development of this market, RPAS are rightly being incorporated into existing aviation programmes such as Sesar and Horizon 2020. In addition, the potential for growth in this industry, from the manufacturer to the end user, is immense for large and small businesses alike. Therefore, it is imperative that we maintain world-class standards for manufacturing. Europe leads the world in drone development, with two and a half thousand drone operators. In the UK alone we have more than 600 RPAS operations providing services from photography to land surveillance. RPASs have become an increasingly popular alternative to manned aircraft for aerial surveillance activities, among other things. They are used to monitor railway lines, power plants and farmers’ crops, as well as at rock concerts and in football stadiums. They are being used increasingly in humanitarian circumstances, in dealing with forest fires and earthquakes, for example, and in search and rescue operations. At the same time, ‘baby drones’ designed for leisure and hobby use have become increasingly popular. All the stakeholders have recognised the potential of this market and we are all keen to stress that any policy framework must enable growth in it in order to compete globally. My role as rapporteur has been to find the right direction and framework to take this industry to the next stage, and I believe that this report, as it now stands, has answered the key questions. Earlier this year I brought together representatives from industry, Member States, civil aviation authorities, air traffic services, the European Safety Agency and the Commission. It was widely recognised by participants that any framework must be proportionate and risk-based to enable the sector to grow while, at the same time, avoiding any unnecessary burdens. In addition, any legislation must reflect global cooperation in order to stimulate R&amp;D. I also had constructive meetings in Washington in March with representatives from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the US Transport Department. This all culminated in a high-level meeting under the Latvian Presidency in Riga, which produced the Riga Declaration. That key message stated that the European aviation community would commit itself to allowing businesses to provide RPAS services everywhere in Europe from 2016. To do this, I believe that we need to establish European and global rules which will address the following areas: air worthiness, certification, commercial and recreational use, drone identity, appropriate pilot training, liability and insurance, operations, protection and privacy, geo-fencing and no-fly zones. The Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) is a committee comprising non-EU and EU Member States and national aviation authorities. It sits under the umbrella of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Its purpose is to develop technical safety and operational requirements for the certification and safe integration of large and small RPAS into airspace and at aerodromes. The Chair of JARUS is a representative from European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). In my view, JARUS is ideally placed to draft global safety regulations for the use of these systems quickly and effectively. We need to ensure that any future EU rules will be compatible with international arrangements through a process of mutual recognition. To conclude, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their very constructive input and cooperation, as well as our colleagues on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and in particular Patrick Cassidy from the ECR Group, who has been an invaluable help to me. I believe that we have acknowledged the opportunities that this nascent market can create for both investment and job creation, whilst at the same time safeguarding public interest. I would therefore ask Parliament for its support in order to send a strong political message that we are ready for this new exciting step forward for the aviation sector.

Unmanned aircraft are able today to perform missions that are not conceivable or economically not feasible with manned aircraft, ranging from safety inspections – as already pointed out – and monitoring activities to precision farming operations or assessment of natural disasters. The range of drone applications for civilian use is developing fast, underlining the significant economic potential of this sector to contribute to growth and jobs in Europe.  Everybody acknowledges the enormous potential of drone technologies, yet citizens are also raising concerns about drone operations: hence the challenge for us to come up with rules that strike the right balance between promoting this promising technology and adequately protecting our citizens.  It is our conviction that only common European rules would provide a solid basis for promoting investment in, and facilitating the development of, drone technologies while duly protecting all our citizens. That is why the Commission greatly welcomes the support for this approach in the Foster report. I would really like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Foster, for her great work and her efforts in bringing together the views of different political groups in her very comprehensive report. The Commission agrees with the report’s call for a clear, harmonised and proportionate EU regulatory framework, removing the current 150 kilogramme threshold separating EU and national competence. We need to go for common rules for all drones, regardless of weight. But please understand me, this does not mean that every drone operation requires heavy-handed regulation. The Commission agrees with the report that we need to evolve towards an operation-centric approach to safety rules that are proportionate to the risk associated with a particular operation. These ideas are already being developed by the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS), where experts from the European Member States play an active role together with experts from the US, China, Japan, Brazil, Canada, and many more. The Commission also supports the idea that safety rules could be supplemented by internal market or international commerce rules, using leaflets, for example, to make each drone user aware of possible risks.  The Commission is aware of the need to let drones operate further away from the ground station, in other words further than the pilot can see. If drones are allowed to operate over a longer distance in one mission, the cost of the operation will decrease drastically, and wider-range operations will encourage innovative businesses. And yes, we should find sufficient R&amp;D funding to finance the missing technologies. While we support the development of drones, public acceptance of drone operations is key, and we therefore agree that adequate enforcement of safety and other existing legislation, for instance on privacy or data protection, is crucial. However, there are a number of other aspects related to drones, such as security, environmental protection and liability, and these also need to be addressed.  Let me conclude: the Commission greatly appreciates this report on drones, which will significantly contribute to steering safety rules in the desired direction and to the Commissionʼs ongoing work to lay down an enabling framework for drones. The topic has been thoroughly addressed in the aviation package, and I hope that we will be able to proceed swiftly in the near future.

At present, there is no global, Nor European or major international competition legislation, whether the United States or China. Several Member States are starting to have legislation and we Europeans are the world leaders in drones, with more than half of the world's companies in this sector. Let me remind you that this market will represent at least 80 billion turnover and 100,000 jobs in 2025. So if we want to remain leaders, we have the opportunity to write the flight rules that will then be imposed at the global level. These rules will dictate the technological standards applicable to drones and the challenge is no more or less to impose on the world our vision: we can take as an example the GSM standard for mobile phones.  It is not all to be the first to have rules, but they must be good, and European rules must give companies maximum freedom of innovation while guaranteeing absolute protection of the population.  To date, two million drones have been sold and no deaths are reported. It is clear that this report provides very clear answers, in particular to the Commission: data protection is essential, privacy must be protected.

This pleases us, but it also shows that we are dealing with the development of technology and that drones will be a permanent and evolving phenomenon. The problem, however, is that advances in technology are not accompanied by adequate legal solutions. The Member States of the European Union regulate the use of drones in very different ways. According to my S&amp;D Group, this is precisely the area in which the institutions of the European Union must actively participate – because it is objectively appropriate for EU regulation. After all, the civilian use of unpiloted aircraft does not restrict the borders of any country. There are two fundamental problems to solve here. The first problem is that pilots have to move safely in air traffic, and the long problem – and it has already been mentioned here today – is to ensure the protection of the privacy sphere. I think that mrs Foster's report very aptly draws attention to these two aspects – in my opinion, it is a very valuable and interesting document.

The safe integration of drones into European airspace must be ensured. That is why European regulation is desperately needed. The faster, the better. Recent accidents involving drones illustrate this all too well. A very important concern is liability. Who should the damage be ified when a drone falls from the sky? In order to ensure liability, we must ensure that there is a clear link with the owner or driver of the drone and that it can be traced at any time when such a drone causes damage. Mandatory registration and the installation of a mandatory identification chip could be a solution. That is also the direction I have indicated in an amendment of mine that has been incorporated into the report. It is therefore clear that European regulation is needed and we really need to look at that. Fortunately, an aviation package with a proposal will be presented at the beginning of December.

The potential for economic growth in this sector is enormous.

In any case, it is my opinion that clear rules are needed for this market in order to enable further investment in technology. People are often sceptical about novelties. Just think of the childhood of aviation – most of them dismissed the men who developed airplanes, as crazy people. Today, I believe that very few of us could imagine a world without the ability of aviation to move rapidly between different continents. A trip to the United States in the past, at least from my home country, Sweden, was in a couple of weeks. The technology is thus evolving and progressing all the time. Many times, as I said, the problem is that we find it difficult to absorb it before we see the practical possibilities of it. The industry can therefore be very large in this market. It is large and can be even bigger, but it also assumes that there are very clear rules of the game in the market, because there is no company that dares to invest a lot of money in a novelty without knowing the rules of the game.

I would just like to clarify a couple of points on privacy. As we said, we work very closely with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and what we need to stress in our Member States is that there are already strong laws in place and we must make sure that our law enforcement is absolutely up to scratch. So that is the starting point. In terms of these little baby drones – one of my colleagues mentioned it – we are not looking at regulating a tiny little thing that a child would play with. The whole point of this report is about that section in the middle, which is commercial use and the slightly bigger ones, which could actually cause damage. This is what this is about. It is also not about the top—end ones, which are already covered by aviation regulation. So this is why we are looking at a case—by—case type class approach. In terms of the protection of facilities – whether it to be nuclear plants, airports, etc. – this is where technology comes in. This is where I mentioned geofencing. We have been talking very often with these technological bods to find ways to see how we can deal with this. My good colleague, Ms Arnautu, is quite right: this is not about military use. This is just about civil use. The points that she has raised are very important. My final point goes to our colleague, Ms Seymour, who very sadly lacks any real understanding of the aviation sector and does not understand that aviation per se already comes under national (UK), European and global rules. That is what the sector does in any event, and drones will be no different. But never mind, I will perhaps explain that to her privately.  On that closing point, I would just like to say that I am very much looking forward to what the Commission will produce. I think that together we can come up with a very good regulation. My final point to the Commissioner would be that I want to make sure that the manufacturers, the end-users and all the bodies that I have mentioned and spoken to are included in this debate and will be included as the legislation rolls on.

It is a major positive to use them in particular for safety checks and infrastructure monitoring, natural disaster assessment, precision-demanding agricultural activities or media production. The most worrying issue, however, is the use of drones by private individuals for commercial purposes and the lack of Community legislation in this area.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is still the world's leading tourist destination. The figure is comforting today, but it is expected that in 2030 we will be surpassed by other continental destinations. This is due to globalisation, the increase in different economic conditions in the population of third countries, but also as a result of digitalisation and the lowering of air transport costs, which make places first distant or unknown destinations that are now accessible. In view of this changed situation, we must be competitive, we must take into account the fact that tourism is Europe's third largest economy, and the European institutions must therefore pay the right and well-deserved attention to it. Moreover, the sector has maintained a good level of arrivals and attendance even in years of economic crisis, with positive results for companies and an increase in the level of employment. Tourism from competence to ambition: and our ambition is to increase our potential, but in a sustainable and responsible way, assessing the difficulties related to climate change and with respect for the environment.  All Member States, without exception, will increasingly have an attractiveness as a destination, because the key to success in the tourism sector is to treasure the territorial peculiarities that reside in culture and cultural heritage, traditions, the environment and biodiversity, food and wine, sport, wellness and so on. Of course, we could discuss at length everything that can be achieved, given that more than 100 types of tourism have been established, but it is clear that in order to have effective and also communicative action we must focus on something as precise and determined as pan-European and transnational tourism products.  Tourist attractions are today a product that must be communicated quickly and widely. For this reason, I call on the Commission to pay particular attention to the issue of digitalisation. More than 95% of travelers plan their trips and itineraries online, with a growing offer of collaborative consumption services. We have a productive fabric made up of small and medium-sized enterprises that must be supported in global challenges: to know and make known, in a digital world that is evolving, from day to day, more and more quickly. The debate held since the beginning of the process in committee has revealed other important aspects, such as the need for strong joint promotion, training for quality tourism, and the need for European funds to be adequate for the growth of the sector. I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism for voting in favour by a large majority on the own-initiative report, thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who have done a good and constructive job. I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Culture, Education and the Internal Market because, through the debate and the opinion expressed, it has been possible to enrich the report with important content. The contribution of the parliamentary groups shows that tourism has no political colour, it is a great opportunity for everyone. For this reason, there must not be a solitary voice, but a choral voice that can give strength and impetus to effective action by the Commission and the Member States.  The hope is that there will be no divisions in today's vote too, so that consensus will allow the Commission to be given the widest possible delegation so that there can be a further quantitative and qualitative increase in tourism in the coming years. Through these concrete actions we will demonstrate together that the European Union is not bureaucracy and austerity, but our chance to succeed for the economic and working future of the younger generation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2015-10-29.json", "name": "Isabella DE MONTE", "mepid": "124803", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Members of Parliament, I would like to thank you and in particular the rapporteur, Ms De Monte, for this excellent report. I fully share your views on the importance of the EU tourism sector. The travel and tourism sector makes a very substantial contribution to European economies. In 2014 its direct, indirect and induced impacts supported 33.5 million jobs. Moreover, in the same period it also contributed more than EUR 1.3 trillion to the economy, making up almost 10% of total European GDP. By 2025 the travel and tourism sector's total economic contribution is expected to grow to 38 million jobs and EUR 2.1 trillion. In addition, travel and tourism is key to the recovery of those countries that have been hit hardest by recession and the euro zone crisis. 20% of employees in the European tourism industry are aged below 25. Tourism is therefore an important entry point to the labour market. Tourism has also significant spill—over benefits for the cultural and creative industries, including fashion and high-end products – agrifoods, transport, construction, shipbuilding or retail. Therefore tourism has a huge potential to generate economic growth and create jobs. But although Europe is still the number one destination, we should not rest on our laurels. We have to address important challenges – competition from emerging destinations is increasing. In 2000 the EU had 51% of the worldʼs tourism market; today we are below 40% and forecasts indicate a further drop to 31% by 2030. To attract new investment and ensure faster growth, we must increase the number of travellers from key markets such as China, India or the US. For this to happen, we need to strengthen our promotional activities. In doing so, we should consider that 99% of the tourist sector is made up of SMEs and 90% of them have fewer than 10 employees. It is important that we improve the business environment, not least by ensuring a well—functioning single market for services. The Commission adopted the new Single Market Strategy just two days ago. We have to fully capitalise on the potential offered by this strategy, ensuring effective enforcement of single market principles and rules, extending also to tourism services. We must continue to work on the issue of over—regulation and cut down red tape where possible. At the same time we must ensure that the principles of the Small Business Act are fully implemented in the tourism sector.  We should also follow market trends and enable the development of new innovative business models and take on board the advantages of the digital revolution. Especially in this case digitalisation will be a key driver of the sector’s competitiveness. We must help tourism-related SMEs to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution. We wish to embrace the opportunities created by the sharing economy, including for the EU tourism industry. At the same time, we must create a level playing field for all actors and make sure that public and consumer interests are properly reflected. To compete with new emerging destinations were must invest in high-quality offerings and improve infrastructure, resource efficiency and skills. To that end it is essential to ensure better access to finance. There is a serious mismatch between the demand for and the supply of skilled labour in the sector. Erasmus+ and the European Social Fund play a key role in the upgrading of skills, including digital skills, as well as in training and workforce mobility. We have helped to define tourism qualifications and developed a skill passport to help match businesses with job-seekers. We are also promoting high-quality cross-border traineeships and the smooth entry into the labour market for young professionals through a digital platform. There is a strong added value in promotion activities carried out jointly with public and private stakeholders. American and Asian tourists want to come to Europe and visit more than one country. We should preserve, and capitalise on, our unique cultural and natural heritage and diversity. We should invest more in joint promotion in close collaboration with Member States, regions and the industry.

Tourism is an extremely important and very sensitive sector of the European economy. At the moment, Europe is the world leader in terms of the number of tourists visiting it, but this position is not given to us once and for all. We must be ready for the challenges of the present and look for ways to constantly increase the tourist attractiveness of our continent. First of all, it is important to break the seasonality of this sector, which will increase employment and diversify the offer aimed at tourists from all over the world. Religious and pilgrimage tourism, among others, play an important role here. It is also important to create tools that will support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises providing tourism services, including in regions which, despite their potential, are not yet popular destinations. This is what the digital age and the emerging model of the sharing economy provide us with.  We should be ready to make effective use of these new phenomena. However, the future of the European tourism sector is also a spectre of threats, including those caused by the uncontrolled influx of illegal immigrants into the European Union.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the new challenges and ideas for promoting tourism in Europe, the report is moving in the context of embellishing the current situation. Europe as the world's leading tourist destination, with a market share of 52%, is an important social and economic activity in the European Union.  But things for the countries of the South, such as Greece, are not so rosy. Greece relies financially heavily on revenue from tourism. But in this summer tourist season a huge economic blow was taken by the Aegean islands. The impact of the particularly increased flows of refugees and migrants is significant on the islands that are the main destinations of these flows, such as Kos, Lesvos, Chios and Samos. In Kos alone, 120,000 cancellations by touroperates and 58,000 by individual customers corresponds to a 400% increase in cancellations. This means a loss of income and jobs, especially among our young people, who in Greece reach 60%. Humanism is good in the European Union, but Europeans cancel their holidays on islands that are being sinked by illegal immigrants, because they are spoiling the peace and quiet they seek. How can we also talk about competitiveness, when the special regime of reduced VAT in the most popular destinations is abolished on the Greek islands and the third most onerous memorandum imposes the absurd VAT of 23%, when in the competitive market of the acceding Turkey it is at 6%? Is this a united Europe also on the issue of tourism development? If we do not change tactics, this Union as it evolves will begin to collapse.

Obviously, the reduced VAT was not valid either freely or selectively. It balanced the increased transport costs and the specific geographical dispersion conditions of the islands.

It has been acknowledged by hotel federations, restaurant associations and others in the hospitality sector as directly boosting employment, and it is one of the success stories. Like my Greek colleague, we came to an agreement with the Troika: the government addressed this question with them, and they were allowed to reduce VAT provided they demonstrated that the funding could be provided from elsewhere. It resulted in a tax on pensions, which was not very popular at the time.

Is it true that among young people we have 7 million compatriots, european partners, who are out of work? Yes! And is it true that tourism is one of the best labour-creating, job-creating sectors? Yes! Well, there are over 13 million people in this sector right now. Then why is the Commission not finally moving and listening to the views of members?

We all agree that tourism is an important economic sector and we need to explore its potential. The Commission, Member States and the industry should join forces and work together to keep Europe as the world’s number one tourist destination. Let me be more specific now and respond to a couple of the points made. First, on the new action plan, the 2010 communication is very comprehensive and a lot of work can be done within its framework. However, new challenges have arisen. The Commission will address them through targeted measures in close cooperation with Parliament, Member States, regions and the industry. Second, on funds and investment, the Commission will continue to promote the visibility of funds that can be used in tourism. We will organise a high—level event on this topic in April 2016. I would point out, at the same time, that in 2016 the budget for tourism is EUR 4.5 million. This allows projects from 2015 to be continued and to be evaluated in order to build on their results. Third, on taxes, the Commission will analyse the impact of taxes – both national and regional – on tourism. It is important to point out that taxation is primarily a national competence.  Fourth, on branding and promoting Europe, this is an important priority for the Commission. We consider that it must be done via joint promotional efforts in cooperation with Member States, regions and the industry. Last, but not least, on safety, aspects related to the safety of services will be looked at in the context of the Consumer Protection Regulation.

The debate certainly does not end today, because we have a task force and an intergroup on Culture and Tourism which operate very actively, and so I think that this is simply a starting point for a very intensive work between now and the future. I shared the speeches made by my fellow Members who spoke on the subject of culture and said that we must promote European cultural diversity and identities, because we really must not only talk about tourism, but we must also talk about rich territorial promotion. Instead, when we talk about immigration, we really confuse two issues that should not be put on an equal footing. Of course, I know that immigration and asylum applications are a matter of concern to the European Union. But we must not give the wrong messages either, namely that Europe is not an attractive destination and a safe destination today. And then at a time when we are coming up with the sovereignty and Europe of nations, ladies and gentlemen, then we should not be sitting here. If we are sitting here, it is because we have to believe in Europe and its potential, including the fact that we have a new fiscal policy. With regard to my Maltese colleague, I wanted to reassure him that the intention of the report is undoubtedly to take account of environmental aspects and also of the quality of work, not least in order to improve, why not, the level of pay, indeed it must certainly be, and to ensure that health does not give rise to social dumping, but is an increase in quality in all Member States.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. On behalf of the Committee on Transport, I would like to briefly present the question on the oral answer to satellite-based positioning systems for air traffic: numerous tragedies in air transport have shown the weaknesses of the current system and have highlighted the need for accurate and constant positioning of aircraft. We remember the tragic history of Malaysian Airlines 370 flight and air france 447 and many others. Only 30% of the world's airspace is covered by today's tracking systems. This hinders rescue and recovery. So there is a need for action. And one of the most promising options is to locate with satellites, that is, the automatic dependence surveillance broadcast. This technology enables better control and management of air traffic, above all more safety, but also more efficiency and control and less infrastructure costs. So: a win-win-win-win situation. Our committee is convinced that the rules need to be reconsidered in order to save lives. The International Organisation for Civil Aviation (ICAO) also shares our concerns. The Committee and ICAO are therefore both asking the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to allocate a spectrum of spectrum at the World Conference in Geneva this November.

The Commission considers that satellite-based technology for global flight tracking is a positive development. In the aftermath of the June 2009 accident involving Air France flight 447, Europe launched extensive work on options both for tracking aircraft and for localising an airplane in distress. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in March 2014 has contributed to fast-tracking of the regulatory process at EU level.  A committee opinion delivered on 9 July 2015 endorsed the Commission’s proposal to amend Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 regarding requirements for flight records, underwater locating devices and aircraft tracking systems. Both in terms of legislation and research our work is performance—based. This means that it does not favour any specific commercial or technical solution as long as the technology used by operators is fit for the desired purpose. Our rules will both provide the necessary flexibility and accommodate a number of technical options – existing ones as well as future ones such as Galileo Search and Rescue and/or satellite-based ADS, type B. Such rules, supported by the Member States, would be based on the following three principles: First, the requirements must be technologically neutral and performance based. They will be defined to ensure that large public transport aircraft automatically transmit sufficient trajectory information regularly and accurately enough for search and rescue and investigation purposes. Second, provided that the relevant equipment can be operated safely, the requirement should specify that it should have a backup power supply and it should not be possible to disable the flight tracking functions. This apparently occurred during the Malaysia Airlines flight. Third, the requirements must allow air carriers and aircraft manufacturers to opt for the most cost-efficient solutions.  The text of the Commission proposal has already been submitted to the European Parliament and Council for scrutiny. On that basis, comprehensive legislation should be adopted and published before the end of the year. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is also updating international rules accordingly. Furthermore, we are working actively to provide passengers with Internet connections, both terrestrial and satellite solutions. Such systems can support advanced data communication between air and ground. This will eventually make it possible for flights to be fully monitored in real time from the ground. To return to the subject of space—based ATSB technology, although this remains an interesting   option, the Commission would like to underline that it is one of several possible solutions. The Commission has set out various options in a technical working paper provided to ICAO. Concerning the Commission’s position at the World Radio Communication Conference, the European Union as such does not have voting rights in the ITU. On Monday, 26 October the Council adopted conclusions for the World Radio Communication Conference, but this topic is not addressed. We therefore welcome the European Parliament resolution and we will work together with Member States at the World Radio Communication Conference to ensure that it is coherently supported during the negotiations.  To sum up, the Commission supported the protection of ADS type B at the World Radio Communication Conference and consequently in the ITU radio regulation. We also know that during the preparations for the World Radio Communications Conference Member States signalled their support for allocation for satellite reception of automatic dependent surveillance broadcast ATSB emissions from aircraft limited to messages transmitted in accordance with ICAO standards. That will conclude my report.

One of the planes was located after years of searching, the other has not been found yet. The reason is the absence of a system to ensure a global and permanent tracking of flights, the positioning of aircraft is possible only in 30% of the airspace. The oceans and part of Africa are not covered due to the lack of technical possibilities, i.e. the lack of terrestrial equipment.  A non-performing and expensive system which records a relatively accurate position of aircraft at large intervals and results in inefficient use of airspace shall be used. We have at hand a technical solution that can provide global coverage, the ADS-B, a system that is already used on the basis of terrestrial equipment and can be used in the future based on satellite systems. Changes to aircraft are minimal. There is a need for a frequency band to be allocated by the International Telecommunication organisation at the World Radio communication conference. The conference will take place in November 2015. The next one's in four years. It is obvious that this allocation must be made this year in order not to lose another four years.

The rapporteur takes note that effective and harmonious cross-border cooperation to combat organised and transnational crime is needed. According to him, the current situation justifies modernising the legal basis of CEPOL (European Police College), which is an EU agency responsible for the training of law enforcement services at European level. This reform aims to adapt CEPOL to the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty and to entrust the agency with the implementation of the new European programme on the training of law enforcement services (services that concern police, border guards, customs officers and prosecutors).  Together with my colleagues from the National Front, we believe that voting for this reform would be tantamount to endorsing the Schengen system. One does not go without the other: the disappearance of borders within the Schengen area requires this kind of European agency.

There, for example, the profession of officer of the medium commanding composition can be acquired, supplemented by appropriate specialisation.

The solution is to prohibit financing operations through securities.

The regulation referred to here establishes rules to make securities financing transactions generally referred to as shadow banking transparent. This term refers to a phenomenon with blurred outlines comprising a whole set of entities whose financial intermediation activities are called \"parallels\". These, in fact, are not part of traditional banking. These operations thus benefit from almost non-existent regulation and borrow attractive channels (little or no taxed and high interest) but dangerous (no public guarantees). They are the work of investment banks, mutual funds, insurers, pension or money funds, private equity firms or hedge funds. Flexible regulation of these activities is absolutely necessary, especially since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

In this context, progress in the establishment of the Banking Union is also decisive.  However, the crisis also highlighted the need to improve transparency and supervision, not only in the traditional banking sector, but also in the areas of non-bank credit activities known as the \"shadow banking system\".

In order to ensure an effective regulatory framework for shadow banking, progress in introducing and implementing coherent requirements at international level remains essential.

Because the reduction in unemployment has been based on precariousness and wage cuts.  Citizens need no more words or analysis.

Some Member States have persistent macroeconomic imbalances (high levels of public and private debt, large current account gaps, excessive risks in the financial sector). The persistently high unemployment rate in most Member States is a worrying phenomenon. Attention is drawn to the need for significant structural reforms, as well as a focus on creating the conditions for flexible labour markets, adapting education systems to labour market needs and transferring the tax burden from work to other areas.  Furthermore, the very low level of implementation of the recommendations for individual Member States should be emphasised, which makes it difficult to coordinate national economic policies with European recommendations.

These recommendations are based on the policy priorities identified in the Commission’s last Annual Growth Survey and have been endorsed by the European Council. The economic forecasts for 2016 indicate signs of slow economic recovery, with 2.1% in the EU and 1.9% in the euro area.

To achieve that will require a change in the direction of the EU’s economic policy.

I welcome these measures, which aim to significantly improve the services offered to this category of unemployed people to help them quickly find a job.

For example, don't include Hungary in your employment data if you have a job abroad, or count them as a statistical unit even if you've only worked an hour a month. There should be no public works programme that provides a salary of around EUR 150 per month as modern slavery. Instead, I propose that governments adopt the recommendations of the motion, including the need to develop specific job training programmes and business development and investment plans that create sustainable and quality jobs for long-term unemployed people.

'u2012' Long-term unemployment is an excellent tool at the service of policies that want to make labour cheaper and more exploited. If a worker is over 12 or 18 months without being employed, he should already be very happy with any crumb.  The previous right-wing government in Portugal, with this idea in mind, created an internship program for the long-term unemployed, directly contributing to the replacement of employment with rights for precarious employment, to the direct reduction of wages and, moreover, subsidizing this reduction of wages with social security money. We understand the need to bring unemployment down. However, there are minimal rules, many of them relating to human dignity.

Interest in these drones has grown rapidly in recent years. In Slovakia only, unofficial numbers say up to ten thousand pieces. Drones are widely used not only for professional purposes, namely activities such as controlling railway tracks, dams, power plants or professional photography of major events, but many use drones for sports or other recreational purposes. On the other hand, uncontrolled use of drones can lead to serious interference in private life. In my opinion, this report balances both areas. It promotes the growth of industry and trade in this area, does not place a disproportionate burden on producers, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also protects the public interest, security and the right to privacy.

One of the most important issues is the safe use of these machines. The cases where pilotless aircraft interfere with air traffic are the most spectacular, but there are also other areas that need to be regulated, e.g. the issue of privacy violations by drone users. Despite the legislative action taken by the Member States, it is necessary for the European Commission to create a certain legal framework that will set a European standard for the production and use of remotely guided unmanned aerial systems. It is important to establish rules for the mutual recognition by Member States of the power to pilot such aircraft for commercial purposes.

While the growth forecasts for the number of tourists visiting the EU in the coming years are positive, we need to be vigilant about foreign visitors, as Europe increasingly has to compete with other destinations in the world, especially those emerging, which can be made cheaper. In addition, some additional challenges require the tourism sector in Europe to adapt rapidly in order to maintain its level of competitiveness. The tourism sector is affected by changes in consumer behaviour, higher demand for high-quality services for customers and, ultimately, companies need to adapt to the era of digitisation, as over 95% of travellers join the Internet to plan their journey, and the number of suppliers in the collaborative economy is growing.

At present, the tourism policy of European countries sees a high degree of divergence from country to country and is still all too often linked to a logic of competition between European countries: this causes a loss of competitiveness towards low-cost destinations outside Europe, which are the real threats to the turnover of the European tourism sector and which over the last ten years have learned to move deftly in the global tourism market , diverting significant EU tourist flows to their advantage.

In addition, we must ensure quality services by making training for workers in the tourism sector cross-border, and work towards a wider range of alternative recreation and tourism opportunities outside the high season.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1090, "date": "2015-10-29.json", "name": "Miroslav MIKOLÁŠIK", "mepid": "28178", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 In the context of the advancing process of globalisation, the tourism sector is also facing increasing global competition from new, less costly countries attracting foreign tourists.

Tourism is the third branch of the economy in Europe (producing almost 10% of European GDP). Other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, transport and culture, also benefit from tourism. Tourism plays a significant role in job creation. It is also crucial for the economic recovery of those countries that have been particularly affected by the economic crisis. Attention is also drawn to the fact that tourism is an area where SMEs are particularly active. They make up 99% of the industry. The challenges facing tourism in Europe are the effects of the following demographic changes, high youth unemployment rates, a change in consumer behaviour, an increase in demand for high-quality customer service, the need for digitisation.  The European institutions should take action to attract new investment, to initiate growth, to improve the business environment. European funds must support tourism in Europe.

So we have to face this challenge now and find a way to maintain and strengthen the current advantage. An interesting tool that can help in this is a new tourist brand promoting Europe as the direction of visits by foreign tourists. It should not compete with existing European national brands, but complement them in promoting tourism in regions whose visibility is still very low.  We must also make better use of the unique cultural heritage of our continent, including Christian heritage. Also, spa tourism, also thanks to the resorts in the Kuyavia-Pomeranian Voivodeship, has the potential to attract crowds of tourists from other continents.
