To this end, a comprehensive legislative framework exists at EU level. In particular, many forests are protected under the Birds and Habitats Directives. These Directives require that some forest habitats be maintained at or restored to favourable conservation status.  Currently 23% of the European Union’s forest area is part of the Natura 2000 network of protected sites. In addition, species protection rules under both the Birds and Habitats Directives apply within the whole EU territory.  Environmental defenders represent natural and indispensable allies in the promotion of environmental rights. Another tool is the Directive on Environmental Crime in the European Union. The Commission is currently evaluating how the Directive has contributed to the fight against environmental crime. The Commission is currently carrying out a wide public consultation, open until January 2020, and will assess the need to review this legislation or improve its implementation.  Finally, the Timber Regulation aims to prevent trade in illegally harvested timber and timber products.  Environmental crime is also considered a threat to European security and to the well-being of citizens. It has therefore been included in the EU policy cycle against serious and organised crime covering the period from 2018 to 2021. The European Union policy cycle’s primary objective is to increase cooperation amongst law enforcement services and EU agencies to disrupt organised crime groups through operational actions.  It is important to recall that Member States are responsible for implementing the relevant rules, as well as for taking appropriate enforcement measures, including sanctions and penalties. The Commission monitors the implementation of these rules and takes action when needed. The European Union is also providing financial means for the protection, restoration and sustainable management of forests in line with the EU forest strategy.  The European Union’s rural development funds under the common agricultural policy are the main source of funding for forests, amounting to EUR 8.2 billion of public expenditure in the current multiannual financial framework (MFF) period 2014-2020.  Last but not least, the recent Communication on stepping up EU action to protect and restore the world’s forests shows that the European Union is increasing its efforts to step up global action against biodiversity loss. This is currently being discussed in the Council and Parliament. In this context, I have to highlight again the important role of the Timber Regulation, which applies to both timber logged in third countries and imported into the European Union and to domestic timber logged in the European Union.  The Commission has been alerted to reported cases of continued illegal logging in some Member States, including in primary forests, and is carefully assessing the situation. On the specific case of Romania, the Commission is working with the authorities to assess the situation. It is also in the process of analysing Copernicus satellite imagery of logging activities in Natura 2000 protected areas.

Among human rights activists, environmental activists often face serious dangers because of the financial interests that their actions call into question. It is imperative that binding laws are required so that today these companies are held accountable for acts against activists. These companies - European companies that import raw materials and products from third countries - must now ensure that their partners and the entire supply chain respect human and environmental rights. The wood regulation is good regulation, but we need to go further in terms of corporate responsibility. Environmental activists must be able to look to Europe to protect them and ensure access to justice when they are victims of such violence. The justice system should not be a means of sinting activists, but of defending them against those who attack their rights and cause environmental damage.

They account for 30% of the Earth's surface area, but maintain 80% of biodiversity. Thanks to them we breathe. Thanks to them we live.

The truth is that as the conditions of our forests worsen, the conditions of the people who defend them, of environmental defenders, are also deteriorating in the world. Some data have been given, and indeed, according to some reports, such as the Front Line Defenders report, in 2018 two hundred and forty-seven leaders and environmental leaders have been shot, persecuted or have disappeared precisely for defending their environmental environment, for defending the right of all. Because it must be said that the destruction of biodiversity does not concern environmental laws exclusively but should be regarded as a violation of international human rights. In this sense, the European Union must take steps to defend the people who defend our environment. We must improve our environmental legislation and fight environmental crimes. Indeed, as has also been cited, forty environmental organizations around the world are protesting and demanding justice in connection with the murder last month of two forest guards in Romania who had denounced the illegal logging of the forests in their region. According to the Commission's own data, 43% of the timber obtained in these Romanian forests in 2015 came from unidentified sources.

Mr President, their name was Reddu Gorcioaia and Liviu Pop, they were forest rangers and were murdered this autumn because they were only doing their duty, which is to protect the forest. In all, not two but six forest rangers have been killed by the timber mafia in recent years in Romania. They protected nature, but no one protected them. Protectors and protectors of the environment are indeed targets, and we know that. Every year, nearly 200 conservationists are killed around the world. Every week, three people are killed because they defend their natural property, their land or simply their rights to the mining, forestry or agri-food industries. Every day, women and men who defend nature are attacked, silenced, defamed, arrested or threatened with death. The NGO Global Witness points out that this harassment is linked to eco-criminal mafias, but it is also the result of the actions of states that put in place policies aimed at criminalizing and intimidating environmentalists. Cynicism kills, greed kills and indifference kills. This is most often happening outside our borders, as in Brazil's Bolsonaro, our trading partner, where, on Tuesday, the NGO Sa'dee e Alegria and four environmentalists were searched by soldiers and falsely accused of deliberately setting fire to Alter do Cho in order to receive international donations. The same is true in the European Union with the Romanian forest rangers, or Rémi Fraisse, killed by a grenade from the French police, or the activists opposed to hydraulic fracturing who have received prison sentences in the United Kingdom.

Pour beaucoup de citoyens européens, l’Algérie représente aussi la famille. Nous ne parlons donc pas d’un pays parmi les autres, nous parlons d’un pays très proche de nous, un pays ami. Je pense que le premier sentiment que, nous tous en Europe, ressentons à l’égard du peuple algérien, c’est l’amitié et la proximité.

Il revient aux Algériens, à eux seuls, de décider du présent et de l’avenir de leur pays. C’est exactement pour cette raison que les Algériens doivent être libres de s’exprimer avec les garanties que leur assurent leur Constitution ainsi que les accords internationaux signés par l’Algérie. There are certain principles that Algeria has subscribed to, as some of you referred to: first and foremost in the Algerian Constitution but also with international agreements and with the association agreement that Algeria has with the European Union. These principles include all fundamental freedoms, including political freedoms, freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of the press, and the freedoms guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the cornerstone of our association agreements. So it is important that all the different actors in the current moment in Algeria can enjoy these rights. This is a message that not only comes from this debate today, but I think this is exactly the message we have consistently conveyed to our Algerian partners, interlocutors at all levels, constantly over this month. I believe that this will continue to be the message that the next Commission, the High Representative that is incoming, will continue to pass to our interlocutors in Algeria.  Algerians can build consensus around the future of the country, in line with people’s legitimate expectations and this can only happen peacefully and democratically in full respect of the principles that Algeria has subscribed to.

He has received visits – that have been limited – from his family, who have reported that his health is fragile. We have raised the case of José Daniel Ferrer, as well as other cases, with the Cuban authorities, both in Brussels and in Havana, most recently at the level of our Head of Delegation, who conducted an outreach on this issue to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs most recently on 6 November. The day after our intervention his family, including his three children, was able to visit him. Let me stress very clearly once again what we have declared many times: that we expect Cuba to respect every citizen’s fundamental freedoms and human dignity, including the right to a fair trial. In these years, we have never refrained from raising cases such as the one of Mr Ferrer, together with our Member States, in a coordinated manner and in a very proactive manner. Our engagement with Cuba on human rights is open and frank. We have no taboos, we address these issues at all levels, including at mine, every time that we see the need for doing that, and that is, unfortunately, quite often. We have chosen to engage with Cuba not because we see eye to eye on all issues, but precisely because we don’t. And let me say very clearly that I am proud that we have opened a new phase in our relations with Cuba during my mandate – let me stress this – with the full support of all of our Member States, no one excluded, no matter the political orientation of the government in place. I am proud that our political dialogue and cooperation agreement is in place, also because human rights are an essential part of it. And I’m proud of our critical engagement with the Cuban leadership, which gives us the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation but also to openly address our disagreements and to do something about them. The first formal dialogue we launched with Cuba under the new agreement was precisely on human rights, because respect for fundamental freedoms and for civil society is essential for us and is essential to us also because it can only be with the full respect of the space for civil society and human rights that economic development can be sustainable. Only through such critical engagement that we have opened with Cuba can we accompany the country in its modernisation.

Young activists are at the forefront of the protest, but farmers and shopkeepers have also joined, and after years of economic crisis, the country is now facing a constitutional crisis too, with no government and no parliament. The protests started, as some of you have mentioned, over fuel shortages over the summer, and these are now paralysing the country. Businesses, hospitals, schools, government institutions are often closed, transport throughout the country has become very complicated, including for humanitarian aid, and the country is basically at a standstill. Political stances are getting more radical, the humanitarian crisis is worsening, and gang—related violence is also on the rise. We have been and constantly are following very closely the current crisis, coordinating with the countries and institutions from the core group. We also have urged the authorities to conduct effective and thorough investigations into crimes. The authorities must guarantee the right to demonstrate freely and peacefully, and violence must be avoided under all circumstances. I expressed this position on behalf of the 28 Member States earlier this month. We also called on all actors to engage in a national dialogue to identify consensual solutions to the current crisis in its political, economic and humanitarian dimensions. Let me also recall that the European Union is also coordinating with other donors to provide urgent relief inside the country, because the humanitarian situation is dramatic. Yet the current situation is clearly unsustainable. It’s not only a matter of humanitarian aid, it’s a political process that can create the conditions for the international community to support the country’s long—term development.

Ho sempre dato estrema importanza al ruolo della diplomazia parlamentare. Credo che il ruolo del Parlamento europeo sia fondamentale non soltanto per la democrazia europea ma anche per il nostro lavoro per la pace, la sicurezza e una politica estera cooperativa nel mondo, soprattutto in questo mondo di oggi. Vorrei sinceramente ringraziare i membri del Parlamento, tutti, il Presidente, i Vicepresidenti, tutti i gruppi politici e in particolare le due commissioni con le quali ho avuto il piacere di lavorare più strettamente, la commissione per gli affari esteri e la commissione per lo sviluppo, che hanno sempre sostenuto in modo fondamentale il mio lavoro in questi anni.

All these people appeared in the investigations of Daphne Caruana Galizia before she was killed. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Muscat has protected them all this time and defended them again and again, while attacking those who wanted to expose them. The situation in Malta has consequences for the entire European project. I think this Parliament needs to point out, now more than ever, to the Maltese authorities that the assassination of journalists with clear political links must have clear political consequences. I have always seen this Parliament raising its voice very high to claim the respect of rule of law and of the freedom of the press to several governments in Europe.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The subject we have chosen this afternoon as the subject of our oral question to the Commission is: what about the electronic internal market for telephone services? We have already discussed this on several occasions, together with many other colleagues in the Committee on the Internal Market. The subject to be discussed this afternoon is a very local issue here in the Strasbourg area. A German citizen mentioned to me that his mother-in-law was in hospital in Strasbourg and that he did not manage to call her during her stay there, because the hospital there kindly offers a 0800 number – a free service number – for french citizens, which, however, cannot be reached from other European countries, which is only a few kilometres away in this situation. I believe, Commissioner Gabriel, that we need to address the question in a very specific way: can the European internal telecommunications market look like this, that we have abolished cross-border roaming charges, but that citizens in the neighbouring country can no longer call their in-laws in the neighbouring country uncomplicatedly because of a 0800 number there? In my view, this is indisputable, because the advantage of the 0800 number is precisely that the citizen can call uncomplicatedly – namely free of charge – and if it is impossible across borders, we have done the European internal market a disservice. That is why I would like to know from the Commission – but together with all the colleagues who are here this afternoon – what we can do to remedy this maladministration, to ensure that not only the bill for cross-border telephone calls remains favourable, but that cross-border accessibility is reliably resolved, even in the case of service numbers. That is why it is important for the European Commission to give us a clear answer here.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for drawing our attention to this important issue. The European Commission believes it is important to guarantee access to the number 0 800. We will look at this issue in detail, first of all because - as you have just rightly said, Mr Schwab - this issue is essential for the completion of the Digital Single Market. Companies typically use 0 800 numbers to provide better customer service. It is often a decision that aims to provide assistance in an easier and more effective way. In the case of a free 0 800 number, the cost of the call is carried over to the named party, such as a company with a customer helpline.  In order to avoid any risk of fraud and to protect the caller from the high costs associated with calls from abroad, especially for small NGOs such as cancer helpline, national and European legislation does not prohibit callers from refusing calls made from abroad. So far, we have not received many complaints, but I do not trust that. Whether there are many or few, that is not the question, we are talking about something essential and concrete. Therefore, I would like to see what other means we have. I draw your attention to the directive that establishes the new European code for electronic communications. You remember, we adopted it last year. This new code has introduced various measures aimed precisely at combating cross-border distortions and eliminating their effects. Therefore, we know that the code will contribute to the completion of the single market. It is currently expected to come into force in December 2020, and the Commission is cooperating closely with Member States to help them implement it. Of course, the European Parliament is always welcome in this process. We will have the same objective: to ensure that the new measures established by the code are operational after December next year, and we will follow up carefully. Therefore, we will continue to follow this issue. Completion of the Digital Single Market is a first-rate goal and we have already made good progress. We now have a set of policies, investment measures and regulatory initiatives that have given European companies important tools for digital competitiveness and, at the same time, strengthened user rights. As you know, we have abolished roaming charges across the European Union. Recently, we have introduced reduced rates for international calls in Member States. These two measures have made a significant contribution to ensuring that European consumers feel concerned about a genuine digital single market policy. At this stage, I can assure you that the Commission will continue to monitor the situation of access to the number 0 800 closely, and it is on this basis that further action will be taken, in line with, I repeat, the evolution of the situation. Today's debate is also a contribution for which we thank you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 144, "date": "2019-11-28.json", "name": "Róża THUN UND HOHENSTEIN", "mepid": "96776", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Thank you very much for this ambitious declaration, which we take here very seriously, because the helplines are indeed very popular in many sectors: the banking sector, mobile networks and many others. They are crucial, including in terms of traffic information, railway information, consumer information and much more. But when I'm abroad, we won't use the consumer helpline yet, because in the handsee – and I've experienced it myself – instead of information about my consumer rights or other advice, I hear, \"At the moment, the number is unreachable.\" And this will also happen to anyone who wants to contact the 24-hour free hotline for children, for young people, for parents, for educators. Instead of getting professional help from experienced psychologists, educators, experienced lawyers, there is silence in the handsee.  According to data available in my country, Poland, from the National Health Fund, the hotline supports almost 40,000 calls per month. I do not see any obstacles as to why the hotline service in Poland could not be available to people from outside my country who are currently in Poland and urgently need information about the availability of hospitals, e.g. for themselves or for a loved one, and have a number that does not start at +48.  Next, of course, we need to reflect on the issue of the universal operation of such hotlines in a foreign language once they have been internationalised, because I completely agree with the Commissioner that, as we all know, law, technical or administrative solutions must make life easier for us, they must make life easier for the citizens of the European Union, not create barriers and obstacles to communication. Finally, Andreas Schwab rightly recalled: we won with roaming or with the prices of international calls. That is why I am absolutely determined to work on extending the functioning of the national hotline to international calls, and I am convinced that we will achieve this in good cooperation with the new European Commission (which I wish you every success).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 145, "date": "2019-11-28.json", "name": "Miapetra KUMPULA-NATRI", "mepid": "124735", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, I am happy to be here to work again for the telecommunication operators and then the citizens’ needs, and I see the internal market of the telecommunication as an essential part. During the last mandate, Europe has taken important steps towards the regulation of the international calls lately, which will come to power only at the end of next year and will also lower the price there. And then we know the success story of the roaming. I’m happy to be the rapporteur and see that results have been causing more happiness than these problems. But then of course, informing the consumers is the most important. I also read the petition made by the German gentleman who was on holiday in France and wanted to call the hospital and thought it was a free number because it started 0800. So then first of all the consumer needs to know if it’s not free when they make a phone call. But I also want to look at the existing law. There are two parts. There are businesses that want to offer services across the EU. It is, of course, then in their interest also to pay the price instead of the customer. But then we do have this possibility also to use this 0800 numbers for the public services such as hospitals. I don’t very easily see the potential there to serve the citizens, because if they’re negotiating the whole euro price, instead of the one country where the hospital is located, I might think that they don’t want to serve these free phone calls for everyone, because the hospital in Finland cannot serve the language of the Greek grandparent or the Polish friend. So it’s more complicated than the easy answer, which would be to make it free for everywhere. In Finland there is a proposal now that nationwide service numbers may not be any price they want. There is now the proposal that service numbers must be included in the unlimited data prices and not have external prices as they are nowadays, not in the price regulation, because even many public services use them. So I’m curious to ask if the Commission sees that possibility, that model, that those national service numbers could be the way forward then also to help the model that they are not excessive. And I’m always in favour of unlimited packages, whether it’s data or telephones. It really gives the purposes for the users to have access to digital services in a more broad way and then having that one as the main goal to make the low price for the telephone users – it serves the people best. But I’m curious also to see this cross-border situation.

An EU emergency number 112 has been created. The European Electronic Communications Code, which the Commissioner has referred to and which will fully enter into force by the end of next year, has been adopted. EU rules on roaming have been introduced – first roaming phone calls, then data roaming, although it must be said here that telecommunications companies are still exploiting every loophole in the law to charge consumers additional fees. Unfortunately, this is still the case in my country, Poland. Nevertheless, progress is enormous.  Indeed, access to 0800 numbers is perhaps one of the last barriers that separates us from the creation of a full single telecommunications market within the European Union. This is so important that many of these numbers are numbers operated by business, as my finnish colleague said, and here, of course, we cannot pour a child with a bath – we must remember that with the lifting of these restrictions, business will bear higher costs, costs will increase for callers abroad. However, let us also remember that 0800 numbers are used in the public service.  Mr Schwab, the author of this question, shows an extremely important example, namely access to medical information.  In Poland, many Poles who work in other countries on a daily basis today, after the abolition of roaming fallout, have mobile area codes from other countries of the European Union.

We must complete the digital single market.’ Now, we’ve made some good progress – obviously, roaming and geo-blocking, complementarity – we did a lot of work on that. And as she said, there’s no point in completing something unless the customers are aware of it. That’s the second point. But I would like to say to Mariya Gabriel, because she has a great record: wouldn’t it be great if she could be the person who could come in to this Parliament over the next five years and say: ‘Actually we have completed the single market, we have completed the digital single market.’ And I think the way to do it is something like what we’ve been doing. Where are the obstacles? Where are the loopholes? Pick them off, deal with them, get them out of the way one by one and do that over the next five years and we’ll make fantastic progress.

Madam President, first of all, I would really like to thank the European Parliament for raising this important issue of access to the number 0 800. Thank you also for your support for the measures proposed and implemented so far for the completion of the Digital Single Market. I would now like to respond a little more in detail, because the questions from Ms Miapetra Kumpula-Natri and Mr Kelly were very specific. The first thing... Why is the cost of calls to 0800 from abroad difficult to establish? It's very clear because actually we are talking about obstacles, but it's a unilateral economic decision and in the case of calls from abroad the cost of the call may be difficult to establish as the called party cannot keep the fees such as transit and call termination fees under control, contrary to costs on a national level and may be exposed to fraudulent practices. This is why under national and European legislation it is not prohibited to refuse calls from abroad.  Now where we are, and what we have achieved in order to give you some European answers. First, our reference is the new Code of Electronic Communications. We said it very clearly. It will become effective in the Member States as of 21 December 2020 next year. But, the Code has introduced measures to avoid cross—border distortions and will further contribute to the completion of the single market. An example of such a measure is the introduction of single maximum Union-wide voice termination rates by a delegated act which the Commission will adopt by the end of next year. Thanks to such a measure, one of the cost elements will decrease over time and the risk of increased overall cost, transit and interconnection costs for the called party, the company contracting the free phone number, the bank or travel or agency, are therefore likely to be mitigated over time. On our side, at the European Commission, we will closely monitor the development to see if further action is needed. Madam President, once again, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for this debate, which is useful for us and for our follow-up work. As I just said, we will continue to monitor the market and developments in this area to determine whether further action is needed in the future. The message is this: we have made several progress, we will see what effects they will produce. Already, thanks to this debate, we will also be following trends and developments more closely in order to be able to act in time. Because technologies are evolving extremely fast, it is important for us too not to fall behind. Thank you very much, Madam President, and thank you again to the Members of Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 150, "date": "2019-11-28.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  The debate is closed.
