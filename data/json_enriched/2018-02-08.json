The Commission regularly receives questions about the time switch, including from Members of the European Parliament. Some of those doubt that we need to switch time.  As the Commission committed before this House, my services have reassessed all available evidence. This includes the very balanced and complete overview made by the European Parliament’s research services. The evidence is conclusive only on one point – that letting Member States free to apply uncoordinated time changes would be detrimental for the internal market. I am therefore against such a solution, whether that means simply repealing the directive or allowing individual Member States to opt out of the harmonised regime.  Conversely, the findings are inconclusive on human health. Some people seem to suffer from the twice-yearly changes, but this might be well compensated for by the positive health effects induced by increased leisure and outdoor activities. It is unclear whether permanent summer time or winter time would be better for the human biorhythm.  While I am open to consider the summer time issues further, I would like to stress an important point. There are two options that would allow for a continued harmonised approach: stop time changes for all Member States by amending the directive, or leave the summer time rules unchanged. If one were to select the first option, it would also have to be established when to abolish time changes – after the last change to winter time, or after the last change for summer time.  We discussed the summer time issues at the last Council sitting in December at the request of one Member State. I explicitly invited all ministers to let me know if any of them were in favour of changing the status quo. Apart from the one Member State that put the question on the agenda, nobody has done so until now. Today it is your turn.  I very much look forward to the forthcoming debate and welcome the vote on the resolution which will give Parliament the opportunity to voice its opinion in this matter. I am sure it will give rise to valuable elements for reflection. All the more so, since the success of any potential Commission proposals intended to modify the current rules by definition depends on the stance taken by the co-legislators.

But as the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we, as the Committee on Transport and Tourism, care very much — especially from the associations of road victims — the accumulation of fatigue that is occurring in the weeks following the change, especially the winter change, but also in spring, since there is a difference that generates nocturnal insomnia and, of course, that accumulation of fatigue. We agree that we must also study — and this was something we agreed on — the benefits, for energy efficiency and, above all, also, because to those of us who are tourism countries seemed to us that our wider schedules were just going to be better. What happens is that, in my country, the schedules are so wide and so complex to reconcile with the hours of stay with the family that we should almost, in Spain, rethink them more drastically and not just because of the time change.

Commissioner, you are responsible for this time change, winter and summer time. You said you don't want a patchwork in Europe. But we do not want that either; we want to abolish the time change, and do so uniformly throughout Europe. It was introduced once to save energy. In fact, energy saving is in the range of 0.1 to 0.5%, as many studies have shown. What you might save on light in the evening with prolonged daylight, you need in the morning for heating or even in the morning for light. From this point of view, there are many negative effects that have already been addressed. And that's exactly what it's all about, that's what drives people around. It's even negative for the climate, you noticed, because the sun is practically generating CO2 pollution for a long time, which is practically in the evening, and that's not good for the climate... (intercuses)... no, that's so, actually, let me finish! Otherwise, as far as health is concerned: many people suffer from it. According to a long-term study by the employee health insurance in Germany, there are 25% more heart attacks right after it, 15% more sick leave, 12% more depression, and there are deficiencies in concentrations that lead to lower school performance and more traffic accidents, which are usually caused by less sleep. in the morning, especially children and young people are involved. We are always fighting to have fewer road accidents, and the opposite is indeed the case. I don't suppose that can be! Furthermore, one must also consider: in the case of animals: the cows give up to 10% less milk. This has to do with the fact that we all have an internal clock, all living beings; this has to do with the position of the sun, for example, and with the day/night rhythm of the Earth, and we interrupt that. Chronobiologists were awarded the Nobel Prize for having noticed them what is important for the organism. And we want to override it? There are 140 countries around the world that have already made the transition 50% — Russia, for example — because they have noticed that there is a decline in gross national product, which of course they did not want.

I think the original directive was quite logical in terms of harmonising the biannual change, so clearly at least we changed the time at exactly the same time throughout Europe and throughout the European Union. I’m personally totally unconvinced by the scientific reports which, quite frankly, are inconclusive. Furthermore, on the grounds of subsidiarity, this must be a Member State decision and should not be a decision made by the European Union and imposed on Member States. A proposed assessment by the Commission in my view is a complete waste of taxpayers’ money at a time when there are far more important issues which we should be focusing upon in Europe. I therefore say, certainly on behalf of my delegation, that we shall not be supporting these proposals – despite all of the hard work done by colleagues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2018-02-08.json", "name": "Nils TORVALDS", "mepid": "114268", "text": " — Mr President, the Commission promised at the beginning of the period that it would be big on big issues and small on small matters.

This is gloom, this is almost midnight. It's different in Warsaw, or Tallinn. In Brussels, by contrast, it is a very different time. Another thing: it rained arguments that don't necessarily contribute that much. Colleagues, don't be angry, but if you refer to what Stalin did and how the flies behave, how it affects the cows, I would leave it completely on the side. However, as regards transport, winter time has the advantage that the propensity for accidents is much less if we start the journey later. And there was an element here a bit confusing. I don't quite understand him. A colleague was showing the clock Saying it was nine o'clock fifteen showed the eighth fifteen. No. It would have been tenth fifteen. Also this needs to be understood.

At the time it brought two great benefits: the enjoyment of the solar day, synchronizing the working hours with leisure times, and the savings in the energy bill, which today is only marginal, as we all know. At first glance, it seems that this resolution is only concerned about the inconvenience of having to change the timetable, but this nuisance has to be accurately measured, since all the evidence collected so far seems to be inconclusive. In health it is important to consider, on the one hand, adapting to an hour of difference in circadian rhythm and, on the other hand, the gains we have from greater sun exposure in diseases such as depression, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. However, whatever decision we make, we must act with caution and responsibility when we ask to discontinue the biannual clock.

Uncoordinated national time change in the course of the year would create very significant problems for the good functioning of our internal market, notably in the transport sector. If we ever decided to stop changing the clock, it has to be done throughout the EU in a synchronised and unified manner. Regarding health problems, it is true that the body has to adapt to the time change in March and October. Some people are more vulnerable and have more issues with the change than others. That is true. On the other hand, as some of you pointed out, other studies show that longer exposure to daylight and more opportunities for leisure and sport have a positive effect on people’s health.

An important component of this quality is primarily health, which is also negatively affected by changes during the year in the form of summer and winter time. Analyses show that the economic benefits, including energy savings from the alternation of time, are negligible. Of course, the benefits from a longer day in summer and the possibility of leisure activities during spring and summer are positive. Regardless of these benefits, health promotion should be a priority. The human body has its natural biorhythms, which such changes negatively affect. Disruption of biorhythms disrupts a person's health and at the same time increases the financial costs of its protection and correction. For important findings in chronobiological research, three researchers won the Nobel Prize in 2017. The latest research has shown that the effect on human biorhythm may be more severe than predicted.

This practice may have made sense in the past when lighting made up the major part of energy consumption in the household. However, today’s energy expenses are different. For example, the cost of air conditioning outweighs the benefits of not needing lighting. Energy saving lighting further reduces such expenses. Many also argue that DST has negative health effects, leads to productivity loss, and increased risk of accidents. This mainly results from sleep deprivation that takes place until the body gets used to the new timing. Studies have shown that this period correlates with increased cardiac arrest rates by 24%, work—related accidents by 6%, traffic accidents by 8% and a productivity loss of nearly 20%.

Unfortunately, it is not the first time that we have discussed here human rights violations in the Russian Federation. In the past 12 months, we have debated in this Chamber: the repression that followed the anti-corruption demonstrations organised on 26 March 2017; the fate of Ukrainian prisoners in Russia; the situation in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula, and the persecution of LGBT people in Chechnya. Today we are discussing the dire human rights situation in Chechnya, and this time specifically the increased pressure on, and harassment of, human rights defenders in the North Caucasus Russian Republic. The arrest and detention of Oyub Titiev, who is the head of the regional office of the respected NGO Memorial, is the main reason we are here today. The spokesperson for the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy issued a statement on 11 January on the arrest of Mr Titiev, pointing out that it was part of a worrying trend of arrests, as well as attacks on, and the intimidation and discrediting of, independent journalists and human rights defenders who work in Chechnya. Similar cases in the past include those of the journalist Zhalaudi Geriev and the Chair of the Assembly of the Peoples of the Caucasus, Ruslan Kutaev, who were both sentenced to imprisonment on dubious grounds of drug possession, the same charge now being levelled against Mr Titiev. The case of Mr Titiev is especially of concern, given that his predecessor as head of Memorial in Chechnya, Ms Natalia Estemirova, was killed in 2009 and no one has been brought to justice for that crime. Mr Titiev’s arrest was quickly followed by an arson attack on the Memorial office in neighbouring Ingushetia and by an attack on one of Memorial’s cars in Dagestan. It is clear that the arrest and the attacks are part of a concerted assault on human rights defenders working in Chechnya. Sadly, recent statements from the authorities, including from the Head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, denigrating the work of human rights defenders, leave us with the fear that these attacks are being orchestrated by the Chechen authorities themselves, as was the case in the persecution of gay men last year. As we have said, we expect the federal and regional authorities in the Russian Federation fully to observe Mr Titiev’s legal rights, in accordance with Russia’s international human rights commitments, and to release him swiftly.

UN experts report that prisoners are being systematically tortured. It is shameful how cautious the EU is in the face of the ongoing massive human rights violations in Egypt. The EU-Egypt Partnership Priorities Agreement, adopted in June 2017, contains mutual commitment to human rights standards.

Our position on the death penalty is well known. The European Union opposes capital punishment under all circumstances and I completely agree with you that, for us, it represents an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity. At the meeting of the EU—Egypt Subcommittee on Political Matters, Human Rights and Democracy, which took place in Cairo last month, the Union shared its concerns with the Egyptian authorities. This was about the recent execution of more than 20 people, and we reiterated our principled position against the death penalty. We have called on Egypt to commute death sentences whenever possible and to establish a formal moratorium with a view to the abolition of capital punishment. Furthermore, we encourage Egypt to take concrete steps to end military trials for civilians, and, in accordance with international standards for a fair trial, to retry in civilian courts citizens convicted by military courts. At the same time, I would like to mention a number of other issues concerning websites and human rights organisations. The EU raised, in its position for the EU—Egypt Association Council of July 2017, clear concerns regarding the blocking of websites and the ongoing pressure on human rights organisations and defenders. That position was also expressed in the recent EU statement at the Human Rights Council under item 4, as well as during the latest meeting of the EU—Egypt Subcommittee on Political Matters, Human Rights and Democracy, in January. Egypt is a key partner for the EU and a significant regional player. The sustainable stability and security of this country are crucial, not only for all Egyptians but also for the entire region, for the European Union and for our Member States. It is our firm conviction that democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms are crucial for this purpose, especially in the context of the many challenges that Egypt is facing. We appreciate the difficulties and we stand side by side with Egypt in addressing them. This view is based on universal values and we regularly discuss these with our Egyptian counterparts within the framework of the new Egypt partnership priorities that were adopted in July 2017. The protection and promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law are guiding principles for EU external action.

It was Mr Trump who described this country, as you know, where we went in December as part of the ACP delegation. On the contrary, it is a very endearing country, where the European Union invests in interesting projects, but where poverty is pervasive. As a result, the situation of young people is terrible because there are between 150,000 and 500,000 young people who suffer slavery within the families themselves. How to respond to this? I fully support this text because it seems to me that it is possible to deal with this problem if poverty is eradicated, because they are very poor families who entrust their children to other families, who are a little less so. To eradicate poverty, we must play on agriculture. The European Union is providing assistance in this regard, but it is often aimed at very large farms and does not reach the small ones who can, in fact, fight poverty.

Almost a fifth of Haitian children between the age of six and eleven do not attend school. This phenomenon has a complex economic and social basis, and the current difficult political situation and lack of action for change in key legislation gives permission for violations of human rights and children's rights. Also, the lack of a birth record system exposes children to being victims of human trafficking.

This condition, which affects as many as 40 000 Haitian children, is turning into a form of modern slavery. 95% of these little slaves suffer physical and psychological mistreatment and 25% of little girls are subjected to sexual assault before the age of 18, and all in the corrupt silence of the ruling class. We need to put an end to this aberrant practice.

We have been actively engaged in the fight to end child labour, boost access to education and, of course, strengthen children’s rights. I totally agree with you regarding the powerful role of education in such difficult conditions on the ground, and that is why, as Commissioner, from the beginning of my term of office I decided to increase our budget for education in emergencies eight times. It is quite important to realise that sometimes, in such conditions, education is the only way to protect children. In this regard, Haiti is no exception. The Haitian population – and in particular, the most vulnerable groups, including children – have been particularly affected by natural disasters and instability. We are also fully aware of the so-called restavek practice, which exposes children to exploitation, sexual abuse and isolation, condemning them to illiteracy and perpetuating poverty. The European Union is very sensitive to these major human rights issues and that is why among our top priorities for cooperation with Haiti is the promotion of education and human rights, with several programmes under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) aimed at fighting these practices, which are shameful, frankly speaking. Children’s rights are also one of the priority issues for the periodical EU political dialogue with the Haitian authorities. We, as the European Union, clearly intend to maintain and further increase our involvement in this issue. At the most recent political dialogue, which took place in Port-au-Prince on 30 January, we conveyed our concern regarding the precarious situation of children and their rights. In particular, we reiterated the need to follow up on the latest Universal Periodic Review recommendation in this regard.  Two EU projects, each worth EUR 0.5 million, have been approved: one focusing on access to justice and legal protection for children, and the other dealing with the protection of children in urban areas near the border with the Dominican Republic where, unfortunately, there is a higher incidence of child trafficking. These projects will be implemented until 2020. The European Union will also continue to advocate the ratification and effective implementation of relevant international conventions such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and ILO Convention 138 on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment.

Essentially the issue is, of course, less about how much information truck users should give away to help us know how much CO2 emissions they produce and more about how much information they should give away so that Chinese competitors can get their upper edge. The principal question, which is probably more important, is that the European Parliament plenary should decide on the mandate for the European Parliament to enter into negotiation and should not regularly delegate that decision to the Environment Committee, or any other committee for that matter.

It is also only right that there is equality in the exchange of information on convictions of EU nationals and third-country nationals. Today, under the current European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), we identify previous criminal convictions in the EU for EU nationals but not for third-country nationals. Our report closes this gap. The report had wide support in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) precisely because it provides a fair balance between protecting the rights of individuals and ensuring that past criminal convictions are correctly attributed. It is about ensuring that judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies have a complete picture in order to carry out their work. As an instrument it offers clear safeguards and protection. It is only for convictions handed out by EU Member States, and it can be accessed only under certain very specific circumstances. A robust and secure system for sharing conviction information with clear safeguards is needed, and this is what the LIBE Committee has proposed.

Again, privatization of profits and publicization of losses in full crisis. I recognise that great importance is given to mechanisms for avoiding funding to companies that carry out tax fraud, but I would have liked the report to address more boldly, the lack of transparency as regards access to data on projects financed by the EIB. Finally, we had tabled a series of amendments to condemn the involvement of the EIB in financing major infrastructure projects with high environmental impact, such as the TAP. I would like to point out here, Mr President, that our position arises from sharing those same principles that the EIB is concerned with and which then disproves in fact.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that 67 Syrian citizens have been killed as a result of this military operation. Of these 67, 20 are children. The situation is very serious and deteriorating. The Turkish government is determined to violate any international obligation, any international treaty, ignores the fact that it is a member of the UN, so I do not believe that diplomatic talks will be able to achieve a positive conclusion.

An unnecessary, harmful project that goes against the principles, the standards that the European Union professes. The European Union itself, even through the Structural Funds, has financed this work. People have been denouncing it for years, but Europe pretends not to see. Europe is not just blind, for us it is complicit. It is complicit in a scam against citizens, because TAP costs tens of billions and does not serve the European Union, it does not serve Italy. Building the TAP won't do the good to revive the economy, to get out of the crisis. Does the TAP have a useful life of at least 30 years and, given the energy transition in place, in ten or twenty years will we still need so much gas? The data says no, they tell us that the pipeline serves to emancipate the European Union and Italy from supplies from other countries, some at high risk such as Libya. Too bad that even the TAP, which will land in Puglia, passes for nations that could give some concern: Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey. About Azerbaijan, we forgot about the inquiry into what happened at the Council of Europe by buying and selling votes to stop Azerbaijan's motion to condemn, which would have prevented the EIB funding? We forgot about the journalistic inquiry that reveals an entanglement of managers in mob odors, cases of cash, Russian oligarchs, Italian businessmen linked to politics, anonymous safes with the license plate off shore? Doesn't all this deserve a modicum of attention from Brussels? The truth is that building the TAP is a mega bargain, into which investment funds, banks and insurance are ready to dive, as long as the risks are covered by governments, the European Commission or by financial institutions such as the EIB, i.e. taxpayers' money. TAP is unsustainable too environmentally. I would remind the Commission that the grasslands of Posidonia are nursery to species of commercial interest, they are essential for safeguarding the marine and coastal environment and for artisanal fishing. I remember that, over the last fifty years, Posidonia has recorded a 10% regression due to, among other things, alteration of the sedimentary regime, the laying of submarine cables and gas pipelines. Not surprisingly, the port is between two SIC areas. On the one hand, the European Union spends resources through LIFE projects to protect our sea and, on the other, lends its side to econveniences such as TAP that destroy the marine environment. It is no coincidence, as I wrote to the Commissioner, whom I thank for his presence, the Italian Minister of the Environment has advocated for the verification of compliance with eleven requirements for the implementation of the pipeline, subtracting them from local authorities, including the Region. Therefore, we ask to know whether this decision violates Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the environmental impact of certain public and private projects. The EIA on the TAP was released on the basis of a feasibility study and not an executive project. Ministerial authorisations were granted in the face of TAP's self-certification, sometimes partial and modified in itinere. Kind of like EFSA's studies on glyphosate, just to understand it. Is the TAP safe? Remember the incident in Austria? On the receiving terminal of TAP, Professor Ghezzi of the Politecnico di Milano has had extremely significant risks, explosions and fires, risks also ascertained by the Puglia Region and that call in case the Seveso Directive. On this, too, we want clear answers from the European Union. The TAP also violates citizens' rights and the rule of law. The TAP yard in Melendugno is a Far West, where the law of the fittest applies, at the expense of the rights of citizens and public authorities. Even the City policemen had to wait almost an hour before they could access the construction site, where they only wanted to verify the regularity and legitimacy of ongoing work. We are before the militarization of San Foca. Peaceful protests by citizens and neighboring municipalities were muted by police. In conclusion, we ask Brussels for an assessment study on the environmental, economic and social consequences of the pipeline, to speak on the protests of the inhabitants of Melendugno and the municipalities concerned, because the rule of law must be respected, because in the European Union we want the law of multinational corporations cannot be used at the expense of citizens' rights, because our sea must be respected, because TAP must be stopped.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2018-02-08.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, today’s debate is a good opportunity to recall the importance of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline as a key infrastructure project for European Union energy security and the internal energy market, and how it fits into the broader European Union picture. Let me start with a few words to put this project into its full context. Gas remains today a significant source of energy in the European Union, accounting for 22% of the Union energy mix. At the same time, Europe is increasingly dependent on imports of gas. The Union currently imports 70% of the gas it consumes; and, in 2016, 42% of these imports came from a single supplier. Our domestic production is declining at a faster pace than our gas demand, thus our import dependency for gas is expected to further increase, to more than 83% by 2040. For that reason, the European Union has been pursuing a study of diversification of gas supply sources and routes. This diversification strategy has three key dimensions: first, the opening of the Southern Gas Corridor to bring gas from the Caspian region and the Middle East directly to Europe; second, benefitting from the developing global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market; and, third, developing a liquid-gas hub in the Mediterranean region. I want to thank the European Parliament in this context for the support it has lent the Commission in our efforts to make gas supplies for our Member States more diversified and more secure, notably by supporting our LNG strategy and helping us achieve an ambitious compromise on the Security of Gas Supply Regulation. In this context, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) is a key element of this strategy to promote diversified supply and competitive markets. It will provide a key link to the Southern Gas Corridor and the resources of the Caspian region for Italy and south-east Europe. For Italy, this additional supply source is particularly important, given that the sale of gas in its energy mix, at 35%, and its substantial dependence – 90% – are both above the EU average. I would also remind you that Italy was the Member State that lost the most, in terms of GDP growth, from the gas cut-offs we saw in 2006 and 2009. TAP will also be crucial in terms of lessening dependence on a single supplier in south-east Europe, creating a gas hub in the region and integrating this market with the rest of the European Union. We expect the TAP project to improve Europe’s energy security and lead to a more competitive market. This will ultimately benefit consumers, who will pay lower prices. Let me now turn to the question raised about the potential environmental impact. A high level of environmental protection is, of course, of the highest priority for the Commission. First, I note that the necessary environmental and social impact assessments have been carried out for this project, and these included a list of conditions to be fulfilled before the construction phase, during the construction phase and in the operational phase itself. These assessments also include an appropriate impact assessment as defined by the European Union’s Habitats Directive, to exclude significant effects from the project. And I would point out that the pipeline does not fall into the offshore area protected by the Natura 2000 network. Lastly, let me confirm to you that the Commission is in contact with the authorities to ensure that the project is carried out in line with the necessary standards and that all necessary measures will be taken to protect nature in the region. I look forward to a good exchange about this project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2018-02-08.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, while the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) is an ambitious and game—changing project that can contribute to the EU’s efforts in decarbonising the economy and introducing environment friendly energy supply, it faces several criticisms, and not without reason. The Trans-Adriatic Pipeline has so far encountered more obstacles than approvals. At least two investigations have been conducted on it, one about connections between the TAP project and Italian organised-crime groups and offshore capital, and the other about a tacit political and economic arrangement between Erdoğan, Aliyev and Russian oligarchic groups. Certainly these are issues that have to be addressed by their national governments. However, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline is a project we need. It will facilitate gas supply not only to Italy, Bulgaria and Croatia but also to several Western Balkan countries, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. In the context of the current Western Balkan enlargement strategy, that has a specific value. TAP will create a stronger bond between this region and the EU and consequently improve our energy harmonisation. In addition, multiple opportunities will appear for the transport of Caspian natural gas to some of the largest European markets, such as Germany, France and Austria. If we are bound to build greater energy security in the EU, TAP will certainly make a great contribution – and, more than that, TAP means major economic development and job creation for all the countries concerned. However, while the TAP corridor is a strategic priority for the Italian economy and other partners, it represents a matter of concern to ordinary citizens. Why? Tourism activities represent a big share of income on the Adriatic shore, and environmental security in this regard is a matter of great importance. Such preoccupations have also frequently been raised by the authorities of Puglia, who are very concerned about the conservation of their olive groves. In Puglia they call olive oil the ‘green gold’ because it is the wealth of their region. Digging up their olive trees may compromise local livelihoods. Around 2 000 olive trees have to be removed and transplanted to make way for the pipeline, and the criticism raised by the head of the region, Michele Emiliano, is perfectly understandable. So how can we be sure that the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline is in the interests of the private citizens who are actually paying for its construction? How can we guarantee that such large—scale projects are implemented with due democratic accountability to our citizens, and with thorough consultation with local authorities? The answer lies in democratic guarantees that the contracting governments have to give their citizens. We cannot apply the ‘business as usual’ tactic and present the project to the people as an accomplished fact. In this specific case, a lack of preliminary consultation has brought about delays in the project’s implementation because no substantial compromise had previously been reached. To tell the truth, there was no significant attempt to reach such a compromise. When we have to deal with such important initiatives, the EU must take the lead in filling the democratic gap. Businesses are often not interested in asking the opinion of the families who will have to live beside their new installations. Citizens need the certainty that TAP does not carry any potentially high industrial risk, such as that of explosions. This is very important. Citizens need to be asked. I repeat this again and again because, in today’s Europe, where there is a desire to promote democratic consultation and accountability, respect for sustainability and the harmonious life of households, we cannot afford to let business be done only among the big players, while ordinary people stand looking on, without a say. That it is why it is very important to discuss this issue –very important even for my small country, among the Baltic states, Latvia. That is why we are discussing it here in Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2018-02-08.json", "name": "Urszula KRUPA", "mepid": "28334", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — The Trans-Adriatic Gas Pipeline, as the final fragment of the so-called Southern Gas Corridor, plays a role in the political and business plans of Western Europe, particularly Germany and Russia. However, no less important is the environmental aspect that is raised by Italian citizens, because the gas pipeline is also seismically active through the area. Tectonically, an area of alpine folding in Abruzzo, Sicily, is rated by environmental specialists as the greatest environmental threat. Earthquakes could lead to the continuity of the pipeline being interrupted, beyond the possible energy-terrorism threat. In the case of such investment, a public consultation should be carried out, which provides for the Aarhus Convention and disputes between the local community and the authorities responsible for investment should be decided using the tools provided for in the Convention. Personally, I very much regret that such social activity was not demonstrated by citizens of the Baltic countries, allowing the Nord Stream gas pipeline to be carried out at the bottom of the sea with a huge risk of environmental catastrophe of the Baltic, which may be caused by the debris of chemical weapons sunk after world wars in shipwrecks and containers. Maybe the Baltic has a huge sensitivity to pollution due to the limited exchange of waters with the North Sea, where the circulation through the narrow Danish straits is the reason that the total exchange of Baltic waters for ocean takes 25 to 35 years.

And that's where we need to help anyone who really sincerely wants to support major projects important to the European Union, but at the same time we must approach the citizens in this way and show our solidarity with them. And that's why I want to solidarity with my colleague from Puglie, Italy, as I know that as with us in Croatia there are similar problems. The LNG terminal that wants to be made on the island of Krk, that terminal which will be financed by the European Commission, with the money we approve here in the European Parliament, has serious problems in its performance. The intent of the technology that wants to be imposed now is something that is completely unacceptable. The principle of partnership with the local community is not respected by anyone here. We know that we have this principle in the European Union. Here, here I have a conclusion of the County Assembly of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County in which it is clear that they are for the construction of LNG terminals on the island of Krk, but they are not for a floating terminal, especially not for floating with the technology offered now. So if we already have a partner who is willing to suffer and accept one LNG terminal, so let's make it so that it is environmentally friendly and acceptable for everyone who wants that terminal. Of course I'm talking about the need to spend a little more money because we need to make a terminal on land rather than floating, especially not the one that is now imagined with technology to eat maybe Kvarner shrimp full of chlorine. Well, I guess that's not our goal. I guess our goal is not to destroy tourism, I guess our goal is not to destroy the undersea and marine organisms in Kvarner. So what I want to stand for on this occasion is: let's do what is best for people and for their lives because the second decision we have, the conclusion from the Municipality of Omišalj which also speaks about accepting the land terminal, but not the same as proposed. And why do we give money for something that citizens don't want? And there is no partnership with these citizens. So, I want to say that apart from this location we know very well that in the northern Adriatic we have opportunities and other locations that are even better than that land terminal on Krk. We have at Urinj already, so to speak, a devastated space, in Plomin there is also a devastated space and it would be much better to find another location.

The TAP project, it was said, is part of the Southern Gas Corridor, the so-called South pipeline, which for 3 500 kilometers is expected to bring Azerbaijan's gas all the way to Italy. The total cost of the work is estimated at 45 billion dollars, with the aim of reducing energy dependence on Russia. This is what the Commissioner reminded us a little earlier. What the Commissioner did not remind us, or failed to remind us, is that these resources will be thrown in the first place in the meal to companies that are part of the TANAP consortium, which are enthused in the events of corruption, so much so that journalistic investigations call the TAP the “mafiodotto”. The European Investment Bank has recently granted a public loan, one of the most impressive in history, of EUR 1.5 billion. It is a scandal on which we will not fail to question the Commission further. There is a lack of serious environmental impact assessment of the work. There is a lack of assessment of emissions and losses, there is a lack of assessment on the compatibility of the work with the intentions enshrined in COP23. Just over two hours ago we voted on a European Parliament resolution testifying to the concern about human rights in Turkey. We go exactly to forge business with Erdogan's government, not to mention the situation in Azerbaijan. But I would like to mention here some European citizens and citizens, who are the Apulian citizens and citizens, whose opinion seems not to count in the determination of this decision. I don't know if the Commissioner was in Melendugno, San Foca, one of the most beautiful coastal areas of Puglia and the Adriatic Sea. I don't know if he could see olive trees cut down for the shipbuilding of TAP, as well as for the unconscious management of the xylella issue. I don't know if it knows of a militarized land, the complaints, police charges against citizens demonstrating against the TAP. I do not know if he knows of a total absence of involvement of the local people and the Apulia Region. I don't know if he knows that they're not yet visible, that they're hidden, the cards that authorized shipbuilding. Of all this I hope that the Commissioner can respond and realise that the TAP must be stopped.

However, Southeast Europe uses more coal than gas for energy, with coal having an even greater impact on climate change in the long term. Indeed, the ideal for the whole of Europe and the world is renewable energy supply, but this ideal is still in progress. I believe that the supply of Italy and Southern Europe with gas and, implicitly, ensuring energy security must not and will not slow down the development of renewable energies. Until the ideal of full renewable energy supply is achieved, gas remains a viable variant. Moreover, this project has the potential to strengthen cooperation between European Union member countries, such as Greece, and European Union aspirant countries such as Albania. This project can also improve the energy infrastructure of the entire region, not just the states that the pipeline will go through, thus bringing economic benefits to these countries and regions. For Albania, for example, the construction and housing of the pipeline can facilitate European integration by increasing economic stability and geostrategic importance of this country. The construction of the pipeline also comes with benefits for local communities, through hiring, acquisitions and fees that will be paid to the states concerned. We politicians are at the service of citizens and we must represent their interests both now and in the future. Local authorities need to talk to citizens, not impose themselves forcibly. He must seek to understand and explain his actions in an objective, clear and understandable way. They need to communicate with people and make their communities partners for a safer and prosperous future. Europe now has links with gas supply to Russia, Africa and the Sea The North. Adding a new source and route reduces the risk of becoming dependent, experiencing energy crises as happened in 2009 and, last but not least, the risk of becoming subject to prices and interests of some. Europe therefore needs an alternative to gas supply, but it also needs open and efficient dialogue with citizens. I encourage the continuation of the project, thanks to the prospects for the energy independence of the South and - why not? - of the whole of Europe.

While I completely agree that there is a huge need to move towards a system that is primarily based on renewable energy – and I strongly welcome Parliament’s opting for ambition last month when it backed our proposal for a 35% target for renewable energy – this is a more complex issue that I feel is often overly simplified. First of all, as Commissioner Arias Cañete pointed out, security of supply is of crucial importance, particularly in our eastern Member States which have at various times in recent years actually experienced gas shortages. At the moment we still have a lot of dependency on gas, both for heating and for electricity generation. We have an obligation to push our ambitions on renewables and climate change. There is no doubt about this, but there is equally an obligation to ensure supply security to our citizens, many of whom have real concerns in this regard. At the moment, diversifying gas supply is our most effective method of doing so in many regions. Secondly, the transition to renewables is moving quickly, particularly in recent years, but it is still a gradual process. Fossil fuels, preferably gas rather than coal or oil, and biomass will be needed to provide the base-load generation that balances our energy system to ensure the cost effectiveness and feasibility of integrating more and more renewables. I have been at the centre of calls for increased investment, under the ninth Framework Programme for research and innovation (FP9), in the development and improvement of balancing and storage technologies that we hope will be able to replace fossil fuels in time for this purpose. But again, this will take time. Regarding the wider debate on the inclusion of certain projects on the list of projects of common interest (PCIs), that seems to have inspired this afternoon’s debate: yes, the PCI list includes certain fossil projects, but these are of strategic interest to the European Union. They are about ensuring supply security with interconnectors, pipelines and terminals for liquid natural gas (LNG). They are about helping to improve the functioning of our markets and moving towards a single European internal market for gas and electricity. And perhaps most importantly, they are about helping to ensure affordability of energy for the consumer. So, all in all, I think that this project is worthwhile. We have to take on board concerns, but at the same time security of supply is of crucial importance and projects that secure supply for our citizens must not be disregarded.

As I said in my introductory remarks, the Commission sees the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) as an important project not only for Italy but also for south-east Europe and the European Union as a whole, because it will bring significant energy security and diversification of gas supply sources. It also has the potential to stimulate investment, to create jobs and improve their quality and ultimately to reduce energy prices to the consumer. I would like to comment in reply to some of the reflections, particularly from Ms D’Amato, who raised many topics and I will try to address some of them. My first comment is related to respect for human rights in countries which supply energy to the European Union. The Southern Gas Corridor, beyond its energy dimension, also serves as a unique platform for engagement with Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. Mutual interdependence in relation to the Southern Gas Corridor project thus contributes to security and to a dialogue that aims to secure positive developments, in line with the core values of the European Union, including human dignity, freedom of democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. And pursuing our economic interests will not compromise the defence of our values. In our experience, the most reliable and effective way to promote them in a sovereign partner country is through dialogue and constructive engagement. In this spirit, on 7 February 2017, the European Union launched negotiations on a new agreement with Azerbaijan that will replace the 1996 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. There was a comment about the possible effect on climate change and the impact vis-à-vis the Paris Agreement. I would say that the TAP and the Southern Gas Corridor will not, per se, increase gas-related greenhouse gas emissions because this is an alternative source of gas and it is not intended to serve demand growth. The objective is to diversify sources in order to increase energy security. In fact, it is very likely to reduce the carbon footprint of the units of gas arriving in the European Union because the entire corridor will consist of brand new, state-of-the-art pipeline infrastructures, which are inevitably less leakage-prone than those built in the 1970s. Many of you referred to the environmental impact the project may have. The environmental impact assessment for the TAP started in 2012. It was improved through the Environmental Impact Assessment Decree issued by the Italian Minister for the Environment in September 2014, with 65 conditions to be fulfilled during the pre-construction, construction and operational phases of the project. Subsequently, in May 2015, the Italian Minister of the Economy issued development consent for the TAP. It is clear that there were legislation changes in the area of environmental impact assessment in Italy, and the powers to approve some verification-of-compliance conditions were given back to central government. Ms D’Amato asked the Commission some questions, which have been answered in a letter from Commissioner Vella, raising the issue of whether the decision to give to central government the power to approve this verification of compliance would violate three environmental directives. The answer from the Commission was that the arrangements for the transposition of European Union law at regional level, and the delegation of institutional responsibility for fulfilling requirements designated through acts of national or regional transposition, are the responsibility of Member States; and it was concluded that, in the specific case raised by the honourable Member, no infringement of European law could be identified.  In the Commission’s view, there has been a commitment from the TAP project promoters to avoid any environmental or negative social impact. Some 20 landfall points along the Apulian coastline were studied, from Brindisi to Tronto, in order to identify the one, at San Foca, with the least environmental impact. A state of the art micro-tunnel was used for the landing point, passing more than 10 metres below the beach. So there will be no impact on the shoreline, and this technology will avoid interference with protected sea and land habitats and, at the same time, will render the pipeline invisible. Also, the width of the pipeline has been reduced. Care has been taken in respect of sustainable water management: the pipeline has been buried 1.5 metres below agriculture land to ensure that farmers can continue using their land, and olive trees will be relocated. They will be stored temporarily until they can be replanted. We also understand that the TAP project promoters are implementing social and environmental investment projects in communities along the route. These projects are being implemented to promote sustainable development, and in full consultation and cooperation with communities along the pipeline route. In Italy, the focus has been on livelihoods, tourism, agriculture and fisheries, and community services and infrastructure. Project funding has been raised from small-scale grants, local community initiatives and regional development partnerships. There were some comments on whether the pipelines had to be assessed according to the Seveso Directives. The so-called Seveso III Directive on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances does not apply to the transport of dangerous substances in pipelines, as this would typically be regulated by other relevant legislation. There was another question on whether there would be Russian gas in this pipeline. I can tell you, honourable Members, that there will not be Russian gas in the TAP when it comes into operation in 2020 and opens up the Southern Gas Corridor. With an initial capacity of 10 billion cubic metres, it will be transporting gas only from the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan, and no other gas can be transported as part of this initial capacity as that would be in violation of the exemption decision that TAP received from the national energy regulatory authorities. If the capacity is doubled, there will be provision for additional use of capacity in a non-discriminatory manner. Finally, the Commission was asked whether it envisaged carrying out an impact assessment of the project’s economic and social consequences. The Commission does not envisage carrying out such an assessment for a specific projects. Such assessments are the responsibility of project promoters, and the promoters of the TAP carried out very extensive assessments of environmental social impacts for all the countries it crosses – Greece, Albania and Italy. The complete dossiers on these environmental and social impact assessment are publicly available on the TAP website. The Commission understands that very high-quality environmental and social impact assessments were also requested by the international financial institutions approached by the TAP project promoters for the project financing. These assessments were recently positively approved by the European Investment Bank due-diligence team when the loan application from the promoters of the TAP project was proposed to the EIB Board of Directors, and agreed on 6 February. But the usefulness of the TAP has been scrutinised by the Commission. The Commission, together with other members of the regional groups established under the TEN-E Regulation in the context of the projects of common interest (PCI) process, assessed the TAP contribution to energy policy objectives, such as security of supply, market integration, promotion of competition and sustainability. The assessment was done on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis carried out on TAP’s behalf and the main results are available on the TAP website. In this context, the TAP was positively assessed as contributing to energy policy, and it was therefore included in the list of projects of common interest (PCI list) initially in 2013, and subsequently in 2015 and 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2018-02-08.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": " The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2018-02-08.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": " Before I close, I wish you a good journey home.
