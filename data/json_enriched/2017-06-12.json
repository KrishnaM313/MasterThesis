This is the first legal partnership under Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which deals with partnerships between public bodies, focuses on a specific geographical area, that of the Mediterranean, and includes the participation of neighboring countries of the European Union. A total of nineteen countries, eleven Member States, three associated countries and five third countries are jointly participating in Horizon 2020, an initiative with a Community contribution of € 220 million and an equal contribution from participants. With a ten-year implementation horizon, PRIMA aims to promote a fuller integration into the scientific, managerial and economic level of the Mediterranean countries in the fields of agricultural, food and water management systems. More specifically, the general purpose of PRIMA is to implement a joint program for the development and adoption of innovative and integrated solutions to improve the efficiency, safety, protection and sustainability of agri-food systems and water supply and management. of the Mediterranean region. The overall aim is therefore fully in line with the recently adopted United Nations goals and the European Union's forthcoming strategy for sustainable development. The overall objective of PRIMA is to contribute to the sustainable and inclusive economic development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, with the specific objective of coordinating, strengthening, enlarging and aligning the current fragmented national research and innovation programs in the field of agri-food systems and water supply and management, as part of a multifactorial, multidimensional and integrated approach. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that military intervention, armed conflict, political instability, climate change, unsustainable resource management and rapid population growth are the most critical factors contributing to migration. Access to water, food and sanitation services are of the highest political, social and economic importance in the region and are key and interrelated challenges in this area. For this reason, PRIMA is, by definition, one of the rare European Union diplomacy efforts that can also help tackle the forced expatriation of Mediterranean residents. Both personally, as rapporteur, and my fellow shadow rapporteurs, we have tried in extremely suffocating timeframes to help improve a good original text with amendments, which mainly focused on the following issues: PRIMA's exclusive focus on political and non-political respect for fundamental rights, the recognition of the human right to access safe and clean drinking water and basic sanitation. Responding to the demands of the citizens of the region, contributing to the improvement of the efficiency, safety, protection and sustainability of the agri-food systems and the integrated supply and management of water. To support all types of research and innovation activities to promote projects of a wide range of technological readiness and to ensure a proper balance between small and large projects. Enhancing fair and balanced geographical cooperation in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. To prevent the external participation of external and internal smugglers, by setting specific conditions and sufficient commitments. In strengthening the open character for all countries that want to participate and in ensuring transparent governance, management and implementation. Ladies and gentlemen, opening the debate, I would like to point out that the joint effort between the institutions - the Commission, the Council - and in particular the Maltese Presidency, which has set PRIMA as its first priority in the field of research and innovation, but also of the political groups, has evolved into an excellent atmosphere of cooperation which has made it possible to find the best possible compromises for the timely completion of the process and for that I thank them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Sofia SAKORAFA", "mepid": "125091", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, dear rapporteur Sofia Sakorafa, I am delighted to be in the European Parliament today on the eve of the vote on PRIMA. Our modern concept of Northern and Southern Mediterranean is an artificial distinction. Proximity to this sea creates a shared heritage, and with that comes shared challenges; and science and innovation must be the tools to tackle those challenges. PRIMA is recognisably the greatest achievement to date in Euro-Med collaboration in research and innovation. It is also an excellent example of successful cooperation between the European institutions. This cooperation would not have been possible without the personal commitment of Ms Sakorafa, and the tireless efforts of the Maltese Presidency and the hard work of the negotiation teams are a testament of this cooperation. So I want to seize this opportunity, as Ms Sakorafa just did, to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Ms Sofia Sakorafa, but also everyone involved in this work and this amazing team that put all the institutions working together. Today, during this debate, we need to keep in mind three things about PRIMA: the what, the why and the how. First, the what. PRIMA will seek to ensure two of people’s most basic needs today: food and water. Why is this an issue for us? It is an issue because it is the biggest issue that we have in front of us as people, as human beings. Without food and water we cannot make it. But if you look at the Mediterranean region, with 180 million people that are considered ‘water-stressed’, this water stress was brought on by changing climate patterns, but also by unsustainable resource management and demographic changes. Water availability, and thus agricultural production, is of strategic importance for the whole Mediterranean Sea. It means the livelihoods of rural and urban populations, and it means territorial development. Water shortages have a negative impact on crop yields, so access also means the health and well-being of the population. We have to acknowledge that these issues are the root causes of migration, both within and beyond borders. How do we solve these issues? I think that part of that answer is exactly PRIMA. These challenges are border blind and are often too big to be addressed by a single country. So no effort can be spared to identify novel approaches to ensure water availability. Right now there is an insufficient level of research and innovation and investment in the region. This means a lack of innovative solutions that are adapted to the Mediterranean region’s geographical needs and that are easily transferable. But we have to put in the means, we have to put in the resources. So PRIMA will fill this critical gap. It will bundle know-how and resources to encourage long-term research and innovation cooperation between the Mediterranean countries, from the North to the South. Ladies and gentlemen, I am personally invested in seeing this unique initiative succeed. I count on you, honourable Members of Parliament, to seize this historic opportunity, and to help shape the future of the Mediterranean basin by adopting the PRIMA initiative in tomorrow’s vote. The Mediterranean region has a shared history. As the great Croatian writer Predrag Matvejević once said, and I quote: ‘Being Mediterranean entails more than history or geography, tradition or memory, birth right or belief. The Mediterranean is a destiny’.

I would like to congratulate the Commission on having presented this proposal for a Decision on the PRIMA partnership for the Mediterranean region, in which several Member States participate. The PRIMA initiative is of great importance, not only because of its scientific and technological interest, but because it can become an essential instrument to try to solve two of the most serious problems in the Mediterranean basin. One is water and the other, as a consequence, food production. We must also highlight the fact that countries from both shores of the Mediterranean are going to participate financially and technologically, and this implies ties of union that go beyond the merely technological. On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that it has a European added value, since it contributes to the fact that many bilateral or unilateral actions that are being carried out in this area are carried out in a joint and coordinated manner. In my opinion, the agreement adopted is ambitious and coherent at the same time, since PRIMA will support research and innovation activities at different levels, guaranteeing the right balance between large projects and small projects. The negotiation with the Council and the Commission has substantially improved the proposal in aspects such as, for example, that the initiative is open to as many countries as possible, but always on an equal footing with the Member States that have already made an effort to participate. financially. It will clearly delineate the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, so that there are no eligible countries on both shores. And by Lastly, on the issue of guarantees, it has been very positive that the Commission has accepted to present a statement that clarifies that the guarantees provided by the participating States must be sufficient to cover the funds provided by the European Union, while avoiding that they areexcessive.The object is none other than to encourage participation, so I ask for a vote in favor of this agreement tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Patrizia TOIA", "mepid": "28340", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a high expectation with regard to PRIMA which we absolutely cannot disappoint.

We must show that we are able to reconcile an intuition, a good idea, with the ability to realize the same idea. Why so many expectations? It does not escape anyone that this project is taking place in a strategic area, but also very problematic for the European Union. Expectations because, by placing water resources and their management and effects on food systems at the center of research, this project, this research platform, is concretely expected to contribute to addressing some of the greatest challenges we have in the Mediterranean: that of climate change, that of food security and that of migration. Finally, a great expectation because it is a very significant form of partnership. It can also be emblematic for the future. It puts European countries and non-European countries, in this case African, on the same level, calling them to have equal competences, but also to a very precise assumption of responsibility. I think that this figure, this way of going hand in hand between competences and responsibilities, we will always have to assume, for what are all cooperation actions.

In particular, the partnership under discussion in the fields of research and innovation, PRIMA, could under strict terms and conditions contribute to the sustainable development of the region, access to food and water. This requires a focus on agri-food systems and water management. It requires increased resources on the part of the European Union, but they are not available. In addition, countries that support jihadists, such as Turkey, need to be excluded from PRIMA funding. Also, Greece as a contracting country, due to the dire economic situation and the poverty created by the memoranda, must be exempted from the relevant national contributions.

But I think that the outcome is a positive one, it is something that we can build on. Yes, it is public-public, but that has a spillover effect as we say that it has to be close to the market.

Worse, some of our environmental commitments promoting the use of biofuels will worsen the restrictions on access to water and lead us to a difficult trade-off between food and energy self-sufficiency. To be clear, therefore, Europe is not immune to a water shortage. As for the southern shores of the Mediterranean, they are caught between a demographic explosion, rampant urbanization and global warming. Almost three quarters of the population of the Arab-Muslim world, especially the Mediterranean, lives with less than 1,000 m3 of water annually, which is the threshold of scarcity. It is therefore obvious that food self-sufficiency is threatened there, since agriculture captures between 60 and 80% of water resources. For Europe, this situation heralds unprecedented waves of migration. At a time when certain states are investing massively in future technologies for the management of water resources, Europe cannot lag behind in global innovation.

A program like this is an excellent program. However, it can be further improved in its governance. Firstly, the Commission proposes that the financial contribution be mainly applied to activities of high technological maturity, in the form of a limited number of pilot projects. It is important to go further: encompass diversity of ideas and projects, low and high technology preparation levels, include curiosity-oriented forms of research and practice-based research. Second, under the program, participation in PRIMA is open to any Member State and any country associated with Horizon 2020, as well as to third countries. And very well! However, the selection of projects must be made by a consortium of States that contribute to the PRIMA budget.

PRIMA is an opportunity to deepen the construction of a research and development diplomacy between the two shores of the Mediterranean, which are among the most exposed to the effects of climate change and which should deepen the exchange of experiences and knowledge in the development of mechanisms for optimizing the use of resources as scarce as water and thus also guaranteeing food security. And it is that today water poverty, defined as the condition of not having access to enough water or of adequate quality to satisfy basic personal needs, affects approximately 180 million people in the Mediterranean area. For this reason, this association, which brings together eleven countries of the Union and eight third countries, emerged from the Conference on Research and Innovation held in Barcelona in April 2012, must be established without delay. The debate we have today is the conclusion of Parliament's work on the PRIMA and shows us the interest and urgency of taking this initiative forward. We must remember that in many areas and hydrographic basins the pressure on water resources has only increased both due to the demand of the population and the increase in irrigated areas, putting at risk some local artisan economies, as well as areas of special environmental Protection. Therefore, the development of the PRIMA initiative must have a holistic approach, which addresses both the efficiency of the irrigated areas of crops and urban pipelines as well as the protection of natural areas, wetlands and areas of special protection, always in accordance with European legislation, and especially in compliance with and compliance with the Water Framework Directive.We must, therefore, have a quick procedure so that the entry into operation of the association is as fast as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation of social and political turmoil in the Mediterranean basin leads us to reflect on the great economic and social challenges currently taking place.

If you talk about water or if you talk about food, there is just one way that we can do it and that is together and what I saw here today in Parliament was exactly that: we are together thinking about how we can increase our food production in the future for the more than two billion people on planet Earth by 2050. What we talked about today was also how we can have water for everybody. I started my career as a very young civil engineer in precisely this field of water and at that time, in 1993, the drinkable water that we had per person in the world was three times higher than it is today. We have to solve this, we have to create a technology, we have to have the innovation that will change for the better and that is something that we will do together. Ms Pilar Ayuso said it: this project goes beyond technology, it creates ties for the future, it creates bridges and I think, Madam, that you have a point. Ms Toia talked about a project of equals which is, I think, exactly what we want with PRIMA, on this project: a project of equals in between all the countries with the same rights as partners and peers.  Mr Zorrinho and Mr Telička talked about difficulties that we had at the beginning but that we were able to overcome those difficulties to arrive at something that really makes sense. I thank you for that because I think that it took the effort, it took the capacity of us sitting around the table all together, but we arrived at a conclusion that is really better than what we had before. We have here a better proposal and we have here a better solution and that is fantastic for all of us. Mr Gambús talked also about the environmental angle of these problems, which are definitely part of our ability to solve it or not.  So I want to thank everybody – the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur – who were able to do something really very unique and which represents also for me, personally, one of the really unique moments of these two years and a half: to achieve with you, all together, PRIMA.

The phenomenon of migration, due to the situation in the region, has such dimensions that such initiatives are certainly necessary, but they are a drop in the ocean compared to the size of the problem. It is our duty to support a long-term integrated, coordinated and anthropocentric strategy and a common immigration policy, a policy that will address the root causes of the European Union, of course, in the face of the fearful and ineffective model of a Europe behind , fences and barbed wire. A common policy based on the principles of genuine solidarity and a fair distribution of responsibilities will guarantee respect for human rights and respect for the spirit and letter of international treaties. I therefore call on you to vote in favor of the report because the smooth and rapid completion of our work will allow the Union actions and the conclusion of international agreements with as many countries as necessary to be completed on time.

The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable regions. We already have restricted and fragile natural resources and any changes will have devastating effects on our people. Climate change will inevitably lead to people displacement and this in turn can result in the political destabilisation of regions and countries.

The PRIMA initiatives are coordinated by the EU, while the development of specific measures and their implementation is the task of the program-associated partner countries. In line with the priorities of Horizon 2020, the general and overarching objective of PRIMA is to build research and innovation capacities, and to develop know-how and joint innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture and food systems and integrated water management in the Mediterranean.

I want to thank the collaborative atmosphere between all the political groups, because the importance of this report requires a consensus, especially with a view to the next Ninth Framework Program. In the first place, it must be known - as you recognize - that Horizon 2020 is the largest publicly funded research program in the world, whose challenge is to respond to the social and economic challenges of society, so its evaluation cannot be further to begin by recognizing your success and your opportunity. A program that was born under the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, especially conditioned by the situation of economic crisis and deindustrialization in Europe, which gave an important role to innovation, the improvement of competitiveness, the strengthening of SMEs. All this from excellence as a priority, which has allowed a leverage effect of one euro out of eleven. However, the rapid and profound changes that European society is facing - such as populism, xenophobia, terrorism, migratory flows, social health and technological challenges, etc. - confer a new paradigm to which we must respond and which we must include. Science must serve to achieve a knowledge society at the service of citizens' interest, a sustainable and inclusive society in which the scientific community and industry are means to achieve the ultimate goal of a science for and by society. In short, to respond to these social challenges. However - and this is the first thing that must be highlighted - it is necessary to reinforce the commitment of all European Union actors to research and innovation. The European Union invested in 2015 an average of 2.03% of its GDP in R&D, with a variation between 0.48% and 3.26%, very far from the 3% that we set in the Europe 2020 Strategy and far from the 4% that some of the most competitive countries in research and technology in the world have already surpassed. These data highlight this disparity and the need - and this is the first call - for Member States and regions to make a greater effort in R&D. Second, an adequate program budget is necessary. We need at least € 120 billion to respond and accommodate all the excellence that has not been accommodated in just the 14% of projects that have received program funding. Excellence, of course, has to remain at the center of evaluation. But we need more excellent centers. A more excellent Europe also needs excellent centers and, therefore, under-represented regions need to achieve greater participation. Also the social and human sciences have to be taken into account and, of course, a better definition of the impact criterion is needed. In order to address the gaps between the regions, in addition to budgets, we have, among other measures, to improve and make synergies a reality. To do this, the role of R&D must be strengthened, but the regulations on State aid must also be reviewed, the regulations of the Structural Funds must be harmonized with the Horizon 2020 itself and the Member States comply with the principle of additionality between money. Social challenges: we continue to defend that Parliament must have a special voice to define and guide them in the next framework program. We need the social and human sciences to be better integrated, as well as to have adequate financial resources. We need the recognition and introduction of research and entrepreneurial capacities from the earliest stages, with a reinforcement of the role of young researchers, a fair return of the public, as well such as greater effort in open science, the separation of defense from the research program and a greater effort on the part of the industry ... - I finish, Mr. President -, greater investment on the part of the industry, involvement in open access and, above all, added value of your projects.And, finally, greater participation in gender issues to achieve the objectives that we have set for ourselves in Horizon 2020 itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "Once again, I would like to ask you to keep your speech discipline.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address Parliament today, and I would like to build on the excellent cooperation between our two institutions, and thank you for the continuous and strong support for policy initiatives in research and innovation. Today, what we are discussing here is a crucial report for all of us, and I would like to congratulate Ms Cabezón Ruíz and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. The report includes many recommendations for further improving Horizon 2020, but not only that, for further improving the future and the future programme of research and innovation in the future cycle that we are having and that we will have in 2020. So as you know, we are already addressing a lot of these points, the points raised in the report, but I think that it is exactly because we are raising these that we have to take action, like simplification, or EU added value, or excellence and many more that we will address during the next two years and that will be streamlined through this idea of the European Innovation Council.  This report will be a crucial input for the preparation of that future FP9, and we have been preparing in the Commission our own interim evaluation over the last month, and it has been a long, challenging and exciting process and it is not over yet. So next October we will publish a Communication on the interim evaluation with the political conclusions from all this work. It will also include a reaction to the recommendations of the High-Level Group, chaired by Pascal Lamy, on how to maximise the impact of our next framework programme.  So today, I want to share with you some of the key findings from the interim evaluation reflected in this report. The interim evaluation shows that Horizon 2020 is performing well, is highly relevant for stakeholders and is on track with delivering its objectives. So putting research and innovation in one single programme has produced great results. More than half of the participants in Horizon 2020 are newcomers to the programme and we had a 65% increase in applications per year when we compared it to FP7.  However, this has led to a serious under-funding problem. Today we can only fund one out of four of the many high-quality proposals received. Just before coming here, I did the calculations. What does this mean? It means that more than EUR 60 billion in additional funds would have been needed to fund all these exceptional projects.  I am therefore very heartened by your support for allocating more funding to the EU’s research and innovation. We know that 83% of the funded projects would not have gone ahead without EU funding. This shows that the framework programme is value-added, is EU added value: there is no question about it, because those 83% of projects would not have been a reality if the programme was not there.  The EU supports projects that produce patents of greater commercial value, and research teams that receive EU support grow faster and attract more international researchers than their peers. The programme is also on track to meet its knowledge creation objectives. The excellence of our scientific publication is world-class, and they are cited more than twice the world average.  So based on the interim evaluation, we have learned some really important lessons that I want to share with you. Firstly, it is clear that much more needs to be done in value creation, in supporting market creation innovation in Europe. Secondly, while stronger than FP7, there is room to strengthen the involvement of civil society in Horizon 2020. We have to create and involve end-users, involve citizens to co-design and implement our programme. Thirdly, we need to communicate better, to explain the results better. To show people what we do, and that we support the future of all of us through these projects, in a way that people in the street understand. It is also an area where you can help by spreading information about the results and impact of research and innovation and Horizon 2020 in your constituencies. On 3 July, Pascal Lamy will present a report by his High-Level Group with recommendations on how to maximise the impact of using investments in research and innovation.  Having read the Parliament position, I wanted to share my observations: the complexity, the low-success rate, the decrease in international cooperation and the need for better feed-back to applicants, just to mention a few. These concerns are yours and are mine. We share with you these concerns, we keep a close eye on these issues and envisage the specific measures to address them in the future. Your report also paid special attention to ensuring better synergy between research and innovation in other areas, like Structural Funds in higher education. We have to do more and I count on your support for that. I took note of your concern regarding the balance between research and innovation and I think it is not ‘either or’, it is both. We have to have both. You notice also the issues and differences in rates of participation among different Member States and again, we have to do more with your help.  I am sure that you will find many of our observations in the interim evaluation interesting, and I am ready to continue our dialogue with you. The interim evaluation provides a solid basis for the future. I count on your support. I count on your suggestions. I hope you count on me.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I think we are talking about key issues - research, development, higher education.I am glad that in the gallery we have representatives of the young generation who listen to this - this is largely addressed to you.I greet especially the group of students and youth from Lublin and the regions invited by MP Piotrowski.Congratulations to the MP, congratulations to the participants.Just please do not clap because it is not allowed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Nils TORVALDS", "mepid": "114268", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Mr President!

The natural question that then arises is: is there any extra value with this tour? Or is it just a transactional document that consumes more resources than anything extra?

In addition, a good research and innovation strategy for smart specialization must be central: a so-called RIS3 in order to be able to build ecosystems at a regional level. Horizon 2020 is particularly successful, but due to the lack of financial resources many promising projects unfortunately die a silent death.

Commissioner! We will already be divorced from Great Britain in the 9th Framework Program. Great Britain, whose best universities and scientists significantly strengthen global, but above all European science, in the 9th Framework Program will only support us on the basis of a third country. This presents us with the challenge of ensuring that science and innovations in other European Union countries can cope with global competition better than ever before. The evaluation of the implementation of Horizon 2020 indicates that three conditions must be met for this. First of all, more funds from the European Union and national budgets. We are therefore calling for an ambitious budget for the post-2020 framework program: as much as EUR 120 billion. But the challenges facing the Union are enormous - these are very dynamic challenges, from the migration crisis to the economic crisis, demography, health, space and climate challenges. We cannot predict many today, but science will have to keep up with them and we must provide it with the tools and resources to do so. We expect that the list of these challenges in the framework program will be verified and continuously adapted to the actual needs. We also call on the Member States to fulfill their commitments of spending 3% of GDP on research and development. Structural funds or grants from framework programs cannot be used to fill holes in national budgets. Second, the new governance of science should serve less bureaucracy and more effects. Grants must remain the most important source of research funding. Loans and other financial instruments are complementary. The portfolio of the new European Innovation Council should help to better support market innovation, to disseminate joint research for science and business, to cover the valley of death, and to strengthen joint ventures that are already clearly successful today. We also need better integration in management and financing science, for example by efficiently combining funds from the next framework program with structural funds, so that no euro spent on research and development is wasted. We can not afford it. New innovative solutions should significantly strengthen Europe's competitiveness, create jobs, but above all support the most innovative industry, and thus the well-being of Europeans. However, we cannot forget about pure science, even if we find its applications only years later. Third, there is a need for new quality for new times. In the resolution, we emphasize the need to open up the framework programs more widely to those countries and regions of the Union that today account for a negligible share of them. If we want to build a real European Research Area, not a paper mock it up, we need to reach the potential of the whole of Europe and ensure that no real scientific talent is wasted. Therefore, the most important funding criterion should remain scientific excellence and integrity, and not the routine and habits of the academic and industrial community. Scientific power can only be built if we risk funding any groundbreaking, unimaginative project, no matter in which country or region, or in which institution it was established.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I am very sorry but this is a 100% time-out and I would like to ask you not to imitate it as I will be ruthless.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Patrizia TOIA", "mepid": "28340", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope he is equally generous to me. Dear Commissioner, you are managing Horizon, which is, I believe, one of the very few positive achievements of the last parliamentary term, alongside the 20-20-20 program for climate change. So, he has in his hands one of the few things I would save from the past five years. Today we all understood that Horizon is an example of success, but we also understood that it has important margins for improvement and we have a duty to cover these margins. We know - now I believe that we have all found a meeting point - that we must act on both directions, which we have sometimes opposed in the past. On the one hand, basic research and excellences - the ten years of the European Research Council have celebrated these excellences a little - and, on the other hand, the whole theme of technological innovation. From this point of view, the European Innovation Council that you are preparing is very important. It would be important that Parliament too could participate in all the working and reflection groups, which are working towards this goal, and the participation of SMEs, industry and the industrial sector is important, although it has not increased its shares. of research.

Research and innovation are essential for the prosperity of the European Union. It is therefore not surprising that Horizon 2020 is such a great success. The European Union shows that action in the field of research and innovation has clear added value. Unfortunately, the program is also a victim of its own success. We see that the success rate has plummeted due to over-registration. We are currently around 10%, which means that a number of very brilliant researchers are dropping out and not taking their chances. This in turn threatens us to miss crucial opportunities. That is why I would like to argue for more budget for the next framework program and for a stricter selection procedure in the two-step procedure. We have long debated the role of companies in the framework program. These companies are essential for a successful program: there the added value is created, there the research results are converted into economic added value. I therefore believe that we should review the rules of participation for the next Framework Program, with the aim of involving even more companies. Finally, I would like to say that I think the report puts the right emphasis on what is going well and badly in the program and has a correct vision for the next framework program.

It is therefore very important that we clearly state that Horizon 2020 is an enormous added value for the European Union and the Member States. Not only by freeing up additional resources, but above all by focusing on cross-border cooperation. These cross-pollinations are considered very important by all participants and, together with the excellence criterion, form the core of this program. If we then look at Framework Program 9, these are the elements that must absolutely be preserved. I have always opposed this research program being treated as a kind of cohesion fund. We must recognize that there is a problem with the EU-13 uptake of funds, but those Member States must invest in good training and infrastructure. This is of course a precondition for being able to conduct excellent research and obtain European funds. That is why I also think it is important that we look at further deepening synergies with the Structural Funds. There is already an R & amp; D aspect to this, but that could be further developed to close the gap between the EU-13 and the EU-15. Industry participation is also very important. This fund should not only finance basic research or solve scientific issues. We also need to give it concrete applications and bring them to the market. This balance is very important. We have to deal with this in a balanced way and divide the focus sufficiently between the high and low TRL scales. We must also recognize that industry plays a vital role in the realization and implementation of innovation. It often also benefits SMEs, which thrive under the wings of these large companies.

There are many important things that have happened in the last few years and I believe that from the good news of the European Union, Horizon 2020 is probably the best. There aren't that many more that we can hold on to. However, where there were cuts, it was also in Horizon 2020. Therefore, it is important to reinforce investment. What we have seen in recent years cannot happen. Is that every time you need money for something, whatever it is, where do you get it? Horizon 2020. We come here to the plenary and say that it is very important to invest in research; next, we need money for something else and what do we say? Let's get money for the investigation. It can not be. To articulate research and innovation, we really need to have public and quality investment. There is no other option. Likewise, we cannot sacrifice research, because we will never seriously innovate if we kill basic research, quality research, and therefore we must continue to bet. We cannot treat researchers badly, we have to give them work with rights: to those who have been working for a long time, and to young researchers who need a guarantee of the future. We need to have more equality between men and women and we need to invest more in small and medium-sized businesses.

Its almost one hundred billion euros allow to promote research and innovation for researchers, companies, technology centers and public entities throughout the continent. And to make this program even more efficient and fair, we need to continue to strengthen the role of women. Because today women still have obstacles to a scientific career. Some less visible, such as gender biases, which condition young women to choose their career. And others that are more visible, such as the wage gap or family care, which are mainly carried out by women. That is why it is so important to approve the Directive on maternity leave, which was adopted in 2010 and which the European Commission has withdrawn. When we speak of women and science, we also speak of inequality. Undoubtedly, Marie Curie could have accomplished much more if she had had, in her time, the support of French institutions. It is true that the Commission has taken positive steps, with good results. However, the target of 50% participation by women has only been exceeded in advisory groups. Their participation among project coordinators and in evaluation panels remains below the objectives, as does the gender dimension in the research contents. Therefore, we ask the Commission to be more ambitious and to maintain independent funding for gender equality initiatives in research and innovation and for structural change projects on gender.

It is important that, even in times of economic hardship, sufficient investment is made in research and science. It is worrying that, at present, only a few European Union Member States - Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Austria - spend more than 3% of their GDP on research and development, as the target has been set. It is important that all Member States are encouraged to take this path. Horizon 2020 is the most important program for us at European level to promote research and innovation. We know that the most important thing now is to ensure that we continue to have sufficient resources for the program, and I warmly recommend that we increase funding for the program.

I will start with the words of Jerzy Buzek, who said: this is not expenditure, it is an investment in our future. The big challenge we have ahead is how to go round the countries and convince the governments that this is not expenditure, this is an investment and a priority for our future. If we do not do that, we will not thrive, we will not get to where we want to be. When you look today at the number of publications we have in Europe, you see that with 7% of the population we have more than 33% of the entire number of publications and articles. If you compare that with the year 2000, you see a very interesting phenomenon – that we have surpassed the United States in highly cited publications. That represents a huge opportunity for the future if we continue to invest in that future. I think it was Mr Torvalds who talked about the importance of added value. This year when Ben Feringa, of the Netherlands, received the Nobel Prize he said something that I think we have to keep in mind – that the only place in the world today where we still believe in the intuition of scientists is Europe. It is because we believed in the intuition of Ben Feringa that he was able to invent something, to create something, that will change life for future generations, and that is why he won the Nobel Prize. In the space of 10 years, the European Research Council has been able to support researchers who have won six Nobel Prizes, four Fields Medals and five Wolf Prizes. That is the added value that we all recognise, and I am very happy that, right across the House, every one of you recognises that. All of you raised the point of investment. How can we increase this investment? Ms Matias, Mr Buzek, Mr Telička, Mr van Miltenburg, Ms Kudrycka, Ms Van Bossuyt – all are asking for more, because we need more! As I said, just to keep on funding the very, very good projects we would need another EUR 60 billion, because we are funding just one out of four of the very good ones. I am with you and I thank you for being so up-front with the amounts you think would be the right ones for the future. I thank you so much. Then there was Ms Matias and Mr Marcellesi, who raised a point that is paramount for me, about gender and gender balance. I think we have been, somehow, an example. We have to improve, but it shows each time I meet with my advisory panels and I see that we have surpassed the 50% mark for women on those panels. We now have 53% on those advisory panels. It has increased from 33% in 1997, so here we are leading by example. A lot of scientists who are women and who come before those panels tell me they feel better when they see that there is gender balance in the room: there is a different energy and it produces different results. On the expert panels, we are not doing so well. We had a target, as you know, of 40% and unfortunately we are still at 37%. We have not achieved that target but we will fight for it. If you compare the results with those of the past, we are doing better. Is it enough in terms of gender? No, we are not doing enough. I want to do more and I hope that you can help me on that. Then we talked here about vision, and you repeated three words that for me are crucial: the word ‘excellence’, the word ‘openness’ and the word ‘impact’. I think it was Mr Zorrinho who said that excellence is when openness crosses impact, and that is exactly it. We need to be at that juncture. For the future we have to achieve the ability of looking at this programme in terms of a triangle. One axis is between the excellence that we need – because we need to be at the top, and for that we scale, speed and everybody working together – and then openness, because that, today, is our political statement. Openness is not just something that is natural for us, who love science. We know that there is no science without openness, there is no innovation without openness, there is no programme without being open to the world. Today it has become a political statement, and an important one. That is our difference, because we want to be open. The third factor is impact. Impact matters not just in commercial terms – the impact we know, the impact of the product – but also in terms of the impact of everything we do in fundamental research.

Balance between all parties and all interests as a key and challenge that I think we have managed to capture in this report. Consensus as a basis for the credibility and trust that the scientific community needs and, subsequently, as a consequence, the progress of European society. Research as an engine of economic and social development, as excellence, but also cohesion. Adequate budget for projects with high European added value for society: let us guarantee a fair return on investment so that science reaches each and every European citizen. Gender and youth: this will need to be reinforced in the next framework program. If we want an excellent Europe, we need all its excellent regions, all the young people and, for this, it is necessary to start the entrepreneurial and research culture from the earliest ages and have all the potential and all the intelligence. For this reason, women have to be better reflected in the Horizon 2020 research program. We propose as a tiebreaker a study that determines which are the barriers that prevent it and, above all, that we also promote a framework in the Member States that allows to bring out the entire fabric of researchers with high-quality projects. But I want to end as I started, recognizing the potential and importance of this program, an enormously positive program and key to the future of Europe. Therefore, I think that the message that we have to have and that we have to end with is one of reinforcement and recognition of their success.

Let me tell you about a man from Franconia: Franz-Josef, 50 years old, physically disabled and unemployed for more than 20 years. Since last year he has been working as a commercial employee in a company near Nuremberg. The ESF made this possible. 20 long-term unemployed in the region have found a new job through the ESF. Why am I telling you this? The European Structural Funds make a lot possible. You are close to people and can actually make life worth living again. They create jobs, they help to cope with climate change, invest in research, build infrastructures and carry out cross-border projects. The structural funds are an engine for jobs and sustainable growth. We actually have to keep this engine running! The discussion about this has started. And I confess: I am worried. There are voices who want to reduce cohesion policy, and even want to abolish it. I can only strongly warn against that. Structural policy is not just a growth engine. It is also an expression of lived solidarity. Europe, this abstract being in Brussels, in Strasbourg, can actually be experienced and experienced locally through the structural funds. We can't let that ruin us! That is why I drafted this report together with the shadow rapporteurs. I believe that it is indeed a good report that presents reality and the value of cohesion policy in particular, but which at the same time puts its finger in the wound. Because of course there is a need for improvement. It starts with the bureaucracy. It cannot be that potential applicants are literally slain by forms and forms and then give up in exasperation and decide not to apply at all. Nor can it be that the administrative authorities suffer from constant fear of making some mistake and then being pilloried. We need a simplification of the rules. And we need more flexible rules. We and the regions must be able to respond to new challenges. Perhaps completely new challenges will be facing us in 2024, which we will also face and have to overcome with European structural funds. That is why we are calling for simple reprogramming in the report. To conclude, let me say something about tomorrow's vote. As I have already mentioned, the future of the structural funds is indeed at stake. I would like Parliament to send a clear, strong signal here in favor of maintaining cohesion policy. At the same time, our colleagues from REGI in particular know that there are two points of contention in the committee where our groups have very, very different views. One concerns macro-conditionality and the other the so-called “golden rule”. There will be amendments on both subjects tomorrow. I understand the wishes of the Greens as well as those of parts of my own group who are against macro-conditionality but do not want to mention it in the report. But I also know that macro conditionality has supporters in this House who even want to strengthen it. Dear colleagues, I therefore ask you very, very warmly: Let us fight this fight later! Let us send a strong signal tomorrow, to the Member States, to the Commission: We, the European Parliament, want a modern, financially strong, less bureaucratic cohesion policy. We want a cohesion policy for all regions, and we want a cohesion policy that is made for the people, with simpler procedures, with better results.

The visibility of European investments and the increased communication of results have become a concern at the level of the European Union institutions. The report proposal comes with concrete ideas and tools adapted to increase the communication on structural funds. At the end of March, the Commission presented concrete proposals to Member States' ministers in Luxembourg to increase the visibility of cohesion policy. At the same time, an action plan on the methods of communicating cohesion policy is being prepared. At the same time, the Maltese Presidency acknowledged the lack of visibility of cohesion policy and confirmed the agreement at Council level on ways in which Member States can more clearly demonstrate that this policy has a direct and positive impact on the lives of EU citizens. We started in this report from the fact that visibility in cohesion policy, as well as funding opportunities are a responsibility of local and regional authorities. These are the interface closest to the citizen, benefiting, as we all know, from a high degree of trust. On the other hand, although cohesion policy is financed with a budget of over € 350 billion, the positive effects are known to a low degree by citizens, and the obvious conclusion was that communication methods have not always been the most effective. . As I pointed out in the content of the proposal, only a third of those surveyed in the 2015 Eurobarometer, and I point out, only a third, have heard of projects funded by cohesion policy and the positive effect on their lives. In this context, better coordination between public authorities, the social and economic partners and civil society is therefore needed, in order to communicate effectively the objectives of the European Union, in order to increase citizens' interest in belonging to the common European project. Together with my colleagues in the REGI Committee, I insisted that the proposal for an Omnibus regulation include a mandatory percentage in the technical assistance dedicated to advertising, given that the percentage values ​​currently used are very low, in some countries almost non-existent. At the same time, we called for a stricter set of requirements for the advertising of EU-funded projects, as it has been shown that a simple billboard attesting to the presence of investments through European funds is not enough. At the same time, we drew attention to the need to clarify the regulatory framework for communication tools, as there are many cases where beneficiaries avoid accessing these tools due to the lack of coherence of existing legislation and, of course, the fear of sanctions. what can happen later. In the long run, achieving the set objectives can only be achieved with the involvement of all relevant partners in the decision-making process. There is a need to develop tools or platforms for animation, taking into account current methods of participatory governance, by involving citizens in a participatory budgeting process. Increasingly open access to information confirms that citizens want to be asked about the appropriateness of development projects at the local community level. Adapted tools are therefore needed, given the technological developments and increasing public access to current digital media. Not in the last In conclusion, Mr President, a new objective proposed in the report is to outsource the outcome of cohesion policy in the context of the future communication strategy.The Commission should adopt different communication strategies for net contributing and net beneficiary Member States respectively.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Iskra MIHAYLOVA", "mepid": "125128", "text": "rapporteur. - The recent series of earthquakes in Italy has had a devastating effect on the affected areas. But it's not just these natural disasters that are happening in Europe - fires in Portugal, floods in Romania, just a few hours ago an earthquake in western Turkey, which affected southern Bulgaria and part of Greece. Large-scale restoration work is needed to help the population, especially in the Italian regions, to live in decent conditions and to preserve the cultural heritage of the affected regions. In addition to the initial support offered by the European Union Solidarity Fund, additional amounts could be provided to Member States by the European Regional Development Fund for the reconstruction of regions affected by major natural disasters. In order to provide such additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, the general legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds needs to be amended. The European Commission has proposed to amend Article 120 of the Regulation on generally applicable provisions by introducing a separate priority axis for reconstruction projects supported by the European Regional Development Fund under operational programs. The Commission has proposed that the co-financing rate be up to 100% for these projects. Operations selected by the managing authorities will be financed under the priority axis only if they relate to rehabilitation activities in response to a major or regional natural disaster, as defined in Regulation 2012/2002 establishing the Solidarity Fund. The proposal has no budgetary implications, with the proposed activities remaining within the total amount allocated for the period 2014-2020, with the whole package remaining unchanged. The report I am presenting today supports the Commission's proposal as a focused and budget-neutral solution. He points out that the policy of Cohesion must adapt to new challenges and ensure a rapid response from all Member States whose regions are affected by major natural disasters. As a result of interinstitutional negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council reached a political agreement on the Commission's legislative proposal. This was followed with great support for the proposal in the Committee on Regional Development. In this regard, I propose to you an amendment to the Commission's legislative proposal, which includes, on the one hand, support through the European Regional Development Fund up to 95% co-financing under an operational program, but on the other hand retains the proposals in Parliament's initial report. a threshold of 5% on the national allocation of the European Regional Development Fund to the Member State concerned. The political agreement we have reached is an expression of our solidarity. It shows our understanding that we are all vulnerable, that a natural disaster is possible in any region, and that we should support each other in tackling these challenges by offering support to rehabilitate the affected areas. I would like to draw your attention in the context of today's debate on cohesion policy, that cohesion policy must adapt to new challenges.

As regards Ms Kerstin Westphal’s report on building blocks for a post-2020 EU cohesion policy, the Commission welcomes their valuable contribution to current reflections on the future of Europe and to the next multiannual financial framework. This is a very timely input, in particular in view of our Cohesion Forum at the end of June. The Commission shares most of the views of this report. In particular, we believe, as you believe, that cohesion policy is more necessary than ever. As all three rapporteurs have underlined here, the European Union is facing tough challenges, such as globalization, migration, which go beyond national borders, and this is where the European Union’s cohesion policy can make a difference. Cohesion policy, as Ms Westphal said, empowers thousands of stakeholders throughout the European Union to tap into each region’s potential and make the best of innovation and smart specialization, making sure that every EU region, no matter whether it is north, south, east or west, is better armed and resilient against globalization, making sure that every European Union citizen can have access to the same opportunities. So this policy works, but for the future it needs to strike a balance between change and stability, keeping what works, carefully assessing the costs and benefits of changes, providing the incentives for targeted structural reforms, to ease the link between investment, growth and jobs, enabling all funds to closely work together and exploiting to the greatest possible extent the potential for simplification. But I hope you all agree with me that this is not enough. Our policy delivers, but we also have to make sure that EU citizens are aware of that. There is a long tradition in communicating the cohesion policy but now we need to do even better. And that links me to the next report by Mr Buda but I shall not continue without once again thanking Ms Westphal, and also the shadow rapporteurs and all the team who worked on this report, for their efforts and their contributions. I shall now switch to my language because the rapporteur is Romanian. The European Commission also greatly appreciates Mr Buda's report on strengthening partner engagement and the visibility of European Structural and Investment Funds. Like you, all our studies, as you pointed out, all our studies show that a lot of people are not yet informed about what the European Union is doing for them, despite the long-term investment of all schools. of hospitals and jobs created. And, I said once again, we come from the same region, I only discovered by running for the position of European parliamentarian that in Cluj-Napoca the tram lines are sponsored by European funds. I think we need to make a collective effort. Also, in Sofia, last week, we expanded the metro line and I don't think that many citizens in Sofia know that they already benefit and go with the metro in Sofia co-financed in proportion of 95% of European funds. So I think we need to make a bigger effort. We are in a situation, I might say, sometimes dramatic. Despite these investments, we know very well that this cohesion policy is more under attack than ever. This is no secret to anyone. That is why I am glad that we have this report, I am glad that we have agreed on the need to increase communication on European funds and what these European funds do for the daily lives of citizens. As you have shown, we are all concerned about the lack of visibility of cohesion policy. You asked for this Today, together with Commissioner Thyssen, we set out to join forces with the Member States and strengthen our investment profile. This was also the message I sent last week to the Informal Ministerial Council in Malta in the presence of all ministers in the 28 Member States. Communication on cohesion policy is a common responsibility, so it should be a joint effort. The European Commission cannot be the only one to act in this regard. You know very well that in any country I go, I visit as many projects as I can as a person, but the Member States, the Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, local and regional authorities, civil society should also contribute. And I know a lot of you do that. I believe that we need to tell, to share the success stories of the millions of small and medium-sized enterprises that have benefited in the last ten years from aid from European funds. We should talk more about entrepreneurs whose dreams are finally coming true, about mothers who can finally find work thanks to European funds, thanks to the new opportunities offered by the labor market. In fact, I think I should mention some promising initiatives that have already been launched, such as the German success story brochure or the \"Let stars shine, engage in citizens, in the EU\" communication plan, let the stars shine. , involving citizens on the present and future of the European Union, drafted by nine Members of Parliament led by Mr Lambert van Nistelrooij. But I count on your support and ideas to ensure that this policy will be good news for 500 million Europeans. I have taken note of your proposals. I want you to know that even in the operational programs they existed money for communication. I think it would not be useless to see how this money, intended for communication, was spent for each operational program, especially for large programs. As you said, I think we need more clarity, more transparency, to see what communication means, what advertising means and of course here we have to rely a lot on the support of our colleagues in the media, who should help us. with the publication of these success stories. Finally, concerning natural disasters, I would like to warmly thank this House and Madam Chair Iskra Mihaylova for your efforts to reach a swift agreement on natural disasters despite the difficulties. So now we will be able to help the Member States cover from the Structural Funds 95% of all the damage caused by natural disasters. As we speak, there is an earthquake in Greece. Last year it was Italy, and we expressed our sympathy for the people in Italy. Now, we have an earthquake in the Aegean Sea in Greece, in Chios and Lesbos, Aegean islands which I will visit as from tomorrow. Especially in this time of crisis: they are all hit by the migrant crisis, and now we have this earthquake. My sympathies go to the people of Greece especially, today. As I said, this dossier has an important political significance. We wanted from the very beginning to send a clear political signal that Europe cares about its citizens and that it is willing and able to provide help quickly. As I said, yesterday it was Italy, today it is Greece, tomorrow it could be Sweden or other countries. Therefore, it was important to urgently conclude an agreement and I believe that, under these circumstances, the compromise reached is reasonable.

Mr. Chairman! The debate in the European Parliament on the future of cohesion policy takes place at a very important moment. Firstly, the European Parliament has started work on the future financial perspective and we are very closely following what is happening in the Commission and we are looking forward to the reflection paper that the Commissioner and Commissioner Oettinger are preparing at the end of June. We are very interested in what will appear in this document that will have an impact on future actions. At the same time, several governments important in Europe have spoken about cohesion policy, and this is also closely followed by Parliament. The lessons from Malta are extremely important to us, because the work in Malta has indeed attempted to translate the scenarios for the future for cohesion policy. This is the first attempt of this type to show what are the tangible consequences of individual solutions concerning the European Union. The discussion on the future of the European Union is actually a discussion today about the European Union in general, what the European Union is to be, what its policies are to be, how it is supposed to function. The question of the very shape of the cohesion policy is partly fundamental, partly technical, because on the one hand we know well that cohesion policy is the key to the European Union, and on the other hand we know that, for example, no changes can be made in the next perspective, what the Commissioner said, because the delays in this perspective are so long that we cannot afford to reinvent new methods and new solutions. Today, the most important thing for us is simplification, simplification, and for us the most important thing is to answer the question what, from today's perspective of the cohesion policy, should be strengthened and extended, and this is actually the key to the whole matter and it will be an argument for maintaining this policy in future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Claude ROLIN", "mepid": "125107", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner, only 34% of Europeans say they have heard of projects co-financed by the European Union to improve their region, the region in which they live. However, these projects are numerous. They are essential for regional and social cohesion and they have an important role in reducing disparities. It is essential to give more visibility to these projects, because they are the concrete image of the action of the European Union. It is and remains important to communicate on the European added value of the projects which are financed. As rapporteur on this dossier for Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I underline the effects of these projects in terms of job creation and social integration. It is also important to reduce the administrative burden, without reducing controls, in order to allow easier access for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular those located in rural areas.

The report on the components of cohesion policy post-2020 is intended to be the European Parliament's contribution to the discussion on its future priorities. I consider it extremely important that we have a clear and common position. There is no doubt that the cohesion policy is one of the pillars of the European Union and, as a unique tool on a global scale, is a brand and an EU trademark in our cities and regions. It was thanks to it that the effects of the crisis were mitigated and now investments are being stimulated again. That is why we want to strongly communicate: the cohesion policy after 2020 must retain its important place in the EU budget, constituting at least the same part of it as in the current financial perspective, as it is beneficial for the entire EU economy. Obviously, although the cohesion policy is doing its job well, it is important to keep working on maximizing its potential. Hence the important proposals for further procedural simplification and, above all, and, I always emphasize, greater flexibility, so that it can better react to unforeseen events, and that local and regional authorities have the opportunity to freely adapt it to local priorities and realities.

So it is a huge achievement but we managed to get a common position in Parliament and then a compromise agreement with the Council. Now, of course, it is important that the money goes to Italy as soon as possible, so the people there can benefit from these Structural Funds.  I also wanted to say a few words on the future of cohesion policy. I want to thank the rapporteur for her report and the Commissioner for her excellent words.

We were much stronger in those negotiations because we were united and therefore we also need to be united in our position on the future of cohesion policy. If we are united and speak with one voice it will be much more difficult for others to ignore us.  I would say that, at this stage, we should not be talking about detailing too much. Detail can come much later, because at the moment there is so much on which we can agree with, we need to agree an adequate budget cohesion policy, that all regions should get something, that there should be more for poorer Member States.

The key role of cohesion policy is precisely to ensure a similar starting position for all, despite the different historical circumstances in which the current Member States have developed. The goal is to create a Europe of equal opportunities on the principle of solidarity, and we must not give up on that. Cohesion policy must be preserved despite political crises such as Brexit, it must be free of administrative barriers and simplified as much as possible.

After all, they put the European strategy of growth and sustainability into practice. Whether that strategy is called Europe 2020 or soon Europe 2030, Brexit may mean that cohesion policy will have to do it after 2020 with fewer resources. This also means that we have to focus even more on results in cohesion policy. Therefore, a strong link should be established with necessary structural reforms in the lagging countries and regions, a link should be established with the follow-up of country-specific recommendations, with the care for good economic governance by establishing a balanced link between cohesion policy and the European Semester, while maintaining macroeconomic conditionality and respecting commitments from the Stability and Growth Pact. This is necessary for the ALDE group to be able to make a good return on the euros that we invest with cohesion policy. We also see the further development of cohesion policy after 2020 as an opportunity. An opportunity to add a stronger urban dimension. An opportunity to continue on the path of simplifying the funds.

Cohesion policy can change the livelihoods of millions of citizens in the European Union, create a better life for the many, not just the few – if it is done well. Cohesion policy can let this continent grow together much faster and closer than before, but it can also tear it apart and that’s why we need to make it better. First of all, we need to invest in the future. Big money, big business will not solve the problems that Europe is facing today. That is why we do not just need any investment but sensible investments to fight inequality, to create jobs, to revolutionise our energy systems and to create a sustainable economy. Secondly, we should not punish those who actually need our support the most. Sometimes in politics we hide behind technical terms to cover up problems and controversies. ‘Macroeconomic conditionality’ is one of those terms. Most Europeans probably don’t even know what this means and there are some politicians who actually don’t want them to know what it means, because they can have a devastating effect on their lives. It is very often punishing those countries who are in most need of European support. And anyway, why should a local NGO supporting long-term unemployed people pay for the possible mistakes that their government have been making. Macroeconomic conditionality is simply wrong, and this Parliament has been opposed to macroeconomic conditionality in the past and we should keep up this fight even if the Council and Commission are pushing us to change our position. Lastly, we need to gear up the fight against fraud and corruption. Cohesion policy is not only about economic and social affairs, it goes deeply into questions of rule of law. We cannot have Europeans losing trust in the whole system because of those who are undermining its credibility.

Citizens do not have the right perception of what Europe does for them, for the territory in which they live, as claimed by local administrations, regions. Victim of communication instrumental to the political game of populist movements, Europe is today unfortunately perceived as just a set of rules, limits, vetoes and bureaucracy that hinders the growth of the member states. Only a small part of the European population, for example, is familiar with cohesion policy. Many have heard of European funds, but few can describe what is being done with these funds.

Thank you very much for your contribution to our debate today and thank you very much for your support for the Cohesion Policy. I think these three reports came at a key moment for Europe and in particular for the Cohesion Policy. Discussions on the future will continue and intensify in the coming months. Ms Westphal’s report, together with the reflection paper on the social dimension, globalization and Europe, provide valuable food for thought. You know very well that we are working together, Mr Oettinger and I, on a reflection paper on the future of EU finances which will be presented at the end of this month. As was underlined here, I think we must, however, understand that the very best argument for strengthening this policy consists of actually making tangible progress on implementation. So we are working hand-in-hand with Member States to speed up the implementation on the ground because this year is of high political importance, it is not business as usual. It is very important to show that Member States are able to use this Cohesion Fund. There is no better argument for the future than a convincing present. It is our responsibility to do it. Make people aware of what the European project has brought them in 70 years of peace, how it has helped improve their daily lives. Of course much has been done so far but I am sure together we can still do better. Many ideas are now on the table, in particular those very helpful proposals by Mr Buda in his report about communication. The Commission is ready to do its part but it cannot do it alone. Please join forces with us and become ambassadors of the Cohesion Policy in your constituency. On natural disasters, I will say some words in Romanian. First of all, Mrs Spyraki, Mr Papadimoulis and Mr Marias, I have said from the beginning that I express my sympathy for the Greek people. I am aware of this natural disaster, earthquakes taking place in the Aegean Sea in recent days. I have changed the schedule: tomorrow I will be in Athens, the day after tomorrow I will visit Chios, Lesbos and the affected islands. You know very well that we in the European Commission have proposed 100% co-financing for natural disasters. I would like to thank Mrs Mihaylova, and I would like to thank the European Parliament for being, until the last moment, with the Commission's proposal. I don't understand and I can't understand why we can co-finance 100% small and medium enterprises, why we can co-finance 100% when it comes to jobs for young people, ius guarantees, and we can't finance 100% when it comes to people who lose everything. I have seen in Norcia people who have been in cars for months and months, I have seen burned houses in Madeira, I have seen in Cascia and not only and I will be, as I said, in the islands. It's very easy to sit in a room in Brussels and say I don't agree with 100% co-financing. Where will the Member States get the 5% that the Council has proposed if they do not have it in their budget? That would have meant solidarity. Ask the Member States that voted against the Parliament and Council proposal: what is behind this? We, the European Commission, have proposed 100% co-financing. If there is an earthquake in a member country tomorrow, let the foreign ministries that voted against come and give these co-financings, because we no longer have a budget for such a thing. With regard to the United Kingdom, I would like to make one point again: this cohesion policy exists due to pressure from Britain and Italy, which in ʼ75 closed their mines in Wales and pressured that they would not go to the Council of Italy in ʼ75. How many of the people in Wales in communication know that they now have jobs due to the creation of this ERDF, this Regional Development Fund? How many people in Cardiff know the subway is made from there? As in any Member State, it does not exist nor in the United Kingdom any region, no city that has not benefited from European funds.250 million euros at the University of Manchester, without any European Union flag.I am very sorry, but when it comes to the Friday Agreement, it was neither London, nor Dublin, nor Belfast, it was Brussels that brought these people together and built bridges and built companies and healed wounds that wewe have on the map of this continent.From this point of view, I want to thank you for everything and I assure you that I will be with this cohesion policy until the last moment, because I personally believe that it is the only dimension that keeps us together, the cement that keeps ustogether.This financial solidarity, of which you spoke so beautifully, Mr Novakov.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Kerstin WESTPHAL", "mepid": "96839", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mister President!

There are voices that say clearly and very clearly and very loudly: We will no longer need this kind of policy in the future and that there should no longer be the great solidarity within the European Union in the future. I may also take the opportunity to remind you that there is also the Commission's White Paper on the five scenarios. There is also a scenario that speaks of the dismantling of regional funding, of the dismantling of cohesion policy, and in the end perhaps even of abandoning this cohesion policy. And my request - or what I have in mind - is that tomorrow, indeed, a large, large majority votes for this cohesion policy, for our policy - for the people on the ground, so that we can focus on the essentials . Because that's what we want, as all the speakers have said again and again: We need to focus on the essentials. I really want the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal next year, because we need it because we have to work quickly here. And then, dear colleagues, we achieved exactly this goal that we need: We need a strong majority so that we are also able to negotiate. We have to decide on macroeconomic conditionality in a different place and at a different time. Now we need majorities, strong majorities, a large majority so that the European Parliament - and we are the ones who were directly elected - is actually heard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Daniel BUDA", "mepid": "125012", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for your interventions.

Of course, it is necessary to do what is necessary to make it more visible, and in this sense it is important to adapt the existing means of communication to technological developments and the diversification of communication channels, because, as you said, there are many stories. successful waiting to be told. It is necessary to involve the beneficiaries in the process of communicating these investments through European funds.

The catching-up of poorer member states will improve the EU's position in global competition, and strengthening social cohesion is the key to continuing European cooperation.

These problems pose a serious threat to the future of cohesion policy. In any case, when designing post-2020 cohesion policy, these causes must be identified and eliminated. According to a number of studies, one of the main reasons for elite corruption, which also influences the choice of development goals, can only be curbed by a profound reform of management and control mechanisms and an increase in national participation in programs. The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) to prosecute crimes against the EU's financial interests will help to curb corruption with EU funds in the Member States involved in setting up the European Public Prosecutor's Office.

We see that there are some stocks recovering in some parts of Europe and others that are reaching their maximum sustainable yield, and we continue to read that however in the Mediterranean around 90% of fish stocks are overfished and are therefore well beyond the maximum limit. sustainable yield. I must acknowledge - and I did it personally even a few days ago in New York at the United Nations Conference on Oceans - to Commissioner Vella who managed in the last year and a half to finally bring the focus of attention precisely to the Mediterranean, with a series of initiatives, and we are very happy with this. We started in Catania, where we finally discussed the situation in the Mediterranean between technicians, politicians and scientists. The inter-ministerial meetings continued and finally with the Malta declaration a few months ago and with the MedFish4Ever project, launched by the European Commission. We therefore thought that the European Parliament should also have its position and voice on this very important and heartfelt issue and on this rather complex situation, so we presented this own-initiative report and specifically asked for a open discussion here in plenary, because it is an issue that requires an effort of many people together and of many policies put together. The report was the fruit of very well coordinated work with the shadow rapporteurs and a fairly broad picture emerged. We tried to cover a bit of all the issues, making sure that there was a picture of the situation regarding fishing in the Mediterranean, which is different from any other basin. European both for the type of stock we have, and for the basin we have, which is shared with other non-European third countries, and also for the type of fishermen, given that 80% of Mediterranean fishermen are small fishermen with therefore boats less than 12 meters. We tried to paint a complete picture and then we also tried to give some ideas, proposals and solutions to try to deal with this situation. The points in the report are numerous, I will not remember them all. Whoever is in this House has seen the report and knows it well. I repeat only two or three concepts. We cannot think of a solution for the Mediterranean without involving third countries. For this reason, we really welcome the inter-ministerial meetings held by the European Commission with great satisfaction, because we insist on the same basin, we insist on the same stocks and third countries must work with us to try to make these stocks sustainable. There is no socio-economically sustainable fishery if there are no healthy stocks. So we need to achieve this balance. The situation is now very complicated and that is why the solutions are not unique, but there are several. We have also dealt with somewhat difficult issues such as illegal fishing, which is still very present especially in some states of the Mediterranean basin. We also talked about possible conservation measures, also addressing the issue of quotas, which seems to be a taboo in the Mediterranean, without proposing it and without even forgetting it, but only as something that is there and that could be useful. I look forward to hearing the comments from the Commission and colleagues and I believe that we have done a good job and that it is important that this report is voted on tomorrow in order to have Parliament's voice on this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Marco AFFRONTE", "mepid": "124797", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, dear rapporteur, honourable Members, we have been making tangible progress in our efforts to improve fisheries governance in the Mediterranean. In 2016 we launched the Catania Process and this highlights the urgency in addressing precarious situations for our fisheries. It also made clear the need to join efforts across the region and to set in motion a coherent plan of action for the next ten years.  I think Mr Affronte just said that we cannot think about the solution for the Mediterranean without the third countries, and I think that is really on—spot. To do this, we organised a ministerial conference in March in Valletta and during this the ministers from 13 countries around the Mediterranean signed the Malta MedFish4Ever Declaration. This is a declaration that stresses environmental sustainability, social cohesion and viable economic perspectives. We now have an action plan. This provides a clear set of objectives and targets, against which we can measure our progress. It addresses critical fisheries—related issues including data collection and scientific evaluation, the eco—system—based approaches in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and support for small—scale fisheries. The plan also deals with pollution and transport and their impact on fishing resources. Now, the plan is in place but we must translate our words into concrete actions at three levels: at EU level, at multilateral level and across EU and non—EU countries. At EU level we will continue to implement our Common Fisheries Policy. This will require progress on multiannual plans. The plans, like the small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic will mark the first test on how genuine our commitments are. We are also working on a plan for demersal fisheries in the western Mediterranean and we are cooperating with the Member States on new national measures, in particular in the Gulf of Lion and the Jabuka/Pomo pit. At a multilateral level we will strive to make further progress in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean at the plenary next October. This will include the adoption of a regional plan of action to fight illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. It will also involve the establishment of a pilot project of an international inspection scheme in the Straits of Sicily. Last, we must continue to ensure solidarity with non—EU Mediterranean countries. We will do this by supporting them in their structural reforms in fisheries, through the EU Neighbourhood funding instruments.  Our joint political partnership has the power to create a healthy environment, a thriving blue economy and a sustainable fishing sector in the Mediterranean. I am very pleased to see that the report by Mr Marco Affronte is going in that same direction. We would like to congratulate the European Parliament for this initiative.

First of all, also, I would like to recall the particular situation that exists in the Mediterranean. More than seventeen thousand marine species inhabit its waters and its coastline is shared by nineteen countries, which makes it necessary for it to continue to receive different treatment from the rest of the marine basins that are under the common fisheries policy, since third countries play a key role in the state of your resources. But it must be recognized that the situation of the populations is far from being the best. This is due to a number of factors, including overfishing, pollution or climate change. This situation forces us to have to take measures, but these have to be backed by tangible and reliable scientific data, something that, unfortunately, does not exist at the moment. Regarding quotas, these must continue to be exceptional measures and respected by all countries. Socio-economic aspects are other factors to take into account, including those related to recreational fishing. Artisanal fishing represents 80% of the fishing fleet and 60% of jobs, so any measure that is valued must take into account its impact, as well as the possible repercussions on many coastal populations dependent on artisanal fishing. since a bad decision can have reversible effects. Therefore, and to achieve a balance between the sustainability of the resources and the socio-economic aspects, the opinion and experience of the fishermen must be taken into account.

With its 17,000 species, the Mediterranean is a sea rich in biodiversity. It is therefore important that fisheries management policies have a multi-species and ecosystem approach, based on scientific research and data exchange. However, it is not enough. Local particularities need to be taken into account through the principle of regionalization which remains, in my opinion, the best tool and on which we are working, in the Committee on Fisheries, on a great many dossiers, starting with technical measures. To achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2020, it is necessary to work on several fronts, from safeguarding marine ecosystems to strengthening cooperation with third countries, also to combat illegal fishing, from greater involvement of fishermen in decision-making processes to investment in food education starting from schools, because a conscious consumer no longer eats fish but eats more fish. We must not limit ourselves to reducing the fishing effort, therefore, but we must act on all sectors with transversal policies. The Mediterranean is the sea in which maritime transport is greater than in all the seas of the world and it is therefore on this that we must work, on land urbanization and on waste at sea. In short, we have many arguments to develop in many commissions. If we talk about the Mediterranean, therefore, we cannot ignore artisanal fishing which represents 80% of the fleet. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed, including many women. And then we are not just talking about fishing, but we must also think about who sells the fish, who is a restaurateur, who works in processing, who produces and markets the equipment, and so on.

Last year, this House overwhelmingly adopted my report on innovation and diversification of small-scale coastal fishing in fishing-dependent areas. However, the Commission is still ignoring this House's appeal to amend the Mediterranean Regulation, the full implementation of which has significantly damaged Croatia's fishing sector and pushed thousands of families into a difficult situation. We cannot allow fishermen to accuse each other of who is to blame for this situation because we are moving away from a solution. That is why I join Rapporteur Affronte in calling for us to clearly define certain forms of fisheries and, on the basis of scientific research, assess their impact on the state of fish stocks and the environment in general.

Any measure taken on one side of the Mediterranean is doomed if there are no similar measures on the other side. On the contrary, the measures will be doubly effective if the fishermen feel that they are not discriminated against, if they feel that there is the same playing field for all. A multi-annual approach with technical measures adapted and adopted with the full participation of the sector I believe is the right approach. In my ongoing report on technical measures, I am arguing precisely for real regionalization. In the Mediterranean, the socioeconomic fabric is very fragile, made up mainly of artisanal and traditional fishermen who are also very respectful of the marine environment. These arts and techniques have to be preserved as part of the integrity and cultural heritage of the region and deserve special consideration and incentives.

Recovery plans are very important here, and the inclusion of recreational fishing is very important. Everything is protected, everywhere, whether they are seals, whether they are cormorants or whatever. But who actually protects the fisherman? That is always the central question when we go to events like this, where small-scale and artisanal fisheries, cutter and coastal fishermen then ask their questions: What future do we have? Today we have an interesting debate on cohesion policy - a solidarity policy that exists in the European Union, that is, the improvement of business infrastructure. Many things are also possible for fisheries: that the fleet can also be renewed in a certain way via the EMFF, that fishing ports are made more attractive again for tourism too. It is precisely this interaction that naturally plays an enormous role.

As for overfishing, of course, there are third countries, but there is also the Union. From this point of view, I believe it is time to put in place quotas for all species that scientific advice considers endangered. Today, only bluefin tuna and swordfish benefit from quotas. There is a contradiction between the heart of the common fisheries policy of 2013, focused on maximum sustainable yield, and the failure to draw conclusions for the quota allocation of species in the Mediterranean.

Second, it also implies a commitment to strengthening the position of fishermen in the value chain. It is unacceptable for fishermen to bring cents home and for large retailers to have large profit margins and for consumers to pay fortunes for the fish they consume.

The increase in maritime transport also interferes; also the urban situation of the coast and mining overexploitation. In other words, there are many activities, not only fishing, that are involved in the Mediterranean and in the serious situation. I agree that measures must be taken in the Mediterranean, but everything must be taken into account. We have talked about artisanal fishing, but do you know, Mr. Moedas, what the problem is? The problem is that, when applying a differential in artisanal fishing, the Member States do not. And when a quota system has to be applied, they make a standard system and give more to industrial fishing than to artisanal fishing, hence the concern about the quota system.

We must also see that, in addition to overfishing, the Mediterranean is threatened by a number of other factors, such as pollution, changes in coastline and habitats, and oil and gas extraction. It is clear from the above that, in addition to fishing, we must gradually give way to environmentally friendly and modernized marine and freshwater fish farming. For example, a significant part of fishponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 areas. These fish farms do not pose any threat to the natural values ​​of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is due to our closed system of fishponds that the unique wetland associations they have created or preserved are.

Between 2007 and 2013, the Seventh Framework Program managed a total of almost € 55 billion, representing around 3% of total R&D spending in Europe. During the seven-year duration of this program, more than 139,000 research proposals were submitted, from which 25,000 projects of the highest quality were selected and received funding. The main beneficiaries were mainly universities, research and technology organizations and small, medium and large enterprises. I would like to remind you that a total of almost 29,000 organizations from all over Europe took part in the framework program. The experts evaluated this program as successful and I am happy to join their opinion. Like them, I would like to emphasize that top-level scientific activity has been supported at both individual and institutional levels. We have succeeded in connecting small and medium-sized enterprises and in establishing strategic cooperation and developing innovations within industries. I would also like to highlight the support for the mobility of researchers in Europe, the promotion of investment in European research infrastructures, the building of a comprehensive network capable of addressing thematic challenges, thus strengthening the overall European Research Area. These are very specific projects, the contribution of which to society and the economy is not negligible. In the field of medicine, for example, there are new methods for detecting diabetes, cancer or Alzheimer's disease, portable detection tools, etc. In the field of informatics and communications, it is mainly the development of the Internet of Things or artificial intelligence. And I could continue in the field of energy, environmental protection, security or transport. But beware, of course, there is still room for improvement. When evaluating the effectiveness of the program, we found i many weaknesses, such as high administrative burdens, complex legal and financial regulations, too narrow a range of topics and challenges, insufficient emphasis on industry participation or insufficient communication. Both the public consultation with the beneficiaries and a number of audits pointed out that, unfortunately, the main source of error was incorrectly calculated personnel costs and ineligible direct and indirect costs. In this regard, however, I would like to thank the Commission and the Commissioner for the fact that most of these weaknesses have already been addressed in Horizon 2020, and intensive work is being done to eliminate further errors and systematic errors. Support for research and innovation is key to the future development of the European Union. That is why I would very much like to call on the Member States to make a special effort to meet the common goal of investing 3% of the Union's GDP in science, research and innovation. Only in this way will we be able to continue to achieve excellence in research and innovation and thus contribute to the Union's economic growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Inés AYALA SENDER", "mepid": "28292", "text": "Speaker. - Mr President, I would also like to express my gratitude to my colleague, Mrs Dlabajová, for the good cooperation that we have had in this report, which was precisely intended to anticipate possible problems arising in the evaluation of Horizon 2020 and in the preparation of the Ninth Framework Program for research and development. Because precisely we saw with great concern, from the Committee on Budgetary Control, that there was a recurring error rate and, furthermore, worryingly high, in which no one seemed to have an interest. Most of the years we encountered an error, identified by the Court of Auditors, of more than 5%, which, after many corrections and much negotiation, we were reducing, but also with a very important percentage of operations with errors that - as my colleague has rightly said - they mainly responded to reimbursement problems that the Court of Auditors has identified as one of the biggest problems. Also delays in deadlines and, above all, the feeling of a certain opacity due to redundancies, inconsistencies and some problems in relation to - possible or not - State aid linked to the issue of subsidies, apart from the outsourcing of agencies , which also generates, in that distance, on the other hand, greater problems in management. To say, then, that we have a lot of interest in that before 2020, at last, it is achieved, if so - and the commissioner will tell us today -, if possible, to finish not only the implementation of the previous one - that is, 7 PM - , but also its control, since we are already in full implementation of Horizon 2020 and preparing the new program.

Also, the calculation error that reaches 5% I think is a serious issue that should concern us.

I also take this opportunity to thank all the honourable Members for their continued interest in the field of research and innovation. We all agree on the crucial importance of research and innovation for European job creation, growth, competitiveness and in improving European citizens’ lives.  Your report concludes, and rightly so, that, I quote, ‘the Commission, overall, managed the FP7 cost effectively’ and I very much welcome this conclusion concerning the previous research programme and I take the opportunity to thank publicly my predecessor Máire Geoghegan-Quinn for her tremendous work in her tenure. Your report and all the independent evaluations of FP7 that we have undertaken clearly underline that European research funding is a crucial piece for the future of Europe, which leads to concrete outputs – Mrs Dlabajová just referred to some of those concrete outputs – and for a more competitive economy and better lives for our citizens.  But I also agree with you that the successor of FP7, Horizon 2020, has led to further improvements. We have now one single and simple set of rules that is much more appreciated and more accountable. Your report recognises this, and especially the simplifications that we have been introducing and the second wave of simplification that we will introduce because it is an ongoing process. We are on the right track but we need to do more. We need especially to look at new ideas for funding. This is part of the debate that we will have with the research and innovation community and with this Parliament over the next few years and I look forward to it.  Some of you, I think, raised the questions that are important for the future. Mr Novakov said, how are we going to link better business to science? He said he wants to see more Nobel Prizes. I would just remind you that the European Research Council has produced in ten years six Nobel Prizes, four Fields Medals and five Wolf Prizes. Then I think that when you look at the question of how we are going to work with the Structural Funds, that Mrs Šojdrová said it. We need to work more in widening and look at how we can do better with other countries, how to help them to go up the ladder of excellence.  But let us be honest: Europe still lags behind other places, behind its competitors in some areas, and we are collectively failing to reach the target of 3% of GDP invested in research and development. I really welcome the idea that Ms Inés Ayala Sender put forward of this pact for science with the regions, which is, I think, the way to approach it; how you can actually go region by region in Europe, help them with this pact for science, with investing more, and I think this is something that we should work on together and I count on you.  We cannot therefore rest on our laurels and what we did well. We have to keep working in many areas to ensure that research and innovation framework programmes are as effective as possible, and that research and innovation is supported and encouraged across Europe. This includes having a budget that is sufficient to meet those challenges and again I count on you in this Parliament to help with looking forward to that budget of the future that today is clearly insufficient for what we need for Europe, for jobs and for growth.  Your report also identifies a number of the challenges that we face in implementing a large programme and you know that I take these challenges seriously. A number of them have already been solved and I think Ms Dlabajová recognised that in her speech. Others need to be addressed in the future programme. Your report will provide a good basis for future consideration. Taking as a basis paragraph 13 in your report I will continue to strive for, and I quote, ‘optimal balance between the attractiveness of programmes to participants and the legitimate necessity of accountability and financial control.’  I think this balance is crucial and also answers the point made by Ms Inés Ayala Sender on the error rate, and I think too the point by another honourable Member, that we have to strike this balance between trust and accountability. How can we get this balance right so we have more innovation?  In conclusion, I am delighted that overall you concluded that the FP7 has been managed in a cost-effective manner, which is an encouragement to me and to my colleagues. FP7 has produced very good results and it has been a worthwhile investment of European money. Your report also shows that FP7 was not perfect. Horizon 2020 is in many respects a further improvement, but we should never stop working to improve our programmes.  Ms Dlabajová said several things, but one sticks in my mind: she said that sometimes the topics were too narrow – narrowly defined topics and I think that if you ask me what my dream is for the future, the first is to do what we do well, very well, and not touch it, but that we have to open up in science so we get the best of the best by not defining sometimes those topics as narrowly as you described in your words.  I think that we should not stop working for the benefit of researchers and innovators and for Europe as a whole, and all of you here can be assured that I will continue to work on this. So thank you very much for your attention.

The pension gap is the average difference between the pensions of men and women. In the European Union, it is 39%. This is of course an average, because there are countries with a gap of around 45%, and others where it is only 5%. We must realize that today's gap is a consequence of several decades of history of the functioning of women and men in the labor market. Whatever we decide today, we won't affect the present, but we can change the future. That is why in the Constance Le Grip report we talk about preventing a pension gap in the future. The pension gap is a consequence of differences in the course of the lifetime of women and men. Every discontinuation of work, every break for childbirth and childcare, every case of part-time work instead of full-time, delay in promotion, worse negotiated first salary lower the pension amount. The same applies to the wage gap or work in lower-paying sectors and in lower positions. All these features - part-time work, with breaks, with a lower salary - affect women more than men. Therefore, it is women who have a lower pension than men, especially women with children. This is an additional, embarrassing aspect to the story. Due to motherhood, women enter the labor market later than men, due to caring for their parents and grandchildren they leave the labor market earlier, they negotiate their first salary more carefully, they are promoted more slowly. Sometimes they stay outside the labor market for years. It is no accident that the highest employment rate for women in the EU is in the 40-50 age group. It is no coincidence that the employment rate of women over 65 in the EU is 8%. Ladies and gentlemen! The reasons why women earn lower pensions accumulate throughout their working lives. Hence, the pension gap is the best, most aggregate indicator of gender inequality - much more accurate and truer than the wage gap, because it covers a wider spectrum of time and causes as well as effects. Time to start using it. The 40% pension gap between women and men in the world's richest economy based on the values ​​of social justice is embarrassing. No wonder that politicians are outdoing each other in ideas on how to remedy this phenomenon. Unfortunately, not all ideas are good. The main reason for the retirement gap lies in the lower participation of women in the labor market, and shorter work for a lower salary. That is why we have to look for solutions in the labor market. The European Commission's proposal - the work-life balance package - addresses these needs. We write about this in the report. Women must have a chance to earn their pension, but this must not come at the expense of the family. Therefore, it is necessary to compensate for breaks in work resulting from the birth of a child by paying the state pension contributions for the time spent on maternity or parental leave. However, this action must be kept within a rational framework. One must look for an answer to the pension gap also in the pension system, but proposing, for example, a guaranteed retirement pension regardless of work history - as such proposals were made during the preparation of the report - must meet with opposition from politicians seeking effective and lasting solutions focused on the gender gap, and not in pensions as such. The presented report by Constance Le Grip is a balanced, rational proposal in which, according to experts' opinions, we combine the pension gap and potential solutions with the causes of this phenomenon. I appeal to all Members to support this rational line, as maintaining the status quo is unacceptable and the expert opinion makes it clear: the pension system is little responsible for women's low pensions. In order to close the pension gap, it is necessary to enable women on an equitable basis to earn a retirement in accordance with their professional career preparation and potential.We also need to constantly monitor the pension gap, for which we need properly collected data and appropriate indicators to adjust our policies and reduce the pension gap in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "José Inácio FARIA", "mepid": "125101", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, the Le Grip report has the enormous merit of giving visibility to the problem of disparity in the pensions of men and women in the European Union.

The fact that, on average, women's pensions in the European Union are 38% lower than those of men, in addition to obviously increasing the risk of poverty for older women, represents an accumulation of gender imbalances and inequalities. throughout active life. In addition to earning lower wages, it is women who see their professional trajectory and, therefore, the continuity of their contributions more often interrupted, either because they are the ones who have more responsibilities in the family or because they are the ones who do more work informal and precarious.

Women account for almost two-thirds of pensioners in the EU, and they receive pensions which are, on average, 38% lower than men. They make up the bulk of the pensioners who have small pensions. As a result, many women experience retirement under financial constraints and with an increased loss of independence, as some of you described. Older women are also far more likely than men to live alone and with limiting disabilities. This makes their lower pensions even less adequate. Simply put, older women in the EU are at higher risk of poverty and social exclusion then older men.  The Commission is glad to see that the European Parliament has taken up this major issue, and I would like to thank Ms Le Grip and Ms Kozłowska—Rajewicz for their hard work on this report. It rightly puts emphasis on how to improve women’s ability to build up pension entitlements. But, unfortunately, the gender gap in pensions is likely to persist as long as women continue to earn less and are more likely to interrupt their careers and to work part—time. These factors further reinforce the gap. We need decisive action to increase women’s participation on the labour market. We need to ensure that they are no longer obliged to choose between their family and their professional career. We also want to give fathers more opportunities to take on more family responsibilities. This is precisely the aim of the initiative to support work-life balance for parents and carers which the Commission adopted in April 2017. This package of legislative and non-legislative actions is one of the concrete initiatives, putting the principles of the pillar of social rights into action.  In addition, the Commission is committed to taking action against the root causes of the gender pay gap. Discrimination on the grounds of gender is still prevalent at work, so strong monitoring and enforcement of existing rights is more necessary than ever. We will continue to support stakeholders in their effort to break the glass ceiling, to combat segregation on the labour market, to improve women’s access to high—earning professions and to ensure that skills, efforts and responsibilities are recognised in all sectors. Action is needed to close gaps on the labour market, but it is equally important to guarantee decent pensions to current pensioners. We need to take into account the situation of older women who have already reached, or are nearing, retirement age.

For the overwhelming majority of colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was felt that this report was worth embracing – from the very first draft through to the final text – unequivocally, and irrespective of political affiliation, because we are deeply appalled at the UN Refugee Agency’s estimates that 135 million children under the age of five, across the South and South East Asia region, have not had their births registered and are at risk of becoming stateless. We are mindful that being a Rohingya, for instance, (the largest stateless ethnic group in the world) equals living literally in the shadows, as a non—person in the eyes of the authorities, unable to stay in, unable to move out, stripped of property rights and denied access to health, education and the right to start a business.  As a proud British Conservative, I uphold a rich tradition that champions the cause for the small state, both in number and regulatory functions. The raison d’être of the state, anywhere in the world, is to defend, protect and enforce the rule of law so that each and every individual is genuinely free. People of all ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds must have their unalienable rights protected, down to the last individual, because the smallest minority is the individual.  My thinking is influenced by Aristotle’s emphasis on the individual. Our prosperity in Europe is the result of the consciousness that no one should be above the law. It was the Magna Carta, in the early 13th Century, and the contributions of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke on the social contract, that paved the way forward. As in 18th Century Prussia, those at the mercy of the Myanmar authorities must be able to stand up and say that there are judges in Berlin. The Myanmar authorities’ failure to fulfil these essential state functions must spur the international community to act. We must recognise the progress made in Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. However, there are still millions who are stateless and persecuted every day because of it. Enhanced political and economic relations with Europe go in tandem with individual freedoms and the rule of law. These are the messages that Myanmar, and any other country in this region and the world, must be reminded of. I am proud of this House, honourable colleagues, because we seized this noble opportunity to focus across the political spectrum on the absolute essentials of life, liberty and the right to happiness.

This topic is of great importance for the European Union and for me personally, and I am glad to be here today with you. The European Union addresses statelessness in different aspects of its external policies, including in our political relationships and development cooperation programmes, as well as in the enlargement process. Through our humanitarian assistance we support the lives of stateless people: I have seen this myself on the ground very recently. We encourage third countries to ratify the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. We urge partner governments to take measures to address situations of statelessness, including by granting citizenship to stateless persons, and we call on them to ensure that these people have access to public services, including health and education. Stateless persons are vulnerable to arbitrary treatment and crimes like human trafficking. Where whole communities are affected we can witness poverty and marginalisation and, as a consequence, significant humanitarian and development needs. The marginalisation of such people can create tensions in society. It can lead to radicalisation and this is extremely dangerous. It can lead to instability at both national and international level. Also, in extreme cases, it can lead to conflict and displacement. Statelessness is an issue the EU addresses in a series of instruments and policies: first, the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy; second, the EU Human Rights Country Strategies for a number of countries; and third, the New European Consensus on Development – to name a few. The EU has funded a range of development and humanitarian assistance programmes in the area of statelessness. These programmes aim to raise awareness of the issue, assist stateless persons and support governments in addressing the problem. Let me give you some concrete examples of our action in South and South East Asia. Maybe you know that last month I visited Myanmar. I met with the authorities and travelled to the troubled Northern Rakhine State to meet with Rohingya representatives and assess the humanitarian situation on the ground. This was the first ever visit by an EU Commissioner to that region and the first high-level international visit in general since the violent incidents of October 2016. I announced new humanitarian assistance for the current year 2017, and I stressed the need for full humanitarian access. I also asked for unrestricted access to health, education and other services for the Rohingya minority, the largest stateless group in the world. What I stressed to all my Myanmar interlocutors is that only steps towards community reconciliation can bring peace and stability. Reconciliation is not an easy process – I know this from personal experience as a Cypriot – but it is the only way forward. The situation in Rakhine State was the focus of the meetings that State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi had with President Tusk, High Representative Mogherini and me on 2 May in Brussels, just before my visit to the country. The plight of the Rohingya has been prominently discussed at human rights dialogues with Myanmar which the EU Special Representative for Human Rights has held since 2014.  The EU strategy with Myanmar of 2016 also calls on the Government of Myanmar to address the challenges of Rakhine State, including the status of the Rohingya. This requires inclusive development in all areas and a political process, including resolving citizenship for stateless persons in a non-discriminatory manner through a transparent, voluntary and accessible procedure. In March 2017, the current year, just three months ago, the EU continued to table a resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar in the EU Human Rights Council, and it was adopted without vote. The EU is a major donor to humanitarian assistance and development cooperation programmes in Rakhine State. Since 2010, more than EUR 76.5 million of humanitarian aid has been allocated to vulnerable people in the region. Our current development assistance in Rakhine State amounts to EUR 25 million, benefitting all communities. The Union also provides long-standing and significant support to the Rohingya in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, with EUR 6.3 million in humanitarian aid allocated in 2016 and EUR 6 million as the EU’s contribution to UNHCR for 2014-2017. Their situation is regularly discussed in political dialogues with the Government of Bangladesh. Birth registration was raised at the most recent human rights dialogue with the country, in December 2016, and also featured in the related EU statement which urged Bangladesh to provide assistance and protection and not to turn the Rohingya back to Myanmar. In 2008, the Supreme Court ended the statelessness of the Bihari in Bangladesh. The European Union aims to reduce inequality and exclusion of all marginalised groups in Bangladesh, through its wider public diplomacy and development cooperation efforts. In Nepal, the European Union, together with other international partners, is exploring sustainable solutions for the Bhutanese refugees. We are working with UNHCR on an exit strategy for them, while providing protection and multi-sectoral assistance.  I would like to thank the House for your attention, your suggestions and your observations, and please remain assured that the European Union remains committed to working with partner countries and other international partners towards eliminating statelessness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

This recommendation must also be valid in the case of relocations of European agencies, a phenomenon generated by Brexit and which did not exist at the time of issuing the recommendation in 2011.

The Conservative and Labour manifestos were committed to implementing the result of the referendum but we cannot trust either party. Both are dominated by Remainers, who want to thwart Brexit if they can. Their best hope of doing that is by negotiating a deal whereby Britain leaves the EU in name, but not in substance.

We must leave the EU under our law, and then tell the EU how Brexit is going to work, not ask for permission on how we might leave.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 210, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Petr MACH", "mepid": "84175", "text": "- When we joined the EU and Brussels ordered quotas on the number of cows, we were ridiculed.When we joined the European Union and import quotas became more expensive for bananas, we shrugged.When the EU introduced quotas for sugar production and we had to close our sugar factories, we were upset.When you introduced quotas for migrants, we began to worry about our own safety and the safety of our children.The European Commission is threatening our country today and wants fines, sanctions from us.That when we take subsidies, we have to take migrants as well.But we have our own rules on granting asylum, and our laws and our constitution take precedence over any decision by the European Union.You can threaten us with sanctions, you can take our subsidies, you can file lawsuits against us.But security is our number one priority and we will never exchange it for your euro.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2017-06-12.json", "name": "Ignazio CORRAO", "mepid": "124856", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor as the representative of Southern Italy, a land rich in agri-food excellence, to denounce how, among the hundred geographical indications that have been provided for in the agreement with China, there is only mozzarella buffalo from Campania as a product of Southern Italy. It seems very curious to me that the protection of German wine, which is a sophisticated wine, a sweetened wine, or Slovak wine, can be envisaged, and that the protection of Nero d'Avola or Bianco Alcamo is not envisaged, there is no provision for protection of extra virgin olive oil, the protection of the wonderful Sicilian oranges is not foreseen. Moreover, Southern Italy has been cut off from the Silk Road, speaking of China, and it seems that there is a plan that is aimed at destroying any type of production, any type of competitiveness, any type of dignity on the part of work and by products from that land.

In the days that followed, several African states, including Senegal, severed diplomatic relations with Qatar. The charges against Qatar are very serious. They come from too many countries to be taken lightly. However, the European Union shines with its silence. It was Germany which intervened on its behalf, as too often, to explain that it is necessary, I quote: \"to put an end to terrorism, within the framework of the anti-jihadist coalition of which Qatar is a part\". We must stop the language of wood. Just a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the London bombing, as we did today in Strasbourg, is not enough. We must also and above all place Qatar in front of its responsibilities. Qatar has laughed at us for too long.
