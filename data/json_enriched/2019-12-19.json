By attacking churches and mosques, they have only one goal: to destroy the community. They focus on those places where people get together, pray, laugh, sing and love each other.

The forces of law and order in Burkina Faso must always respect human rights if they want to create security rather than fear.  But beyond this, human security means guaranteeing people’s right to a decent livelihood and basic services. Extremism doesn’t grow in a vacuum, it grows where there is little hope. Multiple pressures, including climate change, are contributing to the erosion of livelihoods in Burkina Faso and indeed EU agricultural policy is part of the problem, with subsidised milk powder eroding the foundations of the local dairy industry.

In recent months, we have seen a continued and dramatic deterioration of the security situation in Burkina Faso. I was reading more figures than what has been mentioned. 700 victims in this year, 500 just since the summer; multiple attacks of various kinds against armed forced, security forces, civilian villages, schools, health. It makes almost 700 000 people displaced. This situation puts the level of food crisis very high. These people need assistance and basic social services. More than one million people are in need of emergency food assistance. This summer the country recorded more than 2 000 schools closed. It means more than 300 000 children are out of school. Almost 10 000 teachers affected; several of them have been killed during this year. The situation is weakening the central authorities while the next presidential election is already approaching and considering that the authorities have started to be criticised by the opponents for their crisis management. Burkina Faso as a strong partner for us, and despite the fact that some difficulties appeared recently concerning the crisis assessment, I think we have to be more present and more engaged in this area. In fact, Christians represent 25% of the population. It is often seen as an example of peaceful religious coexistence, but it is clear that the terrorist groups want to undermine this inter-faith coexistence as part of a broader strategy of fomenting inter-ethnic and religious conflict and generate a continued displacement of the population. They attack communities that they consider as enemies, but also those Muslims that are considered by Jihadist groups as too moderate, as shown by the attack on a mosque in October. This situation doesn’t call for a retreat but for urgent and strong action. As signatories of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Burkina Faso and the international community share the obligation to save life, to protect the dignity of the population and to defend effective freedom of belief. That’s why we are following the situation and acting on the areas where security is under strain. We are indeed strongly committed to reinforce our support to the fight against radicalisation. Setting up a humanitarian and human rights law compliance framework require resources. We are funding the G5 Sahel force with 10 million and peaceful co-existence between communities with almost the same amount of money, and supporting the civil society in the field of democracy with another 7 million. This is an example, some illustrations of what do we do in this specific purpose. Preserving social cohesion and religious coexistence is key for the stabilisation of the country. I would like to reassure you that the EU will continue supporting Burkina Faso in facing this critical challenge, because the situation in Burkina and in general in Sahel affects very much the security and peaceful prospects, also for us Europeans.

I was in Afghanistan as a photojournalist in 2016 and 2017, and of course the dark side was not hidden there.

It has to be said that it is people like Mohammad Musa Mahmudi and Also Ehsanullah Hamidi who work tirelessly there for human rights, to whom we deserve thanks. It is all the worse that these human rights defenders may be sometimes less protected than the criminals who commit crimes against children there. The two human rights defenders wanted to protect children from sexual abuse and they were arrested on the way to a meeting with the EU ambassador. It is important that we therefore put this issue on the agenda here, that we acknowledge in the resolution that the authorities there now want to take steps to better protect human rights defenders, including to investigate these allegations independently.

The EU delegation and EU Member States with diplomatic missions in Kabul should continue following developments in these cases and fully implement the EU guidelines for the promotion and protection of the rights of children in armed conflicts.

And isn’t the saddest thing about this discussion the fact that it isn’t a revelation, it isn’t new? We’ve all known about this for a very long time. In fact, we know that even attempts to have the situation exposed and dealt with have been interfered with. American soldiers even, who tried to stop the process, were themselves disciplined for that, while such behaviour was engaged upon in military compounds where the US was present. So for me, this exposes the nonsense that we’re constantly exposed to: that the US intervention in Afghanistan was all about bringing human rights, women’s rights, education, when the knowledge of this practice took place under their eyes and they did nothing. This makes them complicit in that practice. And of course the cases should be investigated. Of course the victims must be supported and protected. But, you know, I do think we need to draw the conclusions from that. It’s a sad irony, I find, that we are condemning – appropriately so – the physical rape and enslavement of children when the country itself has been raped and pillaged by foreign intervention and its population enslaved. Afghanistan was recently ranked as the most violent country in the world, yet we send hundreds of young people back there every year. Parliament deems it too unsafe for us to visit, but we’re quite happy to send children back there every year. Shame on us.

We cannot accept this in this way, we need our foreign policy towards Afghanistan to clearly contain this issue, to want Afghanistan, for criminal law, which already regulates the issue of violence against children in Afghanistan, to be enforced in real terms and, in addition to this criminal line, for Afghanistan to launch a state awareness campaign to draw attention to and warn against this crazy phenomenon.  These are ways, at least indirectly, that we can help the victims of this insane violence to dwindling in the future.

What were the causes? The consequences? We can talk about all that, we know. But today, what brings us here, in this specific case, is the part of the iceberg which is out of the water, because the data about child abuses in Afghanistan are, unhappily, much, much, much, much bigger than one could compare with our societies. The data we have shows very clearly that the Logar case is the part that you see from the iceberg. Between 2015 and 2018, the United Nation’s Task Force verified 40 000 grave violations against children throughout the country. 40 000! Many of them were of serious concern. This represents 80% of the civilian casualties. 80% of the civilian casualties are children, and not withstanding monitoring and verification constraints, the recruitment and use of 274 children and the perpetration of sexual violence against many others, the abduction of 2013, 800 attacks on schools and hospitals – well, I will not continue. It’s clear that it’s not exactly the same problem as here. In Afghanistan, in 2017 they wanted to revise the penal code, which entered into force in 2018, explicitly criminalising the so-called bacha bazi. But it’s very difficult to change the habits, the influence of powerful people. Impunity is very widespread, and victims face stigma and exclusion from society. We have to do new fighting, because this Child Protection Act had to be approved by a presidential decree, and later the lower house of the parliament refused it, arguing that they did not have a quorum to approve one article. And in December 2019, yesterday, there were still discussing it. The Law on Protection of Child Rights was rejected four times by the parliament in the last four years. It shows how strong the resistance is to change laws, and mainly habits, in a society which, unhappily, presents such kind of behaviour that we have to fight and we have to help to fight. We have to help to fight, trying to improve the rights of children in Afghanistan. We are doing as much as we can and we will continue doing so, knowing that, at the end, to change a society is much more difficult – a longer-standing endeavour than just publishing a law in a paper. We have organised recently a public debate entitled ‘Children of Afghanistan – They Deserve a Better future’ that drew wide interest from officials and the general public. In addition, our annual rights dialogue between the European Union and the Afghan Government systematically includes a chapter on the specific situation of children, where such matters as children in armed conflict, child marriage and violence against children are addressed. For sure, there are also cases of abuses inside the armed forces, and the EU addresses this matter in a systematic manner, paying attention to the minors recruited by the army and security forces and the behaviour of soldiers and policemen towards the civilian population. We have a police advisory project which includes a gender segment, which is also meant to benefit the young people. As you can see, this is a great problem. We are trying to help the Afghan authorities and society to fight against it, and I think it’s very important that the European Parliament echoes these events in order to fight against them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 44, "date": "2019-12-19.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "  The debate is over.

Many of you have expressed your strong concern about that – and, I think, rightly, because this has the potential to affect independent journalists and bloggers and is another step towards restricting media freedom and freedom of expression in Russia. Since 2012, when the ‘foreign agent’ law was first introduced in Russia, enabling non-government organisations to be branded as foreign agents, about 150 NGOs had this label imposed on them. They have been subject to fines, inspections and stigmatisation. The impact has been to restrict fundamental freedom in Russia, consume the scarce resources of NGOs, and inhibit independent civil society in the country. In 2017, foreign agent legislation expanded, so that any media organisation receiving foreign funding, either directly or indirectly, could be labelled as a foreign agent. It has again reduced the space for free and independent media, as well as independent voices. ‘Foreign agent’ legislation goes against Russia’s human rights obligations and commitments. The EU has repeatedly condemned this legislation, most recently in a statement by the External Action Service – the spokesperson on 23 November: the extension of the law to include private individuals is yet another move to curb freedom of expression. We will continue to call on the Russian authorities to respect their international obligations on freedom of association and freedom of speech. It is essential that Russian citizens are able to exercise freedom of association, including the right to join and participate in non-governmental organisations which promote the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Union will continue to support Russian human rights activists and civil society as we do worldwide, because this is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Our support is important, be it public statements, attending trials, supporting meetings with them. We will keep monitoring developments in Russia, calling the authorities to account when they do not respect fundamental rights enshrined in their Constitution. We will insist on the need to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and, in general, the Council of Europe conventions.

The Court ruled that the assumption of parliamentary office results from the vote of the electors.  The Court held that a person whose election to the European Parliament was officially proclaimed by the competent authority of the Member State in which that election took place has since acquired the status of Member of Parliament and enjoys the protection of parliamentary immunity within the meaning of Article 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union as from the date of the official proclamation of the results. Consequently, the position of Member of Parliament must be regarded as having been acquired by the fact alone and by the time of that proclamation. The Court also held that immunity means that the protective custody measure to which the elected Member has been subjected must be waived in order to enable the Member to go to the European Parliament and to complete the necessary formalities. Having said that, if the competent national authority considers that such a measure should be maintained after the person in question has assumed the status of Member of the European Parliament, it must request the European Parliament to waive that immunity as soon as possible, in accordance with Article 9 of that Protocol. I appeal to the competent Spanish authorities to comply with the wording of the judgment and I have ined Parliament's services to assess as soon as possible the application of the effects of the judgment on the composition of our Parliament.

These are a short-term target, a solution on digital services taxation and a long—term comprehensive solution that adjusts the definition of permanent establishment in order to include digital presence as a basis of taxing rights for corporation tax. The European Parliament supported the digital services tax proposals in its report, exactly a year ago, on 13 December 2018 and this proposal for an EU digital service tax was presented pending a comprehensive solution. It aims to address the increasing pressures that are faced by Member States to act, given the risk that their corporate tax base is being eroded significantly over time and the perceived unfairness of the situation. The proposal can also accelerate discussions at the OECD level to find a global solution on taxation issues, including a global digital service tax. Unfortunately, the Council did not find agreement on the Commission proposals at the beginning of 2019 and France and some other Member States then proceeded to adopt or prepare national digital service taxes. The United States started a so—called Section 301 investigation into the French digital service tax in July 2019. This is the first US investigation into a digital service tax, despite France being neither the first nor the only country that has adopted it. Following this, President Macron and President Trump agreed on the margins of a G7 meeting in Biarritz that France would continue levying the tax and would reimburse companies if subsequently there was a difference between the French tax and the OECD global solution. Despite this agreement, the United States continued with its investigation with a negative determination on 2 December 2019, claiming that France’s digital service tax is unreasonable, discriminatory and burdens or restricts US commerce. This determination opens the route for unilateral measures under US law. The same rules have previously been used only in response to unfair trading practices in China’s non-market economy in order to justify US tariffs against China. The only acceptable route to address trade disputes is through the World Trade Organisation adjudication process and the United States committed itself internationally and domestically to using that route in the past. The Commission therefore calls upon the US not to break its obligations under international law or under the multilateral trading system. President von der Leyen made clear that the European Union will act and react as one against any unilateral measures outside the multilateral trading system. The European Union will collectively defend a Member State if a trading partner takes unilateral trade measures against it. A fast conclusion of the update of the enforcement regulation by the Council and Parliament would send a strong signal that the European Union is ready to protect itself and the multilateral trading system. So let me conclude by saying that it would be a matter of significant concern to the Commission if the United States should decide to introduce tariffs against the European Union, based on a unilateral determination of Section 301B of the Trade Agreements Act of 1974. It would be the first time that the United States has used this instrument against the European Union since the World Trade Organisation was founded in 1995 and the United States statute envisages further discussions as an option instead of trade restrictive measures. So we in the Commission will keep on pushing for these discussions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 93, "date": "2019-12-19.json", "name": "Marie-Pierre VEDRENNE", "mepid": "197502", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, Commissioner, we are here for the last plenary debate of 2019. This debate reflects the situation we have been facing for several years in international trade. International trade, as we all know, is going through a period of severe turbulence. The world has changed, with China's place, that of digital, but have the rules of international trade been able to adapt? I don't think so. However, I will always advocate, as will you, balanced and rules-based international trade. Today, we Europeans are under pressure and Donald Trump is targeting us once again. Let us remember, the latter first chose to tax European steel and aluminium, for almost two years now, illegally. The European Union has retaliated, but how effectively? Since mid-October, our European producers and farmers have been subject to additional tariffs of 25% imposed by the United States in the Airbus/Boeing case. Again, Donald Trump has decided to strike hard, with 6.8 billion euros in sanctions. As you pointed out, on December 2, and that is the purpose of our exchange, the Trump administration announced its intention to overtax up up to 100%, for the equivalent of $2.4 billion, of French products, in response to the introduction of a tax on digital services. This announcement is extremely worrying. At the initiative of the Renew Group and the Renaissance delegation, this debate could be added to the agenda of this session, before the January deadline set by the Americans. It is important to take stock of the issues and I know, Commissioner, that you share this concern. What does Donald Trump blame us for? He believes that the tax on digital services would be discriminatory. I agree: this tax represents a fair contribution to pay for digital companies. The European Union seeks to foster the emergence of an international solution within the framework of the OECD. Discussions must continue in order to achieve fair taxation of digital enterprises, guaranteeing fair competition. In this offensive against the tax on digital services, Donald Trump has targeted the jewels of the French economy: champagne, roquefort, butter, cosmetics, handbags. It strikes where the damage is done, because the United States, which is just one example, remains the largest market in value for French champagne. Even more worrying: while a few large French and European groups will be affected, it is above all our SMEs, TPEs and farmers who will be the hardest hit. These new taxes could be fatal to them. Farmers and producers are once again paying the high price of trade and political tensions. In the event of sanctions, support measures will have to be taken. I would like to emphasize several points today. First of all, the need for dialogue: between two major partners, dialogue must take precedence and we must put an end to this tug-of-war. The European Union has always been open to discussion and we hope that the United States will hear us. This escalation in trade tensions will ultimately only be a loser. A win-win solution must be found, because it will be the producers, but also the consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, who will suffer the negative effects of the lack of a solution. Another point is the need for unity: preserving solidarity between Member States is part of our values. It is in unity that the European Union was created; It's our DNA. And I thank you, Commissioner Hogan, for saying, once again today, that unity is our strength. Finally, this debate is a reminder of the urgency we face, the need to strengthen our trade policy. It is our economy that suffers from our lack of responsiveness. The European Union is the world's leading trading power; it is time to assert it more and be more offensive. To conclude and to return to this new announcement from the United States, the message I am sending today is clear: the escalation that continues is not a viable or reasonable solution; it must be put to an end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 94, "date": "2019-12-19.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Commissioner Hogan, honourable colleague Marie-Pierre Vedren, honourable two other colleagues, it is an honour to be part of such an epic and tense debate, such a fierce debate in this Chamber. We show the attitude of European representatives to such topics. We've had four representatives in the chamber since 751. True, holidays lie ahead, but still this is quite indicative. That is why I congratulate you, Mr President, for being very strict over time and following the rules. If it's said, there could be a heated debate between the four of us, we can argue. I don't know if you're famous, but it's played by four people. We have plenty of time to make such a theme.  It is indicative that the people in the gallery who look at us are a dozen times more than us, and these people are most affected by the debated issue, because the tax on digital services will affect every single app they use, every phone they use and every single service they use. But you see what the attitude of colleagues is. That's very telling, we're giving a policy lesson, we're teaching them politics right now.  But let's get to the heart of it. On July 10, 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative launched an investigation into the digital services tax proposed by the Government of France. This French law would impose a 3% tax on the total annual revenue generated by some companies from providing certain digital services on the French market. According to the draft law, the tax applies only to companies with total revenues from service coverage of at least EUR 750 million worldwide and EUR 25 million in France.  The scope of these services is quite naturally in the sphere where American companies are world leaders. The structure of the proposed new tax, as well as statements by some officials in France, show that it is disproportionately targeted at these American companies. It is clear to me that the balance between fair taxation and maintaining good relations with our closest allies is very delicate.  Reciprocal actions on the American side are not in our interest. We all know and remember what happened when the U.S. administration launched a trade war with China. The problems there have not been solved and are yet to deepen. I don't think the European Union should be in that position, especially when it comes to trade with one of our closest allies.  My group in the European Parliament will continue to defend the right to free trade and free market. This is how we can provide prosperity for our citizens. Therefore, work must be made to resolve this issue. France does not represent the whole of Europe. I hope her example will not be followed by other countries.  I want to draw the attention of this powerful group of four people and something else. In this chamber, we often hear calls for the unification of the tax burden in different countries of the European Union. Usually they come from the leftist Communists in the European Parliament. I would like to point out that we are firmly opposed to such harmful proposals.
