This package was not developed in a vacuum. It is the result of a long process of discussion both within the Commission and outside. I would like particularly to welcome the work of the European Parliament and to thank you for your great involvement in this topic. I am referring particularly to the resolution on road transport in the European Union. I think it is particularly important to underline that this package affects many policy areas – and, together with Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, we have made sure that all aspects are well covered: first of all, transport, but also industry, climate change and energy, air pollution, urban policy, digital market policies, and employment and skills. I would therefore like to thank, in particular, the Conference of Committee Chairs, which invited me two weeks ago to discuss these cross-cutting links. That discussion and our exchanges were instrumental in crystallising the final proposal. I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the Commissioners for their contributions to this package over the last month, especially Commissioner Bulc, who will talk to you in a second, but also Commissioners Thyssen and Arias Cañete with whom we have been working very hard to deliver this package. Why is this package so important? My colleagues call it a ‘quadro-win’ – which means four wins – for consumers, for industry, for workers and, of course, for our planet. Consumers should benefit inasmuch as Europeans are pioneers in adopting new technologies and they have high expectations from a new, cleaner, connected economy, and especially from Smart Mobility. Secondly, our industry: we must make sure that European companies remain world class, and today’s package creates the opportunity for Europe’s transport industry to renovate, innovate and rejuvenate. Europe’s ambition must be that our transport and mobility sector remain world leaders, with world-class logistics, word-class infrastructure and, of course, world-class cars made in Europe, with world-class jobs and working conditions. We cannot afford a European ‘Kodak moment’, where we fail to embrace new technologies in time. Thirdly, workers: we are improving drivers’ working conditions and we want to make sure that our transport and automotive industries continue to create quality jobs and growth in Europe.  Finally, the fourth winner of today’s package is climate, with air quality and innovation. Road transport has a major role to play. It represents 20% of our entire CO2 emissions here in Europe, and we have to remember that three times more people die from nitrous oxide and other forms of air pollution than from road accidents. Our prediction is that mobility is going to increase substantially by 2050. Fortunately, transport is also one of the sectors that is seeing the most exciting technological breakthroughs. I am convinced that we can and will grow the transport industry while, at the same time, reducing our CO2 emissions. In conclusion, this Mobility package puts us on the right track, indeed the fast track. We had already delivered about 90% of the Energy Union legislation by the end of last year. With today’s package and with the final mobility part, which we will present later this year and in early 2018, the Commission will have delivered 100% of the Energy Union proposals. Concerning the news from the USA, I would like to assure you that we, as Europe, will continue on our path. We will continue to assume the leadership in the fight against climate change, and I am sure that the leaders of our three institutions will issue an appropriate statement in this regard.  I very much looking forward to our discussion but I will first give the floor to Commissioner Bulc, once again thanking her for her enormous work, her great dedication and the excellent results which we can present to you today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a great privilege and pleasure for me, together with my colleague Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič, to present to you the Mobility package adopted by the Commission today. This House has, on several occasions, called on the Commission to address the challenges faced by the road sector. Earlier this month you adopted a resolution to that effect. Thank you very much for your clear messages and support. Over the past two years, the Commission has been very broadly and inclusively consulting all stakeholders on all the major issues that represent a challenge for the road sector in the EU. So what you have on the table today are carefully thought-out and balanced proposals. They address a broad range of issues. Let me point out three of the most important ones: first, fairer and more competitive mobility; second, cleaner and more sustainable mobility; and, third, connected mobility. I will address them quickly, one by one. With regard to fair and competitive mobility, since the very beginning of this Commission’s term of office, a fairer and deeper internal market has been at the heart of our agenda. President Juncker has also repeatedly underlined that there is no place for social dumping in the European Union. In this context, the Mobility package will provide a truly European solution, which includes the necessary protection of workers and, at the same time, aims to prevent fragmentation of the internal market.  One prominent and much awaited measure is the fight against letterbox companies, for which there is absolutely no place in the Union. I think everyone agrees that this is becoming a real problem. We must make sure that transport undertakings are established where they manage their business, and that national authorities are equipped to detect fraud. So these are the two elements we are stressing. Another important issue which we are addressing relates to cabotage. Almost all stakeholders have said that the current rules are too difficult to enforce. The Commission has therefore decided to simplify those rules and to base them exclusively on time. Very importantly, the new rules will neither open nor close the cabotage market, but they will provide more flexibility for operators, while also facilitating controllers in doing their job. We propose to increase the controls and make them more targeted at the same time. Today the Commission is also addressing the phenomenon of nomadic drivers. We propose to give drivers the possibility of returning home on a regular basis, at least every three weeks. Drivers must also be offered adequate accommodation when taking weekly rests away from home. Let me be clear that the Commission proposal does not require more or longer driving times, or fewer or shorter rest periods. On the question of the application of the Posting of Workers Directive to the road haulage sector, the Commission has always argued that the rules on the posting of workers should apply to road transport. The fact that workers are highly mobile is not a reason to deprive them of the benefits of EU legislation. Having said that, there is a need for sector-specific rules. We propose to reduce the administration burden for road hauliers and, as a matter of proportionality, to establish that national rules on remuneration apply to international services after three days of accumulated time in one Member State. Clean and sustainable mobility is the next topic. In line with the European Energy Union, and to meet the commitments we made in Paris, transport has to contribute by reducing its very high emissions of CO2 and pollutants. We therefore propose to adopt our common road charging principle to encourage the use of infrastructure in a more efficient manner, and to reward the use of cleaner vehicles. Very importantly, the Commission is proposing to bring passenger cars, vans and buses within the scope of the EU legislation on road charging. These vehicles are responsible for their share of CO2 emissions and congestion on our roads, and this will also address problems relating to discrimination based on nationality, notably for passenger cars. Implementation of the ‘user pays’ and ‘polluter pays’ principles is another key objective of the Commission’s proposal. The vignette system should be progressively phased out in road charges, and charging should be on the basis of distance. This is a matter of both fairness and efficiency. Distance—based charging is also a precondition for external-cost charging, which was requested in the recent resolution on road transport adopted by this House. It is also the precondition for rewarding the use of clean vehicles more effectively. For example, we propose to introduce a 75% toll discount for zero-emission vehicles. On connectivity, what will the road initiatives do for connected mobility? Digitalisation is a very powerful means of achieving our various policy objectives. If we are to bring about more efficient road charging, Europe needs interoperability of national toll systems. Currently there are many different and independent charging systems in the EU, which are complicating cross—border transport. The Commission is proposing new rules which will provide for one on—board unit, one contract and one invoice to users. Another important area in which we propose further to develop digitalisation is enforcement. At a time when enforcement capacity in Member States is being reduced, it is especially important to have modern and efficient tools available for controls. We propose to make better use of e—documents and digital tachographs, to improve the exchange of information between Member States and to ensure interoperability between their systems.  I look forwarding to discussing these proposals with you in the months to come. As we begin the discussions – in a spirit of openness and readiness to compromise, I hope – I would also like to urge everyone to keep in mind the actual problems which transport operators face on the ground. As you are all aware, these problems are quite substantial. So let us try to be pragmatic and find solutions that work and that are enforceable, for the road haulage sector and its workers on the one hand, but also for all our citizens – with reduced congestion and lower pollution and, above all, better road safety – and, last but not least, for the EU economy, so that relevant, efficient and competitive transport services can operate throughout the single market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - The baby is born.

First of all, let me say this: strengthening the internal market, simplification and a better level playing field for all participants in the transport world are all very good. But this should not be at the expense of the social aspects. Minimum wages and cabotage will become big political topics in our discussion. The transition from cabotage actions to cabotage days will be particularly challenging. Commissioner Šefčovič has already said it: just because President Trump is leaving the climate agreement does not mean that we will not continue with sustainability.

Dear Commissioner, The publication of the mobility package is indeed an event that we have been waiting for for many months. A common European response to the sometimes unilateral actions of some Member States in the field of road transport is very much needed and expected by both hauliers and truck drivers. Protectionism is a huge threat to the common market and fair competition between Eastern and Western European transport companies, for which the biggest price will ultimately be paid by entrepreneurs and consumers. Unfortunately, I have the impression that this legislative package only partially addresses the challenges that arise and fails to solve the most problematic issues. The Commission's proposal to recognize a driver in international transport as a posted worker after only three days of stay abroad does not correspond to the realities of long-distance transport operations. I have similar doubts regarding the rules of taking a weekly rest. Social dumping - a term you have used - is a very clever wording, but it does not reflect the economic reality of the European Union at all. I hope that thanks to the joint effort, it will be possible to include in the final version of the proposed solutions also the perspectives of transport companies from Central and Eastern Europe, which constitute a very important part of this market, and whose opinions and expectations have not been properly taken into account in this package.

Wim van de Camp spoke about the ‘baby’ being born, so we will now see whether the baby is well developed, whether the legs are as developed as the arms, and especially whether it has a complex brain and if it is balanced for future development. The philosophy with which you have approached this, Commissioner, and the concept sound good. It is a concept I can subscribe to, even though you referred to Jean-Claude Juncker’s ‘no dumping’ statement. I would appreciate it if he had added a bit more about the market, and about the protectionism that we also see in Europe today. However, we need to give the package a chance and not only that: we need to develop it and make sure that it works in all the dimensions that you have presented. We also need to take into account that the backbone of the EU is the internal market, and the internal market has to function. There is no room for protectionism but there is also no room for misbehaviour or unfair treatment undermining the necessary social standards and environmental aspects. All that definitely has to be addressed.  I would now like to make a few comments to my fellow MEPs. This is a package – and we see on a daily basis various national measures which are, in fact, fragmenting the internal market – and it is high time for this package to be addressed, developed and approved in a balanced way. That means that we need to treat it as a package and we need to make sure the package is approved within this parliamentary term.

They are a basic requirement for toll systems that are harmonized across Europe. However, I can already announce that we will subject all proposals relating to the financial burdens from new requirements for environmental noise or traffic jams to a comprehensive bureaucracy and cost check. Because it cannot be that we are overburdening an already heavily burdened industry and also the users by constantly changing new specifications. As a result, the inclusion of these external effects must not lead to higher costs for the industry. My second comment on the proposals on company licensing and the posting of workers: We will examine this very carefully, but we are already pleased that the rules have finally been made clearer. The clear working time limits will help curb social abuse, and we must then coordinate this with the provisions of the Posting of Workers Directive. However, the Member States must then also monitor more closely, and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must monitor the Member States to see whether they do control. Because they do that really carelessly - I have to criticize that. In summary: warning of excessive toll costs. Call to curb social dumping. Many Thanks.

Firstly, I would like to thank the Commission for this comprehensive and very important package that we in Parliament can now finally start working on. One of the principles is clearer and more transparent rules, their enforcement and the fight against fraud. This social aspect is extremely important to our group, we welcome it and we will support it very hard. The question is, of course, whether this will work in practice. That is the challenge. Does this package make it possible to really tackle social fraud in the field? We will certainly test that criterion. Let me be clear: this is not about a battle between Eastern and Western Europe. It's about making sure that our workers, whether they come from the West or the East, are subject to the same rules, the same wages and the same social protection. That is incredibly crucial for us.

The initiative of Road for the transport sector is essential for it to function well, be competitive, be fair, be clean, be innovative. In the European Union, efficient transport connections have facilitated the creation and deepening of the internal market. Investments in transportation infrastructure drive economic growth, create wealth, improve trade, geographic accessibility, and people's mobility. The demand for road transport has been increasing due to its competitiveness, its ability to improve accessibility and adjust to the demand of its customers. It is therefore our job and must achieve goals that adjust to the new times. Parliament is committed to working on all these reports, whether they are regulations or directives. It is going to be, ladies and gentlemen, a long road - sometimes even arduous - as this package is loaded with sensitive issues, be they social, environmental or innovation.

Addressing EU-wide problems with EU solutions is the right way to go, and the best way to avoid unilateral, uncoordinated national measures which fragment our internal market. With the proposal before you, we are trying to avoid that and to ensure adequate working conditions for drivers in a more enforceable way, while at the same time reducing administrative costs and burdens for operators. Let me now directly address a few of your concerns and questions and hopefully bring more clarity to the proposal and our further discussions. Letterbox companies are illegal and are used to obtain cost advantage by some hauliers. That is a fact. We define here clear criteria to avoid letterbox companies and to better enforce this, in particular through enhanced cooperation between national enforcement authorities. I have been asked on numerous occasions to do something about vehicles below 3.5 tons, especially the so-called white vans that are very often used to bypass European rules. My message here is very clear: yes vehicles and hauliers under 3.5 tonnes are included in this proposal, and the Commission is making sure that they are subject to certain European rules, as described in the package.  There were a couple of comments on a European road transport agency. At this point we are focusing on improving the existing enforcement tools and systems and on further enhancing cooperation between national enforcement bodies. I hope it is going to work. Experience to date with the implementation of social legislation does not show that cross-border enforcement is much more cost effective and more consistent when carried out by the Member State authorities within established framework structures. A road agency could indeed be helpful but for the Member States and the Commission, in assuring consistent and efficient cross-border enforcement, we would first like to focus on the solutions proposed. But I remain open to developing this subject further, in cooperation with you.  Tachographs were mentioned several times. We propose to accelerate the deployment of smart technologies and smart tachographs, which will further facilitate the enforcement of social rules and avoid fraud. For example, operators equipping their vehicles with these modern digital tachographs before the deadline should be rewarded with fewer controls on European roads.  On driving and rest time, I would also like to repeat that the limits will remain the same. The flexibility to organise operations can in no way go against road safety and social protection. On the contrary, they will contribute to facilitating returns home. This is the approach proposed by the Commission. These rules could be complemented by additional social measures relating to working time but, for those, from today onwards the Commission is opening a social dialogue and will propose legislative proposals in the autumn in the second phase of the mobility package.  On charging, Member States are still free to decide whether they want to charge or not. They are free to decide what they want to charge, which roads they want to charge for and which not. But, if they decide to use charging systems, we have given them enough time to readjust their systems to a compatible, interoperable EU-based system.  On cabotage, let me underline once again that our new cabotage rules do not imply further market opening or further market closure. Market access and business opportunities will remain as they are today, but more flexibility will allow operators to optimise their operations, and simpler rules will certainly be of great help to controllers or enforcement officers in controlling illegal practices much better.  On proposal and posting, first for cabotage operations, these are operations whereby goods are loaded and unloaded within the same country. There is a clear and strong link with that country and, therefore, the drivers should be paid according to the rules of the country from day one onwards. Let us say that a Slovenian driver drops a load off in Milan and reloads in Milan to unload in Rome. For the time spent on the cabotage operation between Milan and Rome, Italian rules will apply.  Secondly, for international operations – these are operations where the loading and unloading take place in different countries – we clarify that there is a sufficient link with the country concerned only to the extent that the driver spends at least three days a month in that country. To put it simply, international journeys lasting less than three days are excluded from the Posting of Workers Directive.  Lastly, I would like to urge you all to focus not only on these particular issues. The road initiatives contain a very comprehensive list of measures that are well balanced and represent a substantial step forward in the management of road traffic in Europe, making it much more modern, fair, sustainable and future-oriented. We really need to improve the road sector in order to stay competitive and to make sure that Europe stays a social place.

Ich danke Ihnen sehr für diese sehr freundliche Einleitung. I would like to thank the honourable Members for giving me the opportunity to address you all on this very important issue. Some of you might be surprised to see me here some weeks earlier than the actual start of the Estonian Presidency, but for the reasons explained by the Vice-President, the current Maltese Presidency was not able to attend this session.  The new European consensus on development has been amongst the priorities of the Council and will guide the EU’s development cooperation for the years to come. As you know, our institutions have considerably accelerated the pace of the interinstitutional negotiations since February this year. You will probably also recall that five intensive, yet very constructive, trilateral meetings between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, paved the way for the adoption of the consensus by the EU Development Ministers at their meeting of 19 May. Similarly, I look forward to the vote which will take place in this House tomorrow, and hopefully allow for all the pieces of this complex puzzle to be in place ahead of the joint signature during the European Development Days on 7 June.  Let me stress here that the Council is very proud of this common achievement. It was only possible thanks to the high level of commitment of all parties to come to a common understanding and a shared agenda for the future of EU development policy over the next 15 years. The primary aim will be the eradication of poverty. In line with the Lisbon Treaty and the EU global strategy on foreign and security policy, the consensus will also help to achieve the priorities of the EU’s external policy.  As we all know, the EU remains the world’s largest development aid donor, providing more than half of assistance world-wide. The adoption of the consensus is a key EU deliverable in the commitment to globally implement the 2030 Agenda and support partner countries in achieving the sustainable development goals. The EU is sending an important signal to the global community, notably to the UN High Level Political Forum in July, on how it will support partner countries in their endeavour to implement the 2030 Agenda and achieve the sustainable development goals.  The new consensus for development is articulated around the ‘five Ps’ of Agenda 2030: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships. Our top priorities will be to work towards the eradication of poverty, to reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion, to promote good governance, to ensure human and economic development, to tackle global issues such as the fight against hunger, to protect the environment, as well as to preserve the world’s natural resources. Social inclusion and gender equality will be central to the way we implement and define our policies.  In implementing these priorities, the consensus will have to respond to the main challenges that the world is facing today. The complexity and degree of interconnection between the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development policy – this can only be strengthened through a holistic approach.  The resilience of countries and societies should be put at the centre of our attention and the cross-cutting elements of the consensus – such as gender equality, youth, investment and trade, sustainable energy, climate action, good governance, democracy, rule of law and human rights, as well as migration and mobility – accelerate results, progress and transformation to achieve the sustainable development goals.  And this will bring me to the issue of implementation. The new consensus binds us all, the EU institutions and Member States alike. In this respect, we all need to work to the best of our abilities on its implementation. The coordination and coherence between the actions will be key. Effective results can only be achieved through a tailor-made approach with our partner countries, involving both state and non-state actors. Inclusiveness is therefore essential in order to increase the ownership of our development policy by our partners. Last, but not least, on behalf of the Council I wish to thank this House, and in particular the two co-rapporteurs, Mr Neuser and Mr Wenta, as well as the Chair of the Committee on Development, Ms McAvan, for their dedication and constructive approach which resulted in an excellent agreement that is of benefit to both the EU and our development partners.

The task of bringing 28 Member States, the Parliament with its different political groups, and the Commission together around such a far-reaching joint text is, without doubt, a formidable challenge. On many of the points for which Parliament has strongly advocated, the Commission would be willing to go even further. We have all had to seek compromises, but this only underlines the significance of what we are about to achieve. This text represents a genuine consensus, crafted through common effort and owned by us all. The new Consensus endorsed in the Committee on Development’s resolution also received unanimous support at a recent Foreign Affairs Development Council on 19 May. I would like to extend my sincere and wholehearted thanks to the Committee on Development and, in particular, the co—rapporteurs, Norbert Neuser and Bogdan Wenta, their colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, and the Chair of the Committee, Linda McAvan, who have engaged systematically and constructively in our interinstitutional discussions on the new Consensus. I also want to thank honourable Members for all their previous contributions, including the resolution on the revision of the Consensus adopted by this House on 14 February this year, which is strongly reflected in the joint statement. The new European Consensus on Development represents a profound shift in our development cooperation, guided by the vision of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The European Union, as the world’s largest development actor, has a great responsibility in making sure that this vision is turned into reality. An ambitious new European Consensus for Development is a very important step in this direction, laying down a strong basis for maintaining the European Union’s global leadership in development.  The new Consensus unequivocally reaffirms that poverty eradication remains the primary objective of EU development policy. I want to be crystal clear on that. We will work to reduce vulnerabilities, address inequalities and ensure that no—one is left behind. We will aim to reach those furthest behind first. With this clear objective in mind, the Consensus enables us to respond better to the more complex and interconnected challenges that the world faces today. It sends an important political message, namely that Europe is determined to work better together, making the most of the joint capacities of the EU institutions and the Member States.  Our new Consensus closely reflects the 2030 Agenda structured around the five ‘P’s: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. It integrates the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and also underlines the links with other policies to make sure they take account of development concerns, including peace and security, humanitarian aid, migration, environment and climate. Therefore it also represents a significant contribution to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the United Nations’ efforts to build sustainable peace for all. As regards the Migration and Development Nexus, I am convinced that what we need to offer is more partnership and more cooperation rather than less. Migration is an issue of common concern, common responsibility and common actions, in particular with our African partners. The Consensus takes a comprehensive approach to implementation, combining aid with other resources – public and private – sound policies and a strengthened approach to policy coherence for development. It explicitly reaffirms our collective Official Development Assistance commitments and guarantees that realistic and verifiable actions will be taken towards meeting them. We put strong emphasis on better tailored partnerships with a broader range of stakeholders and partner countries, stressing the importance of fully involving civil society, the European Parliament and the national parliaments in the implementation of the sustainable development goals. Through this Consensus, Europe strives to be not only the biggest but also the best and most effective development actor. Your endorsement of the Consensus at this plenary will be a milestone for our development cooperation. It should allow for signature at the highest political level at the European Development Days next week and it will provide the European Union with a very substantial deliverable for the United Nations high—level political forum on sustainable development in July.  At a time when the values of multilateralism and solidarity are called into question and the commitment of some to sustainable development seems to be wavering, Europe must pull its weight and help to keep global efforts on the right track.

As has been said here, the main political goal of the new Consensus - which is closely linked to the 2020-2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals - is the fight against poverty, discrimination and inequality. In this context, Parliament has made strong efforts to take account of policy coherence and effectiveness in the development efforts of the Union and its members, as well as of other donors and organizations. ODA is of key importance to the Union's development policy. Therefore, reaching the target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2030 by Member States is an important commitment. The new consensus also relates to increasing funding for development policy, including through increased public-private partnerships, and the importance of fair and properly regulated trade. The link between development policy, migration and security is undeniable, as we are strongly aware of by the crises caused by conflict and instability. The new consensus will indicate the direction of solving the problem of the root causes of migration. We will vote tomorrow on a resolution on consensus.

We need one because we have to find a way for the EU to implement the sustainable development goals. We need one because we need a recommitment by the Member States today to tackle global poverty, and I think we need one most of all, today of all days, because we are hearing that Donald Trump will pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. That is a blow to sustainable development goals, a blow to what we want in Europe. So, today of all days, we should give a signal that Europe is prepared to step up and give the leadership we need, and that it will meet its global commitments to our collective future on this planet. The important things for me and for my Group in this Consensus are that we recommit; that poverty eradication is the primary goal of European development policy; that we make the commitment again to reach our target of 0.7% aid; and, for the first time in the Consensus, that 0.2% of our collective GDP will focus on the poorest countries. We are hearing that Africa is losing out on aid. We have to recommit. I know there are colleagues here, and colleagues I respect a lot, who are concerned about the emphasis placed by some governments on security and migration, and I know there is scepticism about whether or not countries will meet the 0.7%. I share some of those concerns and it is our job to hold governments to account and to make sure the consensus is implemented in the right way.

No wonder then that the objective of devoting 0.7% of gross domestic product to official development assistance has become an Arlesian event, namely the event always announced but which never happens. Would it not be appropriate, therefore, to change the method, since that has not worked for almost 50 years? Not a single essential demand of the European Parliament has received the agreement of the Council, which has been intransigent following the blackmail exercised by a minority of Member States, and in particular by one.

It will not be. The few cryptic sentences that deal with this issue in this document barely mask the way in which some Member States despise the European Parliament. Go understand why all our member states agree to comply with the development assistance committee of the OECD, to inform the ambassadors of Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the United States of the content of their policy and, at the same time, refuse to refer it to our Committee on Development? The promises concerning the 0.7% only seem to bind those who receive them. The European Development Consensus establishes the commitment of 0.7% of official development assistance, while in at the same time several member states announced substantial cuts in their official development assistance ahead of the Addis Ababa conference. Should we therefore believe those who are in favor of 0.7% or should we believe them when they say they want to go significantly below 0.7%? Admit that we have a credibility problem here. In addition, official development assistance has an eminently political dimension. With Brexit, we will lose one of the few Member States that devotes 0.7% of its GDP to it. It is not enough to gargle all day long that the European Union is the only global player in development. If we want to remain so after the departure of the United Kingdom, we must leave behind this sluggishness which accepts the laissez-faire and carelessness of the Member States in this matter.

They turn development policy into a domestic policy instrument. The Commission allows the member states to do their thing, and the External Action Service even supports them here! It is primarily about the self-interest of the EU, more about escape prevention, more money for the military, more flexibility also with the regional priorities - but less for poverty reduction. That is reflected in this consensus, and we Greens cannot support that. For us, development policy is a means of defusing blatant inequality and injustice in this world - a means of fighting poverty. It was said: This is also stated in the Lisbon Treaty, in Article 208. There is neither migration management nor security policy. The advocates of the consensus have of course also mentioned it, it is in the text: Combating poverty. Yes, sure, it's in there too.

It is reiterated that it is necessary to work on development in all its dimensions and implications with consistency with respect to trade policies, with the theme of all other aspects, including that of migration. I do not think we should be afraid to recognize that if we create the fight against poverty we will be successful, if we create development with all the attention to local authorities, NGOs, all processes that arise from below, we will also make a contribution to, how to say, making these migrations, which today are a tragedy first of all for those who are victims, not for the countries of arrival, but for those who are victims, to make them more natural phenomena that we will accept and I must say more human to the same protagonists.

The world is looking to us to live up to this role and lead the global implementation efforts by taking full account of the sustainable development goals in the European policy framework and in our priorities. We should not shy away from this responsibility. Development policy, in the form of this new Consensus, will make a central contribution in this direction.

Together we can achieve more and spur action that can change lives across the world for the better, helping to end poverty in our generation. Please believe me that, without this Consensus, eradicating poverty, reaching our official development assistance (ODA) commitments, effectively tackling the root causes of migration, and ensuring the leading global role of the European Union in the implementation of the sustainable development goals will be much, much more difficult to achieve, if they are possible at all.

We reaffirm the need for the Member States of the Union to fulfill their commitments regarding development aid, especially by reaching 0.7% of this gross domestic product. We highlight the multisectoral nature of resilience, which affects, of course, the economic dimension, the environmental dimension, the social dimension, the political dimension and the dimension of security, but whose center and focus is the human being in the midst of all these highly multidimensional characters. We urge the Commission to incorporate resilience into its political dialogue with other global actors, and we underline the special position of humanitarian aid, which must be provided with the utmost respect for the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence and the protection of human rights. Respect for these principles is an essential condition in order to subsequently demand access to populations in need and to guarantee the protection of humanitarian actors. We underline the importance of disaster risk reduction and call on the Union to ensure that the new Communication, which will appear in the coming days, is in line with the commitments made in the Sendai Framework and with the Development Action Plan of this Frame. We also call for inclusive local and national disaster risk reduction strategies to be formulated. We call for special emphasis to be placed on protecting the most vulnerable groups, the poorest populations, minorities, families, women, children, migrants, people affected by AIDS, LGTB people, people with disabilities. . We call for programming with a gender perspective, and we also highlight the need to expand the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Kampala Convention to protect displaced persons. We underline that resilience is based on respect for human rights, the strength of democracy, the rule of law, good governance and trust in institutions. All of these constitute objectives that should be promoted in application of the Global Strategy of the European Union, and we ask that it cover not only the territorial framework closest to us, where crises develop, whose effects come closer to us, but also global geographic.We want to serve all parts of the world, with special attention to the most fragile countries.And, finally, we understand that providing education to children in humanitarian crisis is not just giving them a right that belongs to them, but also preventing further conflicts and restoring peace where it has been definitively broken.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 85, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, the global strategy for the European Union’s foreign and security policy identified state and societal resilience as one of the five priorities of the Union’s external action, with enhanced attention to the EU’s near and broader neighbourhood. The Foreign Affairs Council in October 2016 called for the five priorities to be swiftly translated into concrete policy initiatives and action. Therefore, the Council very much looks forward to receiving the upcoming joint communication by the Commission and the High Representative on the strategic approach to resilience in the EU’s external actions.  The Council stands ready to bring forward the discussions on this topic. The EU acknowledges the need to move away from crisis containment to a more structural, long-term and non-linear approach to vulnerabilities, with an emphasis on prevention and stabilisation. Indeed, we need an integrated approach to conflicts and crises, for thus we contribute to enhancing the EU’s own resilience and that of our citizens.

The strategy does not belong only to the Commission or the Council. It is a strategy for the whole European Union, for all our institutions, for all Member States and, most importantly, for all our citizens. This joint communication on resilience is no exception.  As you know, a wide consolidation process and a fruitful dialogue with Parliament preceded the writing of the communication. It should be adopted at the beginning of June. In the second half of the month, High Representative Mogherini will present a report on the global strategy’s first year of implementation. The timing is no coincidence. When the work towards the strategy began, we decided that it should be not simply a security strategy but something much broader. The global strategy recognises that there is no security without resilience, human development, human rights and democracy for all, in Europe and beyond.  Since then, much of the media’s attention has focused on the defence part of the social strategy’s implementation. With this joint communication, we want to stress that our work on resilience is just as important and is also moving fast. We have, of course, not started from scratch. The joint communication builds on the experience gained since the 2012 Commission communication, the 2015 review of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the EU work on resilience on the ground. Today’s EU resilience policies are supported by evidence of good practice from the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Lessons learned will be set out in more detail in an accompanying staff working document. The joint communication will also ensure continuity with the 2013-2020 Action Plan for Resilience in Crisis-Prone Countries, which will continue to be implemented. When we evaluate the implementation of the Action Plan, we can see that progress has been especially positive in some thematic areas such as food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture, or in humanitarian programmes for a protracted crisis. We also see that significant changes are underway in other areas, such as urban resilience, predictable and flexible financing and social protection. At the same time, the old way of doing things is not enough. On the one hand, the challenges we face have evolved in nature and in scope. They require a stronger and more coordinated response from us. On the other hand, we finally understand that better coordination within the European Union and with our partners can create new opportunities for our citizens and our friends. Let me go through some of the new ideas that shape the joint communication. Firstly, this is part of a global effort to improve the impact of our policies on sustainable development and resilience. The EU Consensus on Development also captures this idea and is key in this regard. With the joint communication we want to put at the core of our policies the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the commitments to action made at the World Humanitarian Summit last year. The question now is how we secure progress towards these commitments in the face of a more fluid landscape of global challenges and risks. Strengthening resilience is part of the strategic response to this challenge. It helps to promote a way of working that moves us away from crisis containment to a more structural, long—term approach to vulnerabilities with an emphasis on prevention. Secondly, the joint communication aims at improving cooperation among all players inside our Union. This includes all institutions, the Member States and all political, development and humanitarian actors. For instance the joint communication will stress the need to streamline the current multiplicity of overlapping risk-assessment processes. Such a streamlined assessment would integrate, in a more systematic and dynamic way, information from our diplomatic network and from humanitarian and development actors, as well as the specialised knowledge about the external environment held by the EU’s internal policies, DGs and agencies. With the global strategy, we have agreed on principles and objectives that we all share. We can now work to join forces towards pursuing these objectives as a true union. Thirdly, in a world where power is much more diffused, we need to engage well beyond state actors. Resilience has to be addressed at multiple levels – not only at government level but also inside societies and communities. Local government and civil society are often the basis on which resilience can take root and grow at community level. We all know that, in every society, women are key factors of resilience as an engine for development, as problem solvers and as peacemakers. Nowhere is this truer than in fragile or conflict—riven societies. The communication too will fully recognise this. When we talk about the resilience of states and societies, we know that the two must go hand in hand, so we will put more emphasis, not less, on engaging these non-state actors, including the private sector, as we are already doing with the European External Investment Plan.  Finally, our world is much more connected than it has ever been. Clearly our work begins in the European Union’s vicinity. This is not surprising, given the special political commitments of the accession process and the European Neighbourhood Policy, but we also know that instability in our neighbourhoods can easily spill out. The only way truly to strengthen our immediate region is to look further and think globally. We believe this joint communication will help us to be more effective in our action on resilience, to the benefit of our partners and also in the interest of investing taxpayers’ money more effectively. So we really look forward to Parliament’s engagement towards stronger EU action for a safer Europe in a more stable, prosperous and democratic world.

Resilience is indeed a concept that has progressively made its way into EU development policies: 2015 was a milestone year as regards development and the idea of resilience in the EU’s eyes. The Commission rightly introduced a resilience marker in its humanitarian implementation plans. This was certainly a good step in a good direction. Today’s world is characterised by increasingly complex challenges – climate change, displacement, pandemics, extremism, population movements etc. Such challenges test the resilience of communities and institutions as well as the ability of regional and international organisations to support affected societies. Therefore, development and humanitarian aid should no longer be about responding to crises after they have occurred. They should also be about helping people and communities to withstand crises and shocks, and helping them to anticipate those and to be better prepared when they happen. This is true not only for state institutions but also for the non-state actors, civil society, NGOs and individuals who have to learn how to cope with complex risks. Building resilience, particularly in a fragile state, is a long-term commitment. It has to be done not only when TV cameras are around but also when nobody can predict the next conflict, tragedy or poverty situation.

There can be no resilience and stability for the European Union's external action unless the European Union proves that it can protect and safeguard its external borders, can protect and preserve peace in the Member States of the European Union. Today's violations by Turkey and the insults to the sovereignty of Member States, such as Cyprus and Greece, are a direct challenge and insult to the European Union itself. And if the European Union does not respond to safeguarding and protecting its credibility through a specific strategy for protecting its external borders, then all its policies are being tested and we cannot talk about resilience and stability. The European Union must guarantee to Member States such as Cyprus and Greece that Turkey, a candidate country for accession to the European Union, cannot, on a daily basis, infringe on the dignity and credibility of the European Union itself. I call on the High Representative of the European Union, Mrs Mogherini, to finally understand that she must send a clear message to Turkey, stressing that it cannot provoke and offend the very credibility of the European Union, and that we must finally understand that. In closing, I want to emphasize that peace is needed to ensure stability. The President of the Republic of Cyprus, Madam President, made a peace proposal to Turkey and to Mr. Akıncı, for a solution to the Cyprus problem.

It is a topic of common concern to us all. Let me start by expressing my deep concern about the current situation in Europe. Evidence from different sources, including the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, shows an alarming increase in intolerance and hatred. There exists specific data collected by the Fundamental Rights Agency confirming that every fourth Jew in Europe has experienced verbal or physical violence. It is difficult to believe and understand that so many in our society reject the fundamental values of tolerance, respect and liberty, and instead choose to hate.  What can be done to address anti-Semitism? This issue was discussed in more general terms during the conference on positive narratives against hate speech, which the Maltese Presidency organised in April this year. Experts from Member States, international organisations, academia and civil society agreed that there was no single perfect remedy for hatred. As is often the case, we need a complex response that starts with education, data collection and analysis, and ends with condemnation and criminal sanctions.  Let me start with the measures I mentioned last, condemnation and criminal sanctions. The EU has adopted specific legislation on combating intolerance and hatred, namely the 2008 Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. This decision outlaws Holocaust denial and anti-Semitic hate speech inciting violence. In particular, it prohibits under criminal law condoning, denying or grossly trivialising the Holocaust.  In June 2016, the Council stressed the importance of this legal instrument and invited Member States to ensure its effective transposition and implementation, in addition to other relevant hate crime laws at national level. Furthermore, the Council asked Member States to develop effective methods to report and ensure proper recording of hate crimes.  In the context of hate speech, the Council supports the Commission High Level Group, which seeks to develop, together with the Member States, concrete practices and tools to improve responses to racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. This group is actually meeting today and tomorrow, and one of the items on the agenda concerns specifically the Week of Action on Combating anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred. There will also be an opportunity to discuss the rights of victims of hate crimes. On several occasions, the Council has called on Member States to ensure the full and correct implementation of the EU legislation, notably the EU Directive on the rights of victims of crime. I hope that the expertise from the High Level Group experts will bring us closer in our common endeavour. However, let me stress that all these countermeasures will be in vain if we forget the important role of education and youth work. More precisely, it is crucial to know the history of our continent to understand the value of tolerance and to be able to counter anti-Semitism when confronted with it. In the context of awareness-raising and policy advice, we are grateful to the European Fundamental Rights Agency for its continued monitoring of, and research into, discrimination and anti-Semitism and for offering evidence-based solutions and suggestions.  I would like to conclude by stressing once again how important it is to combat anti-Semitism. I would like to recognise the work of the first European Commission Coordinator on combating anti-Semitism, Katharina von Schnurbein. We have different tools: we have knowledge, we have education, we have counter-narratives, but we also have condemnation of any form of anti-Semitic violence, hate speech or discrimination. Accordingly, the responsibility rests with all of us – politicians, teachers, students, parents and, if need be, also judges and prosecutors. No one can close his or her eyes or ears and pretend not to see injustice, discrimination or hatred. An important part of the exhibition in the recently opened House of European History, which was founded at the European Parliament’s initiative, is devoted to the genocide of European Jews. It is the duty of our continent, and our shared responsibility, to remember and not to let it happen again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 115, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, combating anti-Semitism is indeed a very important and alarming topic, considering the statistical evidence which the Minister has just mentioned. I very much welcome Parliament’s debate and the motion for a resolution. Increasing fear and high rates of verbal and physical violence against ethnic, religious and other minorities across Europe are a major concern, and it is our duty not only to discuss this but also to come forward with solutions. Data show a clear spike in anti—Semitic incidents. There was more than one incident a day in Austria and three incidents per day in the United Kingdom in 2016, in both cases the highest numbers ever recorded. We are particularly worried about discrimination and harassment against Jewish youngsters, who are more likely to experience anti-Semitism in schools and universities. A hostile environment in schools will put the next generation at risk of exclusion. All of us, collectively and individually, have the duty to fight against intolerance and hatred and reject all expressions of them. We welcomed yesterday’s Joint Day of Action, with Parliament, on combating anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred, which brought together Jewish and Muslim youngsters. Today we are opening two funding calls for applications, making available EUR 5.5 million to support civil society and Member States’ authorities in better preventing and countering racism and xenophobia, including anti—Semitism and other forms of intolerance, hate crime and hate speech. Particular areas of attention include hate-crime training, empowering and supporting hate-crime victims, and improving recording, as well as data collection and methodologies. Also, at today’s meeting of the High—Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other intolerance I presented the results of the implementation of the Code of Conduct we concluded in May 2016 with major IT companies to combat illegal hate speech online. I can inform you today that significant progress has been made and all IT companies have been improving their reaction to notifications concerning manifestly illegal hate speech, including anti-Semitic hate speech. Let me also inform you that I have asked the EU Fundamental Rights Agency to conduct a large-scale survey on the experience of Jews with anti-Semitism. We expect the results by early next year. It will be the first time that we have comparable data on trends around anti—Semitism across the EU, following an initial survey in 2013. On the occasion of this year’s Holocaust Remembrance Day we made the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism available through our website. The Commission welcomes any useful tool that helps to prevent anti-Semitism. Several Member States, including the UK and Austria, which I have already mentioned, use this definition in their policymaking and training and in data collection on anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes. As you know, following our first Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, the Commission appointed a Coordinator on Combating anti—Semitism, tasked with liaising with Jewish communities and with advancing and mainstreaming Commission action against anti—Semitism. She is here today. We must learn from the past, in order to ensure that nobody is persecuted for what he or she is, stands for or believes in.

That is why I promote this Resolution and have signed it with the full conviction that it sends a signal of solidarity with the victims of the wave of attacks and of the growing aggressiveness and offensiveness against Jews in Europe, to which the events in Toulouse bear witness , Brussels, Paris, Copenhagen, resulting in death in a good number of cases and, above all, the spectacular increase reported by the Agency for Fundamental Rights of the European Union in its annual reports - 40% and 48% in the last years in France, Belgium, Hungary, United Kingdom, Austria—. This deserves a message of solidarity, and it is the one carried out by this Resolution, betting on a working definition, for a definition of work, which is not legally binding, but which is endorsed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance - the Holocaust Memory Alliance , which is an intergovernmental organization that has diplomatic representatives from the vast majority of the member states of the European Union - about what anti-Semitism is as an instigation of hatred of Jews for being Jews and of violence, and therefore to attack Jews for being Jews in Europe. It is also committed to strengthening the security of the Jewish communities in Europe and the establishment of mechanisms for parliamentary action, special envoys and specific commitments of parliamentary groups against anti-Semitism. This working definition does not come from any Jewish lobby: it comes from cooperation between the Member States of the European Union and has been endorsed by the Commission, by the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights and Justice, Commissioner Jourová; for the action of the coordinator against anti-Semitic actions in Europe, Mrs Schnurbein, from the Commission. And my last message is that this has nothing to do, logically, with the sensitivity that legitimate criticism and the right to criticize the settlements and the violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian population arouse.

For years, hate speech and hate crimes against Jews were the domain of marginal groups and political movements. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is becoming a strong political stream in Europe. It is accepted and followed by many, often in ignorance of its real impact on people in our communities. Populist, anti-establishment movements use any kind of motivation to gain attention. This includes so-called ‘discussion’ of the Holocaust, and verbal and physical violence against Jews in European cities and the presence of Jews in the Middle East. This dangerous political rhetoric, however, leads us back to dubious discussion and debate about the legitimacy of the State of Israel. Democracy cannot be an excuse for allowing undemocratic forces to act. Jews in Europe have the right to live freely without fear. The State of Israel has the right to exist and protect itself. Any kind of questioning of this legitimacy cannot be part of a debate in this House or anywhere else.

This inclusion is a trap because it cuts off freedom of expression and the opposition of a large part of the diaspora to Israeli conduct. Insidiously it is suggested that the source of anti-Semitism may not be in the gaze of the anti-Semite, but in the person being viewed, including the Jew, if in disagreement with Israel or Zionism. To define anti-Semitism it is enough to say that it is hostility towards the Jew as a Jew, period. It is a hostility that precedes the birth of Israel.

Today, the theme of our debate is anti-Semitism. I therefore keep talking about the hate crimes and harassment against the Jewish population in Europe that have never stopped completely but rather been constant, flared up from time to time or lain dormant, but which have increased in recent years. In particular, the situation has worsened during the various Gaza wars, as many in our countries do not differentiate between the state of Israel and the Jewish population. As a result, it is no longer just those with Nazi sympathies who are harassing, but the group of perpetrators has become so many more. It also makes the problem so much harder to deal with. It is also very important that we make a clear distinction between justified criticism of what the state of Israel does - just as we criticize other countries and even our own when necessary - and hatred and harassment of Jews. It must be allowed to criticize the actions of the Israeli state, the settlement policy, etc., without being considered anti-Semitic for that reason. Today we take a stand on a definition of anti-Semitism that several have already addressed here. There is no consensus among Jewish organizations on the definition. The Jewish peace organizations, for example, are clearly opposed, as they believe that it risks restricting the free debate on Israeli politics. On the day that the various Jewish organizations can agree on a common definition of anti-Semitism, I will be happy to support it. On the other hand, I will not support the definition referred to in today's resolution. This does not mean that I am not behind the necessary work against anti-Semitism and most of the rest of the resolution.

Studies show that European Muslims are 10 times more likely to hold very unfavourable views about Jews than non-Muslims. There are two main reasons for the growth of the current strains of European anti-Semitism. The first is the anti-Semitic content of the Islamic tracts, the Qur’an, the Hadith and the Sunnah. The second is the dramatic growth in the number of Muslims in Europe over the last 50 years, a growth that is now spiralling upward. The problem is that many Muslims take literally what is written in their works of fiction. These works are full of exhortations for discrimination, hatred and violence, and not just against Jews, but Christians too. These hateful passages are being propagated by imams in mosques paid for by Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries. These are not extremist forms of Islam: these are literalist forms of Islam. The passage that always sticks in my mind is the one from the Hadith which says: ‘Judgement day will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews. The Muslims will kill the Jews and the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees. The rocks and trees will cry out Oh Muslim, oh faithful servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him.’  If European governments were serious about combating this problem, they would do two things immediately. First, stop all overseas funding of mosques and imams. Second, end the mass immigration of Muslims into European countries. Any future migration from Islamic countries should be on a highly selective basis only, and only those migrants prepared to make a solemn and binding pledge that they reject the passages of hatred and violence should be admitted.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "EFD"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "There are people who only speak for themselves and not for a parliament, I would say.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 124, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Mario BORGHEZIO", "mepid": "21817", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was necessary to wait for Mr Batten's intervention to hear about Islam.

Instead, it tries to propagate the multicultural society and offers diversity as a solution. That is well-intentioned, but naive.

Some of you mentioned that it must be a matter of solidarity to help and to protect people who are affected by anti-Semitism, but I must say that solidarity is not enough. We need to ensure security for all people, and speaking about security, we are in the field of criminal justice.  Some of you mentioned that we need a legal framework. I can only inform you about something you know yourself, that the Member States are very well equipped with the necessary legislation because we have the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia and the Member States are obliged to implement it in full – to to my regret, not all the Member States. In some Member States, the situation is not satisfactory because we still have some Member States where denial of the Holocaust, for instance, is not considered criminal wrongdoing under their criminal codes. We have many other problems with definitions and so on, but the Commission is pushing very hard on the Member States to have the legislation in place.  Speaking about criminal justice, I want to respond also to those who mentioned aggressive jihadism. This must be fought by means of criminal justice as well. We now have very strict legislation on combating radicalisation and terrorism. We have very strict rules and laws that enable our Member States to punish not only those who are the perpetrators of violent crime, but also those who are helping, who are supporting with finance, or who are supporting with information, shelter and so on. We are equipped and we have to act.  Speaking about criminal justice, however, I must say that for me, criminal justice is the last resort. We must do much more, because here in Europe we face the situation where we have a high number of people who are able to commit criminal offences against people of another race or another religion. Unfortunately, I have to say this is a happening in Europe due to the passivity of society and the silent acceptance by society. This is something we have already witnessed several times in our history and we need to do much more than prohibit criminal wrongdoing. We need to act against this passivity and help society to be much more vocal, to say this is not only prohibited – this is totally unacceptable. I am speaking about all sorts of violence against groups of people and minorities. I would warn very strongly against some attempts to impose collective guilt in Europe because we must never do that again. Today we had a very good debate with the IT providers, NGOs and the representatives of the Member States on combating hatred and hate speech online. You also mentioned it many times here and we agreed on the fact that we need to work together. We need to invest a lot and to use all our collective energy and determination against these phenomena, and we need to work in the direction of having a hate-free Europe. It is highly ambitious, but we have no other way. We have to do it and we have to try.  So thank you very much for all your comments. This debate has convinced me that we have to invest a lot of energy in combating not only anti-Semitism, but also all other kinds of hatred in Europe.

They have problems. According to them, Israel’s normal criticism of, for example, the country’s racist practices and many other issues related to fundamental freedom of speech and normal criticism would be anti-Semitism.

Despite the toll taken by the illegal annexation of Crimea and the Russian aggression in Donetsk and Lugansk, the Government has been conducting reforms on a scale that the country has never experienced before. The scope of the reforms is so ambitious that it is fair to say more has been done during the last two years than over previous decades. These processes happened while enormous economic strain existed due to the Russian embargo and transit ban.  The European institutions have always been supportive of the process of stabilisation and peace in the Ukraine. This has included not only support for the reforms but also micro—financial support, trade measures and, finally, the visa—free regime for Ukrainian citizens. Only yesterday, we heard that the Dutch Senate had voted on the ratification of the EU—Ukraine Association Agreement. These are all signs that our partnership is going strong.  In September last year, the Commission issued a proposal for granting temporary additional trade measures to Ukraine in order to increase its trade flows and support the country economically. These asymmetrical preferences in the Commission’s proposal include additional tariff rate quotas for agricultural goods and a reduction in duties for industrial goods. As the Commission did not provide for an impact assessment, due to the time constraints, this proved problematic for Members of the European Parliament. At this point it should be remembered that those preferences are on top of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement that entered into force at the beginning of 2016. As the first report on implementation is underway, we are not yet able to assess whether the preferences already granted are sufficient. In the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, concern was expressed about the timing and the choice of products. According to the opinion, the preferences target highly sensitive agricultural products that were hit by the series of crises and the Russian embargo. Furthermore, last year EU farmers experienced a record low harvest, while the opposite was true for the world’s other main exporters. I also received feedback from stakeholders regarding potentially sensitive products among industrial goods, which was reflected in their report. Taking all this into consideration, I think we have managed to achieve a balanced outcome in the Committee on International Trade. My report proposes the deletion of two agricultural tariffs, wheat and processed tomatoes, and one industrial tariff, urea, from the annexes. The report also tackles a number of challenges to Commission proposals, such as the need for checks and inspections in order to issue a movement certificate, especially when products stem from territory not under the control of the Government, and also Ukraine’s abstention from introducing discriminatory internal administrative measures, as well as the implementation of continued and sustained efforts with regard to the fight against corruption and illegal activities. I also emphasised the right for European industry to initiate a safeguard procedure. In the end, I believe that a detailed assessment of the implementation of these temporary alternative measures is needed. I am hoping for a strong majority tomorrow and a strong plenary mandate. Once this is obtained, my goal is to start the interinstitutional negotiations as soon as possible.

The Commission made the proposal in September and it is a reasonable and balanced proposal, granting better access to the EU market for certain agricultural products and certain industrial goods from Ukraine. The Commission has considered some sensitivities related to agricultural markets, for instance, and we have not included the most sensitive products such as poultry, sugar or fruits.  We propose to increase annual duty-free tariff rate quotas for eight agricultural products on top of what is already provided for in the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA). In some cases these additional amounts are small and will have no impact whatsoever on the EU market. In the case of other products, for example honey, the additional preference to Ukrainian exports will most likely simply displace imports from other countries, such as China, without affecting prices or import flows to the EU. Moreover, honey and processed tomatoes are examples of export products that will benefit small and medium-sized Ukrainian companies immediately. And in this context Ukraine is a net importer of EU agricultural products. By the way, neither wheat nor processed tomatoes are subject to the Russian food ban, and when it comes to urea, that will actually benefit European farmers because it will replace imports of fertilisers from Russia and give us a cheaper alternative.  Furthermore, we have recent free trade agreements negotiated by the European Union with Peru, Colombia, Central America, Vietnam and Canada. Here we already provide unlimited duty-free access for some of the agricultural products covered by the proposal, so why should we not do that for Ukraine, our friend and economically integrated neighbour? We also have in the proposal a specific safeguard that would suspend preferences to any of the products in the event of market distortion, and we are ready to consider reinforcing that clause, should you so wish, when we go into trilogue. So in sum, this is very much a political gesture. It is about sending a positive signal of EU support to Ukraine, helping the economy of a country which is suffering from the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol and military conflict provoked by Russia in the eastern part of the country. That is why I am very concerned about the report that the committee has adopted because it significantly reduces the scope of our proposal.  On the impact assessment that you have requested, let me just recall that the trade preferences cover a very small fraction of the preferences already in force in the DCFTA, so it is impossible to separate the two impacts. Moreover, the last sustainable impact assessment that we did for the DCFTA in 2007 forecast a deep market opening by the EU, and that is still valid. The economic parameters have not changed much, especially not on the Ukrainian side, and the impact assessed at that time was negligible for the EU market. You suggest applying stricter rules of origin to the products from the territories which are not under effective control of the Government of Ukraine. That would unfortunately lead to two different types of rules of origin applying to exports of the same product. It would be cumbersome, it would create legal chaos both for exporters and for the customs authority, so we oppose these amendments. This proposal, as I said, is a political gesture. I hope that we can work together, Parliament and the Council, in the trilogue so as to send a more constructive proposal to Ukraine and help its people and its economy in these challenging times.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 158, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Czesław Adam SIEKIERSKI", "mepid": "23787", "text": "author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. -  Ladies and gentlemen! Trade preferences for Ukraine proposed by the European Commission are unfavorable for some of the very sensitive agricultural sectors of the EU. These are mainly cereals, but also some fruits and vegetables. The markets for these products have recently experienced severe crises and the negative impact of the Russian embargo. This applies in particular to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are the gateway to the EU for products from the East. To avoid compounding the difficulties already faced by EU producers in the sectors most affected by current preferential imports from Ukraine, in its position on additional preferences, the Committee on Agriculture recommended the removal of the proposed tariff quotas for wheat (100,000 tonnes), maize (650,000 tonnes) and ) and processed tomatoes (5 thousand tons) and the reduction of the barley quota from 350 thousand to 50 thousand. tone. Despite the political and economic problems Ukraine is experiencing, in the face of the current difficult situation in European agriculture, in the committee we were unable to support such a significant increase in trade preferences for Ukraine in the agricultural area. The Union supports and should continue to support the reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy, including agriculture, but the proposed additional quotas are used very quickly and by few market participants. This aid does not go to a larger group of producers and traders, but only to a small group of oligarchs.

In recent years, in the most difficult conditions of war, occupation and prolonged conflict, Ukrainians have succeeded in delivering the unprecedented reforms we demanded of them. Now it is time for the European Union to show its support.  Due to the war, occupation and trade sanctions imposed by Russia, Ukraine has been losing markets in the East and faces economic hardship. In 2014 and 2015, GDP fell by almost ten percent and the reorientation of the Ukrainian markets towards the EU has been difficult. But now the economy is growing again – by 2.3% in 2016 – and it is a crucial moment to support Ukraine’s economy and development. These additional preferences to Ukraine will support recovery and help combat the economic consequences of a war that is still going on in the eastern part of the country. Some measures are asymmetrical but my conviction is that it should be that way. The war and occupation is actually raging in Ukraine and not here. In this respect, I welcome the prolongation of restrictive measures against the Russian Federation as long as the terms of the Minsk Agreement are not fulfilled.

After Canada, meat and grains, after Mexico, Mercosur, you have also started a dialogue with Australia. Today it is Ukraine, which is a real competitor to European agriculture.

Because, and that is the important reason, the data on economic development and the social situation in Ukraine are by no means satisfactory.

That is why it is politically very important that we continue to do everything we can to ensure that the Minsk Agreement is implemented. But I believe we must also examine what economic and social effects the implementation of the Association Agreement had and is having, namely under the question of whether the previous measures have been successful, and specifically successful, in terms of promoting development in Ukraine, or are they there there are other or other measures that should sensibly be taken? From my point of view, it is important that the support should not reach the oligarchs alone, but that it should improve the living conditions of broad sections of the population.

We are aware in the Commission that some products in European agriculture are sensitive and that this has been difficult for many European farmers. That is why we are working, together with my colleague Commissioner Hogan, to support those farmers, and we are also trying to open new markets for farmers. That is one reason why we have such an ambitious trade agenda, in order create such possibilities. European agriculture is of a very high quality, it is in demand and there are a lot of offensive interests, as well, for European agriculture in trade. When it comes to this specific proposal, it is – and I beg you really to read it – very modest. Fruit is not even in there and, when it comes to processed tomatoes and wheat, they are not subject to the Russian embargo. Please check your figures. I would also like to say that the urea will actually make it cheaper for European farmers to get access to fertilisers because we are lowering the tariffs there. So this is a limited, but for Ukraine a very important, proposal. We have looked very carefully into what we think is possible. We have specific safeguards that would suspend the preferences if there were any disruption in the market and we will supervise and monitor this very closely. We can reinforce that clause when we discuss it in the trilogue that I hope will start very soon. It is true that Ukraine has a lot of problems. Many of them are, of course, due to the conflict, but the country is also in the process of making painful reforms. They are working really hard to do that and a lot has been done in recent years. Yes, corruption is still high and, yes, there still a need to continue the reforms, but work is ongoing and we are supporting them and working with them.  Most of you say that we should support Ukraine. It is a neighbour, a friend and an ally, which has had a very difficult situation. One way of doing that would be to agree to this proposal. In July we will have an EU—Ukraine summit in Kiev, and having a political agreement on this proposal would be a great deliverable to bring with us to Kiev. It would show that we are on their side, that we do care and that we are here to support them. I believe that this proposal strikes the right balance between protecting sensitive agricultural areas and sectors here in the EU and providing some extra market opportunities to Ukraine. So I hope that when you vote, you can take the broader picture into account – the political and the economic one – and that we can soon enter into a trilogue in order to get a balanced proposal.

As you could hear, we have very extreme views in this House, from left to right, from one extreme to the other, and my goal from the beginning was very simple. I always had in mind help for Ukraine, but also I always remembered that protecting the interests of European farmers and producers is also important. So finding the proper balance was not as easy as it seems.  Here in the European Parliament a majority of us strongly support the reforms in Ukraine, and I believe that by introducing these additional trade measures we are helping Ukraine to develop, not only in the economic sphere but also politically. Keeping that in mind, I understand that we are going to have a very difficult time in the Council. I understand that the Council will present additional deletions of additional tariff lines, so we may have a problem with that, Madam Commissioner, and I hope that we can find a middle ground.  Tomorrow I hope that I will receive a very strong mandate, because this is the proposal of this House, and this is the starting point of the debate. I hope that we will be able to start the trilogue negotiations very soon, and I hold that we can conclude them as soon as we can.

The report highlights the asymmetric nature of the concessions granted by the European Union, which reduces tariffs faster than Ukraine. This asymmetry is justified by the difficult situation of the Ukrainian economy, which contracted by 9.8% in 2015. These concessions consist of the granting of quotas exempt from customs duties for certain agricultural products: wheat, barley, oats. , natural honey, processed tomatoes, grape juice and corn. Certain industrial products are also subject to partial exemptions. These concessions threaten the economic equilibrium of certain sectors. With regard to maize in particular, this additional quota of 650,000 tonnes per year could cause prices to fall, since the European Union is already in deficit with Ukraine on its maize imports.

As you know, we are now granting the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) to Sri Lanka and thereby we recognise and support the historic political change in Sri Lanka which began with the election of a new President and Government two years ago. That resulted in a Government that launched an ambitious reform agenda, including reconciliation and justice, after the end of a very painful civil war. A major political priority was to re-engage with the international community and the EU, so Sri Lanka reapplied for GSP+ preferences. An unprecedented achievement was also that Sri Lanka decided to co—sponsor the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights. I welcome the vote here in plenary on 27 April on GSP+, which, I believe, signals Parliament’s ambition actively to engage with Sri Lanka.  But of course this GSP+ is not a blank cheque. Just as with other GSP+ beneficiaries, the EU intends to hold Sri Lanka to its commitment to improve sustainable development, human rights and good governance. Sri Lanka will now be covered by one of the fundamental pillars of GSP+, the monitoring mechanism, which implies three things. Firstly, it implies written questions, the so-called scorecards, where we ask the GSP countries to detail how they are addressing shortcomings in the implementation of the relevant 27 international conventions. Secondly, we have regular dialogues with the authorities, as well as GSP missions and regular interaction with, for instance, the International Labour Organisation, the various monitoring bodies, business, trade unions and NGOs in order to have a broad and deep understanding of the situation in the country. Thirdly, we have a dialogue on human rights. With Sri Lanka we already have a well—functioning working group on democracy, good governance and human rights, and that is broader than the GSP+-related human rights conventions.  The information gathered during the GSP+ monitoring process is reflected in our biannual reports to Parliament and the Council. The next one will come by the end of this year. The European Parliament plays – you play – a very important role in this monitoring process because you submit relevant information to us and you use your political leverage to call for visible progress in GSP countries. So we will take the monitoring of Sri Lanka just as seriously as we take it for all the GSP+ beneficiaries. We are actually planning to do a first monitoring mission as early as next September to include Sri Lanka in the 2018 GSP+ implementation reports. The fact that we are now granting them GSP+ status does not mean that we are fully satisfied with the situation. We have been explicit that there are a number of shortcomings that need to be addressed. I have raised this with the relevant Ministers personally and we expect movement and progress from the Government on these issues. Some have doubts about the ability of Sri Lanka’s Government to implement tough reforms. However, it is undeniable that the human rights situation has improved with the new Government. We have also seen that the Government is resolved to act on controversial issues, for instance repealing and replacing the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act, and ensuring that persons arrested are not denied access to legal counsel. So I am confident that this measure, GSP+ for Sri Lanka, can help the country to develop its economy on sound foundations that respect human rights and labour rights, and that are environmentally sustainable. This is, of course, needed in a country which is struggling to find a way forward in a process of reconciliation after a very troublesome and difficult past.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Thomas MANN", "mepid": "1922", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues! My speech starts with condolences for the victims of the devastating floods and landslides in Sri Lanka last week. Is the country ready for the GSP + program? The EPP thinks: yes. It's not just about tariff reductions and not just about easier access to European markets. With almost a third of exports, the EU is Sri Lanka's largest market. It is also about supporting reforms through a contemporary agreement, such as strengthening the rule of law and the further development of human rights. As a member of the South Asia delegation, I have visited Sri Lanka several times and have been able to convince myself of the measures taken to pacify the country. Mine clearing, building destroyed villages, resettling people in their former homeland. Sri Lanka is involved in the UN Human Rights Council and has committed itself to reconciliation. They have achieved most of their Millennium Development Goals - in education, gender equality and health. But there are still problems: anti-terrorism legislation must be in line with human rights conventions, women's and children's rights must be further strengthened, and many allegations against the security forces need to be investigated.

But there are still loose ends and matters that have not yet been settled, such as the terrorism legislation or the power of the military. We also continue to hear from the UN rapporteur on human rights that the situation is still far from being right. That is why my position is: we give Sri Lanka the benefit of the doubt.

True, the country is slowly finding the right path of law and justice, but it has not yet made peace with the past, which is why it was important not to make concessions at this time, but to use them to leverage institutions and continue the reconciliation. However, the European multinationals crave privileged access to this country and its cheap labor, and here the Commission and Parliament give them the green light. Colleagues, I know that for many of you this is not the case, but for me the choice is not difficult between trade and human rights.

I would simply say: You have to make sure that the signed and ratified ILO Conventions 87 and 98, which enable union involvement and joint negotiation, are respected. And there we have a lot of incidents in Sri Lanka where that doesn't happen. That is why I would advise the monitoring group to pay particular attention to four points. Firstly, there is the question of the establishment of trade unions in companies. The 40% membership threshold is too high and registration is too complicated. That has to be changed. Second, we need to ensure that the minimum age for union membership is the same as the minimum age for taking up employment. It cannot be that younger workers are not allowed to become union members. Third, we need to make it clear that responsibility for labor relations rests with the Department of Labor and not with the Board of Investment and others.

The EU is already today Sri Lanka’s biggest trading partner, taking 30% of the country’s exports. Therefore, the potential to boost exports in clothing, fisheries, tea, spices, machinery and other products, as well as to attract investment, is of course considerable. This would bring clear benefits to the people and the local communities in Sri Lanka.  Granting GSP+ to the country gives a clear political signal to Sri Lanka that we, the European Union, want to engage, to invest in its sustainable development, to support a government which has as its prime priority to re-engage with the EU and the United Nations system, and to rebuild and reconcile the country after so many years of terrible civil war.  Nobody denies that there are still problems in Sri Lanka. It takes time to reform a country like this. We will engage with the government as we have done and we will deepen that engagement. We will be watching to ensure that they respect the 27 international conventions that they have signed up to. We will be watching the anti-torture legislation and the terrorist legislation. We will be watching the labour laws. We will be watching the situation for LGTBI persons. We are concerned about the criminalisation of homosexuality, for instance. Experience shows that a positive engagement with a GSP+ country contributes to economic development and creates platforms and possibilities for dialogue on all these issues with the government, of course, as well as with business, trade unions and civil society organisations. This in turn builds the building blocks for improvement. We will be dedicated to the monitoring and we will be looking forward to informing you on this process. As I said, we are already sending a mission in September this year, and I will be happy to report back when that mission has written its report. So thank you very much for your support on this.

As I have already said, I find the Council decision once again not to include police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the new Multiannual Framework for the Agency to be regrettable.  This is mainly for two reasons. First, I believe that from a legal point of view it is the wrong decision. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters have become part of European Union law and are therefore legally covered by the scope of the Agency’s tasks. The second reason is related to the evolving reality in the field of fundamental rights. Including police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the Multiannual Framework would better reflect the needs on the ground, by giving the Agency the right of initiative in these areas. Currently, the Agency for Fundamental Rights can act only upon request by the institutions to provide comprehensive analyses in these areas, which are of obvious relevance to fundamental rights. A change in this direction would send a very important signal, especially given the recent and ongoing legislative developments at EU level in this field. As already mentioned, this is not the first time that the Council has refused to include these areas of competence – as suggested by the Commission in its initial proposal – hiding its political will behind a legal argument. During the past month we have had a very constructive, open and transparent interinstitutional dialogue and, as rapporteur, I could not wish for a better working method. However, I would like to remind the Commission and the Council that the result achieved is not the end of the process, but actually the beginning. Tomorrow, hopefully – and I am pretty sure that this will happen – Parliament will give its consent to the Council decision and will vote on a joint motion for a resolution, which I proposed with the support of the majority of my colleagues in this House. The goal is to strengthen the opinions expressed by the Council and the Commission in their respective written statements, which were Parliament’s conditio sine qua non for giving our consent. I really appreciate the will demonstrated by both institutions to improve the working procedures for the governance and functioning of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and to clarify that the Agency’s competence also includes former third-pillar matters. However, fair interinstitutional cooperation will require additional action to be taken in the near future, starting with the Council and Commission agreement on the interpretation of the Agency’s founding regulation. Moreover, without prejudice to its right of initiative, I warmly invite the Commission, once the external evaluation of the Agency has been concluded, to present the proposal for amendments to the Agency’s regulation. This revision is necessary in order to improve the procedures for governance and for the functioning of the Agency, and to align the regulation with the Lisbon Treaty. Last but not least, I would like to thank the Agency for its good cooperation and to reiterate the importance of its work and its key role in the promotion of fundamental rights across the European Union.

Every five years the Council has to adopt this multiannual framework. It determines the thematic areas of the agency’s work on the basis of the agency’s founding Regulation (EC) No 168/2007. This is essential to ensure the continued functioning of the agency, which makes such an important contribution to fundamental rights in the Union, a work that the Council highly values.  I would like to inform you about the statement of the Council concerning the review of the Multiannual Framework 2018-2022 made in December 2016 and entered into the Council Minutes. I quote: ‘Under Article 30, paragraphs 3 and 4, of Council Regulation No 168/2007, an independent external evaluation of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights will be carried out in 2017. As stipulated in Article 31(2) of this Regulation, the Commission, after having assessed the evaluation report and recommendations made on that basis by the Agency’s management board, may consider submitting any proposals for amendments to the Regulation which it considers necessary. In this context, the Council agrees that it will consider carefully any proposals for amendments to the Regulation that the Commission may decide to submit, including those pertaining to the remit of the Agency to cover the areas of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The Council further agrees that it will consider carefully any proposals to improve procedures for the governance and functioning of the agency.’  The Council trusts that this statement will enable Parliament to give its consent to the proposed next multiannual framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency. This framework will allow the agency to continue to deliver high-quality work in the area of fundamental rights in the year 2018 and beyond.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 215, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Angelika MLINAR", "mepid": "125026", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, first of all I would like to thank Ms Mlinar for her constructive dialogue with all parties concerned and for proposing that the European Parliament gives its consent to the Council’s draft compromise text on the Agency’s Multiannual Framework for 2018-2022.  Like the rapporteur, the Commission deeply regrets that the text agreed in the Council excludes the thematic areas of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and indeed this is not for the first time.  The Commission has always insisted on the inclusion of these thematic areas in the Agency's Multiannual Framework. There is no reason why the Agency should not collect data on all aspects relating to the area of freedom, security and justice, especially in the current context. Police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters are extremely important in the fight against trafficking of human beings, organised crime and combating terrorism. There are also sensitive areas from the point of view of fundamental rights. It is important that the Agency can provide support through reliable and comparable data and the collection of best practices and initiatives.  We cannot ignore the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and its consequences. The pillars have disappeared, there is only one law of the Union. The Commission will thus continue to ask the Agency to carry out tasks in these areas, even if they are kept outside the Multiannual Framework.  The Commission made all efforts to have these thematic areas in the Fundamental Rights Agency’s new framework, but the Council has unfortunately not achieved the unanimous agreement necessary. The Commission prepared a formal written declaration regretting the exclusion of the set thematic areas, which we will ask to have included in the European Parliament, as well as Coreper and Council, minutes. Let me also underline that the external evaluation of the Fundamental Rights Agency is ongoing and will deliver its findings at the end of this year, and on that basis, the Agency’s Management Board will make recommendations to the Commission. At the end of this process we will see whether any modification to the Fundamental Rights Agency founding Regulation will prove necessary. This being said, and as also expressed by Ms Mlinar, it is crucial that the new Multiannual Framework of the Agency enters into force as of 1 January 2018. The consent of the European Parliament is essential and I would like to express my full confidence that the plenary will vote to give such consent, allowing for the final adoption of the framework in the Council by the end of this year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "József NAGY", "mepid": "124926", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. –  Madam President, dear colleagues, Commissioner, Minister, as the shadow rapporteur of the EPP, I would like at first to say thank you to our rapporteur Angelika Mlinar for her really great job and professional approach.

The FRA will be responsible not only for the protection of personal data, but also for migration, asylum and integration of refugees and migrants. Other important issues are racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, as well as children’s rights.  Last, but not least, the Agency takes care of the victims of crime and access to justice. However, some of you complained about their exclusion of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Our legal services confirmed that the current legal basis does not allow such an addition. As Madam Mlinar pointed out, it would be a highly sensitive change, but there is a possibility to adjust the thematic areas by changing the establishing regulation of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.

It is essential that FRA continues its work in this much—neglected field. To this end, I would like the Commission and the Council to encourage FRA to focus on anti—Gypsyism during their work on Roma issues, to prepare a study on anti—Gypsyism in the EU and in the candidate countries, and to monitor it in all the relevant fields.

Firstly, on the Agency's multiannual working framework - as has been stressed by colleagues and as mentioned by the Commissioner - I also deeply regret the absence of the two themes of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the multiannual framework of the Agency, while these themes are obviously relevant for fundamental rights and that there is obviously, even today, a lot to do in terms of respect for rights in this area . I deplore this all the more since the program demonstrates the Agency's ability to adapt, in general, to the new realities of our European society. And our agreement today, Commissioner, Mr Council representative, is basically given to you only on one condition: that the regulation establishing the Agency be rapidly amended so that it is finally competent in all areas relating to fundamental rights, that is to say to these police and judicial cooperation. Finally, secondly, our Union is founded on values. The latter are the subject of systemic threats to the rule of law and I would like us to be able to grant greater independence to the Agency, and for it to have the power of self-referral and investigation, to be truly , not only independent but also impartial and strong, and thus live up to our ambitions and our European values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 220, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Marina ALBIOL GUZMÁN", "mepid": "125048", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, the European institutions are not the closest to citizens, really, and that is why there is quite a lack of knowledge of how they work.

On data protection, the rights of children and disability too, we get such important material and studies for our work in all those fields from the Fundamental Rights Agency.

Instead of questioning itself, it tried to capture two new areas: police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Fortunately, the Council opposed it. The worst thing is that the Agency has developed a communalist conception of human rights which is at odds with the French republican conception.

I heard here the question: why do we have a Fundamental Rights Agency? I find it quite important in simple words to reiterate what the Agency does and why we have it. The Agency is doing targeted research, mapping the situation, explaining the trends, collecting data and providing all those findings to us, to politicians, so that we can take responsible political decisions. Too much is at stake now and we politicians must make proper and right decisions, especially now at a time of brainwashing of our society through fake news. I would even say that, maybe with some pathos, we said we have an existential need of truth-based evidence which will enable us to take the proper responsible decisions. An hour ago here in this plenary session there was a very important debate about how to combat anti-semitism and we also spoke about the rise of hatred in the EU in relation to other groups of people, too. We spoke about anti-Gypsyism and about the hatred against the LGBT community and against other vulnerable groups of people, and so I would like to stress here that the Fundamental Rights Agency should deal also with the matters connected to this, especially criminal justice, because we need to make sure that all these groups of people are secure and safe in the EU, and we need to have the proper data to guide us in what we should do on this in the field of judiciary and police cooperation. So this is why the Commission is now disappointed by the position of the Agency. Anyway, I would like to repeat my hopes that the European Parliament will vote positively on the Multiannual Framework of the Agency and we will look into the possibilities on how to improve the situation in the future for the FRA so that it can do the proper work which we all need so seriously.  COMMISSION'S WRITTEN STATEMENT The Commission regrets the lack of agreement on the inclusion of the proposed new thematic areas of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights' Multiannual Framework for 2018-2022. The Commission recalls that following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters have become part of Union law and are therefore covered by the scope of the tasks of the Agency, as all areas falling within the competences of the Union, under Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) n°168/2007. If these thematic areas are not included in the Council Decision establishing a Multiannual Framework for the Agency for 2018-2022, the Agency will continue to carry out its tasks in these areas upon request from the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission, under Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) n°168/2007. Following the external evaluation of the Agency in 2017, the Commission shall transmit the evaluation reports and recommendations to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions and make them public. After having assessed the evaluation report and recommendations, the Commission may submit any proposals for amendments to Regulation (EC) n°168/2007 which it considers necessary, as provided in Article 31(2) thereof.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 231, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, let me first say again that the Council attaches great importance to the work done by the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) in the area of fundamental rights.

Focused on the situation of migrant workers --who suffer disproportionately the most serious forms of exploitation (slavery, prostitution ...) - the work broadened the focus to realities such as those of the domestic, agricultural, hotel or construction sectors, in which many forms of severe labor exploitation generally go unnoticed.

Thank you, Commissioner Vella. Next week, many of the world's leaders will gather in New York to discuss how we can coordinate to manage our seas responsibly within the framework of the UN's agenda for sustainable development goals. It is just the start of a collaboration that can become a gathering of forces for the oceans, like the work that is going on to slow down climate change. In October, the EU will host the Our Ocean conference, which will further strengthen cooperation to save our seas. The climate on earth and our oceans are intimately connected. Two thirds of our globe consists of oceans and one third of land. Our planet would not have been habitable if the relationship had been the other way around. The oceans are needed to regulate the climate, to provide us with vital food, water and not least oxygen. Every second breath we take is oxygen that has been produced by the sea. In order for the oceans to be able to deliver all eco-services, we must keep them healthy and viable. We get alarm report after alarm report that tells of distant paradise islands in the Pacific Ocean that are soaked in plastic, of plastic particles that increase mortality and reduce the reproduction of small fish and crustaceans - those that form the very basis of the ocean food chain - and of overfishing and illegal fishing. As much as 15%, or 26 million tonnes of the world's total fishery, is illegal, according to estimates by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. In total, the fish is worth $ 23 billion. The \"black\" fish creates chaos in our markets and competes with fish from fishing companies that do the right thing. In addition, illegal fishing pulls away from the carpet for all efforts to preserve and manage our common fishing resources in a sustainable way. Inspiring more countries to take the step of actively combating illegal fishing will be one of the most important issues during next week's UN conference. More than three million people have fish as their main source of protein, and in many developing countries fishing is the most important employment and source of income for millions of citizens. As the struggle for resources intensifies, we must ensure that we manage them in the best possible way and that they are distributed fairly. Then there is no place for illegal fishing. Developing countries are particularly affected, as they lack the resources to control their waters and stop illegal behavior. In recent years, the EU has developed a framework of rules to better control fishing outside the Union's borders. It includes the Control Regulation, the Regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the Regulation on the authorization of EU vessels to fish outside Union waters. As for the last regulation, I am the rapporteur, and we are currently in final negotiations with the Council on a new legal text that is more comprehensive than the current regulation. We are taking a holistic approach to all EU boats fishing outside the Union's waters, including those fishing through direct agreements with third countries and those fishing in the high seas - something that has previously been completely unregulated. This is a big step forward. However, the regulations must not stay on paper - they must be followed up. The Commission's own evaluation of the Control Regulation and the European Court of Auditors' report, which came out this week, clearly show that much remains to be done before we can say that we have full control over EU fishing activities. It is completely unacceptable that some member states do their homework while others get away with completely ignoring the regulations. I expect the Commission to take its role as guardian of the Treaty seriously and put pressure on those who do not yet live up to our standards. At the same time, with the regulation on illegal fishing, we can put pressure on those fishing nations that do not live up to their responsibility as flag states, and that do not control the activities of their boats. Ultimately, the EU can stop the import of fish. When the EU, which is the world's largest importer of fish, closes its market - then it hurts. Unfortunately, there is however, still too many other markets are less meticulous, and the \"black\" fish finds other sales. That is why I want to encourage and encourage other states to follow the EU's example: to take responsibility as a market state. It is time to completely close the market for illegally caught fish. A first step is for more countries to adopt and implement the FAO's agreement on port state measures, which entered into force exactly one year ago. It is a regulatory framework that allows states to keep boats fishing illegally away from their ports. So far, however, only 46 countries have joined, and many of the major fish markets, such as China and Japan, are missing. It is now very good and gratifying that the world's oceans and fisheries are on the international agenda, where these issues belong. The EU is continuing its efforts to tackle illegal fishing. Hopefully the rest of the world will sit with us in the boat. We must continue to work hard to combat those who see our oceans as a haven for illegal activity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Linnéa ENGSTRÖM", "mepid": "128588", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Linnéa Engström for the question on the UN Ocean Conference which will be starting in five days in New York. The UN Conference, together with the Our Ocean Conference which will be hosted by the EU this coming October in Malta, will be the most important global ocean events this year. These two conferences are mutually reinforcing each other and will help us all to keep the momentum for action in the interest of our oceans. The UN conference will allow the European Union to showcase its leadership in making oceans safer, more secure, healthier, and above all, more sustainably managed. These are priorities for the European Union and its Member States, as set out in the joint communication on international ocean governance.  Sustainable Development Goal 14 can be a very strong driver for reinforcing ocean governance. This and other goals under Agenda 2030 are being actively pursued through many of the EU's policies, as we established in our communication in November on the next steps for a sustainable European future. For example, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to the protection of the marine environment and natural resources. This is based on an ecosystem approach aiming to achieve good environmental status of European marine waters. Our birds and habitats legislation provides for protection of the EU sea area through a network of marine protected areas - MPAs - as a part of Natura 2000. The European Union is tackling marine litter and pollution at source through its rules on waste management and prevention and port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, as well as through the circular economy. We have also set up a system for ecosystem-based maritime spatial planning in Europe. We have revised our common fisheries policy, and many stocks are now recovering as a result.  Our rules against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing ensure that our Member States implement their international obligations, keep illegally caught fish out of the European market and help us improve fisheries governance in third countries. Just last week we again showed our commitment to fight illegal fishing globally. We listed St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and the Comoros as uncooperative third countries. This is tantamount to issuing a red card which, amongst other consequences, effectively bans trade in fisheries products from these countries to the European Union. And we have also issued a warning, a so-called yellow card, to Liberia to encourage necessary reforms there.  I will also emphasise the importance of fighting IUU at the UN Ocean Conference on 9 June. The day after World Ocean Day I will host an event on the contribution of this fight to ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources. I will be joined by Ministers from Fiji and Guinea, two countries that benefited from cooperation with the European Union in the past.  Sustainable management and conservation of natural resources, such as biodiversity and fisheries, is also gaining importance in our trade and investment policy. For example we are including dedicated sustainability provisions in the relevant trade and investment agreements and we are also committed to eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies in line with target 6 of SDG 14. And that is why the European Union tabled a specific proposal at the WTO last October. We are now actively involved in WTO negotiations and hope to achieve a multilateral agreement on fisheries subsidies at the WTO eleventh ministerial conference in December in Buenos Aires. Finally, I am pleased to announce that the Member States and Council two days ago endorsed a list of clear and concrete voluntary commitments that the EU will present at the UN Ocean Conference next week.

In 2015, the leaders of G7 agreed on a declaration that highlights the importance of oceans governance science? The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposes 17 sustainable development goals, amongst them SDG 14 – the oceans goal – which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. However, only 2.18% of the world’s oceans have been fully protected as of today.  Our oceans cover more than two thirds of the earth’s surface and contain 97% of our planet’s water. Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods, the majority of world trade is conducted by sea and the importance of the blue economy cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, we take our oceans for granted. Eighty per cent of marine pollution and litter in oceans comes from land-based sources, and maritime CO2 emissions are projected to increase by 50% to 250% in the period up to 2050. Put simply, oceans, seas and coastal areas form an integrated and essential component of the earth’s ecosystem. The ocean is a primary regulator of climate and weather. Next month in New York the United Nations’ first global conference on the oceans will take place with the aim of developing a robust implementation framework for our oceans.

Starting with Mr Wałęsa, I agree that it is time to take more concrete action. That was the idea behind Vice—President Mogherini and myself launching the Ocean Governance communication last November. This is a very important way of moving forward, focusing our ocean governance strategy on three areas: first, to strengthen the legal framework; second, to reduce human pressures on the oceans; and, third, to continue investing in more research and more knowledge. I agree with Mr Serrão Santos that it is important, again, to move from commitment to implementation and for the European Union not to take the lead but to continue to lead, especially in the absence of the USA. I also agree with Ms Girling that we have come a long way but still have a long way to go. This applies not just to the European Union, because this is a global issue and what we are doing is not only within the European Union: we are tackling this at a high global level. I also agree with Mr Nicolai that Agenda 2030 is an ambitious agenda. I can assure you that, in the same way that we took the lead during the negotiation process, we will continue with that lead, even more importantly during the implementation phase as well. As I mentioned, eliminating gaps in the legal framework is one of our focus areas in the ocean communication. Fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) is another important aspect of our second area of priority, reducing human pressures on the ocean. I also agree that we have to walk the walk when we say that all countries and all continents have to do the same. We cannot possibly move on more, better and stronger legal frameworks if some of us have still not ratified the existing legal framework, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – and we are doing our best to push the countries in question to start committing to and implementing the existing legal frameworks. With regard to an instrument on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), a lot of progress has been made, and in the coming weeks one of the final preparatory meetings will take place. Again, we are pushing other countries for support.  With regard to international agreements, we all know what is happening in the USA. I have already mentioned elsewhere that international agreements are there to be honoured. We cannot discuss, commit to and then not honour our commitments. With regard to marine litter, this is a scourge and we are also addressing this, among other things through the new Plastics Strategy, which will be coming out before the end of this year. We are trying not just to address what has already happened in the ocean but to address this issue at source. We call it ‘marine litter’ but it is actually all land litter that ends up in the sea. Regarding encouraging blue growth, we recognise the ‘blue opportunities’ from the oceans, but we also recognise the environmental responsibilities that go along with this, and these environmental responsibilities come into play when we talk about deep-sea mining, drilling and so on.  Ms Goddyn, with regard to illegal fishing, using the red card is, I think, the most effective tool that we have – and we have used it. It has been effective because, when it comes to trade, we have seen countries which were traumatised when we used the red card but some of which, today, are our best partners when it comes to fighting IUU. Mr Millán Mon, it is true that our industry in Europe is one of the best regulated and, I should add, not just within European Union waters but in our external waters as well. One word of caution: we do, more than anything, want to support small—scale fisheries, but unfortunately – and I say this with a little sadness – small-scale does not always mean sustainable. I think we have to focus on what is sustainable and what is not rather than looking at what is big or small. With regard to quotas and where stocks are, we are doing our best. At the moment, the only pending issue, where everyone is saying that the stocks are doing well and we can utilise a higher quota, is probably tuna. We are waiting for the new quotas to come out. New scientific advice will be coming out in the next few weeks as well. Ms Bonafè again mentioned the fact that, unfortunately, President Trump is not complying. It was a very sad statement that we all followed today. My feeling is that this does not reflect what the whole of the USA is thinking because I know that NGOs there are totally supportive, as is a section of the private sector. I know that even some of states within the USA have already come up with their own plans for ocean governance and blue growth. Here again, the European Union is ready to take a stronger lead and I think this is the sentiment when we talk to other continents and other countries. They are not saying that if the USA is not taking on its commitment they will not take on theirs. No, it is the complete opposite of that: the sentiment is that, if a vacuum is created by the USA, we have to work harder and to do better to fill that vacuum.  Ms Pietikäinen, you said the same thing about taking a stronger lead, especially in terms of what we are seeing. I totally agree with you about the ecosystems. Very often, when we talk about ecosystems and biodiversity, we are referring to our biodiversity and ecosystems on land, yet we know that the oceans are home to more than 70% of the planet’s global ecosystem. With regard to the Arctic, we are pushing through our Arctic policy – which we also launched last year – to have a fishing moratorium and to agree that no fishing will take place before there is scientific advice on this. Mr Faria also mentioned the areas protected in the oceans. When it comes to protected areas, it is true that we have made more progress on land than we have in the ocean. On land we have managed to reach 18% to 20% of the surface area of the EU, whereas in the oceans we have barely reached 60%. So we have to do more work, not just to identify the areas but also to see how we are going to manage those areas because simply identifying the areas without having any management plans at all is not going to get us anywhere. I agree with Mr Caputo that the coming conference in New York is a unique opportunity for everyone to start showing their commitment. I would add that the conference in Malta in October is also a very important one. As I said in my speech, the two events are complementary and mutually reinforce one another. We are looking forward to the sequence of the other ocean conferences, the fourth one being in October.  Mr Marius, yes, regarding our fight against IUU, you mentioned China. China is a special case because we can see that it wants to be committed and is making positive signs, with a lot of willingness to cooperate. Just to let you know, we have set up the EU-China Blue Year this year, and tomorrow we are going to have a Chinese delegation – another Chinese delegation within a period of three months – to continue working on our EU—China Blue Year and, as I said, we will continue pushing to turn their willingness into action. I would like to thank everyone involved once again and I would like, in particular, to thank Ms Engström.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 254, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 128 (5) of the Rules of Procedure.I close the debate.The vote will take place on Thursday, 1 June 2017.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 255, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Norbert ERDŐS", "mepid": "124711", "text": "in writing. - Dear Mr. PRESIDENT!

The New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman once said: “The country that gets the greenest, the fastest, with the smartest technologies, that is the country that will lead the 21st century.” In view of the disruptive effects that digitization is already having today in many areas of industry, we must add that the development of these areas must be taken at least as importantly. We are actually dealing with a fundamental industrial revolution here. The countries of Europe with their historically grown industrial base, know-how and research landscape, qualified employees and a large domestic market have absolutely good prerequisites. But whether we will be able to use these prerequisites effectively together, to keep up with the competition between the various major economic regions for technological leadership in this digitization area, that remains to be seen. I think we need a common European vision. I think we need European coordination. We need the right framework conditions for infrastructure, investments and innovations. We need a focus on cybersecurity as a special profile of European development, and we have to pay attention to the social dimension. An integrated strategy for the digitization of industry must consider competitiveness through profit - for example in terms of material intensity or more efficient use of resources - just as sustainability can contribute to digitization, for example in the area of ​​energy transformation or circular economy - and good work. Because digitization can help to improve working conditions. For example, it can be used to create new, employee-friendly working time models, and it can even help to improve jobs in other countries had migrated, return. We must expressly take care - this was shared by all the groups in this House - that the economic dynamism that is developing is not at the expense of social and regional cohesion in the Union. Five points are important in the EU's common industrial policy on the digitization of industry. Firstly, that it is indeed part of a European industrial policy and that it does not stand alone; that when we invest and innovate in infrastructure, we pay particular attention to the fact that it benefits SMEs; that when it comes to cybersecurity and the secure flow of data, we emphasize that this should be the profile that we particularly want in Europe; that we are not left behind when it comes to standardization policy and that we also have to reformat certain elements of our competition policy. We must not ignore the social challenges, the upheavals that can go hand in hand with them.

I believe that we in the European Parliament are united and have a common aim to make a coordinated 5G Action Plan for Europe. We are sending a clear message to the Member States, regions and all stakeholders, that Parliament supports all efforts to reach a comprehensive approach for timely deployment of 5G. 5G is more than a mobile revolution; it will be an innovation engine, bringing disruptive change across industries, creating new quality networks and very high-capacity networks. 5G will enable new high-quality services, which will ultimately improve the customer experience for increasingly sophisticated and demanding digital users.  What do we need to make the vision of 5G real? We need the rules to be future-oriented, pro-investment, pro-innovation and in accordance with the principle of infrastructure-based competition. Investments are the key for achieving 5G goals. The simplification of the legal framework, flexible models for co-investments, and long-term certainty and predictability are required. We need a clear understanding of what 5G means for all of us. The next generation of ultra-high broadband infrastructure will support the transformation of processors in all economic sectors – healthcare, energy, utilities, transport, automotive industry, virtual reality – and provide flexible and highly personalised services that improve every citizen’s life. We need 5G systems that are able to operate over a very wide frequency range, from below 1 GHz up to 100 GHz. The frequencies of 3.6 GHz and above 10 GHz should deliver extreme data rates and capacity in dense areas.  We need the cooperation of all stakeholders in order to fulfil all the conditions within the required timeframe. The key is to harmonise the spectrum allocation processes. The Member States should understand that we have to avoid the fragmentation of decisions and solutions if we want to achieve the 5G objectives. The effective collaboration of all – the European Commission, BEREC, the Member States, business, regions and regional authorities and consumers – is necessary. We need to develop financing for the 5G Action Plan in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. It should be at the proper level and use financial instruments, as well as subsidies, if we want to solve the problem of high -quality Internet accessibility in rural areas. Of course, we need to incentivise private investments, but we also need to have public support. We need to ensure coherent and timely actions at regional and city level. It should encourage cross-sectoral innovation and foster an industry-wide economic cooperation framework.  The first step is key. The timely implementation of the changes in all national broadband plans with country-specific recommendations. We need to make sure that 5G will be developed as an integrated set of solutions, and there must be tests and large-scale pilots in all sectors and countries at the same time.

The communications on a European Gigabit Society and the 5G Action Plan for Europe identify the tools needed to bring this about. The Commission has recently reported on the status of the initiatives presented in these communications as part of its mid-term review of the progress of the Digital Single Market.  The effectiveness of the proposed actions depends largely on the engagement of Member States and of the European institutions, in close cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, to provide the policy, regulatory and financial support that is required.  I also want to underline that, for achieving our vision of connectivity, we need to change the regulatory framework. The Commission proposed ambitious reform of electronic communication rules, which is essential for deployment of 5G and broadband, Without better coordination of spectrum, we would not be able to achieve connectivity that is needed for tomorrow. Your report also stresses the importance of mobilising the necessary financial resources, as well as the use of EU financial support to leverage public and private investments. We have to combine structural funds, national, regional and private funding. This report and the endorsement by the European Parliament of the new 2025 strategic objectives for internet connectivity in the Digital Single Market will be an important step. We look forward to working with the European Parliament and the Council on the key elements of the proposed strategy, in line with your resolution, as well as on the related legislative proposals, including the necessary investment-stimulating reforms in the European Electronic Communications Code. All these steps are essential to make the European Gigabit Society a reality. When it comes to digitising industry, the report by Mr Bütikofer very much highlights how to make the digital transformation a successful revolution, from developing digital infrastructure supporting businesses to helping workers acquire the right skills.  We presented our strategy to digitise European industry one year ago. Since then we have made substantial progress. As Vice-President Ansip has already informed you, €3.5 billion over the next 3 years will be allocated under the Horizon 2020 programme for investment in key technologies and their integration along the value chain, as well as for digital innovation hubs. At the Digital Day held in the Rome in March, we launched an EU-wide forum to coordinate national plans to digitise industry - the European platform of national initiatives on digitising industry. In Rome we also reached a very important agreement on high-performance computing. Today, scientists, researchers and engineers need access to world-class HPC to process vast amounts of data. It could be to simulate a complete airplane, for climate modelling, for genome sequencing or for understanding the human brain. Several EU governments committed to supporting the next generation of computers and we expect more Member States to join the initiative.  Your report rightly identifies that the big challenge ahead is the mobilisation of the necessary financial resources and the use of EU financial support to leverage public and private investments. We have to mobilise and pool structural funds, national, regional and private funding to achieve our objectives. I welcome your suggestion to study future sources of investments for industrial digitisation.  The report also highlights two important issues which are at the heart of the Digital Single Market review - data and cyber security. At present, data flows and access to data are often held up in the EU by localisation rules or other technical and legal barriers. Restrictions on localisation prevent the scaling-up up of SMEs providing cloud computing or data hosting services. As announced in the DSM midterm review, the Commission will present a proposal on the free flow of data in autumn. Regarding cyber security, as we saw less than three weeks ago, cyber attacks are a constantly evolving global threat. Later this year we will review the EU's 2013 cyber security strategy, present certification and labelling measures to make IOT devices more cyber-ready and review the role of the EU's Agency for Network and Information Security to make certain it can help EU countries respond adequately.  The European Commission is working on making sure European businesses and citizens can fully benefit from the digital transformation. We need to develop an inclusive digital society whilst boosting European competitiveness.

We can have very nice figures about data, speed and machines, but the bottleneck, obviously, is in the lack of human resources for this big transformation. Already now we can say that the number of unfilled high-level digital jobs is approaching 800 000. If you look at the gap between the skills needed and the available skills, the gap in the level of education in different countries, it is really worrying. When we look at the labour market, one third of jobs will be deeply influenced by this transformation; this will require retraining of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of workers in Europe. That means that this EUR 3.5 billion that Mr Ansip is talking about should not be spent only on machines, but also at the same level on the development of human resources for Europe.

It gives an advantage to economies with large resources of engineering and IT staff, while the importance of low labor costs will decrease, so Europe has a chance to regain a large part of production from cheap Asian markets. However, we should not forget about the differences within Europe. And the digital revolution is also an opportunity to reduce the differences between different parts of Europe. You only need to be able to take advantage of this chance, otherwise the existing inequalities will rather worsen. Actions must be taken now to prevent this.

It is almost impossible to keep up. The use of the Internet alone surpasses everything predicted about it so far. There are already 5 billion cell phones for 7 billion people. The rise of machine-to-machine communication is shooting up to 50 billion interconnected devices. We are moving from a mega-bit society to a gigabit society. Shang Bing, the chairman of China Mobile, said it very nicely: connectivity is like oxygen, we can't live without it. Only 25 years ago, the 2G technology was introduced, which allowed us to send text messages on our mobile phones in addition to calling. With 3G, photos were added, with 4G videos and now we are growing to 5G with virtual reality. Actually, up to 4G it was mainly about connecting people, while 5G will also connect things, the internet of things. We will have an industry with smart devices and advanced self-healing networks that provide all the information and products we want 24 hours a day. Extremely high numbers of transactions are settled and data flows analyzed. This digital revolution is turning all kinds of business models upside down worldwide. Many opportunities arise to do things better, faster and cheaper. If we want to continue to play our part in the global economy in Europe, we must ensure that we are ready for the 5G society and create the right conditions for entrepreneurs to do business. We must ensure good digital infrastructure and innovation-friendly regulations, while offering the right guarantees for individual freedom and privacy. We must seize the opportunities that 5G offers.

For this reason, the public sector cannot remain impassive and must regulate the technological changes that are taking place, ensuring that labor legislation continues to apply to dependent workers and subcontractor chains under equal conditions, because otherwise we will generate a new focus of inequality. Faced with the fragmentation of the world of work and new figures that will emerge, a legal framework must exist and be strengthened that protects collective bargaining and the right to strike; in short, that rights are guaranteed.

The implementation of these and other key technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence and quantum technologies will be crucial for companies to become more competitive and thus able to create growth and jobs. The successful entry into the gigabit society is, however, associated with high costs. Costs for expanding the digital infrastructure, for research, development and innovation and costs for training. There are currently around 180,000 IT professionals lacking in Europe. The teaching of digital skills must therefore also increasingly flow into the curricula of schools and universities.

It is important to talk about digitalization, and boldly. The sector in Europe employs 6 million people and accounts for 4% of the European Union's gross domestic product. It is important to note that about one third of the growth of industrial production is already happening thanks to the introduction of digital technologies. In other words, the industry is benefiting from digitalization. Nearly 100 billion euros a year are expected revenues. But this result will not be achieved with a single effort. We need coordination of national and regional initiatives and exchanges of good practice, we need joint solutions and common standards to promote the development of the Internet of Things and cross-border data movement. But in addition to concrete investments and added value for digital infrastructure, the digitalization of industry also needs prepared human resources. Forty percent of workers in the European Union do not have enough digital skills. And that is exactly what we advocated in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I am glad that these positions of ours are reflected in the final report. Now is really the time for the new Member States to show that we know how to do this best - to change, to embrace it, to change our industries and to skip the stage of the development cycle, as we did with the internet infrastructure.

This is essential if we are to establish a digital single market. Ensuring access to broadband across all the Member States and implementing new-generation networks are two of the most important issues for the success of the digital agenda. The creation of a European society where all citizens have access to fast and high quality internet connection is essential in opening up the digital single market, not just for urban areas but everywhere. In my own country, the digitalisation of rural Ireland is akin to the electrification of Ireland over half a century ago. The influence of the digital economy will be the driving force in balancing the rural economic environment. Leading the way, as a demonstration of what is possible if rural communities are given access to high-speed broadband, is the Ludgate Hub in my own constituency in Skibbereen in County Cork – a little town, by the way, that produced five European rowing champions last weekend. The objective of the Ludgate Hub is to facilitate 75 digitally working entrepreneurs, thus creating a wealth of new jobs in the West Cork area.

Through 5G, I think we can change our way of life and live in Europe with new services, a new healthcare area, new education reforms, and so on. Secondly, we need to take comprehensive action, so we need to work at the same time with many sectors of industry, we need to cooperate with regions and cities and, first of all, we need closer cooperation among Member States because certain decisions will depend on Member States. Thirdly and importantly, this is a way to create new competitive advantages for the European economy and European industry.

The behavior of the operators is evidenced, for example, by the fact that in the last few days some Czech operators have restricted roaming services without a clear reason.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 325, "date": "2017-05-31.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I dedicate this one-minute speech to denounce the direct and indirect effects of a so-called online game, Blue Whale, the cause of dozens of suicides among the youngest. Continuing to call the chilling phenomenon of the Blue Whale a game means diminishing its gravity and relegating a practice that has its roots in an adolescent and social unease that cannot and must not be underestimated to an almost playful environment. Many media continue to talk about the Blue Whale game in the wrong way: sensationalizing suicides is a mistake and risks generating emulative phenomena. We need to pay more attention because words not only describe reality, but have the power to change it. However, the main area of ​​intervention must be family and social.

The Democratic Unionist Party received an envelope stuffed with the grand total of GBP 436 000 to advertise support for Brexit in Britain but not in Ireland. The unanswered question is who paid the DUP? Did anyone fumble in a greasy till? The DUP has been asked to report on the original source of this money. There are concerns that the DUP allowed the money to be siphoned to avoid British electoral law and exploit a loophole. Serious allegations by openDemocracy linked the previously unheard of Constitutional Research Council and the well-known Saudi intelligence to the cash. Whoever the donors are, we know that the DUP took the Brexit money, but we will pay the price.

That is why I invited today to the European Parliament a group of children from the Romanian diaspora in Belgium, whom I thank for showing me a new perspective on our activity. But things are not so simple: 26 million children in Europe are affected by poverty and social exclusion according to Eurostat. Unfortunately, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary lead in the top of child poverty, so we need a guarantee for children at European level, to ensure their access to education, culture or proper nutrition.
