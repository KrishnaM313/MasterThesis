But at this point in time as we are meeting in December 2016, I would like to say to you that our internal work in the Commission is now almost entirely complete. We have presented to you over the past two years the strategy, the legislation and the enabling environment for turning the Energy Union from a catchy buzzword to the reality we live in.  With last week’s package we are 90% done with what we have promised, and now we very much need the European Parliament to make sure that the Energy Union also becomes a legal reality. We need to work together to make sure that we start the co-legislative process as early as possible. Of course, last week’s package was rather a big one. It has eight legislative proposals and some important political communications and reports, so I shall just focus on the three main goals: how to put energy efficiency first; how to achieve global leadership in renewables; and what we can do to provide a really fair deal for our consumers.  As you will have already noticed, this package is bound to have a huge impact on jobs and growth. It could generate around a 1% increase in GDP in the next 10 years. It could spur investment of EUR 177 billion and it would directly improve the life and quality of our citizens. On this last aspect it was very important for us to have a particular social component in the package, particularly for those who have difficulties in paying their energy bills, and to make sure that the transition we are starting will be a transition which we can call socially fair.  As you can imagine, because of the time constraints I will not be able to go into the details of the overall package, so I will just focus on some elements of the new governance systems we are proposing. When we discussed it the last time, in December 2015, you were very much inviting the Commission to present a legislative proposal on the governance. We listened very carefully to you and we proposed such a proposal. It serves three objectives.  First, it streamlines the different planning and reporting obligations, and we are making sure that we will really get rid of overlapping reporting obligations, we will align the reporting in terms of frequency and timing, and I believe that what we are putting on the table is in full accordance with the reporting and planning of the Paris Agreement. So it will allow us to continue to play a leading role in the Paris Agreement implementation. Secondly, you have been very much calling for increased transparency and more predictability, which we introduced into the system as well because we see them as two essential conditions to attract investments and indeed to fundamentally transform and modernise our economies. Thirdly, we are proposing a mechanism that is solid and robust so we can collectively reach all the Energy Union’s objectives, in particular the 2030 targets, and to put Europe firmly on the road to a low-carbon economy and society. How do we want to achieve it? The key instrument will be the national energy and climate plans, plans that have a long-term perspective of 2030 or even 2050. The plans will cover all five dimensions of the Energy Union and will be the result of consultations with other neighbouring Member States because we know how important regional cooperation in this aspect is.  We would like to make sure that the work on these plans will start swiftly because we would like to see the final form by the beginning of 2019, and this will be an important goal of my second Energy Union which I would like to start in February next year and where I hope some of you, as we did the last time, could join me.  Then we will have a system of biannual reports and every year we will also issue a report on the Energy Union, where we will analyse the overall situation in Europe and where we will also if needed issue the necessary recommendations. I see that time is flying by. Therefore, Madam President, I would like to pass the floor, if you will allow, also to Commissioner Arias Cañete so that he can go into more detail on the concrete legislative proposals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, as explained by Vice-President Šefčovič, the main building blocks of the legislative proposals cover energy efficiency, renewable energy, the design of the electricity market and governance rules for the Energy Union. Let me start with energy efficiency first. We are proposing, as we promised, a European Union binding target of 30% for 2030, up from the current target of at least 27%. A 30% target is the most cost-effective option by 2030. It will create about 400 000 more new jobs, reduce gas imports by 12% and save EUR 70 billion in fossil fuel import bills. For buildings, a sector which accounts for 40% of Europe’s energy consumption, we are proposing to speed up the renovation rate and promote the use of innovative and smart technologies. This will boost activity and revive employment in the construction and engineering sectors. As examples of concrete measures we propose prolonging the savings obligations in order to contribute to the energy efficiency target, deploying about five million electric vehicle recharging points, and encouraging greater use of renewable energy in buildings, which is currently just 16%. With this set of measures, our proposal will speed up investment in the renovation of buildings, create a building renovation market with a value between EUR 80 and 120 billion in 2030, lower energy bills for consumers, and take up to 3.2 million households out of energy poverty. Last, but not least: for products, the Commission has adopted a new Ecodesign Working Plan. On renewable energy, our aim is to be world leaders, maximising the use of renewable energy in buildings, transport and industry. Our new rules will ensure that the renewable energy target of at least 27% by 2030 is reached. First, we are putting the investment framework right by consolidating several core principles for support for renewable energy in European Union legislation. We move away from national schemes and propose a progressive Europeanisation through cross-border opening of support. We want to put an end to retroactive changes in support, and we call for simplified administrative procedures to get the projects up and running. Second, we propose measures for the sectors which have the highest potential for the deployment of renewable energy: transport, heating and cooling, and electricity. In transport the proposed measures will boost the use of advanced biofuels, electricity and renewable synthetic fuels. We have proposed an ambitious mandate of 6.8% by 2030, with a strong component of 3.6% of advanced biofuels. On bioenergy in particular, after many years of uncertainty, we are introducing strengthened sustainability criteria for biomass. Also, in line with our earlier position, we propose to progressively reduce the contribution of food-based biofuels to meet the European Union’s renewable target: from 7% in 2021 to 3.8% by 2030. This is both realistic and proportionate. The Renewables Directive also includes a number of options for Member States to increase their share of renewable energy in heating and cooling supply by one percentage point per year until 2030. Furthermore, our proposal opens access rights to local district heating and cooling systems for producers of renewable heating and cooling and waste from industry, and third parties acting on their behalf. This takes me to the third area: renewable electricity. Our target of at least 27% also means a 50% share of renewables in our electricity mix. Here the proposed Renewables Directive and the new market design proposals work hand in hand. We are overhauling the electricity market, and we do so mainly in two ways. First, by changing the rules of the market. The new market rules will promote a more flexible market. Sharper price signals will prompt investment in demand response, storage and quickly reacting generation. Our proposals will make trading easier by better integrating short-term markets. Second, by fostering regional cooperation. We will create Regional Operational Centres where transmission system operators will cooperate to ensure optimal use of the European electricity grid and better security of supply. And we will set up a Europe-wide DSO entity to coordinate the operation and planning of the transmission and distribution networks. Third, by giving a European dimension to security of supply. We will develop common rules on crisis prevention and tools to ensure cross-border cooperation to confront new threats to security of supply, such as cyber-attacks. And we will establish a common framework for capacity remuneration mechanisms. This framework will build on a wider European adequacy assessment. All available capacities, including in neighbouring States, will be taken into account and this will make sure that the right amount of capacity is identified. We provide rules the rules to ensure cross-border participation. This is a big change compared with today, and it will keep costs to consumers to a minimum and preserve the functioning of the internal market. But I want to be very clear on one more point. Capacity mechanisms will not be used as a backdoor subsidy for high-polluting fossil fuels. That would go against our climate objectives. That is why we have set a limit of 550 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour for new plants, and existing capacity mechanisms also have to adapt to the new rules in due time. In all of this, our European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) will ensure the proper regulatory oversight. We propose therefore to reinforce ACER’s powers to meet these tasks. Finally, allow me to underline one of the essential elements of the package, namely putting consumers at the centre. The new rules will enable them not only to be more informed or to change their provider more easily, but to be able, if they want, to produce their own renewable electricity and be paid for electricity they feed into the grid. In that case, their contribution to the grid costs should be fair and cost-reflective while they continue to benefit from facilitated access to the market – the so-called priority dispatch. I expect this complete set of proposals will be adopted by the co-legislators as quickly as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Krišjānis KARIŅŠ", "mepid": "96901", "text": "On behalf of the EPP Group. — Chairman! Commissioners! The initiative that the European Commission comes with is perhaps the biggest policy initiative in the last decade. Its importance can not be underestimated. Specifically, what has driven our energy policy so far — for the last fifteen, maybe even twenty years? It's been climate policy. The surface is to reduce harmful emissions — CO2 gases — or reduce climate change — what we as humanity do. And thanks to this policy, we have subsidized renewables and these technologies have evolved in a way that we have wind farms, solar generators and so on today that we have a real alternative to fossil fuels. With this initiative, in fact, we will replenish our policy arsenal by introducing another principle that could be quietly translated as price competition. We will now also be thinking about how to ensure that prices are as low as possible for the consumer and industry, and its response and the way we will do that is by putting in more competition, allowing the market to determine what capacity should be in place. We know that subsidies have been necessary so far, but now we have to look at where and how we can maybe move away from that and let the market take over what the subsidies have launched because the market is mature for it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Kathleen VAN BREMPT", "mepid": "5729", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — (NL) Thank you, Commissioner, not only for being here, but also for having approved your winter package in good time at the appointment and sent it to Parliament. There is a huge package of dossiers, legislative and non-legislative, and I can assure you that our group is ready to go ahead and, together with other groups, to ensure that this package gets through Parliament quickly and well. It's a good base to leave. But - and there is always a but - the level of ambition should be even higher in our group. We are one day after one year after the Paris Agreement, and for us this agreement, the COP 21, is the one to which all other initiatives should be covered. In that respect, it is important to strengthen the level of ambition. We are delighted with the binding energy efficiency targets. We think that is great, but as you know, this Parliament has already voted for a binding target of 40%. That is feasible, it is good for climate policy, but also for employment and also for energy poverty in Europe. I'll come back to that later. Two, renewable energy. Good, but not good enough. In fact, you have abandoned the ambition to impose binding targets at Member State level, which have worked so terribly well in the past. We therefore need better targets for renewable energy. I am also linking the priority dispatching to that. There is no point in focusing on renewable energy and giving priority to fossil fuels, which are easier or more expensive to disconnect. Finally, our group is very much in favour of the initiatives presented on energy poverty. We want to support and strengthen them.

Indeed, the package presented by the Commission is very extensive, with a dozen legislative projects and hundreds of pages, so there is a lot of work waiting for us. But therefore it should not be considered hastily or under pressure and the treaty allocation of powers between the Member States of the Community should be maintained, mindful of the right of States to establish their own energy mix, the right to choose ways to achieve Community objectives, e.g. decarbonisation. Moreover, the balance between the two objectives of the Union's energy policy, climate protection and energy security must be remembered. Some proposals in this respect raise doubts, for example, contrary to the Union's push for increasing energy independence is the Commission's proposal for the formation of power markets in the Member States, above all the proposed emissivity limit. In practice, it means allowing only gas units to create capacity markets. Similarly, the exclusion of biomass as a source of RES is at odds with the technological neutrality guaranteed to date in increasing renewable energy production. Concerns are also raised by the concept of a financial platform, centrally managed by the European Commission. There may also be doubts about the proposal to establish a legally binding energy efficiency target of 30 per cent. This remains at odds with the December 2014 climate summit findings.

Thank you very much the Commissioners, too, for being here and preferring the bills we have at hand. This represents perhaps the biggest energy policy bill we had in the history of Europe and is important from very many perspectives. Partly to ensure that we cope with the geopolitical challenges and security threats that energy policy actually poses when we are unable to ensure that our industry and our consumers can be supplied with their own energy, but we depend on a third power to ensure that we cope with the heat in winter, industrial production and low energy prices for our citizens. At the same time, this energy package also places in a larger climate policy challenge. And it is important to remember that the summer package also forms part of the big picture of this, and also the ETs that we are right now in at a stage of trying to finalise. It also gives at hand that we need to have a discussion about what are subsidies and what are not subsidies. It always strikes me in the debate, as one of those who advocate renewable, that as soon as there is a push for renewable energy, then we get a debate about it being massive subsidies. But all the billions of euros ploughed into coal, into gas projects, they are seen all the time as ventures and as something that matters to industry. I think both will fill their function in the European energy market for the foreseeable period. But it is to ensure that we meet the climate targets we have set, low prices for energy so that we cope with electric intensive industrial production in Europe, that we cope with low prices for consumers and that we do so in an environmentally sound way.

They have been calling from 2012 to supervise the energy plans of states and to have overpowers, thereby circumventing the sovereign rights of states. Although some progress is being made in promoting energy efficiency, the target set for a 30% increase by 2030 is a serious reduction compared to the 40% set by the European Parliament. So is the target of 27% consumption of renewable energy sources, instead of the 30% or more requested by the European Parliament. It is also a bad thing that the priority of entry into the networks of renewable energy sources is put to an end.

But - and of course there are good elements in this package - there is a lack of vision. Why do you call this package ‘clean energy’? Why do you not call it green energy? Because the future can only be renewables. Look at the costs. 50% renewable electricity in 2030, with full electrification of transport, bringing more heat and electricity: that is too low, sorry; get up your numbers.  If there is one thing which is unacceptable in this package it is your costs on renewables. How is it possible that the Commission suggests that an offshore wind park costs EUR 90 [per MWh] in 2050 when we have seen one last week which cost EUR 49 in 2016? You need a reality check when it comes to the cost reductions of renewables, and you need a reality check when it comes to ETS and how well or badly it functions. This is not building trust.  The second thing is that this package is not building trust for the market. Yes, Krišjānis, let the market take over, but not only for renewables. What is a market where coal pollution costs EUR 4 per tonne? What is a market where German power companies have to pay for the decommissioning, while France is organising a EUR 100-billion-plus tax subsidy for decommissioning? I want the market to take over, but it must be a market which is fair not only for renewables but also has to address coal and nuclear costs.  And it is not building trust with governments. Governments are not happy. Why? Because you cannot coerce governments by forcing them to open their support schemes. That is not building trust: forcing them to split, or suggesting that they split countries up into two or more zones, forcing them to open cross-border lines without any security margins. That is not building trust. We need to go beyond borders, but therefore we need concrete plans. For the Baltic Sea, how do we link desynchronisation, which is a political must, with offshore wind farms? For south-east Europe, how do we reduce capital costs in non-euro countries like Bulgaria and Romania, and help Greece? How do we get 100% renewable fast-charging stations between Germany, France, Italy, Benelux? Concrete projects: why do we not have a financing scheme to help citizens’ cooperatives.

Almost they had escaped us. I refer to data from the International Monetary Fund and direct and indirect subsidies in the EU to fossil sources, in the year of the Lord 2015amounting to three hundred billion euros per year, quantification reported by Yourself, I am sure, therefore, with your authoritative endorsement. Quantification? Yes, we are 500 million citizens, as a matter of fact I do not know how long, the year-per-capita subsidy for infants and the elderly is therefore equal to these six hundred euros. In the face of this scandal everything else pales, it is a disgrace, five hundred million times shame. I genuinely appreciate the work of those who have drafted four thousand and over pages of professional documents, precise and interlinked, but they lack a capital thing: dirty and lethal fossil energy, climatically, sanitarily and geopolitically it doesn't have to be subsidized more than what you call clean yourselves: I find it immoral, obscene and anachronistic, in fact suicidal.

Climate stability, circularity, thermodynamic balance, only certain and eternal rules such as death, to which we must respond.

Commissioner Šefčovič, you said that 90% of the work is done with this. And it is certainly also possible to establish and ensure that the EU can play a leading role in the field of environmentally friendly energy systems globally. The current package has three main priorities, namely increasing energy efficiency, the EU's global market leadership in the field of renewable energy, and a particular focus on consumers. There are opportunities for consumers in that they have been ensured a much more active and vital participation in the energy markets. They have a wider choice of providers, access to more reliable price comparison tools and the ability to generate and sell their own electricity, which will lead to a significant reduction in electricity prices. The ecodesign measures alone will deliver annual energy savings by 2020 in line with Italy's energy consumption, and households can save up to €500 per year. Similarly, ecodesign alone opens up great opportunities for businesses and an additional revenue potential of €55 billion. There are also great opportunities for industry as clean energy has attracted global investment of €300 billion last year alone. In order to achieve the 2020 targets, it will be another 379 000, notably for the construction industry by amending the Directive on the energy performance of buildings, and a market of €120 billion, in particular for SMEs.

Renewables are an important factor, but complementarity with other current energy sources, be it nuclear, geothermal installations, hydropower plants or biogas produced by methanization. Of course, coal is not the panacea, quite the contrary, and it will be necessary to gradually replace it, perhaps by gas, before leading to a greater development of renewables. However, in this area, we need research — as we have said — and I wonder, because we had pilot projects to capture and store carbon.

On the other hand, the package also gives us another message, which we cannot underestimate: the Commission proposes a path of decarbonisation that is too phased, we must invent new systems to accelerate this process.

Point four: financial platform for supporting RES. After all, we want to trade renewable energy, this platform should be in the main act, not delegated acts.

With the Clean Energy for all bundle, the Commission is taking a really big leap, and that is a good thing. Nevertheless, I would like to mention a few places where I think the Commission is a little too short. A binding efficiency target of 40% — as Parliament has called for — is achievable by 2030. However, it must also be broken down to the Member States. The same applies to renewables. Without any additional measure, a share of 24% would be achieved by 2030. That is why I believe that the Commission's target of 27% is simply too low. Ambitious targets stimulate innovation and provide impetus for growth and employment. They help the craft startups and they create industrial jobs. And it is long overdue to make the electricity market fit for renewables throughout Europe. This includes, of course, priority for renewables. I would like to see concrete European frameworks for national support systems so as not to produce a patchwork in Europe. Capacity mechanisms — if at all — must not be used to artificially keep old nuclear dividers alive through the back door, for example. One final point: I believe that the Commission's approach is right to put consumers at the heart of the energy transition. In the future, consumers will become more and more prosumers. In doing so, we need to pay particular attention to poorer people. They must be given the opportunity to participate equally actively in the energy transition.

One key element is connectivity – connectivity between countries, connectivity between smart buildings, appliances inside homes and the grids, connectivity between car and home, connectivity to integrate more renewables to the grid.

What is the effect of the compulsion to save energy? But what effect do ecodesign labelling, structural requirements also work? How does all this have a concrete impact on CO2 emissions and thus on certificate prices?

We need an assessment of the overall impact of European and national energy legislation on emissions trading. Secondly, I believe that compulsion to save energy is no longer up to date. Everything will go much faster than we think today — green energies also in the heating market. Secondly, the structural change to electromobility: we will need more electricity in the future, not less. Yes, dear Claude Turmes, this electricity will then be green, and we should not block the way to the green electricity age with a compulsion to save money. In summary, the package is okay.

This is a very interesting proposal that the Commission is presenting. A huge package that probably won't be able to accurately assess all the details yet.

If we want to ensure that security of supply is increased and that the impact on the climate is reasonable, then we need an overall approach and must take into account — and I find this interesting in the concept — that the different measures are also related to each other. If emissions trading is to be such a central element, then — as Mr Pieper has rightly said — more attention should also be paid here to the impact we actually have with the other measures. There are interesting indications, including the question of how we deal with the feed-in priority for renewables, that this should no longer exist in the future. But even there is the devil in the details. There are points that need to be talked about even more intensively. I don't understand why ACER needs to be built and expanded like this. Why do we need such a centralist European unit with additional competences? It is quite enough to improve the cooperation of the existing national institutions that we have. Rather, it is about practical questions about how to speed up the network expansion. I do not see a clear answer here.

Big improvements are needed in numerous buildings, 75% of which are currently considered to be inefficient. Buildings account for 40% of final energy consumption in Europe. An enormous amount of this is wasted due to buildings not performing efficiently. Our work in the coming months needs to ensure that we set the right framework to make investment into energy-efficient projects in buildings happen; I look forward to that challenge. I welcome the mandatory minimum requirements for renewable energy in new buildings, and in buildings undergoing major renovations.

Efficient homes mean less energy consumption, lower bills and a lower carbon footprint. It is a true no-brainer, and I look forward to work in the proposal in the coming months.  I feel that the key challenge in making the required improvements is mobilising the investment to bring about the required changes.

A form of energy based on permanent production support cannot be on an economically sustainable basis. Another issue relates to cutting emissions from transport.

The Commission has been very attentive to the proposals made by this House when preparing the legislative measures included in the package. Many of the views suggested over the months by this House have been incorporated in the package and are reflected in the pages of the legislative proposal. I am aware that on some issues this House has advocated slightly different positions from the ones put forward by the Commission in its proposal, so allow me to emphasise this: the Commission proposals are in themselves no easy targets. They will require considerable efforts by Member States to meet their international and domestic obligations, and to get them right we have assessed our proposals along several dimensions, including energy system impacts, macroeconomic impacts, environmental effects, social impacts, including affordability issues, energy-related investments, and, finally, energy system costs. And of course our proposal fully respects the right of Member States to choose their energy means as stated in Article 194 of the Treaties. Many of you have referred to renewable energy. The proposal revising the Renewable Energy Directive is ambitious and improves upon the previous directive, in particular by putting an end to retroactive measures and launching a Europeanisation process. But the measures favouring renewables go beyond this text: the market design, energy efficiency, the energy performance of buildings and the governance of the Union all contribute to reaching our policy goals and targets in a cost-effective way, paving the way for further deployment of renewables in buildings, transport and industry.  The revised proposal also goes beyond reaching the 27% target. It is about bringing sustainable jobs to the market, creating local added value, locking in investment potential, and fostering innovation. The target – at least 27% –represents the cost-optimal contribution of renewables in 2030 towards meeting the European Union’s long-term decarbonisation objectives, and it reflects the European Union’s fair and ambitious contribution to the Paris Agreement.  For the first time; the package is proposing a clear framework on cell consumption and production, energy communities and demand response, and this will help drive the energy transition by unlocking private capital for investment in renewables and make the electricity system more flexible in order to help renewable integration. The European Union’s binding 30% energy efficiency target for 2030 is ambitious but balanced and consistent with other targets of the 2030 framework for energy and climate. It is also the target which Vice-President Šefčovič and myself promised the European Parliament at our hearings two years ago: this is what we have delivered. We are going beyond what strictly speaking would be necessary to ensure that the target of at least 40% for production is met, and any claim that our targets and proposal are insufficient to honour our commitment under the Paris Agreement is simply wrong. With this package we will take the decisive step forward to ensure that the energy transition will continue and that the targets agreed upon will be met. For sure, a lot of real political engagement will be needed in both Parliament and the Council to reach a compromise, and I am counting on you to improve them and make them a reality soon for the benefit of all our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 64, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Members for what I feel was general support for the package. I would like to assure you that we listened carefully to the critical remarks and the calls to be more ambitious and are ready to work very closely with you on this package. Just to complement Miguel’s remark about energy poverty, I think it is very important that we clearly recognise energy poverty as an important challenge in our package. We recognise it as a very important challenge which we have to tackle together with the Member States but we want to do our utmost at European level. We are addressing the energy poverty issue in our governance system. We want to make sure that renovations, issues of social housing, and long—term innovation plans clearly factor in the issue of energy poverty. Miguel elaborated on the importance of energy efficiency and we see it as a very strong instrument in tackling energy poverty as well. In electricity market design we are proposing a clear procedure which would prevent people from being unfairly disconnected, not to mention eco-design and energy labelling where already today our citizens are saving hundreds of euros thanks to our efficient electric appliances.  I would also like to respond to one remark and express the support of the Commission for all those who are pushing for the completion of the internal energy market in a prompt and smart way. I think a lot of positive things are happening in the Baltic and Nordic countries. We are seeing positive developments in South—East Europe through our CESEC initiative, and I would like to assure you that we are bringing new dynamism to managing our projects of common interest. We are also encouraging the Member States to present more projects in the area of smart grids. To conclude, I would like to thank all Members who recognised the high level of ambition in this proposal. Its truly transformational nature should deliver the most significant modernisation of our energy systems since they were built in Europe. So I welcome your readiness to work hard on this package.

We all need to make a move together. Member States need to quickly introduce the obligations related to renewable energy for heating and build in incentives to set up energy cooperatives. Consumers should also receive clearer information on the share of renewable energy in their total energy consumption through their electricity bills.

It assumes that this can be achieved by engaging three programs. Firstly, it is an increase in energy efficiency, secondly a leadership position in the development of renewable energy sources, and thirdly it is a new relationship to the customer. The goals are very ambitious. In the field of science and research — especially for photovoltaics and hydrogen economy — we have a rapid fundamental turn in the immediate period. In photovoltaics, basic research shows the possibility of finding new chromophores. Their efficiency could jump to the energy produced by photovoltaic panels from the current approximately 11% to about 22%. If the European Commission's 2020 EP-confirmed target of 1% energy in hydrogen is met, we can expect rapid expansion of the hydrogen economy. Currently, electric and hydrogen cell buses are in test operation of several major EU cities. In a number of places, it is being worked to improve the possibility of hydrogen storage.

It is the result of a year-and-a-half’s work by a working group with a representative of every political group, helped by a task force at secretariat level that involved every parliamentary committee secretariat and the Legal Service of Parliament. It is therefore very much a consensual report and I pay tribute to the role played by Mr Rainer Wieland who chaired the working group, and indeed all the members of the working group. The bulk of what I propose to you today is very much consensual. It is an evolution, not a revolution. Nonetheless, although many of the rule changes are technical, there are quite a few that are of political significance. Let me list just a few very quickly.  We have rewritten the procedure for first reading agreements with the other institutions, to make them more transparent and to introduce safeguards. We have put into our rules the consequences of the Interinstitutional Agreement with the other institutions on Better Law-Making. We have put into our rules the changes to the procedure for hearings with Commissioners that we agreed in the context of my own report of last year. We have put together a considerable package on transparency, building on the work that Mr Giegold had done in preparation of a different report, and steering a course between what is desirable and what is legally possible to do through changes to the Rules of Procedure, rather than through legislation and, of course, bearing in mind that we have to get an absolute majority in this House to approve any such changes.  We have looked at the rules concerning the conduct of Members; we are prohibiting racist and xenophobic language in this Parliament. We have increased the penalties that can be imposed on Members who transgress our rules in this Parliament. We have rationalised the numerous thresholds in our Rules of Procedure for triggering different procedures, rationalising them to just three different thresholds. We have not raised the thresholds, by the way, and the most common threshold is the lower threshold. Nonetheless, we have brought greater clarity here. We have also made provision concerning membership of parliamentary committees such that when a Member leaves a political group and joins another one, which happens occasionally, the Group that he or she belongs to can replace that Member on the parliamentary committee that they left. This is particularly important, I think, for smaller groups who may only have one member of a committee and if that member leaves they are bereft of representation on that committee.

Allow me to highlight Article 21 of the Framework Agreement, which states: Parliament will seek the opinion of the Commission when it comes forward with its revision of its Rules of Procedure concerning relations with the Commission.

The incorporation of elements from the inter-institutional agreement on better law-making is a positive step. The changes to your approach to the recast procedure should make it more effective and reliable.

And we hope that the idea of topical debates will add liveliness and diversity to the European Parliament sessions, while remaining focused on the areas of EU competence and of general interest. However, some other proposed changes, in particular those relating to a proposed hearing in the case of the appointment of a new commissioner during the Commission’s mandate or modifications in a portfolio of serving commissioners, as well as those relating to possible conflict of interest of the Commission, represent a modification to the current legal framework that cannot be introduced unilaterally by the European Parliament. It must be borne in mind that those changes, if introduced unilaterally by the European Parliament in its Rules of Procedure, cannot create a role for the European Parliament which is neither provided for in the Treaties nor in the Framework Agreement and which would affect the institutional position and functioning of the Commission. I would also like to recall that President Juncker has himself proposed changes to the obligations for the commissioners to avoid any conflict of interest, and, in line with our commitment taken in the Framework Agreement, he has, by letter to President Schulz on 23 November 2016, asked Parliament’s opinion on these changes. It is for this reason that the first Vice-President Timmermans yesterday wrote to President Schulz to ask, on the basis of the principle of loyal and sincere cooperation between our institutions, to ensure the Commission is given enough time to express its opinion and for the Parliament to take it duly into account before voting on the proposed changes to the Rules of Procedure. The Commission underlines in this regard that you apply the Treaties and continue to respect the terms of the Framework Agreement, and the Commission expects that the European Parliament will do the same.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 85, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Ingeborg GRÄSSLE", "mepid": "28220", "text": " draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. — Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Corbett and everyone.

We are voting on this report this afternoon, and we will note that we are still discussing a few minor issues, although some colleagues will complain this afternoon that the vote is going on for so long. We have many hundreds of amendments because we are regulating many technical matters with this reorganisation. And, as I said, we still have a few things we disagree on. This is due to the fact that the process itself has been very broad-based. A technical working group was on board, and all the groups were on board with appropriate relineforce. And, Commissioner Šefčovič, your Commission was also present as an observer at AFCO. So there can be no talk of having been informed 48 hours in advance. They have been re-sent the entire bouquet of all these amendments 48 hours in advance, so to speak, at a time when Members have received it. That was when they came from the translation. We agree on a lot of progress. I believe that we have found a clear agreement on first reading. Secondly, I believe that we have answered the issue of handling in the committees with a convincing proposal. Thirdly, we have introduced a topical debate. We have some serious differences, but they are less party-political. In other words, the question of how the President of the Commission should be elected in the future — by secret ballot or possibly by a roll-call vote — has to do with political culture. In Germany, one cannot imagine choosing the chancellor in an open election, because this has a lot to do with a free mandate. So, there will also be votes today that are beyond party politics. Finally, let me turn to a point which, in particular, Commissioner Šefčovič. The House is under tremble pressure because there are reviews outside of Members who have to deal with a lot — number of speeches, number of applications, number of questions and more. And I know that the House is suffering from the fact that we are asking tens of thousands of questions to the Commission. I know that the Commission is also suffering from this. We want to have to limit the possibilities of individual Members to a certain extent. But if we succeed through the Rules of Procedure or otherwise, Commissioner, then, on the other hand, we also expect you to have the answers to the questions to be somewhat more meaningful.

However, taking a closer look at it, one quickly becomes clear that many of these provisions are of political importance. Rules of procedure are part of the parliamentarian's toolkit. To simplify them is to make its parliamentary activity more expeditious. Our colleague Richard Corbett summarized the reflections presented to him by representatives of political groups over the last 30 months. The number of Members required to initiate a parliamentary decision varied according to the requests made by our colleagues. It had become a real labyrinth. We have succeeded in putting order in this way, although we have not succeeded in revaluing the function of the political groups further, which I regret. Let us put to the credit of our work the strengthening of sanctions against our colleagues tempted by particularly hurtful and irresponsible remarks. Candidates for the presidency of the Commission state, in principle, before their approval in the European Parliament, that they do not want to be elected by Members from extremist parties. With the election of the President of the Commission with an open ballot — as proposed in our report — we will now have the opportunity to verify it. If the proposal is accepted, Parliament will, in future, be informed of the decisions taken by the College of Commissioners before the press, in plenary sitting on the same day. Finally, the new proposals for a regulation will allow the European Parliament, provided that it will, of course, put an end to the ranking of the performance of Members and, in this way, one of the greatest absurdities — as my colleague, Mercedes Bresso has already said — in the parliamentary world. Indeed, the quality of parliamentary activity is not measured in number interventions or reports. To give a report which simply endorses a Commission proposal and does not require in-depth research the same importance as the report on the European Union budget, for example, is simply to disregard the work of the budget rapporteur. This ranking, which is supposed to encourage Members of the European Parliament to step up their work, only records the number of parliamentary acts without being able to give any indication of the quality of their action. This form of stakhanovism has the effect of producing larigot amendments, resulting in inflation of deliberative votes. The means and costs generated by the activism of some of our colleagues are inversely proportional to the results achieved. Certainly, statistics rhymes with politics, but in order to move Europe forward, there are more sensible logic than that of recording simple noise. I therefore call on you to be responsible when voting on our proposal to revise the Rules of Procedure. Two and a half years of reflection, hard work and exemplary commitment by our rapporteur, Richard Corbett, and our President, Rainer Wieland, deserve the support of our Assembly.

I requested this debate because I cannot politically understand that the result of a good two years of work in the working group — I thank all the members of this working group for this — and is being waved through here in plenary at the end of more than 1 400amendments without discussion. The number of amendments tabled in committee and, ultimately, again here in plenary, shows that such a process is best achieved when it is inclusive in development and openly in the result. The result before us, however, is clearly controversial by many parts of Parliament. Despite the great openness with which the working group has come to work — with its rather early return to the groups, I am dissatisfied at the end. Not because I was unable to prevail with my own views and proposals, but because, unfortunately, the work on important issues finally became a matter of power between large and small groups. The Rules of Procedure should be our constitution, which governs our internal democracy, within which we fulfil our duties as Parliament, as the Commission's supervisory body and as co-legislator alongside the Council. The fathers of the great constitutions in our Member States have not been so petty, but have been driven by creating spaces and not restricting them. Democracy thrives on breathing, and we all learn every day: nothing lasts and can be secured forever. Of course, efficiency and acceleration are something we face every day, including in Parliament. But if they are made the primary goals for our internal rules, this ultimately leads to breathing and change. That is why we refuse, for example, to curtail the rights of individual Members, and that smaller fractions should be squeezed into stronger rules. I would have liked, for example, to try not only to reduce the number of questions to the Commission or the Council arithmetically, but also to consider together how to strengthen Parliament's competence in this area and how, of course, to negotiate this with the institutions.

This is the conclusion of a two-year process of hard work in which we have gone through the Rules of Procedure paragraph by paragraph. Parliament's Rules of Procedure is a very important document because it regulates the balance of power in this House between large groups, between small groups, between group leaders, between individual members. It is a complicated document and anyone who reads the Rules of Procedure closely gets an important tool to push their policies. It is therefore good that we make the Rules of Procedure easier and something easier to understand. There are also things that are good improvements. Parliament's board will no longer be able to stop suggestions that we should have a vote on setting up a committee of inquiry to investigate malfeasance. The President of Parliament will no longer be able to prevent the advisory group investigating whether a member has committed breaches of the rules of ethics from investigating this. That veto has the President of Parliament today and it is good for it to be removed, except in cases that are quite obvious. There are some other things that are actually good for the small groups. On the whole, although the report is not as we Greens would like it to be, it is a good report. But there are some things that I want to talk about, which we are fighting to improve. One applies to Application 222 on the composition of committees, the composition of the committee, which is that we change the principle of who should sit on which committee. Today, the member is the one who owns his committee seat. With the proposal drawn up by the Group, it is the party groups that own the committee seat, and will thus be able to punish a member who votes against the will of the group management by taking away from the member its committee seat. If you want a Parliament of strong members who can represent their constituents, it would be very good if we keep the principle that the Member own their own place.

If we ask this question, the answer is, or should be, clear: to make the work of Parliament more effective; to improve it. If nothing else we owe this to the citizens whom we represent, and it follows. This is very much in the interest of Parliament itself. Does anyone actually want to be a Member of a badly-functioning Parliament? A great deal of work has gone into the preparation of the new Rules of Procedure. Some of it is technical – necessarily so; the outcome is that they are a more coherent, more cogent set of rules by which Parliament operates. But this reform also means innovation, meaning that some of the rules to which we had become accustomed will change. While we all subscribe to change in theory, there are those who dislike it in practice. Restructuring the Rules of Procedure was a complex and lengthy task involving high levels of experience. In other words, we are looking at expertise in action. To reject this expertise would be tantamount to the worst kind of populism, the kind that in other contexts we denounce every day of the week. With the new Rules of Procedure, the work of Parliament will become more accountable and more focused. It will undergo a modernisation to bring it into line as co-legislator under the Lisbon Treaty. One particular innovation should be universally welcome. MEP ranking has been generally deleterious to the work of Parliament, and other colleagues have said the same thing.

Just to give you an example from my own experience, some of you will probably remember that I had to take over, rather abruptly, the health portfolio. A few months later, the former President of the Commission had to take over mine because I was on electoral leave. After I came back from the elections, I assumed the portfolio of Viviane Reding, who became a Member of the European Parliament. These were very real situations which occur in political life and which we have to be able to resolve promptly.

Nevertheless, the Commission stands ready to work with the European Parliament on practical ways to implement the provisions of this important reform in respect of our respective institutional prerogatives.

Let me just respond to four or five of the key issues that have been raised. First, the complaint from my good friend Mr Šefčovič on behalf of the Commission. Indeed, the Commission was present at all our committee meetings discussing this. I did not once hear the Commission ask for any extra consultation beyond that, though of course, nonetheless, our President has written to you to inform you of all the amendments tabled at plenary stage after we had finished our work in the Committee. But what we are doing in relation to the Commission is largely about how we organise what we already do as a Parliament, notably in terms of the Commission hearings. Some of them, other ones, actually respond to concerns of the Commission, such as on the volume of parliamentary questions tabled in writing to the Commission. But I am sure that after the vote we can explore any issues that you may feel perhaps are still there and we can look at practical solutions to that. Second, on the question of thresholds. I repeat, we have rationalised not raised the thresholds. The lower threshold is actually lower than it is in our present Rules because it means 38 Members instead of 40 Members can trigger a whole range of parliamentary procedures. The medium and the higher thresholds are rarely used, but they are used in cases which already now have a threshold that is as high, if not actually higher. So I do not think we have made any of these procedures more difficult for smaller groups or small numbers of Members. Third, on the issue of transparency. We have introduced legislative footprints. We have toughened up the declaration of Members’ financial interests. We are proposing to ban second jobs and lobbying of Parliament or the institutions. We are tightening up on the use of badges by outside people. We are bringing more transparency to first reading agreements and to trialogues. What we have not done on transparency are either things that are illegal, that we cannot do via the Rules of Procedure but where we need to change the primary legislation such as the Members’ Statute; or things where we need to reach agreement with the other institutions. That is true, but those issues are still open. We can revisit them and I am sure we will. And finally, may I address Mr Ferreira’s notion that this is a coup. A coup. If you really think that a working group composed of representatives from every single political group in the European Parliament reporting back to public meetings of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is a coup, then I really am astonished. As I said, this also lowers many of the thresholds. It introduces a new procedure for topical debates where every Group in turn can choose a debate on a subject of its choice. It introduces a number of other safeguards for individual Members. This is not a coup. And if you were implying that as an individual Member you find it difficult to make your political points within the wide, very wide, range of possibilities that this Parliament offers to individual Members, then I suggest that you may have some difficulty actually doing your job as an MEP. Let me finish, however, by commending this package to the House. It is reasonable, it is balanced. Even on the points that are still subject to some contention I am confident that a large majority will back what the working group and I, as rapporteur, have put before this House today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 117, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF", "mepid": "28242", "text": " The debate is closed.

(Applause) I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to take your seats and invite you first to watch a short video. (The video will play.) Dear Mrs. Nadija Murad and Mrs. Lamija Aji Bashar! We are very proud to welcome you today and we bow to the people of the Yazidis, one of the oldest religious communities in human history. But we don't just welcome you. We also welcome your families and friends who have taken their seats in the grandstand. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! (Applause) It is also an honour to welcome this year's two finalists of the Sakharov Prize, Mr Can Dündar and Mr Mustafa Cemilev, to our award ceremony. (Applause) Can Dündar was the editor-in-chief of the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet, a leading and independent newspaper that won the Alternative Nobel Peace Prize this year. Mr Dündar was accused of espionage and imprisoned just because he was engaged in his free journalistic work. Mustafa Cemilev, who is now elected Member of the Ukrainian Parliament, has dedicated his life to the non-violent struggle to protect minorities, and especially the Tatars in Ukraine. He is the former president of the Crimean Tatar Parliament and has the privilege of being a friend of Andrei Sakharov, who paid for his belief in freedom of expression with his life and who gave his name to the award today. Today's award ceremony is not just a reason to welcome our two finalists. Today's award ceremony is also an occasion for us to recall the situation of last year's prize-winner, Raif Badawi, who is still in prison, and I take this opportunity to appeal once again to the government and the King of Saudi Arabia to release Raif Badawi immediately. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, the two women sitting up here — Nadija Murad and Lamija Aji Bashar — are heroines. They have suffered indescribable atrocities, survived captivity, and they have fled and found exile. They have overcome fear and suffering and finally found refuge and protection with us in Europe. Both Nadija Murad and Lamija Aji Bashar are fighting today with commitment to those who are left behind, fighting against impunity and for justice. Nadija, you once said, “To tell my story and relive the horror is not an easy task, but the world needs to know.” Ladies and gentlemen, Nadija and Lamija lived in the quiet rural village of Kocho, Iraq, where Christians, Muslims and Yazidis lived together peacefully as neighbours. On 15 August 2014, the Daesh, the so-called “Islamic State”, killed all the men in their village and enslaved all women and children. In November 2014, Nadija Murad managed to escape to Germany. Lamija Aji Bashar risked her life. She escaped the war and was seriously injured by the explosion of a landmine. Today, Nadija and Lamija draw our attention to the suffering of the Yazidis, stand up for the rights of women and minorities and are launching a campaign against human trafficking and for the Recognition of the genocide of their people. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is a matter of direct concern to us in Europe. We took the “never again” vow after the European Holocaust. “Never again” does not only commemorate the past, but also means the duty for the present and future to protect people from persecution and puniny. We see cities in ruins and children buried under the scree of war. We see whole peoples, we see whole regions, we see entire cities and villages disappearing from the map. We see men being killed, children abducted, and women enslaved and kidnapped. However, we, the democratic communities, in the wealthest parts of the world, sometimes refuse to give protection to these people. This, ladies and gentlemen, is shameful and unbearable. (Applause) The two women Nadija and Lamija remind us of our duty by telling us their story. Nadija, you once said, “The world needs to know.” Yeah, I think so too. The world needs to know. And let me add, the world needs to act too. The European Parliament supports their call to the United Nations Security Council. No offender has been tried for the crimes committed against the Yazidis so far. The International Criminal Court must investigate the crimes committed by the so-called “Islamic State”. Crimes against humanity committed by this terrorist organisation must be prosecuted before the International Criminal Court.

I am a Yazidi girl. My real age is 18 years old. I loved school very, very much when I was little and my father decided to increase my age by a year so that I would be able to go to school. And when Daesh attacked my village I was 15 years old. They killed all the men in the village, including my brother, my father, relatives, young and old. And then they took us to another place and they separated us between older and younger women. They killed the older women and then they divided the younger girls up and we were then traded on the slave trade market. I myself was sold four times by Daesh and every single time I was sold I tried to escape. They tortured me, they beat me and they insulted me and captured me again.  And one of the individuals made explosive devices and bombs and forced me to help him, forced me to make these bombs. The last person who bought me was an Iraqi doctor called Doctor Eslam. He was the director of the Houwaja Hospital. He used to torture me. He used to torture all the Yazidi women and he would even rape girls who were only nine or ten years old. Together with a friend of mine called Kathrin and a nine year old girl, all of us were raped by Dr Eslam. The three of us did actually manage to escape but before we actually managed to arrive to safety Kathrin accidentally walked over a landmine and it exploded and the last thing I heard was her death screams and this was awful, absolutely awful and it was the worst thing that I have ever heard.  When I managed to pick myself up I knew that I would not be able to ever see again because the whole of my body was burnt, my body was burning and I did not think that I would actually be able to open my eyes ever again. And then I was taken to Germany and I was helped to travel from Iraq to Germany and I was helped, I was treated and I am now able to see through one eye. I can see now again and I would like to thank God for the possibility that I can see now, that I can be a voice to the victims. And the Sakharov prize gives me great strength.  And this is why I have taken a decision to become a voice for the voiceless. The Yazidis have been victims of extremism, of violence and terrorism, they have lost their lives but I very much ask you and urge you to promise me, to promise us, that never again, never again will you allow these kinds of things to happen. That you will listen to us and see that justice will be done so that the criminals can be brought to justice and held accountable.  It has been two-and-a half-years now since the tragedy that affected the Yazidi people and there are still more than 3 500 children and women held by Daesh as slaves and every day they die a thousand times over again. The bones in the Yazidi mass graves that remain untouched in the area of Singhar, and the Yazidi people, have no value in Iraq, whether dead or alive. Our village, ladies and gentlemen, has been a neighbour to Arab cities for hundreds of years and when people visited us, when an Arab or a Muslim visited us, they would not eat meat in our homes because this was prohibited under their religion. They were not allowed to eat this meat. And my father would tell our Muslim guests that they should slaughter the animal themselves so that they would then be able to eat halal meat when they visited us.  When Islamic State arrived and attacked us then it was our neighbours who actually attacked us first of all, before them. And they killed our men and they enslaved our women. As a result of this we have lost the social order in our own society and we have lost trust with these countries because they do not treat us as Yazidis as equal to other citizens. So today we need Europe so that we can go back to our country, so that we can build up our country again and so that we can experience peace again in our society. These criminals must be brought to justice, they must be held to account. The Yazidis and the Christians need international protection and they, both children and women that have been victims of Daesh, need some kind of psychological rehabilitation. We need programmes for that and they need to be resettled. And ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank you very much for this prize. I stand here before you and I would like to accept this prize on behalf of all the women and all the girls who are still in the camps in Kurdistan, who are living in those camps where the conditions are absolutely appalling and I very much hope that you will all help us. Thank you very much.

I am happy because not only did you stand by us as a community but you stood by millions of women and children in Iraq, Syria and in conflict zones where they face blind terrorism. Receiving the Sakharov Prize today is a great honour for us. Daesh wanted, by enslaving us, to take our honour, but they lost their honour, and here you have given us this honour.  Daesh and the extremists came on 3 August to erase the Yazidis from existence and they gave us one option: death or Islam. There is no doubt Daesh committed mass genocide. This genocide did not only consist of killings, but it also sought to enslave women in a systematic manner and to take the children away. Daesh wanted to break our will to live. They started by killing the disabled and the elders and the women that they did not desire for themselves. Then they destroyed places of worship and infrastructure so that we wouldn’t return. Daesh and other global radical groups do not want anyone to have a life. They target all those who stand against their ideology, including millions of Muslims. Terrorism and radicalism are the enemies of mankind. I was a girl in a big family. I was the closest to my mother among my sisters. I learned from my mother the meaning of goodness and mercy, and what it means to challenge poverty. I learned from my small community that when we pray every evening we pray for all the peoples of the world before we pray for ourselves. I learned from my religion that God is tolerant and noble and that the difference between religions and cultures is a difference chosen by the creation, and it ought to be respected as such. Daesh took my mother, who believed in the essence of humanity, along with 86 Yazidi women in Soulagh. They killed them all because they did not hold any value in the human sex trade. Today, my community has disintegrated under the weight of genocide. Half a million people do not know where their future is leading them. Will we return to our lands? How will we return to our lands under the same conditions that led to the genocide? Should we emigrate? This is what some 75 000 Yazidis did. They mostly emigrated to Germany, and I thank Germany with all my heart for taking in my community, and I also thank Germany also for taking in 1 000 Yazidi women to provide them with medical and psychological care.  Half a million Yazidis remain in Iraq and they are the last members of this community present in the Middle East. They are the few who remain after thousands, or perhaps millions, of Yazidis were exterminated throughout history. The harsh conditions forced them to emigrate from Turkey and Syria, especially under the Ottoman Empire.  We look up to Europe as a symbol of humanity, and Europe is indeed confirming today that it is such a symbol. Europe should remain a model for the world and a model for the coexistence of peoples and cultures. The world today faces two of its biggest threats – the danger of terrorism as well as the dangers of reactions to terrorism. We must fight terrorism and we must dry its source. We must also work with the Islamic community around the world so that they can change the teachings of Islam and make the mosques a place for mercy, love and peace, free of extremism. We must prevent radicalism and racism everywhere. Radicalism and extremism have become such dangers today. We must respect the individual, regardless of religion, creed, colour, sex or place of residence.  The religious communities in Iraq must be protected, and amongst them my community after this genocide. They can be protected through the establishment of a protected zone or zones under the aegis and protection of the international community in coordination with the Iraqi Government and the regional government of Kurdistan. If the world is unable to protect us in our lands, I invite Europe to open its doors to us to provide refuge to half a million Yazidis from Iraq, through an organised mass migration similar to what happened following the Holocaust. For we cannot afford to remain the fuel of genocide and slavery. There must also be an accountability system to hold those who committed these crimes accountable both at [local] level and in the international community. There are still thousands of terrorists in Iraq and Syria and they must be brought to justice.  Thank you again for giving us this great award. From here, I would like to say to Daesh, and all terrorists in the world, if you have chosen for yourself the path of no dignity, then Europe has chosen for itself the path of humanity and honour.

Pursuant to point 21 of the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission, the European Parliament has taken the commitment to seek the opinion of the Commission when it comes forward with such changes to its Rules of Procedure. By letter from President Schulz of 9 December 2016, the European Parliament transmitted for the Commission's opinion, where relevant, the envisaged amendments to its Rules of Procedure brought forward for consideration of the plenary on 13 December 2016. The Commission regrets that Parliament did not respect its commitment for consulting the Commission in a meaningful way, as the time left before the vote by the European Parliament has not allowed the Commission to provide a considered response or even discuss the matter in the College, and the Parliament to take a Commission opinion duly into account before voting on the proposed changes. The Commission regrets that the Parliament did not act in accordance with the principle of loyal and sincere cooperation and, despite its request, did not allow the Commission enough time to express its opinion before adopting the revision.  The Commission wishes to highlight some of Parliament's changes to its Rules of Procedure, in particular those relating to the proposed hearings in case of the appointment of a new Commissioner during the Commission's mandate or modifications in the portfolio of serving Commissioners, as well as those relating to a possible conflict of interest of a Commissioner.

The Regulation provides for the EU to freeze its 'fishing footprint'. The fishing depth limit is 800 metres in order to safeguard deep-sea ecosystems. Vessels fishing in vulnerable marine ecosystems at a depth of more than 400 metres shall have to stop operations and travel at least five nautical miles from the fishing zone concerned. The Regulation provides for improvements in transparency, the provision of information and the collection of scientific data — aspects that we value.

The EU has been given the task of establishing specific fishing conditions for both deep-sea stocks in the north-east Atlantic and fishing in international waters of the Northeast Atlantic. I believe that the protection of marine ecosystems, especially those that are severely endangered, is initially important. Furthermore, since this is about fishing for deep-sea stocks, it is necessary to create a list of deep-sea species because the goal is to work on conservation and further research related to this case. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate it. It is necessary to raise awareness of the need to prevent catches of endangered deep-sea stocks.

This will improve the understanding of the activities and influence of EU lobbyists and stakeholders and their relations with MEPs. The proposed amendments also include a stricter code of conduct for Members and tougher sanctions in the event of disruptions to Parliament's work. Negotiating mandates for compromise talks with the Council will also have to be adopted by the plenary at first reading from 2017. The declarations of Members' financial interests should also be described and examined in more detail under the new rules. The assessment is negative from a political point of view. In some areas, EPP and S&D have cleverly restricted the rights of smaller groups, non-attached and individual MEPs by means of ceilings on written questions, motions for resolutions and amendments. The restriction of free speech in plenary and in the committees is particularly drastic, where pointed speeches are likely to be classified as “xenophobic” or “xenophobic” in the future and thus prohibit them.

The resolution deplores “the increasing level of hate speech within certain institutions, political parties and the media.” They call on the EU to set an example “by opposing hate speech within its institutions”.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 688, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Marielle DE SARNEZ", "mepid": "4335", "text": " in writing. — The European Union ensures respect for the principles inherent in democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, both within and on the international stage.

I supported the report on the state of fundamental rights in 2015 because this document makes it clear to the European Commission that there is a need to present a new agenda. An agenda to which all relevant actors and representatives of citizens' rights will participate and which, taking into account the competencies of the Union Member States, will be able to ensure equal opportunities and rights for everyone. It is very conceivable that in Europe, for example, human trafficking and exploitation is still occurring, i.e. illegal activities, which are at the moment, unfortunately, even more stoking means of new communication technologies. I therefore supported the call for both the European Union and the Member States to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Measures Against Trafficking in Persons and for the work of European agencies on this field to be supported. Member countries are currently seeing a growing trend of racism and xenophobia. So I also voted in favour of the provision that measures to promote equality for citizens should be incorporated into national policies as far as possible.

Indeed, the cultural and creative sectors are important in the different states of the Union and form an undeniable heritage that must be kept alive in order to avoid the museification or even the disappearance of certain crafts in particular. These sectors are also powerful vectors of our culture and our identity and values. Therefore, every people should be able to express themselves according to their own traditions. Innovations, especially digital ones, have revealed new talents, especially in France, a country that stands out particularly in video games and animated films.

It is significant that we speak here of 'European' and 'regional' identity, but not about national identities, which is an essential factor of European identity.

When the strategic priorities of the European Neighbourhood Policy were announced for years 2014-2020, emphasis was placed on gender equality as a cross-sectional issue. Gender equality was also considered a promising new area of cooperation in the declaration from the last Eastern Partnership summit. I share the stated position that women's empowerment and their active participation in social, political and economic life are in fact a prerequisite for change. Unfortunately, there are indications that social discrimination and the functioning of gender stereotypes are still common occurrences in countries that are signatory to the Eastern Partnership. The existence of stereotypes not only prevents more inclusion of women in the job market and participation in political life, but also paves the way for social acceptance of gender-based violence and non-reporting of domestic violence.

It is important that women's rights are suitably high on the political agenda in our eastern neighbours, and work in this respect takes place in parallel with the implementation of policies on the economy or finance. The report highlights that, while all Eastern Partnership states have prepared strategies and plans to improve women's situation, their presence in public spaces and decision-making positions is very modest.

Therefore, I voted in favour because the EU should place the fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation of women at the core of development cooperation with EaP states.

This is the first time that our three institutions have agreed on a list of legislative procedures to be given preferential next year. Together we want to strive to make progress on the projects contained in the declaration next year, and if somehow, ideally, the projects will be completed. Finding an agreement between the three institutions was no easy task and required a great deal of compromise from all sides. The European Parliament has fought hard to include the deployment of workers and the fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax evasion in the list of these priorities. Ultimately, we have stated, at least in the text, that progress on these issues is imperative. I would like to emphasise that this progress must be concrete and not just end in solemn declarations. In particular, the fight against tax evasion and the improvement of the Posting of Workers Directive are issues that directly affect the concerns of our citizens. Allow me to clarify some reservations about this statement at this point. Adopting such a declaration does not mean abandoning the prerogatives of the European Parliament in relation to legislative procedures, or that we hastily or hastily and without proper democratic control by our Parliament. It does not mean that work on the other projects not included in this declaration will stop or will not continue. On the contrary, a lot of work on important legislation is already is underway and will continue, as well as logically monitoring the proper implementation of the laws we have adopted. The aim of this Interinstitutional Agreement on better lawmaking is to make legislative procedures more transparent and efficient. The aim of the joint declaration, which is part of this agreement, is to reach agreement on where we need to deliver concrete results and what we can deliver realistically in the time ahead. That is what citizens expect: a Union that delivers concrete results and strives to make citizens' lives better where it is possible. That is why the three Presidents of the institutions — Mr Fico, Mr Juncker and myself — are signing this joint declaration. Ladies and gentlemen! We are opting for an agenda which, if signed here today, should indeed be given priority by all three institutions. This is a huge step forward. I would like to reiterate here that this has also been accepted by the Council for the first time. Our task now is to make this declaration a reality. We as Parliament are relying on the loyal cooperation of the three institutions — the Commission, Council and Parliament, as provided for in the Treaty. And we are betting on the constructive cooperation of the Presidencies of Malta and Estonia, which I hope will work with us in the same constructive way as the Slovak Presidency has done over the last six months.

Excuse me for a personal comment, I do not need Members of the European Parliament to do this, but it seems to me that this is such a serious matter that they should have been sitting here. At least when signing such an agreement. I repeat, of course, I don't need their presence. I consider the Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities for 2017 as an important tool for increasing the efficiency and transparency of internal processes in the Union, especially in a sphere such as legislation. In addition, now full of Euroscepticism and criticism, it is also essential that the institutions work together, constructively and complementally. I consider its orientation towards the citizens of the European Union as the greatest contribution of this Joint Declaration. Initiatives identified as key, such as employment, social issues and security, are directly affected by them. Our next task will be to deliver tangible results on these topics and to present them clearly. That's what people expect, that's what they need. Of course, the essential prerequisite for success is the rigorous fulfillment of the priorities set. I believe that the regular evaluation of the implementation of our joint declaration will make a great contribution to this. Because countless targets have already been set and many documents signed, which often remained only on paper. By regularly monitoring the progress of the various initiatives set at the highest level, directly by the presidents of the three institutions, we will ensure that the Joint Declaration does not become just another such declaratory document. And I believe that as early as March, you and my Maltese colleague as President of the Council will be able to present the first concrete results of our joint work. Ladies and gentlemen, the declaration we are signing today demonstrates that we are interested in a different approach to solving problems within the Union. During the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union, we have taken responsibly, respectfully and made every effort to bridge the critical period in which the European Union is located. I believe that the Bratislava Process has also made a significant contribution to the kick-start and implementation of the new procedures that the European Union currently needs.

Worse, though, that many in Europe believe that this complete self-evident would exist without the European Union. And even that without the European Union, we could be significantly better off. Let us be the truth, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is in the most difficult crisis since its inception. However, it is not an external threat crisis; it is a crisis from the inside, expressed primarily by the mistrust of the people and the loss of authority of the European elites. The debate on the future of the Union has turned fundamentally during this year. Ask the European if he knows which country should join the European Union closest. He will tell you that he does not know, but that he knows very well which country should come out of the European union. Nowhere in the world, ladies and gentlemen, there is no grouping of countries even a little similar to the European Union. We've all taken the hardest path. On the one hand, we respect a number of national specificities. We hold on to our own national identities, but at the same time we have transferred a number of fundamental powers to joint administration. Today, we have a duty to return to the root. To ask ourselves whose powers and why the nation states have renounced in favour of the whole, and whether today we are not making a mistake precisely in moving away from these roots and paying attention to themes that are subordinate, irrelevant and, instead of joining together with common interests, divide Europe. With a unique project, ladies and gentlemen, which does not exist anywhere in the world, today we are reprehensibly gambling. To stop this gamble, let's just tell ourselves what our roots are in. They are in economic cooperation, they are in common security, they are in peace. Let us not, please, force people other than these fundamental topics, because if they do not identify with them and if they do not believe them, they will turn their back on the Union for good. The Slovak Republic took over in July this year the presidency with the ambition to respond to the situation. The first clear step forward was the Bratislava Summit, as it kicked off a long-delayed, absolutely necessary debate on how to make the Union better, safer and more efficient. What actually happened in the Union and what is happening in it today? What do we expect from the Union? How do we see her future? What did we fail at and why? And by discussing these issues, we started the so-called Bratislava process on 16 September, which is expected to culminate next March on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome. But part of the truth is also that, ladies and gentlemen, we are putting the Union at risk ourselves and often threatening it with the intra-political agendas of the Member States. For example, by holding referendums that are intra-politically motivated, but it is obvious that their results have a pan-European impact and suddenly become something that I could name as a problem for all of us. If this trend continues, the Union will be employed by internal policy in the Member States, we will be forced to seek steady solutions, compromise with our own principles, all at the expense of the credibility of the EU. If it were to continue this way, I believe that we will lack the political energy and, with it, the determination to tackle the fundamental problems facing the Union as a whole. I also want to call on European leaders here in the European Parliament to stop addressing their domestic agenda at the expense of the European Union. We all know well, but we don't want to admit it, that the referendum in the UK was a pure intra-political agenda that politicians failed to handle. We all know that the referendum in Italy was a pure intra-political agenda that has not been mastered. But the consequences of such decisions, for example in a possible referendum on whether or not Italy should remain in the euro area, would be absolutely catastrophic for the European Union and ideas. So once again, I call on European leaders to stop addressing their domestic agenda at the expense of all of us here in Europe. The current crisis in the Union we would should consider it a good impetus to take action leading to a more transparent Union. In turn, the current crisis of trust of our citizens represents an appropriate opportunity to create a more understandable and sincere communication bridge between the political elites and the European public. It is alarming that, according to recent surveys, up to 57% of young Europeans feel that they are marginalised and excluded from economic and social life as a result of the crisis in their country. We — political leaders — are here to give our people not only hope, but the certainty that we can tackle the crisis. That, despite the unpredictability of the external environment, we have control over our direction. In doing so, we must build on the strengths of our community. The European Union as a peaceful port, where peace, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, human dignity, freedom and solidarity are fundamental and timeless pillars of our coexistence. But also the European Union as a modern hub for digital progress and innovation. The European Union as a conscious driver in the fight against climate change. The European Union as the largest provider of development aid in the world. The European Union is strong and actionable only if it is united. The Bratislava Summit also reached this conclusion. The European 27 is committed to collectively overcome and overcome current and future challenges. However, the process of reflection, however necessary, is not sufficient in itself. Without action, even the most beautiful idea remains worthless. Therefore, the Bratislava Summit was not just about reflection, but about concrete steps towards making the European Union more understandable and, on the other hand, providing its citizens with a safe living space. And when I talk about security, I do not mean only external and internal security, the fight against terrorism, but also economic and social security, job security, income or climate and environmental security. These are all the areas that suffer the citizens of the Union the most. Not a game with the words we want to change in the Treaties on the European Union. Not an endless debate about whether we want more or less Europe. A citizen of the European Union wants an economically strong European Union. A Union based on investments that will contribute to economic growth and the creation of new jobs. When I stood before you in July, I said that if we wanted to have such a Union, we must make better use of the available financial instruments. Our ambition has come true. Today, thanks to the great cooperation of the Council and the European Parliament, we have the European Union budget for 2017, which is flexible, balanced and above all reflects our current priorities. That's very good news. After all, thanks to the budget adopted next year, for example, we will increase the resources to support economic growth and employment by 12%. We will also be better equipped to deal with migration and its causes, as well as to increase the security and border protection of the European Union. Citizens are also calling for new investment opportunities in the Union. I am therefore very pleased that the extension of the duration and financial capacity of the European Fund for Strategic Investments has moved closer to reality. By encouraging the use of public finances, we will give the necessary impetus to private investment that can bring new jobs. A citizen of the European Union also wants to have a job so that he can take care of himself and his loved ones without fear. Already today, the single market creates many new jobs and makes our daily lives easier. By completing the Digital Single Market, we can open up a large number of other opportunities. That is why I am delighted that we have managed to make significant progress on this agenda. For example, unjustified geographical blocking will perhaps soon become a thing of the past. We will help both consumers and sellers. Discrimination on grounds of nationality, residence or place of residence does not have its place in the Union. The free movement of European Union citizens must also apply to digital space in today's world. And this also applies when removing roaming charges. In addition, in order to exploit the full potential of the single market, we need an affordable one, a stable and sustainable supply of clean energy. We can be moved to this end by the Energy Union. Even during the last days of our Presidency, we are working together to move the Union further in this area as well. An ambitious and effective climate policy is also an integral part of the Energy Union. By ratifying the Paris Agreement, the European Union has confirmed the world leader in the fight against climate change. We have also sent an important message outwardly that when it comes to global challenges, we are able to take responsibility and work closely together. One such challenge is, of course, migration. We already know that the migration crisis is neither a seasonal nor a regional issue, but a global problem. And although our views on tackling it sometimes differ, a citizen of the European Union wants to know that we are able to offer constructive common action. I am pleased that we have shown in the last period that if we want to, we can also reach a consensus here and move this agenda forward. The European Border and Coast Guard, which, thanks to the rapid and effective cooperation of the European Parliament and the Council, started its activities on 6 October. The issue of responsibility and solidarity is also closely linked to migration. I know that these concepts have evoked diverse emotions in recent months. However, I believe that we all agree that every Member State must, without hesitation, give a helping hand if necessary. At the same time, however, I believe that we should take into account the real possibilities, capacities and capabilities of the individual Member States. And I am pleased that we have shown at a minimum in recent months that we are able to speak openly on this difficult subject. This is also the case with the Slovak Presidency's proposal concerning so-called effective solidarity. I hope that this concept will be one of the elements of the mosaic in the reform of the Common European Asylum System. However, we also have other challenges. In addition to protecting the external borders, we must ensure the functionality of Schengen, work closely with third countries, in particular transit countries and countries origin of migrants and eliminate the causes of migration. Progress on the creation of the European Fund for Sustainable Development should also help to do so. It aims, in particular, to address the root causes of migration by creating jobs, promoting investment and facilitating sustainable development in partner countries. Ladies and gentlemen, a citizen of the European Union wants to feel stability. In the current uncertain world, the Union should symbolise a fundamental foothold in the eyes of the citizen. In order to truly be a stable, safe and prosperous place to live, we need to have good relationships with neighbours as well as distant allies. And we need to be substantially more sovereign when it comes to some foreign policy topics. I will raise a question that can become a reality if, for example, an American adeministry changes its mind on sanctions against the Russian Federation, how we will replicate this stance. That's where it turns out whether or not we are truly sovereign in these views. Equally, we have a big problem if there is what the US administration suggests, and that is a very low presence, engagement in the European space. At the same time, I believe that we will successfully continue the concrete implementation of the Warsaw Declaration of EU and NATO Leaders on strengthening the strategic cooperation between the two organisations. Among other things, an effective enlargement policy leads to better resilience of the Union. It is this that is crucial to fostering transformation and consolidating stability in South-Eastern Europe. To this end, new chapters have been opened in the accession process with Montenegro and Serbia, and positive developments have also occurred when Bosnia and Herzegovina is registered as a member of the Union. It must be our interest that political and economic reforms continue to take place in all candidate countries that bring them closer to the Union and strengthen the rule of law. Free, fair and balanced trade based on reciprocity and mutual benefits is also crucial for the internal and external stability of the Union. Adoption of Agreement about free trade with Canada is an excellent example of this. This modern and ambitious agreement will not only strengthen the economic position of the Union, but will also open up new business opportunities for our citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, the only answer to the current wave of Euroscepticism is to approximate the sense, substance and real achievements of the European integration project through concrete results. Otherwise, we will open up space for different interpretations and speculation of truth to anti-European politicians. In this context, we probably have another major challenge coming from next spring — to ensure that the process of the UK's exit from the European Union is transparent with the full involvement of the Member States, and I will add, although these words have already raised criticism that negotiations must lead to conclusions that pays to remain a member state of the European Union. If negotiations show that it is not worth being a Member State of the European Union, the negative mood in Europe threatens to grow. And this must be avoided, because we can set an incredibly dangerous example to countries where Euroscepticism may be very strong. That is why the Slovak Presidency has made every effort to send a positive boost to the European public through its work and results. That's why we tried with all our strength to deliver tangible results that have an impact on the ordinary life of each of us. Our aim was not only to prevent further fragmentation in the Union, but also to reassure our citizens that the European Union is a project that has a future. I want to assure you that the responsibility we felt at the beginning of our Presidency that this same responsibility remained unchanged. I wish the incoming Maltese Presidency good luck and determination to fulfil its own priorities. I believe that the incoming Presidency will move us significantly forward in achieving our common objectives and, at the same time, I would also like to thank the Netherlands for its excellent cooperation within the trio.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1240, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " President of the European Commission. — (FR) Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our Slovak friends very warmly for a successful first presidency.

Despite the reluctance of some Member States, a solid budget has been voted, with more than EUR 157 billion in commitments, a budget that we believe is still too minimalist, but most of which has been preserved, and on which we have been able to make improvements. Extended Juncker Plan, strengthened border security budget, increased youth guarantee, fight against tax evasion undertaken, posting of workers underway, modernization of trade defence instruments are a number of important advances. There is no growth without industry, and industry has also been at the heart of your presidency. It must continue to be, because it is the foundation of our current and future economy, and we need an ambitious industrial policy to safeguard our jobs and encourage innovation in new technologies. In this regard, carbon market reform is progressing, it will enable the development of low-carbon technologies to reduce the effects of climate change. The European Space Strategy is launched, it is a sector full of extraordinary possibilities in terms of applications and services. Defence too, where lines move to better cooperate at European level and involve each Member State in the defence effort. Finally, the railway sector: we have voted on a number of provisions in this framework to improve passenger transport, but it also means making our suppliers benefit European countries have made many advances in this area. Advances also in digital — you have said it very well — with clear commitments on ending roaming charges, while preserving investments. The quality of networks and access to the Internet remain major concerns for all Europeans. As far as energy is concerned, security of gas supply has been and will be a central topic of our discussions. Regional cooperation and the exchange of information must be improved, and European solidarity must be improved. I am also pleased that Slovakia has made it possible to continue and strengthen the work undertaken by the Dutch Presidency on access to innovative medicines for patients. I was pleased to see the fight against Alzheimer's and antibiotic resistance appear at the top of your agenda. In particular, the Slovak Presidency reiterated the central role of the vaccine as a preventive tool, particularly useful in preventing antibiotic abuse and the dangers it creates. I have only one little regret, but only a little personal regret: no agreement has yet been reached on the new regulation on veterinary medicinal products, it is a pity, because antibiotic resistance is still one of our priorities. I have accepted your call, your call for more community spirit, your call to fight against national selfishness. I hope that it will be heard, in any case thank you for all the concrete measures that you have been able to put in place and which — I hope — will be heard and understood by our fellow citizens, in order to fight against the demagogy of some who want to show that the European Union is not moving forward.

With how much tension we watched the referendum in the UK. Its results affected the functioning of the whole EU, but also influenced the programme of the Slovak Presidency. We can balance today. MEPs from various political groups, committees and different countries have appreciated that the results of the Slovak Presidency are very positive. Even today, it sounded. Prime Minister, please give our thanks to the entire team led by Ivan Korček, who was still sitting here and everyone remembers his face. Of course, also to the Ministers, the Secretary of State and the expert team. I must also highlight the political maturity, correctness and joint efforts of more than 90% of Slovak representatives in the European Parliament. Thank you, dear colleagues, that you also cared for the Slovak Presidency to be successful — this is how you behaved. At the Bratislava Summit in September, all prime ministers or presidents sent a clear message: that the European Union is the only alternative for each of them. This message has tremendous power. We managed to adopt the so-called Bratislava road map, which aims to bring Europe closer to its citizens. A great success is the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. With the advent of a new administration in the US, we are all very pleased that the Paris Agreement is already an internationally valid document. We also managed to ratify the EU trade agreement with Canada (CETA). This agreement will serve as a model for many other agreements. In a record short time, the EU budget for next year was agreed. We found the agreement exactly on the anniversary of the tender revolution in Slovakia — on 17 November at 4:30 a.m. This day is also an international student day. That is why it is symbolic that on this day we managed to put EUR 500 million into the EU budget in support of young people's employment. European Socialists and Democrats fought for this project the beginning. Over three years, with this initiative, we have reduced the number of unemployed young people in the EU by 1.6 million. In Slovakia we have reduced youth unemployment by almost half with this project. Fighting tax evasion and fraud, migration crisis, helping third countries not to flee, combating terrorism, new Border and Coast Guard project, strong social agenda, safe and cheap energy, digital Europe, wholesale prices for roaming services, help farmers, jobs and growth in Europe... that is just part of the agenda that we have moved significantly forward by common forces during the Slovak Presidency.

It turned out that Slovakia coped with this task and responsibility with honour, especially thanks to the work of several young diplomats, many of whom have returned from abroad and helped to make our country more visible. They were behind the organisation of individual events and conferences within the Slovak Presidency. I think our thanks mainly to them, we should be able to express it adequately to them, I hope it will be right. Prime Minister Fico, I agree with you that political correctness, as you have said, is harmful and prevents us from naming things as they really are. One of the important issues that we must clearly name is the question of Turkey in relation to the European Union. We are more concerned about this issue. Since the coup attempt in Turkey in July, there have been a number of steps that must be clearly unacceptable to the European Union. We need to be able to express it. We should not be afraid to say more clearly that freedom of the media is one of the fundamental democratic values of our Community, and the verbal or physical attacks on journalists, the closing of entire editorial offices, the arrests of people in Turkey clearly contradicts this. Similarly, it is with the unmissable persecution of the Kurdish minority, what is happening in Turkey. The similarly stated introduction of the death penalty by President Erdogan needs to be clearly condemned. I regret that a number of leaders of the Union, too, in our Presidency, lack the courage to do so. However, concerns about the end of the agreement between the European Union and Turkey over the migration crisis or economic and economic benefits cannot be a measure of the declared rejection of political correctness. And this applies to relations with all countries that massively violate fundamental human rights. I am pleased that, in the European Parliament, my colleagues and I have expressed our position on the accession negotiations with Turkey, and we have called on the European Commission to have them, in the current situation, country froze. We must not be blackmailed by Turkey or President Erdogan. I believe that, above all, the closure of the so-called “migration flows to Europe” has resulted in a halt to the migration flows to Europe. The Balkan Road and the agreement with Turkey have already reduced the still low number of migrants who wanted to go to Europe.

If I may just point out two issues that I remember from your statement, one is that the domestic political agenda should not prevail over EU-related and common EU interests and affairs. I think that this is very important, but I must say that it still prevails and we see it on a daily or weekly basis. We see it in the Council and we see it in the Council groups: issues are addressed and suddenly an issue of so-called national interest always prevails, whether it is a question of addressing the opening up of the markets in railways, whether it is digital or whatever it is. In this respect, I think that we need to return to the roots, which in fact show the ability to address the issues and find a common basis. The second issue is that you spoke about the EU being subtle. If I may just add, I think that we would like to see an EU that is a strong player and that we still need to contribute to this in a major way. You also referred to the American presidential elections. There is perhaps a bit of uncertainty. We don’t yet know what the policies will be. We have heard a lot of statements that create concern – I would wait for the policies – and, at the same time, threats are expressed from time to time by Russia. These two issues are an invitation to the European Union to be that strong player and to be able to address the issues that are not dependent on the Americans nor on the Russians. We are focusing on the trade agenda. Of course we know what happened with TPP – we do not yet know what will happen with TTIP – but we do not have to wait. On the one hand, we can negotiate with the other countries but, at the same time, the new administration will be put into place and we should set a positive agenda. We should be the ones co-setting, if not setting, the agenda. I do not think that we can be caught unprepared in this respect. Reference was also made to the migration crisis - sometimes too little and too slow, but we are progressing, I agree with you; but I do not think we can hide the fact that what is happening today in Turkey is completely unacceptable. This is a question of our values, and I think that we can hardly continue accession negotiations with Turkey unless we see a real shift in the direction in which Turkey is heading. At the same time, I am in favour of setting the conditions – as we have said in the European Parliament – and reopening the negotiations once, let us say, the situation has progressed in that country. Apart from what I have said, I think that values are key. I must say that we need to apply the same measure to everyone. I am glad that you have signed the agreement with Cuba but, at the same time, I would like to see future agreements that have the conditionality - if they provide concessions - that at the same time, there is real motivation and progress in the countries concerned. Prime Minister, in conclusion, I agree with a lot that you have said. I think that you have had a new experience and that on these issues that you have expressed, and some that I have added, we need recognition, champions in the Council to move beyond marginal – and sometimes very partial – national interest.

Although it looked like it would be forced to deal with the aftermath of David Cameron's irresponsible policies and Brexit, Slovaks managed much more than generally expected of them. In the context of Brexit, for example, they have managed to tame initial strong passions and largely calm the situation and relations with the UK. At the beginning of this half year, I presented the belief that this Presidency will see the European Union that the Visegrad Four countries are not enemies of Europe. I reiterate that we also want to live in peace and prosperity, but we have our political specifics and ask that it be respected. We are not non-solidarity, we are not irresponsible solitaires. We're not the ones who leave when times are mean. It is sad, but from a media point of view this presidency has been talked about especially because of scandals, but other aspects of a very complex period have not been addressed. Slovak diplomats managed to deal effectively with complicated problems compared to other presidencies and avoided internal political disputes. Thanks to considerable efforts, the Slovak side managed to ensure that farmers now have a chance for a transparent and commercial environment without unfair practices. I see this as a great achievement important for the future of the whole sector and for the sustainable development of the European Union. The Slovak Presidency has moved some important issues to denouement and has proved that even a small country can do much important work. Of course, I am far from agreeing with all the actions of this Presidency, especially in connection with the CETA and TTIP commercial treaties. I don't really consider it to be a chance or hope. It's the wrong concept of international trade that will fall upon our citizens. But at the same time, I believe it managed to dispel the initial panic that circulated in the couloirs before your presidency, Prime Minister. I want to reiterate at the moment, that countries from Central and Eastern Europe refuse to be taken as a second-category country, and I sincerely hope that the Slovak Presidency has proved to you, colleagues and colleagues, that we are not them. Finally, I would like to appreciate Prime Minister Fico, who managed to form a functional coalition for this presidency very quickly after the election, despite having health complications. Prime Minister, thank you for showing that we — like us, smaller countries — can be proud and can do a good job, and thank you also to your people who have been good allies in Europe Parliament in individual negotiations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1247, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": " on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. — (FR) Mr President, Prime Minister, I think you are right. Our citizens are expressing concern and mistrust towards the European Union when it is not frankly growing anger, and the referendum that took place in the United Kingdom at the outset of your presidency is the clearest demonstration of this. No wonder, of course, when a quarter of Europeans face the risk of poverty and social exclusion and many others say that they may be the next to have to go into the door. Many attribute all this to the European Union. Faced with that, you say, we need a new impetus, and you are right. But where was that new momentum during your presidency? I am still seeking to call into question an inept macroeconomic policy, which makes competition between workers with each other, a completely manic pursuit of free trade agreements and completely unreasonable budgetary austerity the key words of its policy. I am still looking for the beginnings, the impetus of a fiscal and social Europe, without which monetary union is doomed to failure. You were talking about a leading European Union in climate change, well that is no longer the case. Whereas in 2004, the European Union, which accounted for 30% of global GDP, invested more than half in renewable energy, today we still account for one-fifth of the world's GDP, but we account for only 17% of investment in renewables. We have become poor followers. From all this, of this fairer, more sustainable and more democratic Europe, I find no trace in the Bratislava process, which seems to be clinging to a Europe of defence as the solution to all evils. As for migration, I must acknowledge that during the Dutch Presidency, and then under the Presidency Slovak, the key words of migration policy have become “dismissal” and “keep at bay”. Of course, Prime Minister, it's not you. It is not you who said that you are not obliged to welcome all those at risk. It is not you, it is Mr Theo Francken, the Minister for Migration in Belgium, a minister Marine Le Pen would certainly not deny. However, I will repeat one of your quotes, which is that the idea that a multicultural Europe is a failure and that the natural integration of people who have a different way of life, thought, another culture and, above all, another religion, is not possible. Mr Fico, I tell you that if this multicultural Europe is impossible, then it is the European Union that is impossible, because the European Union, you see, it is a Union that has decided to make the motto 'unity in diversity'. The idea of the European Union is precisely to bring people living on a very small continent with different ways of thinking, lifestyles, languages and indeed religions.

One of the stated priorities of the Presidency was to contribute to combating unfair trade practices in the food industry. Following the EP resolution on this topic, the Presidency in Bratislava held an international expert conference on how to strengthen the position of farmers in the food chain at which a number of delegates expressed their belief about the need to adopt European legislation. Not only the EP, but also a number of Member States invited the Commission to submit a proposal to straighten relations between producers, suppliers and food vendors. As rapporteur of the revision of the regulation on cooperation of supervisory authorities in the field of consumer protection, I also welcome that the Presidency has worked extensively to discuss this extensive regulation, and Slovak colleagues in the Council managed to gain support among the Member States for the proposal.

Among the biggest successes of the Slovak Presidency are the launch of the long-awaited European Border and Coast Guard, which aims to provide a more effective response from the Union to illegal immigration issues. Slovakia also managed to negotiate the EU budget for 2017 smoothly despite the resistance of some states, which threatened even to veto it. As a success, Bratislava can also sign the October 30 CETA agreement with Canada, which allowed it to be temporarily applied until ratified. For the Committee on Agriculture, which I chair, it is particularly important to adopt Council conclusions on unjust practices in the food supply chain, providing, inter alia, for the possibility of legislative action at Union level. In the European Parliament, we have called for such solutions for many years and now there is a real opportunity for action in this area.

Today is a very important day for human rights. We have awarded the Sakharov Prize to two great women, and now we are discussing the 2015 human rights report, which we will vote on tomorrow. Historians may refer to 2015 as a very crucial year. It was the year of the refugee crisis that sustainably challenged solidarity in Europe, and it was the year when Europe's dwindling role in foreign policy became increasingly apparent. It is not surprising that something has not really improved this year as far as the human rights situation is concerned. But I don't want to stop this fatalistic assessment. And because, especially in times of crisis, the foundations are supposed to be visible — and the foundation of the European Union, Europe, is democracy, the rule of law and human rights. The ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights — these are the foundations, these are Europe's unique selling points. It is important that foreign policy makes this visible here too. The report therefore deals not only with the global human rights situation, but also, in particular, with the various instruments available to the EEAS. Like my predecessors Panzeri and Preda, I took a systematic approach. You do not want to list different occasions in different conflict zones. There is an annex to this, and we also have the very efficient instrument of urgent resolutions. I would therefore ask colleagues not to accept any amendments which call this principle into question again. It is a good thing that the Union is clearly committed to human rights. We have very important instruments: the European Union delegations, the human rights dialogues and the Special Representative for Human Rights. Stavros Lambrinidis has done an excellent job in 2015, as always, and he is a good, important ally of the European Parliament. Delegations are working very intensively, and we have always been able to see on missions the importance of human rights for the representatives of the Union. However, in the interests of the coherence and credibility of our human rights policy, it would be important for us to focus more on the increasing constraints of civil society. It's a great threat that spreads like a plague. The matter is simple: without strong civil society, there is no effective protection of human rights. It is therefore very important to strengthen this, as well as support for human rights activists who not only need legal advice, but also need to visit prisons and who should also be accompanied in court proceedings. The report also has substantive priorities. Migration and flight were particularly important — 2015 was very important in this context. We have also particularly addressed the issue of discrimination. What we have already stated in the Amsterdam Treaty: discrimination should be at the heart of our policy and should also be at the heart of human rights policy. It is of particular importance that there are consequences. Law enforcement and trade policy should be linked to human rights. The report has been debated very intensively. Experts and human rights organisations were called in. We had a total of 866amendments. I would like to thank the staff who have supported us in this. I am particularly grateful to the shadow rapporteurs for the constructive and pleasant working atmosphere.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1261, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. –Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur. As you know, we discuss our annual human rights reports twice a year, but if I look at the long list of debates we have had together in this Chamber over the last year, human rights have been at the centre of each and every European Parliament plenary. Even today, a few hours ago, we listened to our Sakharov Prize laureates, who I have just had the honour of meeting, saying that they look up to Europe as a symbol of humanity.  This is not simply an institutional duty that we fulfil. Our work on human rights lies at the core of our foreign policy. It defines our European Union and it defines who we are. Whatever we do concerns the real lives of real human beings. We do understand power politics and the great games of international affairs. Not only do we understand them, but we often play our part to shape them. But we never forget that everything we do is about real people. This is the European way in foreign policy. We are not naive and we are not cynical. In the global strategy we refer to principled pragmatism and that is our way. This will be even more important in the months and years to come. The decision by some countries to withdraw from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court demonstrates that the pressure on the international system of global governance is going to be raised. There will be – there is already – a growing demand for a power that stands on the side of human rights. We are, more and more, an indispensable power – an indispensable power for human rights, for multilateralism, for a rules-based global order.  The report we are discussing today shows once again that all institutions of this Union stand on the same side. I am glad that you have shown your support not only for our Action Plan on Human Rights, but also for our Operation Sophia and for our new external investment plan. We agree on fundamentals, we agree on the vision, and we share the view that 2016 has been a very difficult year indeed for democracy and human rights. We are all convinced that there is no sustainable development without human rights, and there is no sustainable security without fundamental freedoms. This is what the global strategy calls resilience. Our states and our societies are strong only when democracy is strong, when the debate is free and open, when human rights are respected, when the space for participation is open and guaranteed, and participation itself is active and welcomed. Human rights abuses do not make a country more stable or more secure. On the contrary, they only make societies less resilient and weaken the legitimacy of institutions. This vision is already inspiring our actions in very concrete ways. Let me give a few examples. First, the report talks about our missions and operations and the link between security and human rights. The prevention of human rights abuses is indeed becoming a key focus, a key element for our work on security. The EU Action Plan on Human Rights says that our support for our partners’ security forces must always be consistent with the promotion of human rights. We are doing this in practice every single day, for instance also through my proposal of a European framework to support security sector reform. 2017 will be the year of a mid—term review for the Action Plan and we are already working on a daily basis to make it a meaningful review. Second, the report rightly focuses on civil society and the restrictions on freedom of expression. It is almost impossible to mention all the initiatives we have put in place to preserve and enlarge the space for pluralism and free debate. Some of you attended the annual EU—NGO Forum a few days ago in Brussels. You know our dialogue with civil society organisations is constant and intense, both in our region and worldwide. The EU4HumanRights campaign has raised awareness about human rights in Europe and beyond.  Let me thank in particular, as you did, our Special Representative Stavros Lambrinidis, who is here with me today, as he always is whenever we have these debates in this Chamber. His work is making a difference every single day for so many people and in particular for human rights activists and campaigners. You were talking about visits, dialogues and meetings – he is in strong and constant connection with me and with all our services and thus with many of you, and is our hand, our brain, our voice in handling difficult cases, in many cases with success and results of which we are proud. Thank you, Stavros. In 2016 the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights directly supported more than 250 human rights defenders and their families who were at risk because of their daily work.  On the third element, we are engaging constantly with our partners through dedicated human rights dialogues. I know that this is a delicate chapter of our work and I will start with the most delicate example. Yesterday in Brussels I met with Bruno Rodriguez, the Foreign Minister of Cuba. Our relationship with Cuba has entered a completely new phase and one of the first new steps we took was to start a dialogue on human rights. We have had two rounds of that – one in Europe and one in Havana – and I believe there is no other way to try to make a real difference than to engage constantly and tirelessly in trying to improve the situation on the ground, having frank and open discussions with our partners.  Finally, we are keeping human rights and the rights of women and children in particular at the core of peace talks and reconciliation processes. Syria is constantly on our minds, in these hours in particular as we are receiving terrible reports from the ground. Here I would like to take the opportunity in this debate to add my voice to that of the UN Secretary—General, who just a few hours ago underlined the obligation of all parties on the ground to protect civilians and abide by international humanitarian and human rights law, recalling that this is particularly the responsibility of the Syrian Government and its allies.  Those who perpetrate war crimes will be held accountable. The priority now, in these hours, is to protect civilians and guarantee them safe and monitored transit to a place of safety. We all know that it is also crucial – still in Syria, but in the future – to be working on protecting everyone’s rights through the transition, and in the transition, at the moment when a political process is finally put in place. But let me also mention a success story – as you did – and some positive examples: the peace deal in Colombia, an agreement for all the victims of conflicts that would provide a sound basis towards justice, reconciliation and reaching the truth. I am honoured that Juan Manuel Santos, the President of Columbia, was in Brussels with us yesterday on his first international visit after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize; together we launched the EU Trust Fund, precisely to accompany the implementation of the peace agreement in Colombia.  So let me conclude on a positive note. Yes, the situation of human rights in the word is very serious, but there are also success stories. Wherever things are moving in the right direction, the European Union is there, engaged directly through our funds, our delegations, our special representatives, dialogues and diplomacy. My message for you is the same one that I delivered to the NGOs a few days ago: we all need to be vigilant, we need to be critical where necessary, but we also need to amplify the success stories. We need to talk about the real people behind the numbers and beyond the budget lines. We need to show that the European Union is practically and concretely a force for human rights, a force for democracy and a force for good. We need our voice – your voice – to be heard on this too, more than ever.

As you know, development, human rights and democracy are intrinsically linked, and I look forward to seeing these issues prominently in the report to be voted on tomorrow. Indeed, human rights, good governance, democracy and the rule of law are essential elements in eradicating poverty and inequality and, conversely, poverty and inequality endanger the enjoyment of human rights. In the Committee on Development, we welcomed the inclusion of a chapter on development in the 2015 Annual Report and hoped that it would become a constant practice. We also want to see a genuine synchronization between human rights and all our development cooperation, starting with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Human rights must, I believe, be a major cross-cutting element in achieving the goals of sustainable development. And I must also stress the paramount importance of Goal 16, aimed at guaranteeing peace, justice and integration in societies, since in the absence of peace, our development assistance cannot achieve its goals and respect for human rights cannot be ensured.

With this report we need to be able to seriously assess the things we have done, especially with regard to certain areas, I think about trade agreements, and we need to use benchmarks and actions towards this direction precisely to build new visions regarding human rights. I think we have a lot to accomplish, to do, to do and we must do so by raising, substantially, the political level of our intervention on human rights. Our response must be to make Europe's citizens understand that less rights means less democracy and that cooperation with third countries in this field is also essential for us and for our future. We need to be consistent and ensure that human rights are respected both inside and outside the European Union and we must do so, this, with great energy, we must basically understand that human rights issue is an essential issue of all the policies of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1266, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, we are constantly reminded in this Parliament of the many atrocities and acts of human rights abuse that tragically occur throughout the world, such as in Aleppo right now as I speak.

What they have experience under the brutal regime of ISIS is as evil an ideology as anybody could possibly imagine. These are personal stories, but they serve to illustrate the plight of millions of others who find themselves in similar circumstances across the globe.  Member States throughout the European Union each enjoy their own histories and historical trajectories of course. They have each move from autocracies in the past to democracy today, enshrining the rights of all over the few, and developing legal systems that have delivered equality before the law, albeit in very different timeframes. These are the principles that have delivered the civil and political freedoms and protections that we all enjoy today, along with many other economic and social rights. These are the values of the European Union, respect for human dignity and human rights, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law, freedom of the press and expression. It is important that we recall that it is these fundamental values and other institutions that deliver the peace and prosperity we all see in Europe and the developed world today. It is also important that we continue to be a voice in advocating those values across other parts of the world, so we fully support the human rights report in the world as it is.

The list is long and requires clear push-back that involves more leadership from Europe.  It is difficult to be proud of Europe when we watch Aleppo fall and bombardments by Russian and Assad’s planes being rewarded, when refugees fleeing this atrocious war are being fenced off, and international law and human rights are discarded when they get in the way of counterterrorism efforts or ‘managing’ migration. It is now more important than ever for us to stand unequivocally for the very values upon which our open societies are based and give meaning to those values globally. That means a more forceful and credible stance for the importance of and respect for human rights.  Young women, such as the Sakharov Prize winners who courageously fight the horrible violence caused by Daesh, have fled to Europe, but imagine the many, many, many who have spent years in refugee camps now, who have been married off with absolutely no perspective. What will we tell them? We cannot be complacent and must make sure that Europe remains a beacon of freedom, a safe haven for free thinkers and a meaningful representation of what universality of human rights is actually about. It is not only the right thing to do, but it is in our self-interest to offer perspectives for people who need them so desperately, such as in North Africa and the Middle East. I therefore urge you, as my final comment, to avoid deals like the one made with Turkey and now being copied with countries like Mali, in order to avoid a situation where the EU’s foreign policy becomes a mere instrument to manage migration without having a clear focus on the need to defend and protect human rights.

I am afraid, however, that the result will not be up to the challenges we should deal with in the field of human rights and their necessary universality, and how the European Union should act on this matter. I think we have never had such a long report. The longer it is, the more, there are contradictions, the less priorities are identified, and I'm sorry for that. I am particularly critical of the part that concerns migration. How can we unconditionally support readmission agreements, the Khartoum process or the Africa Trust Fund, when these agreements and procedures focus on countries where human rights are violated on a daily basis, as is the case in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, and when these agreements are first and foremost decided on the basis of the number of those arriving to seek refuge on the soil of the European Union. What do the objectives of return policies, not sufficient, do in a human rights report? How does the flight forward in defence policy serve human rights? Moreover, despite the willingness not to target countries in particular, we still find the same obsessions dear to some in this Chamber and always the same forgotten. Not a word about the Gulf countries, not a word about Israel, even refusal to mention the States most concerned in Latin America.

This year's Human Rights Report is both comprehensive and more progressive than before, in a number of important policy areas. Many thanks for this to the rapporteur, Mr Weidenholzer. Further demands can be found in the area of business and human rights in order to achieve greater legally binding obligations. Issues such as the use of armed drones, the fight against human trafficking and the protection of land rights also attracted more attention than in the past. Our report calls for coherence and continuity in human rights policy. With regard to the EU's refugee policy, however, we have to note that, both in 2015 and on an ongoing basis to this day, there is probably no policy area in which the EU failed so miserably because of this very requirement. Even in this parliamentary report, there was no majority criticism of the current outsourcing of European responsibility for the protection and care of refugees. The renunciation of a policy in accordance with human rights is to the detriment of those seeking help in Europe and is in stark contradiction with their own human rights. EU claims. Our report strongly calls for the fight against impunity. The International Criminal Court needs all our support in order to operate independently and efficiently. Now the governments of South Africa, Burundi and Gambia have decided to withdraw from the ICC. They are mainly concerned with exempting heads of state from prosecution — an extremely contradictory and unacceptable demand. It is to be welcomed that the President of Gambia is now considering withdrawing this decision.

The words of Nadia Murad and Lamiya Hayi Bashar resonate in this House still today and are a great responsibility for all of us. Last Saturday we commemorated World Human Rights Day. Sixty-eight years after member States joined the Universal Declaration. And sixty-eight years later, there's not very good news, I'm afraid. The Declaration remains painfully pending. This past year — 2016 — and 2015, which is the report addresses, have not been particularly good for human rights either. War crimes and crimes against humanity continue to occur and go unpunished. The International Criminal Tribunal, far from being strengthened, is being weakened because several countries were withdrawing from the Rome Statute. We are unable to enforce international humanitarian law, and attacks on hospitals, schools and humanitarian personnel are repeated every month. There is a virtually global trend towards greater repression against civil society, and humanitarian aid remains scarce and does not reach the whole world. But if there is something that will mark the Europe of 2015 is the refugee crisis. Never in history have there been so many refugees and displaced persons that we have not been able to care for. Europe, despite some efforts, has not been up to the top, mainly because of the responsibility of the Member States. Thousands of these refugees failed to survive. Thousands drowned in our Mediterranean Sea and yet, in spite of everything, and as we have heard here this morning, the European Union remains a reference for many people. A reference of justice and solidarity; a model for the world. That is why I am talking about responsibility, and that is why I say that this Parliament will continue to call on A Union that does not flucking its commitment to the defence of human rights and does so without complexes, before political and commercial interests jump above human dignity. Human rights must underpin our external and internal action, they must be the central element of our message. Only then can we be minimally effective in their defense. In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge Mr Lambrinidis's excellent work. A work often little known but that is a reference for many of us already. Congratulations and thank you.

Harassment, imprisonment, and disappearances of independent journalists, political opposition and human rights defenders have become everyday news. Just as one more faked election is on the news every few years.  In some countries like Belarus, things have been fixed for quite some time already when it comes to human rights. Cleansed and frozen.

No. That is why it is also right that, within the European Union, we call on Member States such as Hungary and Poland not to go any further along the path they have taken.

Allow me to highlight four elements that I think are salient to the annual report. First, as the report highlights, the magnitude of migration flows has raised important human rights issues. The launch of Operation Sofia is a means of combating traffickers and thus protecting human rights. It is therefore crucial today that human rights remain a red line in our dialogue with third countries for joint management of migration, particularly in the context of the Valletta Action Plan. The second point I note in the report is the key role of European Union delegations. The role they have to play in contributing to the protection of human rights defenders, to initiate early alerts of deteriorating situations and following up on the recommendations of election observation missions. These expectations imply that sufficient human and financial capacities are allocated, and that delegations receive support from Member States' embassies. Thirdly, the fight against impunity and the role of the International Criminal Court. Yes, the European Union must remain firm on the Rome Statute. Nevertheless, I believe that we need a genuine strategy to promote membership of the ICC by States that have not yet signed or ratified its Statute, and thus broaden its regional scope, but we must also find a way to incorporate criticism from members constructively.

All of your observations will obviously inform our constant daily work and also including some suggestions that were more focused on precise elements or files we are working on, from the individual cases to the big crisis zones. Some of you, I think Mr Panzeri said that human rights are a fundamental component of every single policy of the European Union. This is exactly my commitment. It is also my institutional responsibility regarding the external policies of the European Union: trying to make sure that human rights are at the centre of whatever we do, be it security, development, be it trade, be it all the external policies we run. Let me also underline that I share very much what some of you said: this also requires a policy coherence in our internal policies. This goes beyond my institutional responsibilities, but this is at the core of my political worries. The more we are consistent with human rights, respect and promotion inside our borders, the more we are credible and also powerful in ensuring human rights are protected and promoted outside of the Union. As many of you remembered and recalled, we are a community of values and not only a community of people or policies. I would really plead for you to use, at least in this Chamber, appropriate language. I have heard words today that hurt me very much, especially after having heard this morning the testimony of two girls who have shown incredible courage, not only for what they have lived through, but also for sharing this experience with others, reliving their experiences in such a painful way. Hearing in this room words like ‘imported people’ as if people could be traded or imported or exported, I think it is really something we should pay attention to, especially in this room, to honour the community of values that you all represent in this Chamber. Work continues with our special representative, with Stavros, every single day, on all the various files. I am sure that we will continue to work together in this respect with the role of the European Parliament at the centre of our daily work and the European Union will continue to be, at least externally, and I hope also internally, very strongly, the most active, the most dedicated, the most committed promoter and defender of human rights in the world. Because we see all the limits of our work; we see the limits of our results: a lot of frustration sometimes, but still we continue. But if you look around in the world, you realise that we are the most committed, the most dedicated, the most convinced promoters of human rights all over the world, and I will continue, together with you, to be strongly committed to this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1331, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Josef WEIDENHOLZER", "mepid": "111014", "text": " rapporteur. — Mr President. I would like to thank all my fellow Members very warmly for discussing a wide range of issues in their speeches, which I was unable to deal with due to lack of time. I would particularly like to thank the High Representative, Mrs Mogherini, for making it clear that human rights violations do not make countries safer, but rather the opposite is true that wherever human rights, democracy and the rule of law are not respected, there is a major security shortcoming emerges. This is a very important statement, which should of course also be taken into account in everyday politics. I would like to briefly highlight three points: law enforcement has been mentioned, and I believe that an instrument is only good if it has teeth. In this sense, we must do a great deal to improve these instruments. It's also good if we see new developments. We have dealt with drones here in this report. This is something completely new, where violations of human rights can suddenly occur almost outside the normal legal framework, where machines take responsibility. This is something we haven't actually known so far. We have also dealt with these aspects in great detail, such as freedom of expression on the Internet, hate speech. Here too, you should be more active. Of course, we have been talking about human rights violations in the EU in response to some colleagues who are no longer here. I would like to remind you all that you yourself voted on the Fundamental Rights Report yesterday, which is exactly what you criticised later. Let me say briefly: we should consider how we can reform this human rights report. He would have to be more timely, he would have to become leaner and more precise, and he would have to better communicate with the allow the Commission. The role of the Human Rights Commissioner is essential here.

I would like to echo the last word of the previous rapporteur: in these hours the light is coming out in Aleppo — with much, much suffering and death. We have to recognise that attempts to achieve a peaceful solution have failed, and in the end Europe was no longer there, because I believe we have a decisive weakness. Not that Mrs Mogherini is doing the wrong job here, but if you don't have a stick, the carrot won't help with that either. That is why I believe that we need to make an appropriate mix, and what you have proposed in your Global Strategy, what has been decided by the Council of Foreign Affairs, which will be decided in the European Council the day after tomorrow, shows that we are crucial in the field of foreign, security and, above all, defence policy. need to move forward. We see that flight movements that concern us have something to do with a war that we cannot make a sufficient contribution to ending it decisively and early. We see that military violations of international law are being perpetrated in Europe, as in Kiev. We see that traffickers are causing incredible suffering on the coasts, which leads to many deaths in the Mediterranean. We see the development problems in Africa that bring insecurity, war and flight. I believe that we must also see that both Russia's conduct in violation of international law and statements in the American election campaign also lead to uncertainties as to whether NATO's collective defence still has full credibility. We must work to ensure that it has full credibility, because we need a security guarantee for our Member States, and that has to do with NATO. But this also shows that we need to develop our own skills to strengthen NATO, or if NATO does not work to have something of your own. For both reasons, we have to do this ourselves, and I believe that this must proceed accordingly. Nor can we make a difference in many parts between internal and external security when we come to the issue of terrorism, for example. I believe that many things intertwine and that, for these reasons, too, we need to overcome the passivity that we have sometimes had. The fact is that 70% or more of European citizens agree on an issue that more Europe needs to come — namely in foreign, security and distribution policy. I believe that sometimes the apparatuses in the national capitals block, but not the citizens who want more security. I believe that it is important for the reason that we finally come to the fact that there is a mentality in the Member States, that we need to have better common diplomacy, that the European Member States must act more together here and not a race between the foreign ministers, who will first compete with the foreign ministers. his flight somewhere, but it needs to be spoken with one voice to move diplomacy forward. We need development. If I have a sensible development policy, not only in the classical sense of development policy as we understand it, but better living conditions in other countries, particularly in Africa, also in view of the demographic factor. This includes a different trade policy. This means that there must be an integrated approach in many areas and no longer the distribution between two different subjects. I believe that only then can the problems be solved. Only then peace is possible. We must recognise that development provides security, but that even with stability, social justice, democracy and the rule of law, we are once again stabilising and advancing development can provide a sustainable development that is necessary. I believe that we need all the military conditions for this too. We need skills in foreign and security policy, and that is why we need to realise that our Member States are spending EUR 200 billion on defence, with a moderate result. Here we need the synergy effects in the areas of headquarters, command lines, cooperation, pooling and sharing, procurement, research and development. I believe that there is an urgent need for us to move forward in this area in order to be able to deliver accordingly. I hope that this development and this willingness, which has developed over the past six months, will play a role in the European Council on Thursday, that we will take decisive steps forward in the relevant preparatory work that you too, Mrs Mogherini, will make us take decisive steps to ensure that Europe gives its citizens the feeling that to provide security. Lack of security is what makes Europe insecure. Because of the fears — this is what drives the populists.

Thank you for the wisdom, the competence, the passion you put into everything you do and also into this excellent report. Thank you also for this debate, the third Article 36 debate we have had this year, and as you know we are supposed to have at least two Article 36 debates per year and we went further – this I believe is proof of the fact that we need to work more together on this, but also the intensity and the quality of our cooperation in this field. So thank you also for that, and thank you because your report follows not just the structure of the global strategy but also the spirit of the strategy. This report’s message on the European Union as, I quote, ‘the largest economic power, the most generous donor of humanitarian and development assistance, and the front-runner in global multilateral diplomacy’, end quote, is exactly what we need in these times. To be a little bit more self-confident or at least aware of the instruments we have. The report describes a European Union that is a superpower, a diplomatic superpower, but I’m glad that we are finally starting to realise our potential and our strength. It is so important that European institutions pass coherent messages in these complicated times, because we all see the challenges, we all see the threats, we also see the limits, but we must never forget our strengths. We must never forget that as a true Union we are a global player and our unity holds the key to the security of our citizens, as you just said, and also of our partners. And since I’ve presented the global strategy on foreign and security policy, our work for a stronger Union has moved on very concretely and very fast. So today I would like to update you on our main actions starting with those on security and defence that I will present on Thursday, two days from now, to the European Council, to our Heads of State and Government. When I presented this strategy I said that the implementation would have to begin in a matter of weeks and not in a matter of years, and by the end of this week exactly this package on security and defence will be presented. I will present it to the European Council to give its endorsement to it but also its orientations on this defence package. It is a package based on three main ideas and three main documents. First idea and documents. Our Union can be made more secure through our external action, and this is the sense of the global strategy and its implementation plan on security and defence, that was already endorsed by the Foreign and Defence Ministers in November. Second, we need a stronger defence industry and to achieve this goal with the European Commission we have put forward a European defence action plan. Third, we need stronger cooperation with our partners and with this in mind the European Union has signed an unprecedented joint declaration with NATO. This package includes a number of concrete actions to make our defence spending more efficient and effective, to improve our rapid response to crises, for the joint planning and conduct of our missions, and for Member States to explore the possibility of a permanent structured cooperation on defence matters. We need to address our citizens’ needs, not with endless ideological debates but with concrete decisions, so we are moving fast and with concrete steps towards a real European Union of security and defence. But implementation of the global strategy is not simply about defence. Greater integration on security cannot be and should not be a substitute for greater integration in other fields. I want to be very clear on this. We need much more in different fields of our policies for what relates my institutional competences, the second strand of implementation of the global strategy relates to the resilience of states and societies in our region and to an integrated approach to conflicts and crises. We are working now on a set of targeted actions to address the whole cycle of conflict and crisis, and on a joint communication on resilience to be presented by next spring. In the meantime, the strategy is already impacting on our new policy proposals: we have just discussed now the link between human rights and resilience, and how we are putting human rights at the centre of all our foreign policies. Moreover, last month we presented our proposal for a new consensus on development which is 100% consistent with the approach of the strategy: for the first time ever, all European institutions can agree on a shared development policy, one common policy on development for the Parliament, the Commission, the Council and each and every national government. If we finally manage to make full use of our different European and national instruments and at the same time to act as one single force, then our potential truly has no parallel in the world. Implementation of the strategy also includes the revision of our sectoral and geographical strategies and a renewed and joint attention on public diplomacy. But let me just focus on two other strands of implementation before I conclude. One is the link between our internal and external policies, starting from migration. Our external work on migration, in particular with the migration compacts, but not only, is proceeding along these lines and I will present the second progress report on the five migration compacts at the European Council on Thursday. Last but not least, the work on global governance. It is extremely important and I know I can count on this Chamber to work hand-in-hand on this. Just yesterday my friend António Guterres was sworn in as the new Secretary-General of the United Nations. Our cooperation with Ban Ki-moon already has been really impressive and I would like to thank him for this. On all the current crises, from Syria to Libya, to the work we are doing in these very minutes and hours on Aleppo, trying to guarantee the protection of civilians, all the current crises, all the work we do and also on all the global issues from sustainable development to climate change, the European Union and the United Nations are natural partners and we are working together on a daily basis. António’s mandate will provide us with an even greater opportunity to strengthen and reform the system of global governance. We are entering a phase of change for the United Nations, this is an opportunity for our European Union to be more and more present inside the UN system with a more effective coordination among Member States, and I think I can count on this Chamber to support this approach as well. The last few years, despite all the crises and all the difficulties inside the United Nations, we have also managed to show the incredible potential of a more cooperative global governance, from the deal on Iran’s nuclear programme to the Quartet report on the Middle East, from the Paris Agreement on climate change to the sustainable development goals, the international community has delivered on many of the challenges it has faced. The European Union has the duty and the interest to keep a reformed United Nations at the core of the international system, and I know on this we can work together with this Parliament. So let me also thank you, Elmar, for your constant leadership, for your constant wisdom, for your constant passion in the work you have done as the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I know this is your last CFSP report as the AFET chair, but I count personally on your commitment to a stronger European Union, to continue to support the work we are doing to make the European Union our Union, a stronger actor as a force for multilateralism, for peace, for cooperation as a principled and responsible superpower.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1342, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (FR) Mr President, first of all I would like to welcome the ambitious report prepared by Mr Elmar Brok, whose message is clear: we want a more present, more assertive, but above all more efficient Europe. It is time to focus on areas where we can make a difference, and respect for human rights and democracy must remain more than ever at the heart of our external policies. Here are a few things that I think are essential: first of all, enlargement. It must not be forgotten that this is the best instrument of stability on the European continent. Europe's reaction to the various crises and to the rise of populism must be openness, not retreat. I am thinking in particular of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country for which I am rapporteur. We must do everything we can to ensure the future of the country within the Union. Secondly, our crisis management capabilities in the neighbourhood, be it east with Ukraine or south with Syria or Libya. The report points out that the European Union is a diplomatic superpower, which is true, in theory, but we must be more present. That is why, I believe, the Union can do more to resolve the Syrian conflict rather than just a humanitarian actor. Another point I would like to highlight is the issue of strategic partners of which India is a part. For this tool to be a real asset of our foreign policy, it must be redesigned and revitalized. Finally comes the Europe of defence. I hope that the Heads of State will give a strategic impetus to the defence on Thursday, with clear guidance on the way forward. We need more commitment on the part of the Member States, more cooperation and, above all, to equip us with real civilian and military capabilities.

It is a real piece of work, a real legacy to the European Parliament and foreign affairs, security and defence. We are now in a period of unprecedented challenges for foreign policy, and with the election of Donald Trump in the USA, we also have ahead of us a situation of unprecedented uncertainty. This is happening at a time when we are confronted with multiple wars and, among other things, terrorism, migration, and the imperialistic attitude of Russia and its propaganda. I should also mention equally its direct threat to the free and fair elections in some new Member States and beyond. This gives even more importance to the role of the EU on the global scene. It is an opportunity, but also a challenge. We have to prove that we are capable of playing a leading role and a resolute one. We will be marginalised, and other global actors will prevail over us if we fail. In order to be influential, we need first and foremost unity and full support for the High Representative and the global strategy. This is the only way we can make use of our leverage. The other important consequence following the elections of the new American president is that we also have uncertainty as to how the USA will now interpret their role in NATO. This requires an even larger importance in the current international context. Also, from this point of view, we should take the opportunity to intensify the role of EU Member States within NATO, and to enhance the process of a joint EU-NATO agenda as was done after the NATO summit in Warsaw. This agenda must be based on complementarity, cooperation, coordination at the highest level of interoperability of our forces in the interest of collective defence.  I very much welcome the steps already taken by the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, and I only hope that this is just the starting point of much more consistent cooperation. It goes without saying that, in order to achieve these goals, we need to urgently strengthen and restructure our defence investments; not spending, but investments. I fear a simple coordination of investments is not enough. We have until today relied mostly on NATO and particularly on the USA. Now, the time has come to clearly identify our challenges and our needs and to take all the necessary actions in that direction while, at the same time, being proactive in the relations with the future challenges. I will conclude by saying that pooling and sharing has proved to be just close to nothing. We have to act for the security needs of all 27 Member States today and in the future.

The praise of the EU as a generous donor of development aid and humanitarian aid in the report conceals an important fact: 60% of development aid funds go directly back to European companies and organisations. Mr Brok, sensible development aid, sustainable development aid looks different! Criticism of the practice of arms exports is also in vain, as the EU remains one of the largest arms dealers in the world. In fact, there are regulations, but arms are unrebated, death is exported, especially to the countries of the Middle East. It is cynical when the people who want to flee to Europe before death by these weapons are increasingly prevented from doing what drives them on even more dangerous routes. Legal escape routes are now almost completely closed. It is an abuse to use development aid to better defend against protection seekers. Borders are being raised before the borders — see Tunisia, Libya, the Sahel. Yes, that too is a kind of enlargement policy. Is this also a human rights policy that has always been invoked in the debate before? These connections are not found in the report, because there is only one route here: more armament, more money for the arms industry and arms research, the fusion of internal and external security, and not least aggressive refugee defence. For a long time they wrote on the flags that the EU wanted to create a ring of friends around it. This approach has completely failed. What we have is a ring of fire!

Nevertheless, I’m going to concentrate on a few more specific issues since this is not the first, and probably won’t be the last document dealing with our global strategy and its implementation. First of all, let me thank the rapporteur for the exemplary work which as usual he put into the report, both in the draft and in the negotiations. We are glad to be able to be part of many of the compromises. The report rightly highlights the possibility and the wish and even, to some degree, the fact that Europe could be a diplomatic superpower. It is something that we should all strive for, and we agree that this is the goal, but there are quite a few steps along the way until we fully reach that potential. Just to mention one single example: the EU has more diplomatic representations around the globe than any of the Member States, but nevertheless so far we have been unable to pool even our consular functions. So the blocks that come are usually not from the other institutions, not from the European Parliament and not from the Council, but from the Member States. A diplomatic superpower should not speak with many different voices. We can only become a diplomatic superpower if we remain committed to an integrated and common foreign policy. For that we need to convince our Member States as well. Secondly, I would like to mention the claims that we need significant defence capability development. We agree that we need to have power in order to be able to keep and foster peace around the world. That also requires power, we fully agree with that. We also agree that we are not there yet. We need further developments in this field. However, what we’re slightly worried about is the militarisation of foreign policy: that is something which needs to be avoided, and it needs to be avoided because a military policy cannot dictate the needs of diplomacy. Last but not least, as the Vice President has already mentioned, the development policy needs to be an integrated one, fully agreed between all the institutions.

A reality that sees, for example, a situation totally changed in the international relationship between the great powers, when even a simple immobiliarist, a person who has made himself, who himself is always busy with business, real estate, but which obviously has a great sense, he understood that the fight against terrorism, because here we say that a strong, muscular, European defence policy is needed to fight terrorism and pretend not to know that the golden way to fight terrorism and beat terrorism — Aleppo teaches — is to seek a policy of agreement, of coexistence with that other power World military that is able to fight against terrorism, which fights terrorism and above all beats terrorism, while Europe is good at making words, defending rights human, but so weak that we can't even rip up the trafficking of poor human people across the Mediterranean, as we have repeatedly come to denounce. But let's come to defense policy. On this policy, let's say that making rhetoric about the fledgling European army is problematic, since it appears a bit of a compromise, a middle ground, a European army that doesn't have enough men and endowments to fight an eventual war, it doesn't even have the necessary structure. And then we wonder what the real aims of this European army are. The first is to complete the disarmament of individual states and to complete the robbery of sovereignty and also an economic robbery, given the high cost: 500 million a year I am certainly not for something that serves no use, I'm not certain few. The second, the second aspect, the second goal even worse. In the original text of the resolution of 22 November on European defence policy, it reads that “the army entrusted to the European Defence Agency should work in concert with NATO on various operations, including those concerning immigration.” It is easy to assume that the European military could, for example, dedicate itself to rescuing migrants arriving by sea on our shores, to help the big traffickers. Given that the EU's policy so far has been to turn us into an open-air refugee camp, we Italians, Greece, and so on, soldiers would be reduced to completing the work.

However, in order to implement a common foreign and defence and security policy, it is essential that it meets the needs of the Member States and does not satisfy the expediency and the anchorages of the European Union's leading circle. The two main threats currently facing the European Union are terrorism and the invasion of illegal immigrants. But both of them have come from erroneous interventions by the European Union in internal conflicts of neighbouring countries, usually supported by the wrong side. This must stop happening in the future. In order to control migratory flows, which many terrorists also carry in the European Union, safe areas must be created in the neighbouring countries of the crisis country, hot spots must be created there and aid for refugees there. The European Union's commercial and agricultural policy towards third countries must not be directed against the interests of the inhabitants of the countries of the European Union by creating unfair competition. The defence of the European Union must continue to be based on NATO, 22 of the 28 countries of which are Member States of the European Union. The European Union must not replace NATO. Moreover, the threats it receives are not so strong as to justify an excessive increase in its military capabilities.

You mentioned that we have a summit at the end of this week where we will also talk about security and defence. I would imagine that the occasion will perhaps be asked what has been implemented since the summits of December 2013 or even June 2015. I think we have some catching up on there. I'll name one keyword: security of supply. This is a decision, and we have not made any progress. I would really like you to take up these decisions and also remind the Member States that they did so. But it also takes progress on your part. You will be asked how to implement the defence package. I would therefore like more courage from the Commission if Member States appear to make the derogation the rule and make unjustified use of Articles 3, 4 and 6. I really want clear guidelines on your part to prevent you from simply stealing out of this defence internal market.

Both actually have a change of government, only in Gabon does the president accept not. Therefore, it should become visible how we act differently there. And in Gambia, the president changed his mind.

History did not end because the present brought back power politics to the international system, forcing the EU to readapt to this old type of politics. Elmar Brok’s report, being very complex and therefore comprehensive, an appropriate legacy I should say, compels us to be selective in the topics we address. Consequently, I intend to address only two issues. The first is the popular support the EU is getting from its citizens. That support is indispensable for the functioning and future of our Union, and the truth is that sometimes our adversaries communicate better with our citizens then we manage to do. But it is due to the easiness with which confusion and manipulation percolate in an environment with many alternative sources of information. Paradoxically, the more sources of information we have, the less informed we are. And that is in part from the support provided to the eurosceptic parties on the extreme right and extreme left of the political spectrum. But it is partly due to our own making, to our strong belief, not always warranted, that the European citizens believe and follow automatically the EU leaders, and to the over-bureaucratisation of the EU’s relations with its citizens. And here I have a parenthesis to point to the new regulation concerning visitors here in this Parliament. The second issue is the expected revision of the current arrangements regulating world trade today. Already TTIP is on ice and the TTP contemplates total scrapping. If that happens it will challenge the EU’s initial raison d’être, questioning its first achievement, namely its common commercial policy. Imagine all those long decades of tough negotiations to provide the current institutional and legal platform for world trade becoming irrelevant or facing the perspective of becoming irrelevant overnight.

Against the backdrop of this Aleppo menetekel, speaking of a superpower Europe seems almost absurd to me. With this sounds like loss of reality.

As long as the Member States, as long as the national capitals do not have the political will to speak with one voice, as long as we can make plans and resonate words as much as we want.

The reality is that a foreign and defence policy would require European sovereignty. This cannot exist, because there is no real sincere convergence of interests. Let's look, for example, at what is called the Franco-German couple. With each partnership, French interests are drowned in Germanic politics, presented as a European policy.

It is called economic war or imposed foreign policy, but it is always the same arrogance, the same contempt for other peoples, the same brutal domination. The reality is that behind the so-called common policy there is also the action of opaque influence groups, relays of powerful oligarchies and criminal groups that make up both, such as the Soros Foundation, which prepared Mrs Merkel's migration policy.

But I must say that, in the difficulty, there is also the difficulty of enduring a lot of things that you have to hear today in this chamber. Freedom of expression sometimes leads to aberrations or even lies, and I salute your courage to hold until the end of this session. I have no doubt about the professionalism and dedication of many people, starting with yourself, who serve, I was going to say under the European flag, be it in the external missions in our delegations and in the external action service in Brussels. These people are professional, they are dedicated to the cause. However, I must say that I continue to doubt a part of this system and foreign policy which, by wanting to do everything everywhere, with all the instruments at our disposal, fails to make the European Union sufficiently audible. Unfortunately, we are still lacking — and this is largely the responsibility of the Member States, of course — of this hierarchy of priorities that would make the European Union truly weigh where it should weigh, and as a matter of priority in our nearby environment. I am very concerned that the European Union is losing its environment, from Ukraine to Syria, Libya and the Horn of Africa. These are places where we have conducted a lot of missions, where we have deployed a lot of staff, where we spent a lot of money, and we lose those places, we are no longer audible, we are no longer determinant, if we have never been. This is a matter to question the sense of priorities we must have and the concentration of the resources we need to invest, perhaps in a number of areas smaller, but where our action will be truly decisive. Our credibility is first played out in our close environment, so I will ask you, for the coming year, to put the package on issues that are really in our environment and which weigh on our stability. I am thinking in particular of the action you are taking, which I hope will be decisive, especially for Tunisia, which is an essential link in the chain of stability — or instability — that prevails around Europe.

The fight against the great common enemy, that is climate impact, can basically be lost with a new president of the United States. It doesn't look bright.

The current uncertain international landscape requires a more active and cohesive foreign policy of the Union, which defends our interests and values, committed to multilateralism and the defence of the universality of human rights. Moreover, we need to act in the face of the gradual deterioration of our security environment. The circle of instability surrounding the Union in the neighbourhood area; the terrorist threat, particularly in Daesh; the revisionist attitudes of some countries, as well as the possible withdrawal of the United States, are elements that compel us to deepen our common foreign policy and in particular its security dimension and, in particular, its security dimension and defense. In this regard, I welcome the priority given to strengthening this policy in Mr Brok's document. There will never be a Union foreign policy without a genuine common security and defence policy. We must be ambitious in its implementation, as are the Council conclusions of last November and the recent Commission proposals. But also pragmatic, particularly in a context of fiscal consolidation, as is known. Finally, I do not want to conclude without remembering the humanitarian tragedy that Aleppo is experiencing.

On diplomacy, we agree that the European Union should continue to focus its policy on conflict resolution and international consensus. As the largest trading power in the world, our word as the European Union has weight. Second: development. I think paragraph 40 of the report makes it particularly clear that we Europeans must tackle the root causes of instability and inevitable migration, such as poverty, economic inequality of opportunity, armed conflict, poor governance and climate change. This can only be achieved if we strengthen democratic institutions and civil society, and thus the resilience of unstable states. Thirdly, Defence. A lot has been said about defence. I believe that the European Union's common security and defence policy needs to be further strengthened. The High Representative, Mrs Mogherini, is on the right track here. Only by strengthening our civilian and military capacities will we be able to respond comprehensively to crises, strengthen the resilience of our partners and protect Europe.

Dear Mrs Mogherini! I think the main question that needs to be answered is whether the countries of the European Union really want a common foreign and defence policy. The problem is that in many cases the answer is still “no.” Member States still want to live in their own world and do not want to lose sovereignty. The bad news for these countries is that the world is changing and Europe's influence in the world is rapidly falling for a variety of reasons, whether in terms of population size, economy size, military. It's neither bad nor good - it's a reality, but Europeans and politicians still see Europe as the centre of the world who can dictate its rules to other countries and regions of the world. That's not the case anymore, and practitioners who encounter foreign affairs every day can only confirm this. It's good if an old man still feels that he is young and strong, but much worse is if he continues to act like a young one. But he also has his own strengths, such as experience and patience. The number of instruments of influence in European foreign policy is very limited. We still have strengths: technology, education, a capacious internal market, influence in international organisations, opportunity to finance projects, etc., but Europe is unfortunately losing its influence with every step.

I take a more nuanced approach and I have always seen a complementary role for cooperation in foreign policy and defence at EU level. It was with this in mind that delivered CFSP’s origins after all, in so-called political cooperation in the 1986 European Single Act, as agreed by the then-UK Prime Minister, one Mrs Thatcher. For instance, EUNAVFOR ATALANTA’s success has proved that there is a defence role for the EU that combines soft and hard power, without undermining NATO, Mr Carver, whilst the sanctions regime employed against Iran has illustrated that a CFSP common position can leverage our individual Member States’ positions. As Britain sadly leaves the European Union, I believe that foreign security policy will be one of the key areas that we must remain plugged into. In possession of one of the world’s most effective armed forces, being one of the P5 on the Security Council and a nuclear power, the UK has a lot to offer the EU, particularly as our shared interests will remain the same post-Brexit. As a member of NATO, the Berlin Plus Agreement will allow Britain to easily contribute to any future CFDP missions and I hope that during the Brexit negotiations, the EU 27 will see sense in finding a more formalised structured CFSP role for Britain, given its close links to the continent and the ongoing common security interests.

It is therefore in the spirit of the European project that the European Union should assume once and for all as a power capable of preventing, dissuading and protecting. In this era of hybrid and cross-border conflicts and threats guaranteeing peace and security in Europe means guaranteeing peace and security outside walls. It is not enough to perform just a mediating function. It is true that it has experienced some successes, such as the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo and Iran's nuclear agreement, but in the face of the tragedy in Syria, in the face of the situation in Libya and the Sahel, we see that this is clearly insufficient and that the development of European defence capabilities, with the corresponding increase in investment.

The report on the implementation of foreign and security policy, also recalling the report on the overall strategy presented in this House in July by the High Representative, aims to relaunch and strengthening in operational terms those principles and values of the European Union, thanks to which we have been able to build a peaceful society. Moreover, Russia's behavior, which repeatedly violated international law deliberately, and the uncertainty arising from the election of the new President of the United States give Europe a central role of management and intervention for respect for international law and humanitarian law. The European Union is the frontrunner of world multilateral diplomacy, but today, with the deepening of the crisis and the obvious difficulty of action by the United Nations, caused by cross-vetoes, we must take awareness of the need to strengthen the European role, laying the foundation for a purposeful impulse, combining soft power with hard power. Stronger and more common military capabilities and consequently a more active and effective role in conflict resolution and peacebuilding are key elements in enabling the European Union to respond fully to today's crises and I am convinced that you, Mrs Mogherini and we with you, today more than yesterday, can achieve a great result for the European Union in this field.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1389, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Jaromír ŠTĚTINA", "mepid": "124702", "text": "   – Madam President, we are debating today Mr Brok’s report on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy.

Unfortunately, we have an example of Russia that violates the sovereignty of neighboring countries and which threatens global and world peace. The report by our colleague, Mr. Elmar Brok, directly identifies three key challenges and perspectives in thinking in common foreign and security policy. We really find ourselves at the crossroads as far as defense policy is concerned. One direction is to maintain strong ties with the United States through NATO and within NATO. Another direction is the development of standalone defense capacities, independent of the United States, especially after Trump's victory in the presidential election. I believe that the third reason is the most important - the future of defence of the European Union is precisely an independent security architecture built on cooperation and coordination of Member States, strengthening interoperability of military capacities, as well as defining key objectives of foreign and defence policy towards unstable European neighbourhood. In the wake of these challenges, it is essential to strengthen the status and position of the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and to work towards harmonisation of Member States' foreign policies. This requires deeper integration, but we must bear in mind that only by strengthening the close cooperation of all foreign policy actors can we achieve that these goals are indeed achieved.

On the other hand, in the face of the rise of populism, let us not tired of telling the truth: no Member State can tackle the challenges we face alone. The coherent and effective implementation of the CFSP is an imperative. In this sense, allow me to highlight three elements. Firstly — and this is one of my deepest beliefs — the Union must continue to invest even more in mediation, preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention. I am convinced that this is an area where the Union has a net added value. As such, the conflict in the Middle East must be the subject of permanent mobilization. This is our neighbourhood, and we know the effects of permanent instability in this region. Secondly, I stress the missions EUCAP Sahel and EUBAM Libya, which must be provided with the necessary human and financial resources to ensure the security of Europeans and the stability of the Union. The Sahel is a key region, where the risk of connecting insecure areas is significant. Finally, the Union must participate in strengthening the capacities of regional and subregional organizations, particularly in Africa, to address security challenges, but also to encourage our partners to tackle the sources of conflict and instability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1394, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Csaba SÓGOR", "mepid": "39724", "text": "Mr President, in the context of the crisis in East Ukraine, full implementation of the Minsk Agreement can bring the political solution, and everyone seems to agree on this.

Some of you expressed it in a different way: there is nothing we can do alone as single Member States, no matter how big or small we are. Some of you questioned if together we are losing influence; maybe compared to a century ago, probably yes. But also some underlined that in the current geopolitical situation we actually have some space that is opening up for the European Union to act as a security provider, as a guarantor for a rules-based global order that we can use if we are up to the task. Which means that, while individually we are losing influence, together as Europeans we can regain that sovereignty that as Member States we are losing.  This is why to me it resonates really strangely to hear, also in this Chamber, some of you referring to the fact that having a common foreign and security policy is a way of losing sovereignty. It is actually the only way to regain sovereignty in the world of today, acting as Europeans, and this was very clear when we had our Treaties adopted. But, if our strength is our unity, we have to be aware of the power we can exercise. Sometimes I wonder who we believe the European Union is. I give you news: the European Union is each and every one of you, and especially you that are sitting in a European institution. You are a European institution yourself. So whenever we say, whenever you say, some of you say in this room, that the European Union is weak, you are saying to yourself that you are weak, and maybe you can do something about that. I see the European Union through the eyes of our partners, and I see that they see the European Union as a superpower today. What I see from the inside of the European Union is that we do not even realise the power we have; and if you do not realise the power you have, then yes, you are powerless, because you do not use it. If you do not believe in yourself who should believe in yourself? Who should believe in you? This is the basic rule that you teach to your teenagers, daughters and sons, when they reach 13, 14 years old, no? I am not yet there but I am practising. If you do not believe in your capabilities and your capacity, in your tools, if you do not believe in yourself, how can you claim others should believe in you? So at the same time you are saying the European Union is weak, and on the other hand you are saying - sometimes the same ones of you - we should act as a superpower. Well, the two do not stand together. Either we believe in what we can do and we do it, and we implement the decisions we take - or I wonder what you are doing in this room. Sometimes I do.  This to say that we have the tools, economic tools, diplomatic tools, that nobody else in the world has. We should also have the security and defence tools that could complement our soft power. There is a unique mix, the European way of doing security, which is a mix of mediation, conflict prevention, work on poverty eradication, on human rights, on governance - which is also part of security nowadays. And also the hard power means that sometimes we need to enforce some decisions or to simply allow humanitarian aid into place.  This unique mix, this European way of doing security, is something that the world is desperately looking for and that we would have, if we managed to develop the political will. I hope in two days from now the Heads of State or Government will put that political will behind the implementation plan on security and defence.  Because this is what we need in this moment, to complete our toolbox, together with the soft power instruments, the EUR 20 billion every year we invest in Africa - EUR 20 billion every year - are we not a superpower? Who else in the world invests EUR 20 billion every year in the African continent? So we need to complement this with some instruments of hard power that together Member States can shape. It is not a matter of a European army. I have repeated it I do not know how many times, I will continue to repeat this: Member States have one set of forces, they can use it for European missions, for NATO missions, for UN peacekeeping missions, for national purposes. But we need to work on the output of our defence investments because it is true that we invest 50% of what the Americans spend on defence, but the output of our investment in defence is 15% of what the Americans get as an output. That gap to me is what we have to work on today. We can also work on all the rest but today it is the economy of scale, it is coordination, it is cooperation that we need, including on the industrial basis of research. Let me say one last word on Syria - two last words, one on Syria. Some of you said that we cannot only be a humanitarian player. Believe me, being the humanitarian player that has more credibility and more determination than all the others on the ground - because we have been the ones trying to allow with our resources, with our work on the ground, with our offices in Gaza and in Damascus, trying to allow humanitarian aid to get into places; sometimes we have managed, sometimes we failed - but being the credible and committed humanitarian player on the ground in Syria gives us the space and the credibility to be also a political player, most of all with the Syrians and with the regional players. This is what we are doing. This is what we are doing every day, and when I say this I mean this is what we are doing every hour, especially in these hours, we are trying to protect the civilians in Aleppo. This means that we are trying to reach out to all those that have an influence on the ground in this moment, to try and protect the civilians. Every single life counts. The problem is - and some of you mentioned that - the world is in such bad shape today that the big question is not: ‘How powerful is the European Union and how come we are not managing to stop the war?’ The point is: ‘Who in the global system of today has the power to enforce humanitarian and international law?’ The point is that the system of international rules is broken and we have to find effective ways of enforcing the international and humanitarian law. This is an effort the European Union has to make and can make. We will never manage alone, even if we are a superpower, we will never manage alone, because yes, we are not managing today in these hours to do as much as we would like to do for the people of Aleppo and elsewhere, but the same goes for our friends in the United States, our friends in the United Nations, our friends in the G5. Are we all powerless? I do not believe so. I do not believe so, but as it is true that we have a lot of power if we realise how to use it, it is also true that we need to work with others to find the solution to the crisis. This is also the European way and we will continue, we will continue to try and save every single life, protect every single person, in Aleppo but not only there. One last thing: some of you mentioned the fact that we need to have priorities. To me the priorities are two and are very clear. One is our region, and our region goes from the east of Europe to the Sahel. Second is investing our potential, our work, on the areas, on the files, where we can make a difference, and not others. Sometimes this is the case for places that are far away and where we have a direct interest in investing in security and stability. But we have to analyse case-by-case where it is us that can make the difference, and where it is us that can contribute but maybe one step back.  And this is an exercise I believe we are making now, with a strong focus on Africa because Africa is our neighbour, is demographically growing as we all know, is a security but also an economic challenge for all of us and also an opportunity, and this is why I believe next year will be really an African year for us, not only because we have the summit with Africa but also because we are looking at ways in which we can invest in security, in economic development, in digital, in energy, in human rights and governance, in all sectors far beyond the migration-only angle. That is important, but it is not the only angle for our relation with Africa. Last but not least, as I have spent too many words on Elmar in the beginning, I was reminded that this is not the time for farewell, so I will not say anything now.

We should indeed approach with more self-confidence. We have all the potential to play a role in our interests. I can only agree that we can regain our sovereignty. Through Europe, because the nation states are too weak for this, we can regain sovereignty for our peoples. I think that is a very crucial motive for doing this. We are not just dealing with NATO, but — as the references to Africa and other issues show — we need to develop our own capabilities, regardless of what happens to collective defence in Europe. We can only take this forward together by developing skills here, for example in Africa policy, which has to do with traditional development policy, but also with good governance, with a different trade policy. Rather, we have to recognise that we need to summarise instruments that we have been handling separately so far and which have therefore not taken effect. I also believe that we must be able to move forward with a coalition of the willing, which is offered by the permanent structured cooperation. Not everyone has to join. Article 42 (7) also states that non-NATO members only need to participate in accordance with their constitutional circumstances and that this is not an overcoming of national constitutional competences. That's why we have a lot of room here. The fact is that the Secretary General of NATO said that Europe needs to develop capabilities so that it is also effective for NATO. Having a European Union with armies where 80% of the cost is overhead cost is money thrown out. We are wasting taxpayers' money on our division and lack of cooperation! That is why we should act together and move forward accordingly. I believe that some good-willers who still have their NATO have concerns that may be able to overcome them. But I have to say one thing: we are not going to be told by those on the far right and on the far left who have their campaigns financed by Putin's supporters or even Putin money. To advocate and promote our policies is not propaganda. Mrs von Storch, you are pursuing a policy that is against the interests of our citizens and is delivering to us those who are not well with Europe.

First, there would be a common permanent headquarters in the European Union to conduct civil-military operations. Secondly, the Union must respond more quickly to threats by using its combat groups for joint missions and operations.

It is following an interim report that was adopted by the European Parliament in 2011 that we are here today, which reserves its consent to improving the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, particularly on the issues of child and forced labour in the context of the annual cotton harvest. Following the adoption of the report, a dialogue was established with Uzbekistan, through which annual hearings were held, including the participation of several actors, including civil society, the Uzbek authorities and European and international institutions. Close cooperation has also been undertaken between Uzbekistan and the International Labour Organization in order to assess actions undertaken to eradicate child and forced labour in the context of harvesting annual cotton. The ILO conducted a cotton harvest monitoring mission for the first time in 2013, which was repeated in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The 2015 final report of the ILO monitoring mission, which took place between 14 September and 31 October 2015, showed that child labour had been virtually eradicated during the harvest of cotton. Public authorities have put in place various measures to eliminate child labour, including the organization of after-school daycare facilities, fines for offenders, empowerment of parents, teachers and farmers. Only a few isolated cases have been identified. The ILO therefore affirmed that child labour was indeed sporadic and socially unacceptable. This position has been reaffirmed by the latest ILO support. His report will be official early next year, but we already have the conclusions of this report, which actually confirm what happened in 2015. Unfortunately, the same statements could not be made on the issue of forced labour. Since the assessment in this regard is more sensitive, ILO has identified several indicators of forced labour, related to abusive working conditions and the recruitment process. The Uzbek authorities have made several commitments to progressively abolish forced labour by adults, including the establishment of a permanent feedback mechanism to respond to public grievances, the organization of awareness-raising campaigns and the establishment of programmes for the evaluation and implementation of international conventions in the field of human rights. material. Parliament therefore fully supports the work carried out by the ILO to permanently abolish forced labour in Uzbekistan. The efforts of the Uzbek authorities should be encouraged. That is why we propose to give consent with, of course, a resolution that says simply to the uzbek government that if the work that has been done so far could not continue, we would take a much harder attitude here in the European Parliament on the whole agreement between the Union and the uzbek authorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1405, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the textile protocol that we are debating today will extend the provisions of the EU-Uzbekistan Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to bilateral trade in cotton and textiles. As you well know, this is an issue that has been on your agenda since 2011.  The aim of the textile protocol is to facilitate EU exports to Uzbekistan in the textile and clothing sector. It will grant a legal basis for the Most Favoured Nation treatment to EU textile and clothing exports to Uzbekistan. Therefore, it is in our interest to conclude such a protocol with Uzbekistan. The Commission is well aware of the concerns that has been raised with regard to the need for Uzbekistan to continue addressing the challenges in the cotton sector. It is true, there have been lots of concerns. But as the rapporteur said, and I would like to thank the rapporteur Ms Arena for her work on this. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Uzbekistan has made significant progress since the last resolution of 2011 in this House; particularly as regards eliminating the use of child labour from cotton harvests. I also want to commend Uzbekistan’s cooperation with the ILO, including on the issue of forced labour. Moreover, I am also happy that the Commission services have been able to facilitate the contacts between Uzbekistan and the ILO. We have been discussing these matters regularly with the Uzbek authorities and have also been closely cooperating with the External Action Service and our EU Delegation in Tashkent throughout the process.  The ILO’s committee on experts report from last year’s harvest was very positive about the achievements in the area of child labour and also welcomed progress in the area of forced labour, while noting that there are some remaining challenges. The ILO’s preliminary assessment of this year’s harvest, which ended just a month ago, continues on the positive note from last year. A substantial information campaign on the fight against child labour and forced adult labour has been conducted. This is work in progress for the coming years, going in the right direction. I can confirm that the Commission will very closely monitor and actively support this important process with the objective of ensuring that the issues related to the recruitment processes in Uzbekistan’s cotton manufacturing are addressed in an effective, lasting and sustainable way.  Furthermore, the Commission has been supporting financially the monitoring mechanism put in place by the ILO through an ongoing contract with the World Bank of EUR 5 million.  Moreover, we are ready to support Uzbekistan’s economic diversification efforts via our development cooperation assistance programme to Uzbekistan, in which rural development is a focal sector. The total amount of that programme is EUR 168 million for the period 2014-2020. Finally, a few words on EU-Uzbekistan’s trade relations: given the very low bilateral trade flows today, there is room to boost trade relations. I am convinced that a good business climate and respect for the rule of law are essential conditions to develop bilateral trade and investment relations. To this end, we are encouraging the Uzbek government to pursue the necessary reforms. The EU fully supports Uzbekistan’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. This would also enhance bilateral trade relations and facilitate EU investment in the country. It would also be in line with the momentum currently existing in the Central Asia region. Let me reiterate: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan have recently joined the WTO, and Turkmenistan has recently announced its interest in WTO membership. So that is all positive news.

It was the first time after the Lisbon Treaty that this Parliament, which now has to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in consent procedures, blocked the textile protocol with Uzbekistan, because of child labour and forced labour to a degree that is simply unacceptable. There was horrendous abuse of children and adults for the main export product: our clothes and other textiles. Since then there have been lots of improvements. The government has started to work with the International Labour Organisation in the Decent Work Country Programme. In October 2016, the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association was ratified. Nevertheless, huge problems still persist. It is right that child labour has decreased and is now not socially acceptable anymore, but we have plenty of reports from independent civil society organisations which say that forced labour is still there in an amount which simply does not make the glass half-full. In that sense, from the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) side, we were also pushing for having put in good cooperation with rapporteur Arena from Committee on International Trade (INTA) to have a resolution, and this resolution has some very important points in it. Nevertheless, in the end I had to withdraw my name from the consent procedure because I simply could not say yes to giving consent. I will also ask tomorrow for a postponement of the vote until the final reports from the International Labour Organisation and the independent civil society organisations are there, because they have been working and the harvest only stopped a couple of weeks ago, so we do not have the final reports yet.

In December 2011, Parliament rejected approval of the extension of the EU-Uzbekistan Agreement to include textile products and made its approval conditional on Uzbekistan's ability to make significant progress in the elimination of forced and child labour within the framework of the annual cotton harvest. This measure was right and important, and it has meant that we now see a different situation than it was five years ago. The 2015 ILO report shows that there is practically no child labour during cotton harvesting. The ILO also confirms that child labour, if any, occurs only sporadically and has become socially unacceptable in Uzbekistan. In recent years, the authorities have committed themselves to taking far-reaching measures, including the gradual abolition of forced labour by adults. This resolution commends the efforts of the Uzbek Government. At the same time, she also points out that the sudden death of Islam Karimov and the election of Shawkat Mirsiyev as the new president must not jeopardise the initiated process of improvement. With our approval, we follow the reasoning of our 2011 report. Uzbekistan has implemented the calls for tangible and profound changes. The European Parliament, with its approval tomorrow, should encourage Uzbekistan to continue along this path.

First of all, I would like to thank my colleague Maria Arena for the very comprehensive and very good report she is discussing with us here today. The topic of cotton production is particularly important to me. I am shadow rapporteur on Parliament's report on the EU flagship initiative for the clothing industry, which the Commission has been working on for some time. Many think of Bangladesh seamstresses and the collapse of Rana Plaza when it comes to supply chain traceability and fair clothing. Ever since I have dealt with supply chains in the textile sector, I have been emphasining a fact that is being forgotten. Textile production begins in the cotton fields. According to the International Labour Organisation, about 60% of child labour is in agriculture — mostly in the cotton fields. That is why I am very pleased that legislation is now in force in Uzbekistan which prohibits child labour and that, as a result of these rules, child labour has been almost completely eliminated. However, I am somewhat concerned that forced labour will continue to be used in the cotton fields in 2016, including public sector employees and students. For example, I support the rapporteur in calling on the Uzbek President to introduce a new human rights paradigm and to end the ongoing forced and child labour during cotton harvesting completely without delay. This should be done in close cooperation with and under the supervision of the International Labour Organisation. I am particularly positive that the Trade Union Confederation of Uzbekistan joined the International Trade Union Confederation as an associate member in October 2015. Only where trade unions function and where there is the freedom to unite into a trade union can a good way to decent working conditions and the Protection of workers' rights. I remain on the subject and will definitely include cotton production in the report on the EU flagship initiative in the clothing industry, and I hope that, in the case of Uzbekistan, as the European Parliament, we will continue to be in close contact with the Commission in order to continue the situation on the ground. improve.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1410, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Hannu TAKKULA", "mepid": "28316", "text": " on behalf of the ALDE Group. — Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament said in the 2011 report that we will reform the textile agreement when we can state that access to the ILO has been secured to observe the working conditions and, above all, the working conditions in the country with regard to child and forced labour. This has happened. The ILO has reported on the issue at regular intervals, and a 2015 report found that child labour had been effectively completely eliminated. I believe it is essential and important that if we have insisted that the International Labour Organisation ILO goes and observes and has done this work freely there and reported to us on it, we also trust this reporting and on the other hand respect the decision we took in this regard in the year in 2011. In other words, it is worth noting with satisfaction the developments in Uzbekistan. Of course, there is still work left in the case of forced labour, and it is also very important for child labour to continue monitoring so that positive development can be secured even in the future and ensure zero tolerance in this area. But it is also good to remember that in the new democracies — not always these old ones — things do not happen in any moment, and in my view, by renewing this agreement, we can give our own approval to the work that has been done in Uzbekistan up to now.

I think most of us agree that, even if the situation is far from perfect, Uzbekistan has made a lot of progress in this area and this is also confirmed by the ILO - not only this preliminary report, but it has been a trend for several years now. There is of course no time to be complacent, we need to continue to monitor this, to work with the ILO, to work with Uzbekistan so that this good development continues. The Commission will monitor this very closely and support the progress, and is happy to engage with the European Parliament, throughout this process.  I also think, and some of you mentioned it, that this renewed cooperation and trade with Uzbekistan will give us a positive impact on other aspects of bilateral cooperation not only in the areas of trade and development cooperation, but also of course when it comes to labour rights and human rights, where a lot needs to be done - but this can open a new platform for dialogue with them.  Also I want to say that the textile protocol, from a trade point of view, is also very much in the interest of the European Union because it provides legal certainty for our exporters in that sector.

We must now ratify the EU trade agreement with Ecuador. As permanent rapporteur for the Trade Committee for Ecuador, I have been able to closely monitor the long process of developing trade relations between the European Commission and the Government of Ecuador. This includes the agreement now before us with Ecuador and the accession of the Andean region to the regional agreement with Colombia and Peru, which has thus been negotiated in special negotiations. I sympathled the withdrawal of Ecuador from the negotiations and welcomed the country's alternative proposal for a cooperation agreement. Ecuador insisted first of all to launch the fight against poverty, for the constitutional anchoring of human, social and environmental standards, and an independent, catching-up and at the same time more sustainable economic policy and development. This is in view of the challenge that Ecuador has the US dollar as its currency to date and thus has only to a limited extent monetary and fiscal governance to changing global economic conditions. Nevertheless, the first conditions have been created to put economic cooperation with other countries on a new basis, including interesting projects with other Latin American countries. In 2010, as the European Parliament, we welcomed by a large majority the fascinating logic of the Yasuni-ITT project. The question already moves: what are we doing here to open up such new economic and, at the same time, growth-critical ideas, real economic support and lasting prospects in all of our interests? Commissioner, I am still firmly convinced that the Commission's reluctance to this new agreement at the time was a mistake. We are in our negotiation schemes, our instruments and mechanisms still too deadlocked despite trade for all. I would be delighted if you could assure me today to consider the alternative and more development-oriented approach of Ecuador. This is because the agreement with the states of the region needs to be revised and improved in the coming years — especially when it comes to social changes, such as the peace process in Colombia, which continues to be a sensitive and graceful structure of the region. trade and economic relations on the part of the EU, but also with neighbouring countries. Many smallholder farmers in Colombia have already lost their livelihoods as a result of the double competition from the agreements with the US and the EU. This, however, should now be avoided by a forward-looking, partnership-based fair trade policy for Ecuador. Similar could be said for mining activities, as they endanger the habitat and traditional lives of indigenous people, as well as the environment, all of which are protected by Ecuador's modern constitution. No selfish pressure should be created by EU companies. As the European Parliament, in our accompanying resolution, we made a statement by the Government of Ecuador on maintaining and strengthening social and environmental progress under the Correa Government on the condition of our agreement and on further progress in strengthening democratic standards and their practical implementation. pooked. Ecuador submitted a comprehensive document in the summer of 2016 which I can only recommend reading to all my colleagues. The forthcoming elections will decide on a possible continuation of modern and progressive policies. Allow me to say this context: if the agreement were not reached on 1 January, those political forces would be called Failures that want to turn the social and environmental wheel backwards. Let us talk today about the conditions, the additions to this agreement.

This agreement builds on our strong political, historical, cultural and trade links with Ecuador, and it boosts the possibility for deepening them further. We need to recognise the courage and the strong will of Ecuador. It is a major step for that country – the most ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement, and the first free trade agreement that Ecuador negotiates with a developed partner.  The agreement reflects Ecuador’s clear determination to pursue the road of modernisation and reform of its economy, to diversify and to integrate into the global economy and international value chains. And to reach this, Ecuador has taken determined action and addressed trade irritants and prepared for accession. Some of these decisions have not been easy, and we need to give credit to Ecuador for taking them. Ecuador is now joining its neighbours, Colombia and Peru, and enjoying a privileged trade relationship with us – with the same rights and the same obligations.  Throughout this agreement, the EU is also supporting regional integration in Latin America. We have shown continued commitment towards a stronger partnership with Latin America, through the conclusion of ambitious trade and development agreements with all countries in the region. I am pleased to see that there has been strong support, both in the Council and Parliament, for the rapid accession of Ecuador. Both institutions have shown the political will to get the job done in time. And with this vote today, the institutions will have made provisional application before the end of the year possible. As the rapporteur said, it is very important to keep that deadline so that we avoid a gap between the end of the current trade preferences and the provisional application, which would have meant major trade disruption with Ecuador. By boosting export opportunities for Ecuador, we also respond to the country’s need to relaunch its economy after the terrible earthquake it suffered in April. With the constructive work done with Ecuador and the confidence built between both sides – and notably over the past six months – I trust we will continue to work with Ecuador to ensure that the agreement is implemented and will bring new opportunities for more trade flows in both directions. I also wish to inform you – because I know this is of importance to many of the Members of this House – that the work on the Regulation covering bilateral safeguard and the stabilisation mechanisms for bananas is a separate track: we are not only making progress, but it has been resolved in a trialogue, and I would like to thank the Members of Parliament and the Slovak Presidency for making that possible.

Indeed, the European Parliament has been closely monitoring the process of Ecuador's accession to the agreement with Colombia and Peru. As you recall, we adopted a resolution on this subject here in November 2015, there was an ad hoc delegation to Ecuador in March 2016, and we also had an intensive exchange of views with Ecuador's Minister of Trade, so that this is an example of how the European Parliament will support participation opportunities. to ensure that what we agreed together — a value-based trade policy — is implemented. It is clear, of course, that, as in the case of Colombia and Peru, Parliament's activities have put some aspects of democratic, environmental and labour law improvements on the track. At the time, we called for an appropriate declaration, a roadmap, from Colombia and Peru, and similarly now also received a plan from Ecuador to improve the situation in the labour and environmental fields. We will, of course, continue to support this accordingly. By the way, there are many positive elements. For example, Ecuador also has a momentum in fair trade, which we also want to promote very strongly, a separate action plan to support smallholder farmers in the area of fair trade, be it flowers or fruit. In this respect, a number of positive developments have emergered. The third point: I think the work is only just beginning. Even if we decide tomorrow that accession can take place, then we must of course monitor the implementation. I firmly believe that negotiation is one side of the coin, but perhaps the most important side is the implementation of agreements.

Without them, the future of a fundamental industry for several European outermost regions, such as the Canary Islands, is committed. The proposed measures, such as early warning, automatic activation of the stabilisation mechanism, a report on its operation in 2019 — open to possible compensation — the possibility of extending this mechanism beyond 2020, and a permanent assessment of the banana market and the state of the sector to identify problems and to act accordingly, are sufficient to scare away the only uncertainty associated with this Agreement. That is why I welcome the agreement reached today, which we will discuss and vote later. Otherwise, I think this addition is good news. To begin with, it consolidates stability, improves the situation of fundamental rights and provides social and environmental guarantees to the development it will promote throughout the area. Secondly, it benefits many citizens of these countries who live there and those who have become new Europeans. In the Basque Country, for example, the Ecuadorian colony is the largest of those that group the nationals of other states who have decided to build society and country there, with us. Finally, the Agreement will unite the European Union to this positive effect and must work together in the consolidation of our presence and influence in a region of America that has been looking forward to the Asia-Pacific area for years. Finally, I stress that activating this Agreement is urgent so that Ecuador can better cope with the pernicious effects of three circumstances: the decline in oil prices, appreciation of the dollar and the depreciation of neighboring currencies, with the effects that this has had on the Ecuadorian economy, whose exports have fallen by 30 per cent; the earthquake in April, which produced nearly 30 000 victims and damages whose reparation will require investing an amount equivalent to 3 per cent of Ecuadorian GDP; the progression of the income of the country, which has passed this strip.

Added to this crisis was the April 16 earthquake that caused three billion dollars in damage. The agreement with Ecuador provides for a gradual and asymmetrical lowering of customs duties and, in my view, is a good measure to help this country at a difficult time and strengthen its economic structure. But my only concerns remain two: I am pleased, on the one hand, the agreement reached today on the issue of competition between Ecuadorian banana producers and European banana producers, in particular Canary Islands, which were in danger of being crushed by Ecuadorian production which we remember, in some cases, does not meet European quality standards. It will now be necessary to consider whether the agreement reached today protects European farmers enough. Secondly, my concern is about respect for ILO conventions and freedom of association in Ecuador, because although the Charter Treaty claims to promote these rights, in fact a ITUC report denounces many obstacles related to freedom of association and organization, in particular barriers to the founding of trade unions, the system of the single union in certain areas and the limits of collective agreements.

These core requirements are about the inclusion of binding sustainability chapters, which are very important to us. It is about human rights, it is about ILO labour standards, it is about multilateral environmental agreements. We really have to insist that they will be respected. Unfortunately, we now hear from the NGOs and also from human rights activists that not everything is working out as well in Ecuador as we imagine. Human rights abuses occur again and again. It also happens that there are problems with the right to freedom of assembly and that trade unions cannot establish themselves either. So here we see a big problem. However, it is also unfortunate that the implementation of this sustainability chapter in Peru and Colombia is not yet working like this. Here too, we need to do more. I am of the opinion that we do not just need negotiations to be concluded, and then what is written on paper will fit.

As has already been said, our Parliament and its Trade Committee have a responsibility to continuously evaluate the economic and socio-environmental impact of the agreement over the next few years. If deemed necessary, we will also call for appropriate changes to the agreement. With regard to trade cooperation with Ecuador, as with all other agreements, the European Parliament will not lay its responsibility with ratification, but will actively monitor its implementation in its daily lives. In the Trade Committee, we have also created the appropriate structures there together with the monitoring groups. One more thought from the debate now: I believe that when we are discussing jobs in EU banana-producing regions and areas, safeguard agreements — good that we have managed the trilogue — but that also means that we are also talking about it have to think about what this means for jobs, for production in the third countries concerned. So how do we jointly create agreements that enable fair trade, social, environmental and human rights standards and thus make a joint contribution to development? Not only do we have to turn our doors, we also need to look there, and it is a shared responsibility to shape this task responsibly in the future.

This is my first report as a European parliamentarian and it is an honour for me to have been rapporteur on this text long awaited by European farmers. In the face of the violence of the crisis and the desperation of the agricultural world, it was indeed urgent to address the issue of volatility. The elected representatives of the European peoples cannot remain silent when agriculture dies. The ambition of my mandate as a Member of the European Parliament was to bring solutions first to European farmers. As we know, among farmers Europe is seen more as a source of problems than as a solution. It is very logical that we, as Members of Parliament, have the responsibility to provide answers. Tomorrow, this Parliament will be an opportunity to show European farmers that Europe is useful to them and that MEPs are aware of their situation. No, we're not above ground. No, we are not disconnected from realities. No, we do not passively accept the decline in European agriculture. On the contrary, we have an ongoing relationship with the agricultural world, to which I belong, like other Members here. We are aware of the disaster that threatens us. Yes, we are aware of farmers' suicides on a daily basis. Yes, we know the despair of farmers. Yes, we are outraged that people working to feed their fellow citizens die in general indifference. I did not come to Parliament to cross my arms and to witness, powerless, the death of our agriculture. That is not my view of politics. I'm here to fight, fight for agriculture, because, yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is a real fight to fight. It is in this spirit that I propose to you the vote on my report on the tools of the CAP to combat price volatility. My aim is simple: to get the Commission to make proposals to combat price volatility. The main areas of my report are the following: strengthening contractualisation between the various actors in the food chain, the orientation of the CAP towards risk management tools, the creation of price observatories and strengthening existing ones to make markets more transparent and, finally, the improvement of the tools of the food chain. crisis management to respond more quickly and effectively to emergencies experienced by farmers. These guidelines have been widely supported by my fellow Members of the Committee on Agriculture. Once again, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the spirit of conciliation and respect in which we have reached these compromises. At this moment, the adoption of this report coincides with an alignment of planets. Indeed, the report of the Task Force submitted to the European Commission on agricultural markets, published on 14 November, comes to the same conclusions as ours. The report on price volatility adopted by the Committee of the Regions last week makes the same proposals. This is an opportunity to bring the voice of Parliament loud and loud. It is, once again, a great honour for me, a farmer, to have been rapporteur on such an important subject at a moment like this. On reading the two reports, I would like to propose the following two plenary amendments, for which I count on your support. The first on setting up a legislative framework to combat unfair trading practices, the second on the prevalence of the CAP over competition law European Union, both of which are sources of price volatility. So they have a full place in this report. Finally, last week, President Juncker and you, Commissioner, announced the adoption, before the end of 2017, of a communication on the future of the common agricultural policy. We can only look forward to seeing the Commission finally get to work on this issue. I wish, perhaps ambitious, but not unrealistic, that this report can serve as a basis for reflection on the Commission's forthcoming proposals with a view to the next policy for 2020. I am happy and proud to be part of this leading European project. I therefore count on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support my report tomorrow so that it will weigh on the Commission's future proposals.

I would like to congratulate you, Ms Delahaye, on achieving your first parliamentary report.  This report comes at a very good time, when the Commission is preparing a communication for adoption next year on the modernisation and simplification of the CAP, as announced by President Juncker at the Agricultural Outlook conference last week. I have identified three principles which I believe should guide the new CAP: market resilience, more sustainable agricultural production and progress on generational renewal. The issues that are raised in this report go to the heart of the debate about the future of the CAP by asking how best to deal with risks and crises in agriculture and reflecting on the whole range of public policy instruments that are currently available. I want to assure Ms Delahaye that we will fight together for farmers’ livelihoods and that we are on the same political page in this regard.  I fully agree with the central thesis of this report that we need to maintain sustainable agricultural production in Europe, and for this we need to seek efficient ways to ensure farmers can cope with risks and crises. We all know that risks and crises are inherent in agricultural production, and farmers have consistently demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity. Despite this resilience in the market orientation of the CAP, there continues to be clear justification for a formal public intervention, either at the level of the Member States or of the European Union, in order to support our farmers. Several interventions by farmers and stakeholders at last week’s European Union Agricultural Outlook conference demonstrated the importance of this message.  The report quite rightly acknowledges that the CAP has evolved over time and in line with the needs of European farmers and society, and in response to the challenges of the day. However, during the past two years we have experienced particular difficulties in the dairy, pig—meat and fruit and vegetable sectors in particular. Thankfully, we are now seeing a recovery in those markets, not least as a consequence of the robust actions that have been taken by the European Commission. In response to the crisis in various sectors, we have deployed virtually the full toolkit that is available under the Common Market Organisation and mobilised in excess of EUR 1.5 billion extra resources. If we take the example of the mill sector, as many as 24 regulations have been adopted between September 2014 and September 2016. These measures adopted included the opening, extension and enhancement of private storage aid schemes, the extension of public intervention periods and fixed price ceilings, the granting of targeted aid for our livestock farmers, the authorisation of collective agreements on the planning of milk production, and even the introduction of a milk production reduction scheme. We will also remember that we managed to find synergies between the migration and agricultural policies to make sure that milk is distributed to school children in Syria.  There are also other instruments available to help market actors to become more resilient and sustainable by their own means. I am referring here to the significant progress in market transparency that has been made over the past two years, with dashboards being developed for the main agricultural products, and observatories being established for milk, pigmeat, beef and veal to give market signals to our farmers and our agribusinesses. Building on the work of the Milk Market Observatory, these have been a good success in terms of providing accurate and timely information to all of our operators so that they can make market-led and good decisions. The experience has also raised some questions, of course, about the effectiveness of the toolkit available. Our responsibility as policymakers is to create an adequate framework to help the farming sector to successfully deal with risks and crises by enhancing its resilience.  In my view, there are a number of questions we need to ask ourselves: do the existing tools allow us to act where needed, and to do so quickly enough? Should farmers have greater built-in measures to help them in times of crisis on the basis of a risk management approach? And do producers and processors have the ability to diversify their markets, or to find new markets in times of market loss? These are questions, perhaps, that indicate to us the existing tools are not perfect. So we have to continually look at the variety of instruments at our disposal in order to try and improve them. One of those ways is through the provision of a basic income support in order to help farmers within an effective safety net. This will continue as an essential element of any new CAP through a system of direct payments, something which Ms Delahaye’s report calls for. You will by now be familiar with report of the Agri-Market Taskforce whose recommendations have been well received. Several of these recommendations, for instance those on market transparency, the improved functioning of producer organisations, as well as risk management, go hand in hand with the concerns that have been expressed in this report. I welcome and look forward to the hearing which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will hold next month on the Agri-Market Taskforce report. The recommendations contained in Ms Delahaye’s report will form part of the debate on the future of the CAP, particularly in relation to the adequacy of the existing risk and crisis management tools. In addressing the adequacy and use of these tools, we should consider any obstacles which prevent or discourage their use.  This report, then, is a valuable contribution to the debate and I acknowledge the emphasis which the report places on the importance of a common policy. In this context of preparing a new CAP which aims to modernise and simplify the policy, I can assure the House that my services will examine this report very carefully and ensure that appropriate account is taken of it and its recommendations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1450, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Nedzhmi ALI", "mepid": "34250", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Madam President, Commissioner Hogan, dear colleagues, the volatile prices in the agricultural market can have a strong negative impact on the food security of consumers, incomes of farmers and the well-being of entire countries.

In order to overcome the negative consequences of the price volatility in this important sector of the economy, some measures could be introduced as follows: firstly, rural development programmes should be used more broadly to contribute towards insurance, mutual funds and income stabilisation schemes for farmers. Secondly, improving synergies between the CAP and other EU policies, in particular regarding energy, water supply, land use, biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as development of remote and mountainous areas. Thirdly, the creation of a system to protect the farmers’ incomes through the use of risk management tools.

Indeed, price volatility is one of the very central problems that farmers face, and the more we remove market instruments from the CAP, such as quotas, the greater the logical risk of volatility. We have seen this very clearly in recent months and years. Looking ahead, it is relatively easy to predict that volatility will not decrease in the markets, but will increase. That is why I agree with you, Commissioner, that we need instruments to combat this volatility. One instrument — you mentioned it too — could be insurance and mutual funds. Indeed, we already have instruments in the second pillar of the common agricultural policy in the common agricultural policy today. I come from a country and a region where there is probably the highest density of insurance contracts in the European Union. If I look at the complexity, the difficulty of the rules we have created, the bureaucracy that we have created, it sometimes gets bad for me. We spend hundreds of millions a year to support insurance contracts, and at the same time very often harvest non-acceptance by farmers.

Volatility in prices for agricultural products is one of the main causes of the dramatic situation in which European agriculture is facing, and the forecasts are not reassuring. Globalisation, instability and sophistication of agricultural markets, increasing variability in supply due to climate instability, increased health risks and the fragile balance of Food supply chain will continue to adversely affect farmers' exposure to price volatility. It is necessary to adopt a more impactful policy, with targeted instruments to ensure sustainable agricultural production, accompanied by fair and remunerative prices able to mitigate the negative effects on farmers exposure to price volatility. It is useful to highlight that while the European Union reduces strategic support for agriculture, its competitors on the world market, the United States, Brazil, China, introduce public financial support significant and growing to develop new risk policy models and to provide tools that can protect their farmers from the negative effects of price volatility. If we want to protect our agriculture we need to change the traditional approach. The negotiating power of producers must be strengthened in the food supply chain by means of standard, transparent, balanced and collectively negotiated written contracts in order to counter trade practices unfair, promote competitiveness and ensure the stability of incomes. In order to protect agricultural enterprises in a market-oriented CAP, it is necessary to further develop the instruments for managing climate, health and economic risk, instruments Income stabilization, individual provision mechanisms, mutual funds and income stabilization instruments. More needs to be done in terms of raising awareness and training as regards existing risk management tools. I call on the Commission to adopt, in close cooperation with national authorities and farmers' associations, a plan to raise awareness of available risk management instruments within the framework of the second pillar of the CAP. Countercyclical aid is a real novelty of the motion for a resolution we are debating, they intervene in support of farmers' income when unfavourable vintages compress their income and are a key and innovative instrument for European policy which, I hope, the European Commission will be able to assess adequately, providing greater flexibility in annual budgets or financial mechanisms in able to allow the European farmer to receive the difference between an objective price and the price actually received from the market.

I have been in this Parliament since 2009. Not so long, compared to some of you, but it seems longer sometimes and I cannot remember any point during this time when we have not been talking about at least one sector of agriculture being in crisis. Price volatility has a big impact on agriculture, and it can lend itself to exacerbating these crises. As an industry, it is very difficult to take collective action to hedge or insure against the effects of volatility. The agricultural industry is made up of a myriad of players. Unlike many other strategic industries, it does not have the structure to act together.  Traditionally, the CAP has attempted to deal with this problem by market intervention measures and, as CAP has been reformed, more emphasis and more budget has been given to direct payments to support farmers’ decoupled incomes, in some way trying to use that as a mechanism for riding volatility. But has this worked? I suggest not, as we have these continuing crises. This report lays out a number of tools that can be used, but frankly, I do not see that any of them are new. Price intervention – not new; crisis reserve – not new; risk management tools and mutual funds in pillar 2 – that is not new, and the encouragement of producer organisations is not new either. That is not because we are all very dull people who cannot think of new things; it is because we really have tried most of the options available to us. These already exist. The report calls on further development of these tools and this is welcome, but what else can we do? There is no level playing field as Member States have huge flexibility in how they apply pillar 2 support, but I do not think we should take that flexibility away. They also have huge differences in how much pillar 2 support they actually get. In order to redress these imbalances, the answer is not necessarily more money as suggested in a number of places in this report, but perhaps a complete review and reallocation of the CAP funding based on today’s data and designed to tackle today’s problems, including price volatility. If we continue to work on a historic basis, we will be doing European agriculture a disservice, giving no incentive to move forward. My group believes that the best way to help farmers ride the rollercoaster of price volatility is to increase their efficiency and encourage their profitability.

Today, when we have all the knowledge, when we have all the possible mechanisms at our disposal, we are still talking about the same topic that we all learned together 30 years ago, at least those who are engaged in economics or agriculture. So what I want to tell you, Mr. Commissioner, is the fact that we have to do more for our agriculture, do much, much more. And let's not forget that countries such as the United States of America, such as China or Brazil, have decided to seriously invest in agriculture. With the choice of Mr. Trump seeking to commit primarily to his state, at least so he says, one can expect U.S. policy to be even more focused toward supporting industry and agriculture in America. Therefore, we will have and how to discuss in the coming years, if we do not support our agriculture.

Mr. Commissioner, or the European Commission. There are a lot of mechanisms and a lot of tools at our disposal.

Using financial instruments in CAP for managing price risks, rather than reducing and addressing the causes of price volatility, ignores the reality. The financialisation of our food supply, where you have highly organised financial institutions with access to information exerting control over fragmented producers, the level of support they get and therefore food supply, is another step along the road of locking farmers into a treadmill of debt and below—cost production. It is the normalisation of a form of slavery for the farmers.  Farmers themselves have to realise that the best long-term solution to price volatility would be product diversification, and for them to focus on what the market required and not to buy into the spin of the vested interests and to engage in a race to the bottom for the benefits of multinationals. Trade agreements such as CETA, TTIP and Mercosur further increase problems by exposing farmers on both sides of the Atlantic to increased pressures that they simply cannot bear. When we hear of the positives, we hear about positives for the agri-food industry. This does not necessarily mean positives for the farmer. Whether these trade agreements will bring difficulties in a financial sense or in a mental health sense because of extra competition, it is not going to be worth it. On basic income we need that, not just in farming but in a lot of different sectors. Mechanisation will make sure of that.

Under these conditions, we must strive for the smallest farms, especially families, to remain, because they ensure the creation of jobs in remote regions and support rural viability. As you know, direct payments are a predicted and fixed share of farm income, which is especially important in times of crisis. Direct payments allow the farmer to plan this part of the income, the farmer knows exactly when and how much, what payments will receive, but the current unevenness in direct payments distorts the market. I regret that the report did not take into account the fundamental remark of the Committee on Budgets that, in order to ensure a level playing field in the Single Market and the sustainable use of agricultural resources at European Union level, it is necessary to harmonise direct payments between Member States. Production costs are similar across Europe. Is it not time to show that the European Union is solidarity and equally appreciates the work of every farmer, no matter where he works?

The sugar beet price is going up; all the surplus beet that farmers produce in the UK this season will be paid for at the full price. Next year there is going to be a higher price. For milk, the price is going up. It does work that way around. In October farmers sowed a wheat crop. In that month they had the opportunity to sell that crop for GBP 130 a tonne for the following November, 13 months later. They had that opportunity because of a futures market.  They could also, by using a futures market, have bought an option to have sold their crop for GBP 130 per tonne; that would cost them GBP 7 per tonne. In other words, they were guaranteed a rock bottom price of GBP 123 per tonne. If the price was higher than that they could take it. But futures depend on speculation: one-third speculators, one-third producers, and one-third users of the commodity; it has to be in that ratio. But the EU, through its MiFID legislation, is trying to get rid of the speculators. It is trying to de-speculate. If you de-speculate the futures market then you do not have a futures market and so the farmers cannot benefit.  Things sort themselves out. The potato futures market collapsed 20 or 30 years ago because it was over-speculated; this can happen. Of course we have another tool and the Commissioner did mention it: the annual farm payment, whatever you like to call it. In poor years, well, this is your prop – what you lean on. In good years, it is a chance to re-invest in your business. So the combination of futures markets and the single farm payment should keep most farmers going along pretty nicely.

Agricultural producers are hard to manage these effects, and national public authorities unfortunately do not use effective tools to regulate imbalances on markets. I therefore consider that it is necessary to strengthen the process of setting up and development of producer organisations and associations in the agricultural sectors, in order to create their own production, processing, storage and sales capacities. The negotiating power must also be increased when establishing medium-term and long-term contracts, as well as facilitating the supply of supermarkets in what we call the short supply chain. At European Union level, it is important to set up a forecasting unit, which forecasts sector production and market absorption capacities, so that farmers can effectively link their demand with supply.

If price volatility is a phenomenon that has always characterised agricultural markets, the current size, and even more those that can be achieved in perspective, require effort common in order to ensure agricultural production that can respond to the global challenge of food security while ensuring stable and adequate incomes for our farmers. The measures envisaged in the last reform of the common agricultural policy to counter market variability have proved insufficient, as demonstrated by the crisis affecting the sector dairy. Among other things, the introduction of a complex bureaucratic fulfillment facility has effectively mortified the potential these instruments might have in protecting European agricultural enterprises from risks of market. The fact that the Income Stabilization Tool, considered one of the most innovative instruments introduced since the last reform, has only been applied in three countries of the Union confirms the need to take action at most soon, in order to make the current measures simpler, more effective, more efficient, as well as more usable by all Member States.

Volatility affects both the upstream and downstream of agriculture, and ultimately the farmer, because he is isolated, is the victim of it. We must therefore resolutely not only find tools, but also to support farmers in a better organisation, give them contracts which, over the course of time, will guarantee them an opportunity, an income, and which will allow industrialists to have a guarantee of supply, because we always talk about crises when they are in the world. the farmer's detriment, but in the recent past we have experienced crises that were at the detrients of the downstream, and downstream will be happy to have contracts that ensure it over the long term.

Unfortunately, during these periods of falling prices, farmers represent the main shock absorber for the entire industry and see their margins shrink rapidly.

The last two years have tested the adequacy or otherwise of the measures, and we need – as several speakers have said here this evening – to work together to ensure that farmers are provided with the appropriate tools to deal with price volatility, and we need to learn and look at the market experience of the past two years in relation to what tools we require.

Simplification is something that I very much support, and I will do everything possible to reduce red tape in the agricultural sector, as I am already doing.  Of course it may also be – as Ms Girling said – that we have used all the tools that are available. If that is the case, we need collectively to be more imaginative and see if there are other proposals that we can make in this regard. Next year’s communication provides an opportunity for this House and for the Council, and I am committed to working constructively with all stakeholders to help our farmers in this regard.  A number of speakers have referred to the need to ensure sustainable production, and I want to agree with Mr Ropė when he identifies small farmers as being central to the future of sustainable agricultural production and sustainable rural communities in Europe. We need to ensure that farmers, who are our boots on the ground in the context of implementing environment and climate action, continue to be the custodians of our policy in our rural areas, and also the custodians of our rural environment.  Mr De Castro also referred to the need to remove obstacles to such tools as the Income Stabilisation Mechanism, and you and all Members of the House will get an opportunity to assist me in a proposal in this regard in the Omnibus Regulation which is coming before the House in 2017. So I urge you to adopt this regulation, as Mr Dantin noted, to help farmers to get easier access to the income stabilisation tool and to get easier access to credit through the reforms that I am making and the changes in the financial instruments.  Despite any differences which may exist in this House and between our respective institutions, there is clear agreement across the board on the need to strengthen the position of farmers in the food chain and to tackle the issue of unfair trading practices. I agree with what Mr Tarabella said in this regard. I would also remind the House that the Council adopted Council conclusions yesterday, which, along with the overwhelming vote of this Parliament, are making a very important statement and contribution towards the need for the Commission to come forward with proposals in the work programme of 2017 to try to deal with this issue of the position of the farmer in the food chain.  I should also say that, despite the support that farmers get from the European Union and our national governments to co-finance programmes, most farmers would like to get their income from the market. That means having access to the market, and getting a fair return from the market. So we need fair trade, not always free trade, and farmers are benefitting from well negotiated free trade agreements and access to third—country markets. We are making good progress in this regard, and I am confident that this trend will continue. We cannot continue to have farmers’ production in storage at the expense of the European Union taxpayer all the time. We have to find outlets for that, internally and externally.  In terms of achieving a fair return, I welcome the report of the Agricultural Markets Task Force. The Commission is currently considering those recommendations very carefully, and this will inform the proposal I will make in 2017. I would like to remind Mr Serrão Santos, that farmers in the Azores under the POSEI scheme are getting at up to EUR 250 extra per cow in the dairy sector if they wish to utilise that, in addition to voluntary coupled support from the Portuguese Government. These are instruments that are already available and which are being utilised by your regional government and your national government in Portugal in order to assist your dairy farmers.  Finally, I would like once again to express my appreciation to Ms Delahaye and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done in producing this report. This will serve as very important information and recommendations to me in the context of the work programme for 2017 and the legislative proposals and measures that we will bring forward in the context of the position of the farmer in the food chain.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1477, "date": "2016-12-13.json", "name": "Angélique DELAHAYE", "mepid": "124732", "text": " rapporteur. — (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for those who are still in the Chamber, I would like to tell Mr Flanagan that I share his view on the consequences of globalisation, just as I share Mr Agnew's view on the role and place of farmers as entrepreneurs and not in as employees of a central government.

This is largely due to the peculiarities of this sector, which like no other is dependent on natural factors, and these are difficult to predict. Adding to this are the issues of changes in international turnover and demand in the local market. This all affects a lot of price volatility, which has negative consequences for both food producers and consumers. Therefore, we need effective measures that will lead to a maximum reduction in price fluctuations. I share the rapporteur's view that the risk management support currently offered by the CAP under the second pillar is insufficient. Risk management instruments must be revised and, where appropriate, expanded. It is also necessary to strive for as much market transparency as possible.

I welcome this landmark parliamentary resolution, which makes securing farm income the highest priority. Farmers must finally be able to calculate again and earn an income from the price of the product. At the moment, we see a pure profit maximization of the retail groups and their lobby. One example is the steadily rising milk price in Europe, which is not passed on to farmers, or only months, is passed on to farmers. The total sell-off and undercutting competition at the expense of farmers must finally come to an end. Concrete measures to strengthen agricultural organisations, the establishment of European agricultural price observatories and the creation of a new legislative framework that will put the safeguards of the common agricultural policy on competition law can restore the position of farmers in the food chain be strengthened. I therefore call on the European Commission to deliver the proposals quickly and unbureaucratically to put an end to price dumping.

However, the possibilities of using the CAP rural development programmes to strengthen the systems of insurance, mutual funds and farm income stabilisation have not produced the desired results. Moreover, the liberalisation of markets by abolishing customs duties from third countries creates problems both for agricultural production and for European farmers. At the same time, the EU's refusal to lift sanctions against Russia has affected farmers in the European South and beyond. Particularly for Greece, the problems in the rural world are inflated because of the tax policy imposed by the troika. The increase in the tax on agricultural oil, the annihilation of subsidies and the confiscation of the few subsidies from the government have led to an impasse on my country's farmers.

In recent years, due to the rapidly occurring major changes in demand, presentation and prices, this has become a structural feature of agriculture at European, but also at global level. There are many reasons for this. Climate change and pests in agriculture have a negative impact on agricultural production, which directly affects prices. Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union in contributing to the provision of food safety in Europe must be increased. European farmers, especially from newly acceded countries, as well as from Lithuania, are increasingly exposed to risks independent of them. The EU should therefore increase its aid to farmers in these countries. The EU should guarantee stability in the agricultural sector, as price volatility causes a high level of uncertainty among producers and consumers. At low prices, manufacturers see risks to their profits and investment capacities, while high food prices cause difficulties in acquiring basic foods, which leads to a crisis situation. It is necessary to provide Member States with additional tools and guarantee aid in terms of crop, animal and plant bans, investment funds and a new income stabilisation mechanism.
