I have received the following nominations: Hon. Monika Beňová Hon. Gilles Boyer Hon. David Casa On. Karol Karski and Hon. Anne Sander. The candidates have confirmed to me that they accept their respective nominations.  Since the number of candidates does not exceed the number of seats to be filled, I propose that they be elected by acclamation pursuant to Rule 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure.  Are there any requests for secret ballots? There are none. The candidates in question are therefore elected to the office of Judges of the European Parliament. Of course, I congratulate my colleagues on their election.  However, a vote is required, as you know, to establish the order of precedence, i.e. the order in which the votes are allocated to the five Members. (Parliament carried out a test to verify the proper functioning of the voting arrangements) The test worked. We shall now proceed to the vote on the Members of Parliament in order to establish the order of precedence. Again, there are 5 seats to be filled, so you have to vote at least 3 candidates, otherwise the vote will be considered null and void.  The vote is open. Did they all vote? The vote is closed.  I communicate the results: number of voters: 574 white or null votes: 71 votes cast: 503 Candidates obtained the following results: – Mr Sleyn. Sander: 407 votes (Applause) – Hon. Beňová: 391 votes (Applause) – Hon. Casa: 391 votes (Applause) – Hon. Boyer: 317 votes (Applause) – Hon. Karski 261 votes (Applause) Greetings and congratulations to elected representatives. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of Procedure, the order of precedence is the order of precedence which established the vote just now.  The composition of the new Bureau will be notified to the Presidents of the institutions of the European Union.  In accordance with Rule 18 of the Rules of Procedure, the order of precedence shall be determined by the order in which they were elected and, in the case of equal votes from age.

I offer you my best wishes and I hope for good cooperation between our institutions. To some, it is Parliament that represents genuine European democracy because of its directly elected Members, while to others it is rather the European Council because of the strong democratic legitimacy of the leaders. In fact, such disputes make little sense, as both institutions are democratic. In the end, we must respect each other and cooperate with each other, because only then can we build trust and change Europe for the better. That is why, honourable Members, before the European Council proposed the new leadership of the Union, I met with your representatives many times. I did so not only out of respect for you but also, above all, to make sure that the decisions are truly common. We managed to make these decisions on time, and actually much more quickly than five years ago. I believe they are good choices. For the first time in our history, the European Council proposed two women and two men to lead the key EU institutions. I feel happy and proud that we have achieved perfect gender balance in the top positions. This is a very positive change. Europe is not only talking about women, it is choosing women. I hope that this choice will inspire many girls and women to fight for their beliefs and passions. I also hope that it will inspire the European Parliament in its decisions. During the process of nominations, I was in close contact with the leadership of the Greens, especially with Ska Keller and Philippe Lamberts. I am fully confident that cooperation with the Greens and their presence in the EU decision-making bodies will benefit not only the governing coalition, but also Europe as a whole. Therefore, I will appeal to all my partners to involve the Greens in the nominations, even though there is still no European Council leader from this party. I hope that the newly nominated Ursula von der Leyen will also listen to my appeal and, in fact, I will pass this message to her directly later today. As you know, in many countries green symbolises hope and freedom. I have much faith in this symbol. Speaking about different sensitivities in Europe, I would also like to mention unity and geographical balance on the continent. As you know, I have personally struggled to maintain European unity in recent years, whether on solidarity with Ukraine, assistance to Greece, the migration crisis or the Brexit talks. Sometimes we were more and sometimes less successful, but eventually we always managed to stay together. This is because the leaders truly understand the power of unity. It is clear that only when we are united can we counterbalance the most powerful global players. At our last summit, we were also able to build consensus. It took us three days because I wanted to be sure that every Member State, big or small, from every corner of Europe, was on board when it came to the future leadership of the Union. Of course, there is still room for improvement, as regards representatives from the East, in the overall architecture of European positions. In particular, some Prime Ministers from the Socialist family were making commitments as regards geographical balance in this House.  The European Council also covered a number of other topics but, since you know our conclusions, I will not take up any more of your time. Thank you and good luck again.

We have talked about jobs and names over the past few days and the past few nights. It can often take time to find the right balance and the right compromise and it is worth taking the time to get the right people for the right jobs when the future of our Union for the next five years is at stake.  That is why I am delighted that this House has chosen President Sassoli for what might be the most difficult job of all. So, caro Presidente, congratulazioni, and congratulations of course to all Members of the European Parliament on their successful election. I would like to congratulate you not only on my behalf but also on behalf of the President of the European Commission and my colleagues in the College, and I would like to underline that we are all looking forward to working very closely with all of you. The same applies to all the candidates nominated by the European Council, including the candidate for President of the European Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, who has all the credentials to lead our institutions. This House will of course have the final say and we will have the opportunity to debate this in the weeks ahead. But the June European Council was not just about people and personalities. It was about our strategic priorities for the next five years and I am pleased to say that there is a lot of common ground between our two institutions. I would like to emphasise just two points. First, the social dimension. Now, more than ever, we must ensure equal opportunities for all at a time when Europeans are confronted with, and have to go through, multiple transitions – economic, ecological, digital – which all have profound repercussions on our daily lives. My second point, which I believe is equally vital, is the question of climate change. My proudest moment, serving as a Commissioner, was when I was honoured to be able to sign, on behalf of the European Union, probably the most important agreement in recent history, the Paris Agreement, in New York. This House knows very well that this was one of the key priorities for the Commission and how hard we’ve all been working, together with you, over the last five years to deliver on our pledges and commitments. Today we can say that ours is the first big economy in the world to have committed itself under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 1990. You know very well that, with all your hard work, we set the framework, making sure that we would overachieve this target by 2030. We have to say that this is the most ambitious contribution of any major economy and that we have now established the legislative framework to deliver on all of our commitments. For the European Union to continue to lead, all Member States must now match their deeds to their words when it comes to achieving our commonly agreed 2030 targets.  But climate change will not stop in 2030, whether we meet our targets or not. Therefore Europe must very clearly commit to a path of climate neutrality by 2050, as proposed by the Commission last year and supported by the Parliament and recognised by a vast majority of the European Council. A clean planet for all is in all our interests, not least in our economic interests, including the interests of the very small minority of Member States that may still need to be brought fully into our common ambition. This is why we have committed to investing at least 25% of the next long-term budget in climate action. For this reason we have launched a sustainable finance strategy as a part of the capital markets union in order to channel the flows of private capital more effectively into more sustainable investment. However, none of these objectives can be achieved by the European Union unless we have the right money to hand at the right time. That is why I insist that we must still reach an agreement on the future Multiannual Financial Framework this autumn and I trust that you, honourable Members, will also make it your priority to finalise the negotiations jointly with the Finnish Council Presidency. Voters in the European elections called for an effective Europe, a Europe that can act effectively, and we know that this can happen only if a budget is concluded on time. This requires willingness to compromise on all sides. When I think of Europe’s tens of thousands of researchers, 100 000 cohesion projects and one million Erasmus students, every single day counts if programmes are to begin promptly on 1 January 2021. In this case, the phrase ‘time is money’ really applies. Since we are talking about money, at the European Council we could see how our hard work in recent years on deepening the economic and monetary union has paid off. Today we have a stable currency with an average inflation rate of 1.8% in the euro area. European banks are now much more secure than before the financial crisis. The equity buffer is now close to 20% of total expenditure, compared with only 10% before the financial crisis and, as a result of the banking union, the share of non-performing loans has also been more than halved since 2014 and is approaching pre-crisis levels. But we must not rest on our laurels. There is still work to be done in order to complete the economic and monetary union. The budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness is an important step towards a budget line for the euro. We need to secure its financing and governance. Further efforts are also needed on the Treaty on the European Stability Mechanism to make it effective and credible and it needs to be integrated into Union law over time. We also need a common deposit guarantee to complete our banking union. We cannot afford to wait until the next crisis before we finally make headway on these crucial issues. There is still much to do and I am therefore happy that, with this plenary session, your work is only just the beginning. Honourable Members, allow me to finish with a few words on some of the other issues we discussed during the last European Council. Firstly, I want to reaffirm our full support for Cyprus in light of Turkey’s continued illegal drilling activities. President Juncker was the first to say, back in Sibiu, that on this issue he is a Cypriot. I was delighted that at the European Council every Member State spoke in unison and said ‘we are all Cypriots’. The Commission is now backing up that spirit of solidarity. We are working on concrete actions we can take and I can assure the people of Cyprus that we will do what we have to do. Europe will stand in full solidarity with Cyprus. I cannot mention Cyprus without once again offering my sincere condolences to the family of former President Dimitris Christofias, a man who shared his love for Europe and Cyprus in the same way as we do. On the Western Balkans, I want to repeat the Commission’s commitment to a firm and credible EU perspective for the region. I believe it is the best way to bring stability to the region. It the best way to overcome bilateral issues and keep up the reform momentum that is serving the people of the region so well. The Member States put back a decision on accession negotiations for North Macedonia and Albania until October. The Commission is ready to keep explaining its recommendation to open talks on the basis of our objective assessment of the progress achieved. In the meantime, it is essential that the two countries and the region as a whole keep up the momentum. These reforms and efforts are, first and foremost, for the citizens of the region. They are about building a society based on fairness and respect of the rule of law. The European Union will support all efforts to achieve this.  Finally, let me reiterate our full and unequivocal support for Ukraine. We are following the issues in the east of the country very closely and we will continue to make the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements the number one priority. The Commission will repeat this message loud and clear in Kiev next week at the next EU-Ukraine summit and I will personally do my utmost to make sure that there will be a continuation of the long-term gas transit through Ukraine for the next long-term period. Lastly, I would like to inform you that the next trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the Commission under my chairmanship will resume in September.

You have counted on our vows; I'm just asking you not to forget it now or in two and a half years. I would also like to congratulate and thank President Tajani, who has always defended the honour and dignity of this Parliament and all its members. In addition, I must congratulate new colleagues and veterans. On our shoulders lies the responsibility of representing the European people. We are the only institution chosen by the European people. The one I am not going to congratulate is the Council. With all due respect, President Tusk, you cannot boast of how you have done things, not by forms, nor by vetoes, or by your disrespect for the rest of the institutions.  To the extremists - I don't know if they're here today - who turned their backs on the European anthem last Tuesday, I also want to tell them that we will never turn our backs on the UK anthem. That's the difference between having principles and not having them. Today I speak here on behalf of a deeply Europeanist political group, which has helped build Europe from its foundations; the Group of a founding party of the European Union; a group that, unlike others, will always be willing to make resignations and sacrifices to reach agreements; a group proud of its president and candidate victorious from the last European elections, Manfred Weber. Manfred, you have our support! Without having intended it, today it represents the spirit of European democracy in front of the Council.  Europe, in addition to seeming democratic, must be democratic. That is why this House has defended the Spitzenkandidat process for years; because we believe that Europeans have the right not only to vote on how they are governed, but also who governs them. And I tell you one thing: we believed yesterday in the Spitzenkandidat, we believe today and I assure you that in five years we will continue to believe, because we prefer the ballot boxes to the closed rooms.  The legitimate interests of the governments represented in the Council should not be imposed by force of the States on the will of the citizens represented in this Parliament. At this point, I will tell you that the European People's Party will support the candidate proposed by the Council, out of responsibility, because it belongs to the political party that won the elections and because at the head of the Commission there will be a person trained and prepared to give the battle in defence of Europe's interests. As a political group, we are also proud that Ursula von der Leyen will be the first woman to lead the European Union and that she is precisely a woman of centre-right. However, the Council and its candidate will have to negotiate a programme with this House. We invite the members of the Council to share a reflection. Europe's future must stop being decided behind closed doors and in secret conspiracies. The Spitzenkandidat process is not about a man or a woman. It is a question of citizens being able to choose the person who governs them in Europe; a truly revolutionary idea: it's called democracy.  The Council has the right to propose to Parliament a candidate for President of the Commission. That's true. But the Council has no right to ignore all candidates who have been voted on by European citizens. You, Mr Tusk, have formed a dome of the European Union that dispenses with Eastern Europe. No one from Eastern Europe is in his name package. You, Mr Tusk, have veted – yes, veted – the candidate to which more than forty million Europeans voted, the same population that your country has or that has mine. He's been veted. You have imposed on the candidate for President of the Commission the structure of the Commission. Not only the structure – even how many vice-presidencies it will have – without having consulted it and before Parliament votes on it, which is clearly against the Treaties.  You have intended to tell Parliament who you had to appoint as President of the House, even for how long the groups had to hand us out the presidency. You have come to the point of deciding who is going to be the president of the European Central Bank as if it were another political post. That's called democratic rude. You have given the eurosceptics reason. Governing from capitals is also nationalism. None of the Presidents who are part of the Council would dare to do in their respective countries what they have done in the Council, because the Constitutional Court would prevent it.  If I may joke, you are fortunate that Article 7 of the Treaty cannot be applied to the Council because otherwise the Commission would have a real problem today. You have opened up a very serious political conflict between the Council and the Parliament on who decides in Europe. And I will tell you one thing: my group is one of those who thinks that in Europe the people decide. That's called democracy.

The best would have led this change in the Commission would undoubtedly be Frans Timmermans. Firstly, because of the figure of Spitzenkandidat who can get a majority vote in this European Parliament and out of respect for the democratic norms we set ourselves. And second, and both or just as important, because our candidate has been dismissed for defending the values of the Union and the rule of law. Well, be clear that we will work with more energy to make those values respected.  But there is an important policy issue that is also fundamental and consistent. And it is not coherent to come here to throw the Council's decision down and then say that it will be voted in favour of it. The truth is, that position is not very coherent. But let us be clear on one issue: the fundamental principle underpinning the European Union is human dignity. And if we were consistent with these values a long time ago, we would have acted forcefully and coordinatedly to talk about politics in Europe; to talk about how we are able to respect human rights; to see how we are able to make the fundamental values of the Union respected. We have to go further.  I want to talk about politics and I want to talk about how this group is going to lead the changes in Europe. I'm glad the Italian courts have released Captain Carola Rackete. This happens when, indeed, there is separation of powers, and that is why it is essential to preserve the separation of powers from democracies and liberals. But we must go further and prevent these dramatic situations from occurring because of the lack of solidarity in the European Union. It is indecent to criminalize those who save lives and it is indecent to try to draw political return from the misfortune of these people.  Speaking of politics, and speaking of content, we will also not support any candidate and any candidate who intends to remain in immobility in the face of the need for reforms with economic governance, strengthening social policies and ecological transformation. The clock doesn't wait. European teenagers tell us that every Friday. Let us act in the face of the global climate emergency; let them down. That is why we will be very demanding on the agenda of the next Commission.  Climate change requires a transformation that must have two axes: inclusion, so that it is a fair transition, and sustainability. We were disappointed to see the lack of unanimity to meet our commitments made in Paris. This Parliament has always been ahead, and our group will continue to build majority to urge the Commission and the Council to be more ambitious. In this regard, I should congratulate the Finnish Presidency of the Council on its proposals for a sustainable future.  We're still talking about politics. We need an ambitious multiannual financial framework to make the necessary change; we can't do more with less. And this Parliament will give the battle to have the funds demanded by the policies we are going to adopt. Remember Europe 2020? There are six months left and we have not been able to meet the objectives, to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and exclusion. Out of twenty million, we've only got five. Because while some benefit from the crisis, others continue to pay their consequences, and the big numbers are not enough for us. We are interested in people and we want economic growth to translate into the better living of people, men and women in Europe with more social justice.  We must change economic governance. We want a social and solidarity economy, and for that we need to strengthen the European Semester, so that it includes the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the pillar of social rights. And we also need to reform monetary union. We cannot wait for another crisis to reform the euro area, to give it fiscal capacity and a guarantee of deposits. But we will not be able to achieve these goals if we do not work on a global agenda at the same time. We want a strong Europe, to promote human rights, labour and environmental standards in multilateral agreements. Citizens expect more from us: expect us to defend social conquests, such as sexual and reproductive rights or the rights of the LGTBI community; that we move forward so that unfair situations such as the gender pay gap are over once and for all. And, of course, in our hands is to end the largest social scourge that europe is currently living, which is the gender-based violence, women who are still killed just because they are women and, of course, because we are here to give answers anymore, we can't wait any longer. We are here to build a strong Europe on the values of equality, solidarity, sustainability and justice, and we will work closely with those who stand up for these objectives. Let us not let down the trust of those who have placed it in us.

I can only express my hope that, together with the new group 'Renew Europe', we will make the voice of this Parliament more heard. For this voice to be heard more, we need first of all a democratisation of the process of appointments to leadership positions in the European Union. This is where these proposals must go, because otherwise we can discuss names, we can discuss gender balance, we can discuss geographical balance, as long as we do not have a democratic and transparent process of choosing those who must lead Europe, we cannot be satisfied. (applause) Yes, we have some proposals this time. Colleagues who preceded me in the intervention expressed their views on how these people were selected. We do not have a balance, Mr President, we do not have a geographical balance under any circumstances. Eastern Europe, unfortunately, is no longer represented as it was when you were appointed to the position you are currently representing. So we need a way to take into account everything that the Treaty of the European Union provides, and these things need to be translated into a democratic process. Dear popular and socialist colleagues, if we really want a democratic spirit and if we want these list leaders to be truly representative, let us think about how we can set up a system of transnational election lists or lists whereby these candidates can be accessible to all European citizens, not just German citizens, not just French or Spanish or Dutch citizens and so on. (applause)  These \"Spitzenkandidaten\" will be legitimate when every European citizen has access to them and is able to vote for them. We propose that we do this and start here in Parliament, because we cannot expect either the Commission or the Council to do something, which is our responsibility. The Renew Europe Group proposes and will also propose to the Council and Parliament to organise a European conference, a conference for the renewal of Europe, for the democratisation of the electoral process, a conference of a sufficiently long duration, two years, two and a half years, to make proposals together with the Commission, with the Council, with citizens, with non-governmental organisations, to come up with proposals on how we can improve the process we have.  I fully agree with Mr González Pons, I fully agree with Iratxe García Pérez that we need people who really represent Europeans and from there the Council can choose. But let us formalise this process, so that we no longer sit around arguing in exchanges of ideas and opinions when it is already too late, when the Council has to choose and when we must be able to decide! Let us use this mandate so that by the next election we have such a device that is already agreed with Parliament, the Council and the Member States and we do not waste any more time throwing ourselves invective and show European citizens that we are capable of making decisions and we are able to represent them!  That is what we are proposing, I hope we have your support, because we have time, from now until the next elections, to go through this process. Secondly, European values and the rule of law, respect for human rights, from our point of view and for us, are non-negotiable and their violation means undermining democracy. That is why it is very important for us that in this parliamentary term we can discuss a set of legislative proposals to protect the rule of law and for fundamental rights and an effective mechanism that also provides for sanctions for all Member States, that we have this very clear mechanism that plays a prevention role primarily, but we know exactly what awaits each Member State that violates the rule of law and does not respect justice.  We must also conclude the process of appointing the European Prosecutor as soon as possible. I've waited too long for that. This institution must be operational as soon as possible in order to protect the financial interests of the European Union from corruption, from fraud, but above all, to give a very clear signal that the European Union knows not only how to punish, but also to prevent and that the European institutions have the tools to do so.  Thirdly, we need a new vision and policies that agree with environmental imperatives with economic and social ones. We have an agenda on climate change that is very clear. We need to be able to align it with our economic development goals, social development. The message must be very clear to the future European Commission about these objectives that we also have in Parliament. In this context, the adoption of the new Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 which the Council has adopted is an important step, but that is not enough. From our point of view, we must have such a political agenda set here in the European Parliament. I hope that we can continue and carry out the process that we have started with the pro-European political groups in Parliament to set these priorities and put them on the table of the future leadership of the European Commission as soon as possible. Parliament must play a key role in setting these priorities, and that is what we must do now, before the appointment of the next President or President of the European Commission. Otherwise we risk it being too late again. It is our responsibility, the pro-European political forces in this Parliament, to put Parliament's strategic priorities on the table of the future European Commission. We must do this now, because European citizens are waiting for a renewal of the way European policy is done, and this renewal must leave Parliament here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2019-07-04.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to welcome two-thirds of the members who are coming here for the first time. Ten years ago, when I sat down in this chamber, I was very moved by the emotion of collectively representing 500 million European citizens. So, of course, on a global scale, it is relatively modest - 7% - but this is the first time that humanity has tried transnational democracy. Remember, on 26 May, 200 million Europeans took part in the election of our Parliament, the seat of this first transnational democracy. In the wake of the election, and in response to the unprecedented citizen mobilization, I began to dream that political groups resolutely committed to European integration would decide to forge a project contract together. This project of change would have no other purpose than to find, in this Chamber, a large and stable majority to respond together to the triple environmental, social and democratic emergency and thus demonstrate that the European Union works in the service of all. This agreement on a project contract would then have allowed the groups involved to nominate a personality directly from the elections to embody him, as President of the European Commission. A solid and coherent project, a credible personality to embody it, all carried by a large majority, including the winning political forces of the elections. In the face of this, the European Council would have had no choice but to accept, otherwise, a sterile confrontation with Parliament, a confrontation from which it would not have won. In such a scenario, the European Parliament would have affirmed, as never before, its capacity to be the primary democratic expression of the citizens of the Union. At the same time, he would have provided a response to disenchantment with politics. These are colleagues what the situation might have been at the opening of our first plenary session. It is this scenario that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been preparing for several months. It is in order to achieve this that we have been fully committed over the past weeks. Of course, the challenge was enormous and time was running out, but where there is willpower, as you know, there is a way. It is here in the European Parliament that this will has failed. Indeed, a majority of this Parliament has preferred a path which will inevitably lead it to become the executor of decisions taken elsewhere, in the European Council, unless, of course, the martial expressions, which I have heard on my left and right, are translated into fact, but allow me, at this stage at least at least, to doubt them. A European Council, five days of unglamorous haggling where partisan and national logics have taken over the project and its incarnation. All this to lead to a cast that can be questioned about the ability to drive the change that our societies need and that our fellow citizens expect. And if it is legitimate - and I have heard it very much in this Chamber - to criticise the Heads of State and Government, I would like to tell all of you that if Parliament emerges weakened from this episode, it will first and foremost have to attack itself. I would like to thank President Tusk here for the kind words he has addressed quite explicitly to the political family which I have the honour of leading here in the Council. I believe your sincere words, but I must note that, around the Council table, but I would even say here in this House, this desire to involve the family of political ecology, in the management of the next five years, does not seem uniformly shared and I think that is an understatement. But all this does not temper our enthusiasm, strong from the renewed confidence of our fellow citizens, we will not give up. In the next five years, we will use the leverage of our 75 MEPs and our teams to advance the cause of a fairer, more sustainable and more democratic Europe. A Europe at the forefront of the fight to preserve our climate, biodiversity and natural resources; a Europe that champions the fight for social, fiscal, economic and gender justice; a Europe at the forefront of defending human rights freedoms and an ever more participatory democracy. In short, a Europe that places the dignity of all human beings at the centre of these policies rather than maximising the profit of some. This cause - and I have heard some of you say it - is not monopolized, it is shared. We will work with all those who, within this institution, in the other European institutions, in the Member States, in national, regional, local and above all in civil society with all those who share this cause. Make no mistake, colleagues, our house is burning. In the face of a triple environmental, social and democratic emergency, only such an alliance for change can save us.

Those who had, after the election campaign, after the elections on 26 May, had little hope of a change in methods and programmes were disappointed.  The spectacle that has been offered and the interinstitutional confrontation that we have seen going on these days is something that the citizens of Europe will really not be able to understand. The Council has decided to throw in the bin a questionable method that Parliament has tried to defend, that of the leading candidate (Spitzencandidaten), and today Parliament and the parliamentary groups complain that there has been no respect in the package agreed between the Heads of State or Government. And here too, you demonstrate your hypocrisy and your lack of consistency in following up action with words. If Parliament really wants to ensure that, if Parliament, or the majority in Parliament, really wants to defend the leading candidate's method, words can be followed by deeds. If you really want to be consistent, you can vote against the candidate that the Council has proposed for the Presidency of the Commission. If you make such a gesture, you can be considered consistent. Otherwise, as you have always and often demonstrated, your words will remain in the wind, demonstrating once again that this institution is worthless and has no say in European decisions.  With regard to the package proposed by the Council – and we are, of course, waiting for what the policy lines will be – the preconditions, as I have already said, do not suggest a major change, what the citizens of Europe asked us to do on 26 May; they do not suggest a change of line that can solve the problems that the citizens of Europe are facing and where the majority, which has ruled in Europe to date, has failed profoundly.  The economic crisis: today Europe is the least growing continent; it is a continent that is falling behind, and this is the result of bad choices made by these institutions, which have not only been unable to help the citizens, but have very often aggravated the problems.  The issue of internal security: those who were present during the last parliamentary term had to live in two very serious attacks in both places of Parliament. Today, our citizens are unable to travel around our safe cities and, in this respect, these institutions have not been able to give an answer.  And the third point concerns the management of migratory flows: until we are able to protect our external borders, until we are able to protect our citizens, these institutions will not only never agree on how to redistribute those who have the right to enter Europe, but the risk is that this continent will be crushed by migratory flows that are not sustainable.  With regard to what the Identity and Democracy Group will do in the coming years, despite the fact that this majority or the majority that will come has once again decided to demonstrate that this institution is not a democratic institution, excluding those who represent almost 20% of the Members of this House, we will continue to work to combat a failed vision of Europe, to combat centralisation in Brussels and to establish that , if Europe wants to save itself, it must start again from the Member States, from the nation-states, which are the only area of true democracy. We will continue to work to call into question the rhetoric of 'TINA' (There Is No Alternative), of what you are proposing to us every time to solve Europe's problems, namely to give more and more powers to bureaucrats far removed from the citizens. No, this is not the Europe that the citizens want. This is not the Europe we want, and if you continue in this direction, Europe is in real danger of being dissolute. The differences between the Member States and between the institutions continue to widen and we will not go in any direction.  The Identity and Democracy Group will start from this vision: a Europe where the Member States lead European cooperation and protect the differences that you want to homologate by law.

I think the most obvious conclusion that comes from the last Council is that the Spitzenkandidaten mechanism is dead. It is dead and gone. It’s even more dead than the parrot in the Monty Python sketch. I’m not sorry that it is dead because, look, there is nothing about Spitzenkandidat in the Treaties. Not a single sentence, not a single word, nothing. I know of course that the attitude of many people in European politics, including this Chamber, towards the rules and the Treaties has been consistently cavalier, to say the least. Mr Timmermans was not a candidate of the people, of the European people. Mr Timmermans was a candidate of the left-wing political establishment and it is good that he has gone. And I hope he will not return, because essentially the Spitzenkandidat process was to conserve the power of the existing political establishment in Europe, not to open the political space for the people. Far from it. On the contrary.  We have problems with rules all the time, and the European Parliament has had consistent problems with respecting the rules. Yesterday we had a lamentable spectacle which showed how a lot of people here are openly disdainful of the rules. President Tusk, of course the Council has no right whatsoever to indicate the Vice-President of the Commission – that is a blatant violation of the Treaty. It is the sole discretionary power of the President of the Commission. So, as I say, the Council is not blameless either. But there is good news, I think. The good news from the last Council is that the EU big guys failed to achieve what they wanted – they wanted to impose their own concept, their own power structure, on the rest of the Member States, with the expectation that it would be humbly accepted. Well it was not, and I hope that some lessons were drawn from that and that it will result in a change of practice. The days when two or three governments and their acolytes could dictate the solutions – even the names – to the entire European continent, are gone.  What I am worried about when I hear my predecessor here is that you, ladies and gentlemen, don’t seem to draw any lessons from what happened in the elections. You seem to be determined to continue the same strategy. The number of people who are openly critical of this strategy is increasing. There are more people critical of the strategy now than there were five years ago. And the number is continuing to rise. Yet you seem to be blind and deaf – you don’t hear any warning signals, but you should, because if you do not change course then the consequences will be disastrous. As I said, there is a slight signal from the last Council that things might get better – at least I was hopeful of that – but I lost a lot of hope when I came here and listened to what most of you have said. However, when the milk is spilt please remember that I warned you.

Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to congratulate you once again on your election, Mr Sassoli. We expect nothing less from you than to be a President who stands for transparency, for bipartisanship, and who also knows how to defend Parliament's rights against the Council and also with the Commission. This brings me to the real issue: the Council, President Tusk, has now found a solution in personnel poker, and some colleagues have complained about the result, even though their party families have been heavily involved in it. I would like to make it clear to you at this point that the real scandal is that such solutions are found in backrooms, that there is non-transparent work on solutions that do not involve Parliament and that actually make a mockery of democracy in Europe. This will disappoint the confidence of the electorate and cause great damage to European democracy. (Applause) People outside the back rooms and also outside the fine restaurants where these conversations are said to have taken place get the impression that it is only about posts and no longer about content. But we on the left in the European Parliament have been instructed by millions of voters to fight for a progressive change of policy here in Europe, in the European Union. And we are happy to accept this assignment. Now, some groups, some colleagues, have been negotiating intensively with each other in recent weeks and have tried to set up a joint coalition agreement. That has also been mentioned – that is, the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Liberals and also the Conservatives. I believe that minimal consensus does not meet the political challenges of our time. The Left Group wants to take effective measures against the climate emergency. This requires progressive majorities in this House. We want to strengthen social rights in the EU, we want to tackle tax dumping, tax evasion and money laundering. This, too, requires progressive majorities in this House. And, Commissioner, the Commission recently celebrated the planned EU-Mercosur free trade agreement. I want to tell you that it is totally unacceptable for my group to sign this agreement. Surely it cannot be the European Union's policy of throwing human rights, social rights and environmental standards overboard for a few euros! In addition, this agreement is also to be signed with the far-right government in Brazil. It is such a policy that makes the far-right acceptable in the first place! That is our firm contradiction. Nobody understands that anymore! I call on colleagues here in Parliament to join us in opposing this planned free trade agreement. (Applause) Yes, the Left Group is in favour of a humane EU migration and asylum policy that guarantees universal human rights. And yes, we are therefore very pleased that carola stands one to zero in the clash between the captain Carola Rackete and the self-proclaimed Il Capitano. I think that is how it can continue.

It is also a pleasure that deals that do not respect the EU treaties will be destroyed. It is not possible to expand beyond the contracts and to upset the balance between the institutions. History has transcended the pre-peak system, and I think it's the right thing to do.  The third is that it is not worth trying to force certain groups of countries to apply double standards to them. The Union cannot be built against Central Europe, the Visegrad countries.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support.

I am also very glad that, in all the speeches, I have heard clearly that there is enormous convergence between our institutions on the strategic agenda for the future. We have been working hard over the past five years to make sure not only that the EU will remain the leader in tackling climate change, but also that we are laying the ground for the new, modern, sustainable economy, and therefore one of the big responsibilities for all of us in this new period will be to make sure that we have correct and proper implementation of all the laws that have already been agreed. The cause advanced by Ms García, Mr Ciolos, Mr Pons and Mr Lamberts, to make sure that we use the next five years to build a social, green and fair Europe, is something we must bear in mind throughout the next steps and in planning our work for the future. I very much echo the calls made by many of the honourable Members who say this new economy must ensure that nobody is left behind, that energy poverty is properly tackled, that everyone will see their future in the new economy – including those who are living in coal regions today or in energy-intensive cities and towns built many decades ago – and that we know how to help, we know how to provide them with new hope and new economic plans for the future.  What we need to underline – and again this point was made by Ms Iratxe García – is that to get to these very concrete measures we need quick decisions on the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We need to make sure that we do not waste time, that we do not waste weeks, months and days ensuring that all our programmes and ideas are properly financially supported. We know we are not that far from concluding the deal, and we need to make sure that we use the Finnish Presidency for a successful conclusion of the new European budget. We need to build an economy that is not only green and clean but also competitive, and it’s quite clear that, in addition to what we’ve been doing already, we need a new, ambitious approach to all the so-called technological mega-trends. Be it in clean mobility, artificial intelligence, super-computing or robotics, we need to make sure that we can be a strong competitor vis-à-vis the competition from the USA or China – and I’m sure we can do that in our European way, respectful of our citizens, respectful of the environment and respectful of international treaties, international rules and obligations. In that regard, I would also like to reassure Mr Shirdewan that all our new trade agreements, which will be discussed with all of you, respect high trade, environmental and labour standards, and that this is our European response to the creeping trade protectionism which we see around the world. Of course, we in the Commission will be ready to explain to you all the advantages of, and the philosophy behind, these trade deals. With all due respect to our British colleagues, I have to say that we in the Commission will be sorry to see you go, and we still hope that this will not happen. (Applause) And to the colleagues up there, with all my diplomatic skills, I would just say that we would not take that leadership lesson from you. (Applause) So, honourable Members, Mr President of Parliament, President of the European Council, I would like to conclude my first address to the new House with an appeal to all of us: let us make sure that we use the coming years to make this century a European one, or at least as European as it can be, because the world needs a strong, united, prosperous Europe.

Following the results of the European Parliament elections, which showed an electoral erosion of the right-wing and social-democracy parties, members of the EPP and S&amp;D respectively, it became necessary to reconfigure the so-called 'Brussels Consensus', which included with another role the so-called 'liberals', now formally necessary for the formation of the majorities necessary to enforce the continuity of the current policies.  The compromise confirms the deception of so-called 'candidates for President of the European Commission', a political manipulation maneuver that sought to give a democratic appearance to an undemocratic process in its essence, while at the same time covering efforts to deepen the federalist character of the EU institutions and the process of capitalist integration itself.
