Following the presentation by the Commission of its proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the Bulgarian, Austrian, Romanian and Finnish Presidencies worked hard at the technical and political levels to prepare the ground for an agreement. We have now entered a decisive phase. Following the discussion at the December European Council, the President of the European Council has carried out extensive consultation with his counterparts. On this basis, he will submit, with a view to the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 17 February, his proposal for a deal at the level of the European Council. The Croatian Presidency fully supports the view that a deal must be found swiftly. This will not be easy, as we all know, but there is still, in many parts, an expectation gap between what we want to achieve at EU level and the funds to achieve these goals. However, postponement would not make things easier, quite the contrary. The departure of the UK creates a budgetary gap, further tightening the situation, with the Union facing, at the same time, a number of new challenges and, hence, priorities. A balanced agreement reflecting the ambitious objectives of the strategic agenda at the level of the European Council in February is necessary to open the way for concluding the negotiations on the many pending sectoral codecision files so as to be ready for the beginning of the new cycle in January 2021. The urgency to adopt the draft MFF regulation at the Council level also stems from the fact that this will not be the end of the road, since the European Parliament must give its consent to this regulation. We are aware of the concerns and the positions expressed by the Parliament. That is why, all along the process, the successive presidencies have taken great care to keep Parliament informed, for instance, through regular meetings both before and after the General Affairs Council meetings discussing the MFF, which will be the case next week as well. The Croatian Presidency will continue with this practice whenever the MFF is on the GAC formal agenda. Moreover, that is also why the President of the European Council has had several high-level contacts with the representatives of the Parliament. Once unanimous agreement is found at the level of the European Council, the Croatian Presidency will work very hard with the Parliament to ensure a positive outcome when the House votes on this regulation. Reaching a timely and balanced agreement on the whole MFF package, including the own resources part, is in the common interest of all institutions, Member States, and their citizens. I very much hope that we will achieve that objective. The Croatian Presidency will do all it can in that respect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Ursula von der Leyen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Präsidentin der Kommission. Herr Präsident, meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten! In der Tat, wir werden nächste Woche den außerordentlichen Europäischen Rat haben, und das ist ein wichtiger Moment für Europa. Die Ausgangsposition ist im Prinzip gut, denn alle drei Institutionen – das Parlament, der Rat und die Kommission – sind sich einig über die strategische Agenda. Wir wissen alle, was auf dem Spiel steht. Wir haben sehr klare gemeinsame politische Ziele: Europa soll 2050 der erste klimaneutrale Kontinent sein, und zwar nicht nur, weil es um die Gesundheit des Planeten geht – das ist das Hauptziel –, aber auch, weil wir wissen, dass dahinter, wenn wir eine saubere und umweltfreundliche Wirtschaft entwickeln, neue Jobs stehen, die nachhaltig sind und die damit auch Zukunft bedeuten. Wir wollen vom digitalen Wandel in der Welt profitieren, und zwar nicht nur passiv, sondern wir wollen auch aktiv Akteure sein. Und wir wollen die Menschen in Europa stärken, indem wir einerseits den Übergang, der durch die ökologische und digitale Transformation ausgelöst wird, abfedern und andererseits genau das machen, was richtig ist, nämlich investieren in die Bildung und Ausbildung, gerade mit Kompetenzen auf dem ökologischen und digitalen Feld. Doch uns läuft die Zeit davon, und lassen Sie es mich noch einmal ganz deutlich formulieren: Wenn der Haushalt nicht bald beschlossen wird, dann werden wir im nächsten Jahr nicht in der Lage sein, mit dem neuen Haushalt die neuen Prioritäten tatsächlich auch so zu finanzieren, wie wir uns das alle vorstellen. And, therefore, after nearly two years of deliberations it is high time now. All of us must be ready to find common ground. And what is important: we have to find the right balance between old priorities and new priorities. Because if you look at the negotiations, while there are many, many Member States that strongly defend cohesion policies, and rightly so. And there are many Member States that strongly defend the common agricultural policies, and rightly so.  But I also expect to see the same dedication when it comes to defending our new priorities. Because the day the budget will be signed, the day we have agreed on a budget – and I know that – everybody will turn around towards the Parliament and towards the Commission and will ask for: Horizon Europe, will ask for Erasmus, ask for migration funds, for defence, for digitalisation, for infrastructure, you name it. And, therefore, we really have to make sure that these new priorities get the attention they deserve.  We have to deliver on a European budget that is able to invest in digital start—up, to explore the potential of artificial intelligence, to anchor Europe’s position as the world’s leading research region, to offer young people a better future and all parts of Europe, to address the root causes of migration, to allow us to demonstrate solidarity in cases of humanitarian or natural catastrophes, to allow to build the European Union of security and defence. But, most of all, we need a budget so that citizens and companies see that we are able to act on climate change. For citizens this is the top priority. For us, it’s a challenge, but it’s our duty to turn this challenge into an opportunity. Le succès de ces négociations budgétaires dépendra des moyens que nous nous donnerons de financer notre pacte vert pour l’Europe. Moi, je n’accepterai aucun résultat qui ne garantisse pas qu’au moins 25 % du budget soit consacré à la lutte contre le changement climatique. J’attends un budget qui alloue les nouvelles ressources nécessaires au mécanisme pour une transition juste. La raison en est simple: si nous ne nous donnons pas les moyens nécessaires pour soutenir les régions et les travailleurs les plus exposés aux conséquences économiques et sociales des politiques relatives au changement climatique, nous ne réussirons tout simplement pas à atteindre la neutralité climatique. Le pacte vert pour l’Europe se fera avec les citoyens européens, avec les chercheurs européens, avec les entreprises européennes, ou il ne se fera pas du tout. Je pense, tout comme vous, que de nouvelles ressources propres pour l’Union constitueraient une avancée importante. Pour cela, j’ai instamment prié les États membres de tenir pleinement compte de la position du Parlement européen à cet égard. Je suis convaincue que cela donnera un coup d’accélérateur à notre programme commun et allégera la pression exercée sur les budgets nationaux, rendant ainsi possible l’allocation des fonds supplémentaires nécessaires. Ainsi, c’est véritablement une solution gagnant-gagnant que nous recherchons.  Honourable Members, we all know the negotiations will not be easy. As a Union of 27, as you said, we have fewer resources. It’s about EUR 75 billion less for the whole 7-years period, but more common challenges that no Member State can solve on its own. And at the same time, expectations towards the next long-term budget of the Union could not be more diverse. As Members of Parliament, you are well aware of the discussions in your home countries, while you also see the different positions in the Member States of your colleagues. Arriving at an agreement will therefore be a serious challenge. We all know this. But we also know that citizens will not understand it if decision-makers fail to make the funding available for policies needed. It’s our common responsibility in the European Council, and in the European Parliament to deliver for Europe.

When we talk about money, we talk about budget, we talk about politics, about the future of Europe. Where can we focus? I would like to begin by stressing that, from our point of view, it would have been good if Charles Michel had been here today. Listening would have been good. We know that he is in close contact with our Steering Group to meet with the experts, but coming to plenary has another meaning; that is why I would like to say at the outset that it would have been nice if he were there. But what is positive is that he has set February 20. He puts pressure on the MFF discussion, he tries to give answers, he tries to achieve security for the citizens. The farmers, the students, the researchers – all are waiting for clarity as to what will happen in the next few years. That is why we wish him every success for the 20th. It is the right moment to do this: we have a fresh mandate – we, as Members of Parliament, from the electorate, the Commission has a fresh mandate. We are all equipped with new momentum, and we know what the people have given us after these European elections, and that is what we need to do together now. The first point is that we, as a European level, make it clear that it is not just a question of defending the existing funds. I would like to make it clear that we too are capable of self-criticism, and it must also be possible in budget negotiations to start by looking self-critically at whether the existing money is being properly spent. Both Günther Oettinger and Johannes Hahn have done so in their responsibility with the proposals that are before us. That means looking at it in a really self-critical way in the areas. One issue that is important to us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is budgetary control: the possible limitation of payments to an individual. If a person in Europe gets large sums from the EU budget, then that cannot be right. We are in favour of a kind of anti-oligarch law in the European Union, where we make it clear that the money must not end up in one hand. A second issue for us is that we also defend the existing funds and make it clear that they are well invested. Farmers need support in global competition, rural areas need support in globalisation. Regional support means that Europe is growing together. That is right, and solidarity is still necessary. In the field of research: Erasmus shows Europe the European added value, the additional European advantage. Thirdly, it is important to us that we do not save on the future. Agriculture is important, regional development is important – we have always stressed this in our positions – but the momentum must not now be created for cuts in the European Union's future fields. I would like to see a one-per-cent discussion in the Council now, not just a percentage discussion on the ceiling, but also a concrete discussion of content. If the European Council decides to put into force 10 000 Frontex officials who better protect our external borders, then it is unacceptable for the Finnish Presidency to reduce this share of the budget by one third. Either you stand by your promises or you do not stand by your promises. This also applies to research. Our project, for example, which is very important to us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, will also need the necessary resources to succeed in the fight against cancer. I have already mentioned this in Erasmus, and I would like to thank Johannes and also Ursula von der Leyen for the clarity that these issues must not be allowed to go under the table. I would also like to see – and I say this as a German – that we finally end the net contributor discussion. Ladies and gentlemen, if we establish proper border protection in Europe, if we establish a Marshall Plan for Africa, then these are not money that will go back to the Netherlands, Austria or Germany, but it is in the deep interest of the Germans, the Austrians and also the Dutch. That is why we should stop discussing the net contributors. The best approach to overcome them would be to finally get started in own resources, if European tasks are financed with European funds, that the common interest of Europeans is also financed by European funds, then that would be the best answer we can give. I would like to say explicitly that the Council should know that, for us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the issue of own resources is also a red line. We need a systemic change in the financing of the European Union, and we will underline this in the further discussions. Another systemic issue is rule of law: European taxpayers' money can only be spent if legal principles are respected. An independent judiciary, a free media landscape, is the best guarantee that money will be properly spent. That is why we take the view that a combination of rule of law and the MFF makes sense. And last but not least: in the last discussion on the MFF, David Cameron campaigned hard for it: only one per cent, only one per cent, only one per cent! In doing so, he could convince the British that Europe would then be efficient, sustainable and lean. We have seen the Brexit example: if we feed the populists, if we give in to the populists, it will strengthen the populists and not weaken them. That is why we now need an ambitious approach – not the lowest common denominator, but ambition for Europe!

It's no use setting goals by 2050 if we tie our hands for the next seven years.  That we are at a crucial time for Europe we all know. So is the Council. That Europe really needs to put in place a major transformation to lead sustainability in the world, a transformation in economic, social, environmental matters. Of course, that agenda of transformation is necessary. We all know this, and so does the Council.  Now we only need to be able to put on the table the means necessary to carry it out. This Parliament's proposal is very reasonable and faces this need: 1.3% of gross national product, more additional resources for new policies to be put in place, such as addressing the right transition in this area.  This Parliament's proposal is very clear and has a large majority of support from the various political groups. President Von der Leyen has insisted very much on the need for this to be a geostrategic Commission and to have our position in the world. And so has the President of the Council, Mr Charles Michel, alluded to the need to lead the fight for climate neutrality in the world. Now all we need to do is convince his Council partners — and I would also like to say at this point that we would have liked Mr Charles Michel to be here today; you may still have little to say, but you have a lot to listen to. In order to convince the Council partners, I believe that it is necessary to understand the great responsibility we face and it is necessary to have an agreement in front of us in which there are no winners and losers because then it will be losing Europe. This is not going to take money from some policies to put it on others. This is not going to take money from some regions to put it on others. I would like to remind you here of one thing: it was Jacques Delors who launched the first multiannual programme. He did so in view of the need to make a great European agenda and that it should be above national interests. That it was much more important to move forward in the solidarity of the European project. And that's the ambition we should have right now.  I ask the Heads of Government for a European vision, because we are at an important moment and we are also playing the future of the Union project right now. It is important that we understand that it is necessary to address once and for all the discourse of own resources for those additional funds that we need. It's a strong and ambitious budget. We can't do anything else with less.  We need to address European policies for young people. We need to address European policies for the primary sector, for farmers and for farmers. We need to address European policy to support new entrepreneurs, researchers. There are so many policies that Europe can respond to right now that we will not give in to the attempt to continue this issue.  Time passes and the clock runs. And for us we can say, \"In this Parliament we are patient.\" I'm just going to say two last questions. Parliament decides on an equal footing together with the Council and we will not give in to the pressure of time because the future of the European Union is in our hands and is the most important responsibility we have at the moment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Dacian CIOLOŞ", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen in recent years how much Europe is expected to provide answers to the challenges we face - the financial crisis, the migration crisis, climate change... Crisis after crisis, Europe is increasingly being called upon. More than ever, Europe appears to be necessary; it is therefore necessary, too, to adapt the budget to this new reality. I would like to welcome the determination and commitment of Charles Michel who, alongside the Croatian Presidency, is seeking agreement on the European budget. He has our full support to do that, but only if it is a good budget. Europe is not just a matter of commitment, as we have made many political commitments in recent years. We also need to ensure that these commitments translate into tangible facts for citizens. The adoption of a good budget shows the determination to act together. It is only when we give the budget to our political ambitions that we are credible. The effects of climate change are tangible and require solutions, as well as digital transformation, but we also need to modernise our common agricultural policy and our cohesion policy. All this calls for urgent action on the part of the European Union. I want to highlight three key points for my group. First, the size of the budget. We need the means to meet current and future challenges, and we cannot agree on great ambitions one day and, the next day, limit our ability to achieve our ambitions. It is a matter of the credibility of the European Union before the citizens to agree our political statements and our capacity to act. Second, new own resources. The 'revenue' part of the EU budget must now be modernised and aligned with the treaties. A real European budget calls for solid own resources. The last reform on this subject was made in 1988. Now is the time to rethink and modernize this budget. Third, a strong rule of law mechanism. We must have effective measures to protect the European budget, as long as European values are attacked. My group is not ready to compromise on the rule of law. Erasmus, youth employment, security and defence, border protection and migration management: all this requires a solid budget. After Brexit, after the crises we have been through, we agree on the need now to renew the euro, and the decision on the budget must be proof that we are capable of doing so. The European Parliament must not accept a compromise that undermines the credibility of a Europe capable of acting for its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Marco ZANNI", "mepid": "124780", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pity that President Michel is not here with us to discuss this important point, because I think he has put on the table, convening this extraordinary meeting, so much so that he has earned the initial political credit he has earned from his appointment as President of the European Council. We are therefore waiting for the new proposal to see the numbers, to see if anything has changed, but from the news we receive and from the bilateral meetings it does not seem that this proposal differs much from what was presented by the Finnish Presidency, which was a proposal that had displeased almost everyone, both the Member States in the Council, this Parliament and the Commission.  I believe that, a few months before an important deadline for the new Multiannual Financial Framework, it is appropriate to close an unnecessary dream book and have more pragmatism and realism and to accept the fact that resources are limited. The resources are limited because – and I agree with what my PPE colleague said – very often this Parliament and these institutions have not been able to implement the budget in a concrete and positive way. Not only cases of fraud, but in many cases the programmes on which much political action had been taken have not produced positive results. This is clearly reflected in a more conservative attitude on the part of the Member States. If we are unable to demonstrate the efficiency and added value of the European budget, it is normal that we should be more reluctant to give money. And then this same Parliament and these same institutions repeatedly adopted resolutions directives and regulations calling on the Member States to regulate the budget. Then we also need some consistency in order to have discipline in the management of our budget and in the management of our resources.  I believe that the priorities that are there, those that are fundamental, those that are entered in the European Treaties can be financed without requiring added resources. Agriculture, fisheries, support for regional development and cohesion policy: I believe that there is room in this budget to finance these priorities without asking for additional resources.  We can cut the EUR 20 billion of an unnecessary programme of support for structural reforms, which will only result in a constraint on the choices made by the Member States, and the EUR 13 billion allocated to pre-accession funds, especially turkey, can be drastically cut. In short, we have room to make a truly pragmatic proposal and to reach an agreement as soon as possible.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget is a tool. But you know, you can argue about the size of the tool - a big hammer, a small hammer will always be a hammer, and when you need a screwdriver, well it doesn't help you to have a big hammer. What I mean is that what matters first is what we want to do with the European Union budget.  I very much liked what you said, Madam President, at one point. When you say', 'I will not accept a budget of less than 25% of which is spent on the fight against climate change', I would add: and if the other 75 per cent exacerbates climate change, we are obviously off the mark. I know that is not what you think, but I believe it is important to ensure that the whole European budget is coherent with the ecological and solidarity transition. And I would agree with almost 100% of what Manfred Weber said, but on the common agricultural policy, I do not agree. The aim of the Common Agricultural Policy is not to help our farmers in the globalization of agribusiness; the aim of the common agricultural policy must be to help our farmers transition to agroecology. That is where we will make the difference. The same goes for the Structural Funds, the same for the European Union's research programmes: everything must contribute to this effort.  And so the question of coherence is the first element that will allow us to judge the quality of the Council's proposal. I would remind you that this would be a proposal, not a record - just because the Council approves something does not mean that Parliament behaves like a recording chamber.  Second, as Manfred said, is the link between the budget and respect for the values of the European Union. The European Union is a union of values. Before being an economic and monetary union, before being a financial union, it is a union of values, and one cannot take advantage of the economic and financial benefits of belonging to the European Union if one does not play the air according to the rules of the game, that is, respecting the values of the Union. And we're still a long way off.  And then there's the volume. Of course, volume is a real question. I think, as Iratxe said, that Parliament's proposal is reasonable - 1.3% of GDP! Everyone knows very well that, macroeconomically, we are in short supply of investment. The Green Pact is precisely what I think will stimulate investment in the coming years. Of course, the bulk of the investment will be private investment, but there is no denying the driving and driving role that public investment must play, if only in infrastructure, such as rail. And so, of course, we need a budget that is large enough to carry out the new missions.  So I would say to the European Council, either you sign for 1.3 or 1.5, or you give us the own resources, but you cannot continue to say 'we are tightening the kiki on volume and on top of that, you are not given the opportunity to set up own resources', that is, European taxes. Last point, and I end, Mr President: I was here seven years ago and I heard at the time Joseph Daul, Martin Schulz, Guy Verhofstadt say with Daniel Cohn-Bendit: \"Over our dead body! We will never accept a declining multi-year budget for the period leading up to 2020 compared to the previous period.\" What happened in the end? The first three accepted what they considered unacceptable.  I urge all of us to be consistent, and therefore to stand firm if the proposal that the Council will put forward after the extraordinary summit does not meet our criteria. We must not be afraid to go to conflict. There is agreement only when both agree.

I do not want to make a speech listing the priorities. How can we disagree with the objectives or most of the objectives that have been set? The speeches we listen to and make are a fight against climate change. There's no one who disagrees with that, maybe we can discuss how. An intervention on innovation, an increase in resources for our young people, for researchers, I too could join a list of priorities that draw up a more beautiful, better Europe, as we all want it to be. The theme though and the knots are coming to the comb. The problems are a situation in which we have to deal with a different budget and, above all, with risks that may fall indirectly on some States, unlike others. It is clear that we are heading straight for a debate which will inevitably bring back the risk that, in order to guarantee a large part of the policies to which reference has been made as a Commission programme, we will go and cut back on certain items which are fundamental and which constitute points for this Parliament on which we cannot back down. I am thinking in particular of cohesion policy and agricultural policy. There is a lack of courage to look – as some of my fellow Members have said, and I agree – at what was the effectiveness of the previous budget. There is a lack of courage to intervene with drastic and clear cuts on certain items that have not produced any kind of result. There is a lack of a strong idea of how to develop and relaunch investment. In this sense, the debate that opened on Monday on the reform of the Stability Pact seems to me to be far removed from the rapid objectives that should also accompany the adoption of the budget.  I will close with one final thought. This morning, too, the subject of the rule of law is echoing in this House. We have who is the custodian of European values, because there is this presumption, and so we have the conviction that we can explain the criteria that stand for the rule of law and even link these values of which someone is the depositary to the possibility or not of using resources.

It is therefore not right what Mr Hahn, sitting next to you, says that you are merely an 'honest broker' in the debate between the Council and Parliament.

Otherwise it is not possible to implement the Green Deal without drastically cutting cohesion policies or the common agricultural policy, and there will be no money for innovation and investment. And we must deal not only with the slowdown in the European economy but also with the possible crisis that is coming, and we can only do this with a more ambitious budget.  And because we must speak practically, in order to achieve — the three co-legal officers — a satisfactory compromise, we must look for it on the side of what Parliament is proposing, above what the Commission is proposing, which is now obsolete, Mrs von der Leyen.

Only that we have different ways of reviewing. The European Parliament is strongly saying that, once the United Kingdom leaves, the European Union should, however, maintain and broaden its scope for action, and should maintain its level of ambition. The programme should correspond to what it was by adding new tasks for the future.  But in the Council we see a different approach. Some countries not only want to reduce the budget, but simply want to reduce their activities and reduce the scope of the European Union. He wants to return very often to the old idea of the British people, namely the renationalisation of certain policies. That's where the slogan comes from: we won't give more money. It is not just about the budget, but about the fact that the Union is simply going to be smaller in terms of its actions after Brexit.  The European Parliament definitely says 'no' to its majority. No, the Post-Brexit Union cannot give up its ambitions, because it will only prove that it cannot cope. The European Union must find a way to complement certain elements and find resources for new tasks, e.g. through own revenue.

We know the expectations of citizens in the European Union. They elected us so we could keep them. And the institutional cycle that has just begun has a fundamental challenge ahead: to regain the confidence of citizens in the European Union. In negotiating the multiannual financial framework we are faced with an exercise in which each Member State needs to get out of its national selfishness. But it is possible, as we have almost always shown throughout the history of the European Union, to make national interests compatible with European interests.  An opportunity that allows the political priorities that we advocate and that we have heard, systematically repeated in the political discourse of all, or almost all, European political leaders, not to be vain words, but to reflect a real political will. Just a few examples. We want to promote investment, economic growth and job creation: we have the InvestEU programme. We want to promote cohesion and combat inequalities: we have cohesion policy. We want to generate innovation and promote the transition to digital: we have Horizon Europe and Digital Europe.  We want to promote cooperation between identity education systems in each Member State and the mobility of young people: we have the Erasmus programme. We want to tackle climate change: we have cohesion policy, the CAP and the Just Transition Mechanism.  And i could go on! But for all this we need adequate funding. The direct contribution of the Member States is not sufficient. We need to compensate and increase EU funding by using own resources without penalising citizens.

The collective challenges before us are enormous; they require quick and unparalleled efforts - we all know that here. Yet, after more than 60 years of living together, the dogma of a budget of around 1% of GDP is not in question at all. As every seven years, states scramble and lock themselves into apothecary accounts: how much will I give? How much will I get, especially? Plus 0.01% here? Certainly not. Less than 0.02% there? Oh yes, definitely! It is a fact that for some states, the quest for the Grail is the reduction of their national contribution. And this obsession is facilitated, even encouraged by our funding system. Sitting at 80% on national contributions, this current funding system is perverse. To satisfy each other, we compete with ingenuity, we introduce complexities and discounts of all kinds. The task of the President of the Council is not simple, but he has our full support, as does the Commission. To solve the squaring of the circle, only one fight: that of own resources. With its own resources, once a mark of identity, national contributions will be reduced - this is the win-win solution that the President mentioned earlier. The Union will also be strengthened, with more financial autonomy to meet the priorities of Europeans. Today, let us say, this is a serious time. Stripped of its original philosophy, our financing system is experiencing an existential crisis. Let us be clear: without reform, it risks taking away all the hopes that we have based on our Union.

Do we want to make the EU climate neutral? Do we want to combat youth unemployment and poverty? Do we want to invest more in research and digitalisation? We Greens want this, and we therefore want to judge the proposal that Mr Michel is now preparing and which will be on the table next week, precisely on the basis of this and nothing else.  Because we know that 1.0% or 1.07% is far too little. It means cuts for the EU budget and for the issues of the future. We need more joint investment in the EU in order to make the EU climate neutral, but we also need to spend the funds in a more climate-friendly way. Less for coal and industrial agriculture, more for renewable energy and climate-friendly agriculture. For us, however, the EU is not just a money machine where everyone gets something, but for us the debate is about democracy and values, and anyone who tramples our democracy underfoot must not get money from the EU budget. That is why we need a strong rule-of-law mechanism, and we are saying quite clearly that if Viktor Orban, together with others, kicks the rule-of-law mechanism, then we will not, in the end, vote in favour of the financial framework as a Parliament as a whole. No country benefits more from a strong EU than Germany, and that is why we find the position of the German Federal Government particularly petty. Germany would be much weaker without the EU. German companies export extremely much to other EU countries and benefit from investments in all member states. That is why we want the German Federal Government to commit itself to a strong EU budget. Germany invests just 87 cents per day per Citizen of Germany in the European Union.

In the Council, there are no more great voices, nor courage for that matter, to open the way to a Europe free of austerity and able to make the most of the promises of this century and to protect peoples from the dangers that lie ahead.

What they have to discuss on 20 February is what policies we want to do at European level and how we are going to finance them. And there are many reasons to make policies at European level: because the results are better if they are done at European level than at national level, that is, because Europe is more efficient; because inequalities are reduced, i.e. Europe is more supportive; or because it can only be done at European level and therefore Europe is the only solution.

Nor have you answered the question of whether we now want to transfer more competences to Brussels or whether more competences are returning to the Member States.

Because the last word on the EU budget for the next seven years lies with the European Parliament. We will only give our approval to the EU budget if our priorities are in.

Secondly, finance the new priorities of the Union, in line with the political ambition. The Commission asks for support in financing future-oriented priorities. Let me tell you what happened to the budget for research this year. The Council says research is important. What does it do? It cuts it by EUR 500 million. Parliament says research is important, but we increased it by EUR 700 million. We need to put our money where our statements are, and we should not play farmers against Erasmus students. We should not play researchers against the security of the European Union.

Net payers generally benefit very heavily from the share of the common market. Germany, for example, pays EUR 27 billion in contributions per year and the benefits of the common market amount to as much as EUR 210 billion per year.

Discussions on the next MFF, over many months, have underlined how passionate we are about the positive impact of policies on our citizens. We don’t agree on all the details, but we see a lot of consensus on our shared priorities. The budget is the policy cast in numbers and it needs to be big enough to meet our ambitions. Yet compromise is needed and, as President Ursula von der Leyen has made clear, time has run out. Next week it is crucial that an agreement is reached. We all want to see an ambitious budget, but we cannot ignore the reality that filling the gap of now being a Union of 27 comes with its challenges.  This is why I would urge you to aim for a budget that can deliver as of day one. This is why it is important to continue working on the sectoral proposals. Moreover, we should also work together towards a better outcome for a budget that is able to deliver on our common Strategic Agenda for Europe by focusing on, first, equipping ourselves with the means to deliver the Green Deal for climate neutrality, and, second, ensuring new own resources are created, for example plastics and ETS to help finance European public goods. We also look forward to a constructive and productive discussion at the European Council on 20 February and an outcome that’s good for Europe. The Union cannot deliver on its ambitions when cuts are in areas where European citizens expect us to do more. Many of you have mentioned examples – climate, borders, digital, Erasmus, defence, you name it – and therefore the Finnish negobox is not yet the finish. Why the urgency? We are already very late, as several speakers have said, even later than 2013, where that delay led to a lost year for many programmes. I am talking about 2014.  Our focus must be on making sure that all the new programmes are up and running by 1 January 2021. Let’s avoid delays, let’s be positive and let’s stay united. We owe this to ourselves and to our institutions, but, most importantly, to our citizens, who expect results. The Commission remains committed to a continuous dialogue and to engage fully to support the forthcoming negotiations. By the way, regarding the negotiations, I have been asked in the past couple of days and even today by many people if I believe that it is possible or likely to strike a deal next week, meaning that, according to tradition, it is unlikely that only one meeting will be sufficient to get the deal. But I think it’s time to break with this tradition and to work for a deal struck in one meeting. I have been travelling to many Member States, participating in many meetings and conferences during the past couple of weeks, and I believe there can be a consensus amongst Member States, even already next week, provided there is some goodwill and energy and – may I say and this is very important – that, in particular, bigger, leading Member States become more active and work for a deal. In that respect, I urge all of you to use your contacts and your networks to put some pressure on the European leaders, your party leaders and your party friends in order to work for a deal which, finally, is in the interest of all of us and enables us to enter into negotiations with the European Parliament.

Social programmes providing for assistance to children at risk of poverty, combating youth unemployment, research and innovation, digital transformation and environmental and climate change investments (European Green Deal) are particularly important in this respect. Adequate funding should also be maintained in the field of cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy.  A key element of the ongoing negotiations on the 2021-2027 MFF is also the reform of the EU's own resources system providing for the establishment of additional sources of union revenue. Currently, the lion's share of the Union budget (around 70%) are contributions paid by Member States; consequently, their final amount is always the subject of difficult intergovernmental negotiations.

The Commission's original proposal, which had moderately reduced the share of agriculture and regional aid and increased resources for research, education and security, provides a good framework for further negotiations.  Unfortunately, the Council proposal prepared by the Finnish Presidency does not reflect the position of either the Commission or the EUROPEAN Parliament. Firstly, the framework is too tight, 1.07% of gross national income. In addition, funding has been reduced from exactly where future needs are: security, digitalisation and the fight against climate change.  The notch in the EU budget caused by Brexit is, of course, considerable. Part of it must be covered by increasing member states' funding, others by savings, but the share of own resources must also be strengthened in the future. In addition to agricultural and regional policy, the new budget must be able to meet the challenges of the future: industrial renewal and sustainable growth, in particular innovation, digitalisation, support for SME growth and education, and, to a large extent, security policy.  Personally, I would like to highlight in particular the two 2021-27 programmes in which I have held positions of responsibility in Parliament. Firstly, the Connecting Europe (CEF), which finances cross-border transport, energy and digital infrastructure: as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Youth, Research and Energy, I find it scandalous that the Council is proposing cuts to the programme, while both Europe's competitiveness, a functioning internal market and the fight against climate change require fast, modern links. Secondly, the research programme Horizon, in which I was the responsibility of the Committee on Transport: investment in European science, research and innovation is needed to strengthen the competitiveness of industry and to meet global challenges.

It has public health implications, but most importantly of all it is an animal cruelty issue, it is an animal welfare issue, and the Commission itself must ensure that the internal market governs these particular farms to ensure that there are standards of decency in them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 175, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Clare DALY", "mepid": "197731", "text": "   – Madam President, I am absolutely delighted to be able to support this motion and to really welcome the initiative taken to address the illegal pet trade, which is a phenomenal problem in Ireland, actually, where a number of individuals have been finally brought to court for treating animals so appallingly and for their own private profit.

We need to consider the lives of the pets too. There are many dogs and cats that are abandoned when humans do not want them anymore.

I guess that digital technologies provide us with a big opportunity of possibilities at our fingertips and never before have people had so many opportunities to learn, to communicate, to participate or to create. Unfortunately, a lot of Europeans still lack the necessary digital understanding and skills in order to fully embrace the opportunities of the digital revolution.  Yesterday, we celebrated the Safer Internet Day, but one day a year might not be enough to stress the importance of media competence and safety. European education systems, therefore, must be modernised across Europe to prevent a digital divide in society. I would like to thank, in particular, the Finnish Presidency at that time for providing European citizens with free access to online courses on artificial intelligence (AI). AI can have enormous benefits for people and society, but we have to put humans – and this is important for us – in first place.  Employment and social policies must keep pace with the digitalisation of our labour markets. We need a social contract for the new world including minimum wages, strengthening collective bargaining and, in particular, the right to disconnect. We need, also, to create fair working conditions for workers, no matter whether offline or online. And we have to tackle the tech giants, their abusive market—dominant power and create a level playing field and taxes should be paid where profits are generated.  The European Union to needs to have a new legal framework on artificial intelligence and robotics, including a guarantee for upholding fundamental rights. The EU Commission will present the White Paper on AI next week. It should tackle this ethical aspect of AI, legal safeguards and liability. The algorithms must be free of bias. AI must not discriminate on the grounds of gender or ethnicity, and we say, ‘no AI without ethics’. Therefore, we urge the European Commission to come forward with a regulatory framework for this. Large sets of data are key for AI applications. They will fuel them. Cambridge Analytica and Clearview – these companies are the most prominent examples for the invasive use and abuse of their personal data. Voter manipulation and deepfakes, for example, are serious threats to our democracies.  The digital revolution is nothing new, and it has been going on for years, but we constantly need to find new answers to the new technologies. Just a reminder, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, took almost six years from the start until adoption and this shows us that artificial intelligence, surveillance and facial recognition are already rolled out across the European Union and we need to hurry up in structuring them. It is our duty as the European Parliament and representatives of the people of the European Union to make sure that nobody is left behind. The European digital agenda must be based on our European values and should offer opportunities for everyone.

It is indeed important to reflect on how the Union can, within its competences, help to ensure that an increasingly digitalised Europe remains recognisable as the social Europe we know. Our social market economy is our competitive advantage globally. We need to defend it but also to adapt it to the changing world. Digitalisation is a broad and cross-cutting transformation process which presents opportunities and risks. It can be an engine for innovation and the creation of new quality jobs. It can increase labour productivity. It can enhance the well—being of workers, thereby also contributing to the reconciliation of work and private life. It can also offer new opportunities to people from vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities. As with any change, however, there are also risks which we need to be aware of. The EU stands at the forefront in efforts to ensure that technological developments result in social equitable benefits and in protecting those at risk of falling behind. EU Member States played an important role in the 2019 ILO Declaration on the Future of Work, which they promptly endorsed and promoted. Today I would like to address three aspects related to digitalisation, which we can already see will have a significant impact on our lives: first, required skills; second, the platform economy; and third, the broader social impact of digitalisation. On skills: the impact of digitalisation on the labour market is twofold. First, it increases the demand for highly-skilled workers and other workers with the right skills. Second, certain jobs change significantly or even disappear. This risks increasing structural unemployment, creating new inequalities and leading to the polarisation of the labour market due to a loss of intermediate-level jobs. We already observe a skills mismatch today with the skills shortage, notably in ICT but also in related fields like engineering, mathematics, science and technology. In these fields, we also observe a high gender imbalance. This is likely to get worse if we do not react. To face this, we need to take into account the impact of the digital revolution over the whole human life cycle, from early childhood to old age. No one should be left behind, and well-being is an important factor in this regard. Both women and men are needed to fill the shortage in ICT skills across all occupations and sectors. Education and training systems should systematically prevent and combat stereotypes and discrimination. Collaboration between all stakeholders is vital for the successful management of tomorrow’s job requirements. The social partners play a crucial role in this process, helping to maintain the adaptability of the labour force. Regarding the platform economy, we all struggle to clearly define what is meant by this widely-encompassing term. Digital platforms bring service providers and their customers into direct contact. Many platforms work with people who are formally self—employed but who depend economically and organisationally on the platform. This form of organisation often has a negative impact on the level of pay, social protection, occupational health and safety, the right to paid leave, and other aspects. Effective social dialogue at all levels and a balance in the bargaining power is indispensable for securing a fair and equitable future of work, but it is difficult for platform workers to organise their presentations, as they often do not know each other. The Council has already addressed a number of issues related to new forms of work. Decent working conditions must be ensured for all, regardless of changes in employment patterns and, where necessary, by adapting the national legislative frameworks. At Union level, a first step has been made with the Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions adopted in June last year, which notably protects on—demand workers. The Recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self—employed, adopted by the Council in December, makes explicit reference to platform workers. It recommends that Member States provide access to social protection for all, including the self—employed. The Council also highlighted that social protection policies should be balanced with making work pay policies. In this regard, it is important that people in a non—standard employment relationship can also benefit from collective bargaining. On a number of occasions, the Council has made it clear that workers in new forms of work should also be adequately protected in terms of occupational health and safety, irrespective of the size of the enterprise or the type and duration of the employment relationship. The Council also stressed the need to ensure an effective implementation and enforcement of EU law on working conditions and health and safety, including for new forms of work. A better understanding of platform work is a prerequisite for defining further policy responses. In this respect, we look forward to the platform work summit organised jointly by the future German Presidency and the Commission in October 2020. Thirdly, and finally, regarding the social impact, changes related to digitalisation have different impacts on different actors. On one hand, people can organise their work more flexibly and, on the other hand, face—to—face interactions decrease and constant connectivity means that people can never truly disconnect. New job opportunities can be created, for example for rural populations or people with disabilities. Working people have access to better tools to perform their jobs more efficiently. At the same time, employers are provided with better tools to monitor and optimise output efficiency. To conclude, technological development is inevitable and should be embraced. Fostering the development of new technologies will give us more control over the direction it takes, to make it more ethical and human-centred.

La question de l’emploi est sûrement au centre des interrogations. Combien d’emplois vont disparaître, remplacés par des robots? Ce qui est d’ores et déjà certain, c’est que la majorité des emplois vont être transformés. De nouveaux emplois vont apparaître quand d’autres disparaîtront ou connaîtront de profonds bouleversements. Il est prévu que l’intelligence artificielle et la robotique créeront à elles seules près de 60 millions d’emplois dans le monde au cours des cinq prochaines années et déjà aujourd’hui, cela a été mentionné, près d’un million d’emplois TIC sont vacants, faute de candidats ayant les bonnes qualifications. C’est d’ailleurs le principal souci de nombreuses entreprises, surtout de PME, qui ne trouvent pas de personnel qualifié. C’est aussi un défi majeur pour nos politiques de l’emploi et de qualification.  We have acted on the green transition by launching the Just Transition Fund for regions and people most affected by these changes. Likewise, we need to strengthen much more our employment and social policies to anticipate and manage the disruptive changes expected from digitalisation. There are – and it has been already mentioned – a lot of very good opportunities, but there are also risks of widening inequalities and more precariousness. Over 90% of jobs now require some level of digital skills, as does participation in society at large, yet 43% of the EU population have an insufficient level of digital skills and 17% have none at all. Next month we will propose a new skills agenda to address the skills challenges through concrete instruments and this challenge is huge because, according to a lot of forecasts, about half of the European workforce, meaning more than 120 million people have to be re—skilled or upskilled. So, we have three major aims. The first one is engaging employers to upscale their training provision, and for that purpose, we want to launch a skills pact committing companies, committing the business community to invest in their workforce. Second, we have to step up public and private investment in training according to this need I just mentioned. And third, we have to empower people to invest in their own skills and qualifications. Many of our initiatives post 2020 will address these challenges linked to digitalisation. The European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) will support projects, such as the creation of e—schools with digitally trained teachers or training unemployed people for ICT jobs. And I’m working on a reinforced Youth Guarantee to provide a much stronger coverage of digital skills. Non—standard forms of work are on the rise, and come with flexible but also very often with inadequate working conditions, insufficient access to social protection, decreased coverage by social dialogue and absence of a right to collective representation. This challenges our labour laws and social protection systems and calls for a rethink of existing models to match the needs of old and new work arrangements and ensure decent working conditions, inclusion and high level of social protection. The digitalisation is changing notions of work of employer—employee relationships and of workplaces and it is absolutely indispensable that we create some clarity in this new world of work. New technologies also blur the lines between work and private life. This creates new physical and mental health risks and, therefore, the right to disconnect has to be dealt with. The use of data in employment has led to new algorithm—based management and an increased profiling in social protection provision. These can improve productivity but also increase control on individuals and surveillance of workers’ performance. It raises questions of protection of personal data; we should pay attention to this in the context of the regulation of artificial intelligence. We need accessible and interoperable digital technologies in order to exploit the potential of digitalisation to increase the autonomy of persons with disabilities and to boost their participation in society and the economy. The digital transformation must also be an opportunity in the context of the demographic challenges we face in particular in relation to our aging population and the existing rural and remote areas. We also should devote special attention to the gender gap that exists in the digital world. Europe has to be a competitive and innovative player in the digital economy. New initiatives on the Digital Services Act and artificial intelligence will play a key role, while also addressing risks of bias and discrimination. On 22 September I’m organising together with Executive Vice—President Vestager, a summit on platform work where we discuss how to improve working and social conditions on online platforms. Beyond this, we have launched the process leading to an action plan on the European Pillar of Social Rights, because the principles of the pillar should also apply fully to the new digital world of work. The pillar frames our social strategy to make sure that the transition towards a digital and climate—neutral society is socially fair and sustainable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 187, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Dennis RADTKE", "mepid": "188945", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which First of all, I would like to thank Mr Ertug for putting the issue on the agenda here today, and thus, so to speak, to reconnect the social dimension and the discussion we are having here on social Europe with this important issue, digitisation. Thank you very much for that. I share much of what has already been said here. In the discussions that we still have to have, we must not overlook the fact that over the last 20 years we have seen fundamental upheavals in the world of work within the European Union: on the one hand, employment relationships that have changed completely – namely on-demand work, but also crowd workers and click workers – but on the other hand, we now have a very different way of working in many places. We all have these devices in our pockets, and we all know how difficult it is when you have such devices in your pocket, to have some work day and to be able to switch off at some point. It is very important to me, in the discussions that we are now having, that, on the one hand, we assess the opportunities, but also the risks, in a very sober and objective manner, and look at where we need to intervene and where we need to support them.

It must be accompanied by concrete action for a bold objective to transform the EU into a champion of innovation in digital. Alas, we are lagging behind. We cannot do this when almost one out of five EU citizens had no digital skills in 2017 and the situation is no different now.  Digital literacy and skills are key pillars of adapting European citizens to a labour market that is constantly transforming and changing our work arrangements. This is the priority, the key priority of today and tomorrow. We need to answer the daily concerns of European citizens by providing them ways of adapting to the new challenges and opportunities to develop new skills and access to the labour market. The question is how, and the best way we can do this is by literally investing in people this time. We need investments that can bring together expertise and capital from the public, private and non-profit sectors together in order to ensure the digital transformation that we want to put forward is paving the way for all citizens to achieve a high level of well-being and overcome inequalities of technological use at EU level.

First of all, one of the most visible consequences of digitisation in the social and employment field, as we have said, is the emergence of new forms of work, particularly through the development of platforms. In practice, these platforms cover very different realities, which can make our task as legislators more complex. We must strike the right balance between the opportunity of new employment opportunities and the protection of these workers, avoiding them a possible precariousness.  In this regard, I think it is my priority to guarantee them decent working conditions, as well as access to social protection - in the event of illness or accident at work. I have no doubt, Commissioner, that you will do so with determination. We must also allow these workers to organize collectively to defend their interests. Finally, ensuring training opportunities is essential to ensure the quality of service delivery and individual career prospects.  The second point I would like to emphasise is the very poor positioning of the European Union in terms of digital skills, since 40% of our workforce currently has little or no digital skills. It seems to me that it is time to update our training software. Let's invest heavily in digital skills!

It is worth noting that older people have great potential to offer, both in the form of knowledge, professional and life experience, civic engagement.

Therefore, when planning the development of a digital Europe, account should be taken of the fact that new technological solutions do not contribute to the exclusion of older people, the reduction of their employability, their independence.  Services, including banking, must be more consumer-friendly and not limited to people who use mobile applications efficiently. New technologies and artificial intelligence can and should aim at levelling the playing field and offsetting age-related deficits or disabilities.

The first months since the start of the Commission mandate I have had the opportunity to meet many of you already. All the exchanges we have had have confirmed that all of us, together, have so much work to do in this area of policy. I am grateful for the support you have shown me and this Commission on many occasions. The European Union and its citizens need your full support in making Europe an equal place for women and men in all their diversity. Gender equality is a founding principle of the European Union. Europe is a good place to live for many, but it would be an understatement to say that we are still not there yet when it comes to gender equality. Women are still being underpaid compared to men. One in three women in the EU have experienced physical or sexual violence, or both since the age of 15 – and that’s millions of women. We cannot accept these appalling inequalities. President von der Leyen, Vice-President Jourová, and the whole College support me and this fight for equality. Gender equality is a key theme in the mandate of this Commission and the first key milestone will be the launch of the Gender Equality Strategy. The adoption is foreseen for the week of International Women’s Day in early March. The strategy will underpin the political commitment to gender equality and support strategic and systematic work for gender equality in the Union and beyond. We are aiming at an ambitious strategy. In the context of a visible and organised movement opposing progress in women’s rights and gender equality which has emerged in recent years in Europe and internationally, it is more important now than ever to restate in the strongest of terms the Commission’s continuing commitment to gender equality. There has been a wide consultation on the strategy, including a public consultation that gathered more than 1 300 responses. As gender equality is a cross-cutting issue, the strategy will strengthen the Commission’s dual approach of gender mainstreaming combined with targeted actions on specific topics. We aim to introduce a more systematic approach at an early stage of policy design to include a gender perspective in all EU policy areas. As regards content, we intend to present a positive future-oriented vision for a gender equal Europe – a Europe where women and men, girls and boys, in all their diversity, are free from gender-based violence and gender stereotypes, where they have the opportunity to thrive in the labour market, lead our businesses, politics and participate equally in all sectors. Important horizontal considerations that will be emphasised in the strategy are challenging gender stereotypes and intersectionality. In terms of topics, the strategy will address the priorities highlighted in the President’s political guidelines – increasing women’s economic-empowerment by closing the gender pay gap, including by introducing binding pay-transparency measures, getting better gender balance on company boards and improving parents’ and carers’ work-life balance. We also continue our efforts to combat violence against women. EU accession to the Istanbul Convention therefore remains a priority. If EU accession remains blocked in the Council, despite our joint efforts, we will table legislative proposals to strengthen the Victims’ Rights Directive and include or add specific forms of gender-based violence to the list of EU crimes. We shall also address other important and emerging aspects of gender equality, such as online violence against women or the gender perspective in digitalisation, including an artificial intelligence to avoid bias. Together with the adoption of the strategy, we will launch a wide-ranging and inclusive consultation process on binding pay transparency measures which we aim to table by the end of the year. I am aware that introducing binding pay-transparency measures can be challenging, and I want to find the right balance for such EU intervention, taking into account the interests of employers, employees and national administrations. I look forward to hearing your views and discussing with you. I sincerely hope to get your support so we, as the EU, can make the so much needed leap towards a gender equal Europe in a more gender equal world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 230, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Cindy FRANSSEN", "mepid": "197455", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the entire Commission for putting gender equality so high on the European agenda. Gender equality is one of the fundamental values on which this European Union is founded. Well, a score of 67.4 on the latest European gender index shows that we are far from there. We therefore call for an ambitious strategy that makes strong progress. Women's talents are still an underused source of expertise, creativity and changing power. A comprehensive gender strategy streamlines policy around three main axes: creating opportunities for women, keeping women on board in a rapidly evolving world – we are thinking of digitisation, migration and climate change, and we also need to take into account the new forms of work such as platform workers. And thirdly, pay attention to the vulnerable position of women.  That is why we need to tinker with this new gender strategy that will set out the lines for a gender-equal Europe in the coming years. This means, in concrete terms, eliminating the gender pay gap and the gender pension gap. Strengthening women economically and eliminating poverty. Promoting female entrepreneurship, combating violence against women, breaking gender stereotypes and further implementing the social pillar, in particular the work-life balance directive.

I would just like to say to the previous speaker that women are not weaker, but are weakened – by systems, by rules, by traditions. They are being weakened, we are not weaker. But this weakening comes from outside. If we now look at the strategy that we hope will now be reintroduced into Europe after five years of abstinence, then we have very clear demands: we want a new, independent, ambitious strategy. We want a strategy with a clear action plan. We want to see clear progress. We do not want to see any regression and, above all, we do not want attacks on women's rights. We want to focus on equal opportunities and put an end to all forms of discrimination.

We want it in foreign trade, in tax policy, in digital policy, in environmental policy, in the budget, in research, in agriculture and so on and so on.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your commitment and energy in carrying out this equality strategy. It's time. In the face of the great upheavals facing the world and the European Union, it is high time that equality between men and women was a reality. Equality before health, first of all. In my country, abortion was legalized in 1974. However, in 2020, there are still women and men in the European Union who do not have equal, free, caring access to abortion and, of course, sex education. Because yes, the right to abortion is a health issue and all European citizens should be equal when it comes to health. Violations of sexual and reproductive health rights are violations of women's rights, they are violations of human rights, they are unacceptable violence against which we must fight mercilessly.  Equality in the face of violence, let's talk about it! We must eradicate them, starting with economic and financial violence. If yesterday we celebrated the women and girls of science, our financial reality, it is an unacceptable wage gap between men and women in the workplace, which is getting worse in retirement. This is absolutely unacceptable. Equal work, equal pay! Men, women, regardless of background, disabilities, convictions: equal work, equal pay. It is unacceptable for women to see their retirement handicapped by the fact that they are carrying children. The only human being who has won two Nobel Prizes is a woman. It is unacceptable that women are under-represented in STEM sectors. We need a career equality, equal access to power. This strategy, as you have said, must be concrete, mandatory. We have examples in the European Union that do not hinder the performance of companies.  Physical violence must also be combated. Is the Istanbul Convention blocked? Never mind, let's develop alternative solutions. The Council will unlock it. This does not prevent the establishment of a directive that cuts all forms of violence and harmonizes the definitions of different forms of violence, adopting an intersectional approach.

Why not encourage men to be men and encourage women to be women? Injustice in the workplace, which favours either women or men, should not be addressed by nation states and companies? But no, it must be the dictates of the EU's central office. Let families decide for themselves who does the washing-up, who raises children, brings the money home. I am anxiously awaiting the day when the Commission presents an action plan to distribute breastfeeding babies more fairly between father and mother. Why are women being told that they are only worth something if they go to work? This is an incredible reduction and discrimination against all those women who deliberately choose to do family work. But no, you are determined to force women into the world of work. It is interesting, however, that women's quotas are only called in the executive floors. Where is the quota of women among bricklayers, truck drivers or sewer workers? Finally stop making people mere objects of their social experiments. Stop wanting to re-educate people. Stop adapting people to their delusional notions of society.

And there is still a gap between men's and women's pay of 16%. Not to mention violence against women.  The social change that women need in order to be able to see their rights fully guaranteed concerns all of us, women and men. If we men do not change our roles, both in the public sphere and in the business world and in the family sphere, it will be impossible for women to get rid of situations where their rights are violated so often. Changing roles, I say this from personal experience.

It’s long overdue, and maybe we could suggest that it has the title: ‘We only waited 63 – I repeat 63 – years for the EU to make a proposal on the question of pay equality’. I think that would serve the purpose.  The second issue that I believe is absolutely crucial – and colleagues have said this – is to have a directive against gender-based violence. The accession to the Istanbul Convention is not enough. The backlash against women’s rights is getting stronger across the European Union, and we need to have a clear position to stand up to that. I really believe that, with Trump in the US, with Putin in Russia and with Bolsonaro in Brazil, the European Union, despite the problems that we have in this union, is still the beacon of hope and freedom for feminists around the world.

I want to make sure that the Work-life Balance Directive is implemented in the Member States to help women and men reconcile work and caring responsibilities. Also, I want all major EU policy initiatives to be assessed from a gender lens.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her We are celebrating the 25th anniversary of a document that summarises and defines women's rights in a comprehensive and clear way than ever before. The Beijing Declaration, adopted at the 4th World Conference on Women in Beijing, is still one of the most progressive, one of the most comprehensive and clearly formulated documents on women's rights that exist. All areas of life are covered, full equality between women and men is intended – whether young or old, rich or poor, women living in peace, women living in war, public and private life – comprehensively and progressively declared in 1995 all participating governments: \"We recognize women's rights as human rights.\" We have a 25-year-old Magna Carta of Women, which makes all women's rights human rights human rights and puts women on an equal footing with men in all areas of life. The declaration contains comprehensive instructions for action to all governments, NGOs and includes all other multi-level stakeholders in the proposals for action. 189 governments have committed themselves to co-existing, implementing, realizing women's rights in the world, and since then progress has been reviewed every five years. What I would like to emphasise in particular about the declaration is that we are consistently talking about the equality of women in power. \"Power equality\" - what a modern wording. That full and explicit recognition and affirmation of the right of all women to determine all aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is a fundamental condition of their equality of power; that access to economic resources, land, credit, science and technology, vocational training, information, communication and markets should be fully and equally granted – so I quote from this. Twenty-five years after its adoption, however, a bad verdict must be made. No country has achieved full equality for women. No country – not even the states of the European Union – can guarantee women's self-determination over their bodies. We in the European Union are stuck when it comes to joint action on equality for women, and we must not boast of being a good region. The Gender Balance on Boards directive, which aims to empower women in decision-making posts, has been blocked for eight years. This year it should have been fully implemented throughout Europe. We do not have complete equality in access to goods and services. There is still discrimination and areas such as advertising are excluded. We clearly have Europe-wide discrimination in terms of merit. Even after adjusted figures, we see that the pay gap is still wide. 500 000 young women, half a million women and girls, are victims of female genital mutilation – not somewhere outside, but within Europe. These examples, these figures, are shameful for Europe and most governments. I am right to criticise the Council for providing equal support and positive support to governments, which are obliged to represent half of their population, namely their citizens, on an equal footing, until full equality is achieved. Traditional, cultural, religious machism continues to prevent, and more than ever, the dismantling of patriarchal power structures and places women as less valuable than men. That is why we must fight as a guarantor of women's rights as human rights, particularly at European level. That is why we must not allow regression within the EU to take place in individual Member States or as a common global player in the rest of the world. I remind you. It is about half the population! Do not deny the human rights of women! We know that the 1995 Beijing Declaration does not bind governments, but we women in this world have a document in our hands that gives international legitimacy. We will not let go, we will fight for real progress. The document must now be brought to life. The United Nations is now fully behind taking action. But the UN needs the cooperation of governments. It sets up action coalitions, commitment – Mexico and Paris I would like to mention – and tighter controls on progress and implementation are needed. I therefore call on the honourable Members to support my two amendments on action coalitions in the vote that accompanies the question tomorrow. We in the European Parliament want a strong participation and multilateral action. The United Nations thrives on cooperation, common will, joint action. As the European Union, we must make a full commitment to this – together and in diversity.

I shall also touch on the question of gender equality more broadly. 2020 is a pivotal year for the realisation of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls everywhere. It will also be the year of a series of milestone anniversaries relevant to gender equality. We will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security; the fifth anniversary of the sustainable development goals; and not least, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Gender equality matters to all our citizens. It is not just a women’s issue but a social issue and also an economic issue: allowing everyone an equal chance to contribute brings significant benefits in terms of our economic strength. The upcoming session of the Commission on the Status of Women will be dedicated to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. At the next session of the Commission on the Status of Women, we should identify gaps in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and reconfirm the full validity of the commitments undertaken 25 years ago. We should re-energise international efforts towards gender equality, the full enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls and their empowerment. The UN Secretary-General highlighted that process and progress in many areas is lagging behind. This is in particular the case concerning the exposure of women and girls to extreme poverty and violence against women and girls. We also continue to have a gender gap in labour force participation and under-representation in decision-making and a leadership role across all sectors. The EU will set the bar high in all these areas. They should be backed up by substantial financial resources.  When it comes to the negotiation of the political declaration, the EU will demonstrate its strong leadership role on gender equality. The EU’s agreed position is rooted in the EU’s legal and policy framework and is intended to guide our negotiators in New York. Some of the most critical issues include the following: equality and non-discrimination, sexual and gender-based violence, family and family oriented policies, health, education, social protection, decent work, sexual and reproductive health and rights as per the new European consensus on development, and desegregated data collection. Furthermore, the position paper also includes guiding principles on climate change and information and communication technology. The EU will make every effort to ensure that past achievements are safeguarded and that further progress is achieved on the road to full equality among women and men.  The EU will also strive for a political declaration which recognises women civil society organisations and women human rights defenders. They play a critical role in the promotion, protection and fulfilment of the human rights of all women and girls. The EU will therefore pledge to continue supporting civil society and ensuring a safe and enabling environment for them to operate effectively at local, national, regional and global levels.  As to the EU’s political statement at the opening session, we are convinced that the European Parliament and the Council share the same values and interests and the same priorities. We therefore look forward to hearing your suggestions today.  President, honourable Members, on the issue of gender equality more broadly, you rightly underlined in your question for today’s debate that gender equality is not a separate domain, but one that cuts across the whole of society and the economy. Progress in this field, therefore, requires the integration of gender equality goals into all relevant strategies and policy goals. In other words, we need gender mainstreaming as well as specific actions. Precisely in this spirit, in its conclusions from December last year, the Council called on the new Commission to adopt a stand-alone, high-level EU gender equality strategy and I’m delighted that the Commission has undertaken to do just that. The Council, furthermore, called for an effective and systematic implementation of gender mainstreaming in all policy areas. The Council also called on the Commission and the Member States to pursue a stronger focus on gender equality within the different phases of the European Semester process.  Finally, a few words about the Council’s work programme in the months to come. We of course look forward to the initiatives that the Commission has announced, such as measures relating to pay transparency. Meanwhile, as you are aware, gender equality and non-discrimination is one of the priorities of the Croatian Presidency. We intend to table a set of Council conclusions on the impact of long-term care on work-life balance, as we all know women perform a far greater share of informal care work than men and this limits their ability to participate in the labour market. On 30 January the Croatian Presidency organised a high-level conference on the topic: Participation of women on the labour market – Benefit for society! It’s results will be discussed within the UN Commission on the Status of Women. While a lot has been done, there is still a long way to go in order to achieve full equality both within the EU and especially beyond its borders.

Thank you for including the preparation of the UN’s 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in today’s agenda. This is very good timing. The negotiations on the political declaration and the preparation of the EU statements are ongoing, and the aim is that the CSW will start with a strong and action-oriented political declaration focused on the implementation of the existing commitments. At the same time, we are preparing our side events, which will be melting—pots for good practices and new ideas on how to take the Beijing Agenda forward. This is the strength of the CSW – a place to meet and discuss gender-equality which many actors in the field.  The session will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We also celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and the 5th anniversary of the Sustainable Development Goals. Gender-equality and the empowerment of women and girls is not only a question of justice. It also makes economic sense to ensure that women and men, girls and boys, reach their full potential.  I have read with great interest the report of the UN Secretary-General on the state of play with regard to the situation of women and girls in the world. It is a good, nuanced report based on 167 national reviews and regional review meetings, which took place in various regions across the globe.  While we have seen some progress, we have not advanced as much as we wanted to. Female labour market participation was increasing, but has stagnated over the last five years. Women still carry out a disproportionate share of household work and care. Women’s and girls’ voices and participation are far from being on an equal footing to those of boys and men.  Women are 25% more likely to live in poverty. Gender stereotypes still determine the paths of women and girls. Gender-based violence is a recurrent issue. Next to this, new issues are emerging like climate-change and digital technologies. We must turn these changes into opportunities. Digitalisation can open doors for women and girls, but can also be misused to silence them. As the UN Secretary-General highlighted, gender-equality and empowerment of women and girls is crucial to an economically uncertain world with increasing polarisation, environmental threats and conflict. The unequal distribution of power, resources and opportunities perpetuates gender-inequalities. I welcome very much the input of the European Parliament, including your forthcoming resolution on this topic, and the Parliament’s presence during this CSW. Gender-equality is a priority for the European Commission, both in our internal and external relations and actions. The Commission will present a new gender-equality strategy in March, and still in 2020, launch the third action plan on gender-equality and women’s empowerment in external relations. A stronger, ambitious and holistic approach will address the issues identified globally and for the EU. Our approach will be based on gender—mainstreaming in all policy areas. The task force on equality, with members drawn from all the Commission’s services and the European External Action Service, will be fundamental for this. Next to this, targeted actions on specific gender—equality issues will continue. We will continue to tackle the gender pay—gap and introduce pay transparency measures. We will continue to develop measures to end gender-based violence. We will continue to push for gender-balanced company boards.  I am looking forward to hearing your views and discussing these ideas. Thank you again for putting the CSW on today’s agenda.

These are actually a very clear outline of the priorities that we should be presenting at the UN Conference. The language is right, the words are right, and we can do our best to bring forward what you’ve heard here today. The priorities that people across this Parliament have outlined: these are the priorities, clearly, that we have to bring to the UN. What’s very clear is that progress has been made, but there are the most extraordinarily serious issues still affecting women around the world. We also have to note that, after the Nairobi Conference on Population and Development, the USA did not sign the statement or the priorities at the end of that conference, and that is very serious. This is, as you said, the 25th anniversary of Hillary Clinton’s famous line: ‘women’s rights are human rights, and human rights are women’s rights’. Hard to believe that it actually needed to be said, but it did, and it accelerated change. There is much more to do. It is a very important year. It’s about acceleration; it’s about implementation; it’s about targets, and it’s also about monitoring. It’s also about budgets, and that has to be a particularly important element of the debates in the UN this year. Also, of course, we do have to watch out for attitudes that are still far too prevalent, where we see everyday sexism. That’s very important to address as well, in terms of the perception of women, the reporting on women, and so on. That is critical.

We should not take these rights for granted, and we should not take our democratic European society for granted. Women’s rights continue to be heavily challenged, and there are recent trends of an organised backlash against women. We must not yield, but evermore show our commitment and use our voices to create a more social Europe – an inclusive Europe where all have the same equal opportunities, including women.  This motion for a resolution is our commitment to the visionary worldwide agenda of the United Nations for the empowerment of women. As representatives of our European citizens, we know that it is important to put into action our commitment for Agenda 2030. Women need to be on board for everything, gender equality is necessary for sustainable development, and 2020 is the year for the rapid realisation of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. I welcome the Gender—Equality Strategy by Commissioner Dalli, which is due this March.

My God – how presumptuous, ridiculous and sexist it is to say that without the EU, women would not be able to move forward in life! Those who want to strengthen women's rights should ensure, through effective border protection, that women do not become free game for imported groups of men in Europe.

Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, we are presenting a motion for a Resolution in which we make a number of recommendations which we consider to be priorities for women in the European Union. But the truth is that, so far, they have not been very encouraged by gender perspective and feminism. The Council is the body in which the most important initiatives for women have been curbed. For example, it turns out that we have an anti-discrimination directive which has been blocked in the Council for ten years. Are you going to do something? The EIGE recently told us that we were moving towards equality at a tortoise's pace and in a clearly uneven way. It also turns out that the European Union has not ratified the Istanbul Convention thanks to the boycott of a number of States in the Council – the axis of Visegrad and its circle of influence and collusion – and thanks to the same religious lobbies that have supported anti-election campaigns in all parts of the world. Each other bent on treating women as incubators and breeding machines, slaves of their partners or their governments. They have managed to prevent sexual and reproductive rights in the Union, although this Parliament acknowledged that the denial of sexual and reproductive health and related rights services is a form of violence against women, in line, by the way, with the European Court of Human Rights. They are the ones who want to eliminate equal education in schools, and those who criminalize the LGTBIQ collective. Let us not forget that Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia are now leading a brutal resistance against the so-called 'gender ideology'. Nor has the European Union adopted a Directive on gender-based violence, because for some States and political groups sitting in this House this violence does not even exist.

Precisely because of social exclusion, lack of education, appalling conditions in which they live, the experience of health care is often silent. In my country, Slovakia, many Roma women from poor settlements do not share hospital rooms with other women. They are placed in separate rooms. Many times women have to endure humiliation, neglected care or uncomfortable access by staff. In the past, many Roma women have been forcibly sterilised without their own consent. In 2016, the UN Human Rights Committee asked the Slovak Government to set up an independent investigative body and ensure compensation for involuntarily sterilised women.

Our citizens consider security one of their top concerns and expect the EU to deliver. Security and freedom go hand in hand, so we need to create a safe space for all Europeans. Being safe is indispensable to live, enjoy rights, work, study and it is also indispensable for the economy. Every person present in Europe has the individual right to be safe. The 2019 Eurobarometer on attitudes towards cybersecurity published recently shows, however, that two thirds of respondents are concerned about falling victim to identity theft. Moreover, a well-functioning Schengen area of free movement requires a common policy on the EU external borders. We need to effectively monitor and control persons crossing the external borders for the benefit of all of us.  The need to strengthen our internal security and our EU external borders has led to the adoption of a variety of recent legislative acts, for example, the European travel and information and authorisation system, the entry-exit system, the regulation of inter-operability between EU information systems and the new European border and Coast Guard regulation.  Today, we have another example, which is the new false and authentic documents online system: a European image database supporting Member States in the recognition of authentic and false documents. I thank both the European Parliament and the Council for your constructive work on this final compromise that ensures real added value. The new false and authentic documents online system is very useful for border guards when performing border checks. It provides information to Member States’ authorities on new forgery methods and new genuine documents in circulation. It contains thousands of descriptions of authentic documents, hundreds of descriptions of false documents, covering more than 30 participating countries, and more than 180 third countries’ international organisations. It helps to detect attempts at identity theft for purposes of irregular migration. The final political agreement will further improve the functioning of the false and authentic documents online system by transferring its management to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.  Security is a top concern for citizens. They expect the EU to deliver in this area as every citizen has the right to feel and be protected. The rise of threats posed by organised crime, terrorism and the drug market are poison to our societies. This is why the Commission has announced a new security union strategy for the second quarter of this year. As part of the strategy, on internal security, there will be a focus on three priority areas: organised crime, which would include drugs, firearms, corruption, trafficking in human beings, terrorism and radicalisation, and fighting crimes in a digital age. Strong borders to support the area of free movement, which is emblematic for our Union, will also be a key element of the new pact on migration, as announced in the political guidelines of President von der Leyen.

As a new Member of this House working on my first legislative file, I very much appreciated her lead. Now on substance. Verifying the authenticity of travel documents has been turning for quite some time into a pressure point in the work of border guards, because of time constraints, the tremendous increase in the number of travellers in Europe, and the diversity of travel documents that are being used. Furthermore, the sophistication of forgery techniques has been a constant challenge for our law enforcement officials. The new FADO system has already been in use for some time, serving these needs. What we are now doing, and this is very important, is to bring it from the intergovernmental into the Community method by adding it to the list of instruments entrusted to the EBCGA (European Border and Coast Guard Agency) as part of the enlarged mandates that we decided to give last year.  This means increased accountability towards, and scrutiny by, this House, and higher safeguards in the regime applicable to the data contained therein and the measurement of access rights. The protection of personal data was one of the main issues that we had to deal with during the negotiations of this file, and we made sure that the processing of personal data is limited to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of detecting or investigating document fraud.  We also introduced clear rules on accessing the database, with Member States now having an express obligation to determine which authorities competent in the area of document fraud are to have access to the FADO system and their level of access, and then to notify the Commission and the Agency. The Commission, upon request, will now have to transmit this information to this House. The negotiated text complements the reform of the EBCGA and will ensure better protection of the Union’s external borders and more efficient law enforcement.

So, I support the introduction and creation of such a database, I support the strengthening of the security of the Schengen area that my state will hope to enter soon, I thank my colleague Mezzola for the great work she has done with this and I call on us to continue to work on strengthening the security of the citizens of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 333, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Sunčana GLAVAK", "mepid": "202036", "text": "   – Dear Chairman, congratulations on my colleague Metsola's excellent work, greetings to Mrs. Dalla.

Let me start by assuring you that the Council, like the Parliament and the Commission, is fully committed to the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. Together, we have made substantial progress in this area, including with amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the Banking Package, the European Banking Authority Regulation and in the Criminal Law Framework. All these recent rules now need to be implemented and enforced. The speculations raised by the Luanda Leaks case are indeed alarming and damaging if confirmed. Damaging not only to the country in question, which may have been deprived of essential revenues, but also for EU banks if it turns out that not all applicable rules were followed. I understand that related investigations are being undertaken, including in Angola and Portugal, which now need to follow their course.  Last July, the Commission published, at the request of the Council, a post—mortem review of alleged money—laundering cases involving EU banks. In that report, the Commission identified concrete problems with the supervision and enforcement of any anti-money laundering rules across the European Union. And I think it is not excluded that we may now see some of these same issues repeated if, in fact, confirmed.  Looking ahead, however, in spite of the challenges and setbacks, there are also causes for more optimism. Indeed, there is a sense of urgency shared by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and more than that, I would say that there is also a shared sense of ambition in tackling the big problem that is money laundering.  This brings me to the strategic conclusions that the Council adopted last December. In these conclusions, the Council advised the Commission to look into ways to increase harmonisation in the anti-money laundering area, as well as to consider the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages of establishing an EU supervisory body.  The Council is advising on other fronts as well. For one, we still have the Anti-Money Laundering Action Plan, agreed by Ecofin in December 2018, which is running its course and which we continue to monitor.  Additionally, our Presidency has started a broader discussion on fighting serious and organised crime by tracing its proceeds more effectively. We stand at an important crossroads from where we have the opportunity to proceed towards an effective regime to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In this sense, I very much look forward to the Commission’s upcoming initiatives and proposals and I trust that the Commission will take on board any lessons learned in this last case, the Luanda Leaks, as appropriate.

We have consistently stressed that better enforcement of anti-money laundering rules across Europe and stronger supervision are essential to increase the resilience of our financial system. Beyond stability, we need to ensure the integrity of our financial system. It is not a problem of one country. The European Union should have zero tolerance for dirty money. We are willing to apply all of the tools at our disposal and to the fullest capacity. Moreover, we are ready to strengthen them. We will not hesitate to propose changes to the legislative and institutional architecture that supports our fight against money laundering, terrorist financing, as well as tax evasion and avoidance. Following up on the European Parliament’s resolution and the Ecofin conclusions of December, the Commission will adopt a new action plan on anti-money laundering that will seek to improve the enforcement of the rules. Much has been done in recent years. The fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which should have been transposed by Member States by 10 January, allows greater scrutiny of information around beneficial ownership by civil society, including by the press or civil society organisations and contributing to preserving trust in the integrity of business transactions and of the financial system. The legal framework currently in force seeks to ensure a proper balance between the need to ensure protection of privacy and of personal data and the need for more transparency in financial and economic activities. By establishing accessible registers of beneficial ownership information, the Union has achieved the gold standard worldwide in this respect. Regrettably, not all the Member States have transposed the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Today, the Commission has started infringement procedures against eight Member States which are signalling a complete lack of transposition. However, our real problem is not a lack of rules; it is that the enforcement of rules is done at national level and is uneven from country to country. Recent legislative changes to the mandate of the European supervisory authorities granted new powers to the European Banking Authority to lead, coordinate and monitor the EU Supervisor’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. This covers the entire financial sector. The Commission, however, acknowledges that more must be done. There is a need to address structural weaknesses linked to regulatory fragmentation among Member States. This is where European added value lies. The Commission intends to work towards the establishment of a unified, comprehensive anti-money laundering policy, building on existing rules and introducing all necessary improvements. There is scope for harmonising the existing rules. There is need for more information sharing between law enforcement authorities to detect and prosecute criminals and to recover assets. In addition to a more detailed and harmonised set of rules based on regulations rather than on directives, a greater role for the EU in overseeing their implementation is justified. This applies as regards both supervision and coordination of the Financial Intelligence Units. An EU supervisory body for AML is a must-have, but creating a structure should not be our aim in itself. The body, be it a new one or building on the existing one, has to have a clearly-defined scope, powers and, very importantly, efficient governance. We know that we can count on the support of the European Parliament to bring about a revamped and more efficient supervisory and enforcement architecture.

The deadline for transposition of the fifth directive was a few days ago, on 10 January. At this point have a total of five- to five! – of twenty-seven Member States, the directive has been fully implemented, fifteen only partially – Madam President-in-Office of the Council, even if you are not listening, your country is one of these fifteen – and the rest have not even informed the Commission of its implementation. I very much welcome the fact that you have today opened infringement proceedings against these Member States. If, however, that is the way in which the Member States are tackling money laundering in practice, then all the fine resolutions of the EU finance ministers are just lip service. Since the Member States do not seem to be able or willing – and are not listening now – to take effective action against money laundering, we need to think about how we can combat the problem at European level. Thank you very much, President, that you are listening now again.  After all, this is about the integrity of the European financial system and also about the security of our citizens, because money laundering and organised crime are directly linked. With the European Public Prosecutor's Office, we have a model for building an authority that can also take a European perspective on criminal matters. That is why I am really calling on the Member States to cooperate here to get to European prosecution authorities so that we can deal with this problem on a permanent basis.

Moreover, none of the Member States correctly and completely transposed the Fourth Directive, for which the transposition deadline was June 2017.  There are some clear lines of action that come off, in particular, in light of the latest revelations in the Luanda Leaks scandal. Firstly, we need, Commissioner, anti-money laundering regulations. It's a brave but absolutely necessary approach. Directives are not a strong enough tool. The paradigm needs to be changed.  Then we really need to know the real beneficiaries. Transparency is an absolutely mandatory exercise in the whole process.  Legislative gaps create situations of great vulnerability for the Union and for the Member States. It is unacceptable for one of the four major European consultancy firms, including working with the Union institutions, to provide financial and legal advice to relatives and camaraderie of dictators in third countries to help them launder money, transfer their assets to tax havens and escape the budgets of the states in which they operate.

The whistleblower, Rui Pinto, is in prison, but the real criminals have not been prosecuted. Similarly, Portugal has sold thousands of golden visas and built a tax haven in Madeira. This is how people's sense of justice is trampled underfoot, and we cannot allow that to happen as a European community on the rule of law. The European Commission must enforce European law in all Member States, and it must not wait for infringement proceedings.

In 2019, the total number of illegal border crossings at the EU external borders was estimated at 139 000 which is a 6% decrease compared to 2018 and the lowest level in six years. However, while the central and western Mediterranean routes saw a decrease of 40% and 50% respectively compared to 2018, arrivals on the eastern Mediterranean route have increased by 50%.  The situation on the Greek islands is, in particular, a source of concern as we all noted during our last debate in the plenary on 29 January. The number of people present on the Aegean islands reached a peak of over 40 000 migrants. It is the first time since the implementation of the EU-Turkey statement that we have reached such a high number. The Greek government is taking concrete measures to improve the situation. It has announced a new national strategy designed to protect minors who have arrived and who are resident in Greece and it aims to increase the number of transfers to the mainland. In 2019, more than 35 000 migrants have been transferred and these transfers have continued at a fast pace since the beginning of 2020.  Arrivals from the eastern Mediterranean route have direct impact on the flow of migrants in south east Europe. In 2019, there were over 14 000 illegal border crossings on the western Balkan route, which represents 140% increase compared to 2018. Since the beginning of 2020, the pressure on this route has decreased, due also to winter conditions. Nevertheless, this winter the pressure is higher when compared to the previous winter.  Our Presidency will continue to devote much attention to the migratory situation and increasing migration management capacities in the entire western Balkan region, with a particular focus on Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to ensure adequate protection of migrant population where, according to UNHCR, more than 8 000 migrants and refugees are currently present, mainly in the North West. The situation in the country remains challenging, but in the last weeks, there have been some positive developments regarding the increase of adequate reception capacities.  On 3 February, the Croatian Interior Minister Božinović, held a meeting with the new Bosnian Minister of Security, Mr Radončić. The ministers agreed to strengthen the cooperation in several key areas: implementation of accelerated readmission procedures, more intense implementation of mixed border patrols and support of the Republic of Croatia in strengthening the Bosnia-Herzegovina security forces in border control. The ministers also agreed to strengthen the cooperation in combating smuggling networks, which was also a topic of a ministerial debate at the informal meeting of EU interior ministers in Zagreb on 24 January 2020.  Minister Radončić commented that Bosnia-Herzegovina lacks over one thousand border guard for better border control, as well as the 93% of EU funds approved to Bosnia and Herzegovina last year were intended for humanitarian treatment of migrants but only 7% to strengthen security forces. The EU will continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in its efforts to guarantee the dignity and safety of all migrants, especially the most vulnerable ones, while at the same time seeking a more permanent and comprehensive solution.  We will also continue to support work with all partners in the Western Balkans. The overreaching goal of our efforts is to ensure that the migration flows at our borders are well managed and migrants’ fundamental rights are always respected. We expect the recent measures taken by the Greek government to bring positive change. The new asylum legislation which has recently entered into force in Greece should speed up the streamline of both asylum and return procedures.  The return rate has been very low for far too long. Returns are instrumental in managing the migratory flows. The plan of the Greek government to return 10 000 migrants by the end of 2020 is ambitious but it can be achieved, also with necessary EU support. Effective returns also require the good cooperation of Turkey. To ensure that the situation is well managed, it is also important that our Western Balkan partners enhance their migration management capacities, also in the area of return and particularly assisted voluntary return, conclude readmission agreements with third countries and further align their visa policies. We are ready to assist them in these tasks by all means at our disposal.  On the central Mediterranean route, conditions for migrants in Libya have deteriorated due to security issues arising from the internal conflict in the country. To alleviate the suffering of migrants and detained refugees in Libya, the EU individual Member States have funded UNHCR and International Organisation for Migration (IOM) programmes via EU trust fund for Africa.  IOM is funded to carry out voluntary returns to countries of origin and to provide humanitarian emergency assistance and has done so at an impressive level. UNHCR is funded to evacuate persons of concern to either Niger or Rwanda in view to a settlement in the EU or other receiving countries. These relevant actions require our further support, especially in view of ongoing conflicts in Libya.  To conclude, I would like to stress once again that the humanitarian situation at our external borders is a cause of great concern and we have to work closely together with our neighbouring countries and international organisations to improve it. Let me also express here our appreciation for the work of all humanitarian partners. I will let the Commission further elaborate on the comprehensive assistance the EU provides at our external borders to improve the situation.

The humanitarian situation of refugees at our external borders is of great importance and of concern to us all. The EU promotes the respect of the rights of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, both in the EU and outside of our borders in our neighbourhood. Any form of violence against refugees and migrants is, needless to say, unacceptable. Respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law must be ensured without exception. Member States must fully comply with these principles when implementing the EU acquis on border management, asylum and return. Pushbacks are not acceptable. Access to asylum procedures and respect for the principle of non-refoulement, in line with the EU Charter, must always be guaranteed. Member States must have in place the mechanisms needed to prevent pushbacks in the first place. Equally, they need to ensure that they have appropriate mechanisms to guarantee a prompt reply and investigate any alleged pushbacks. But challenges at external borders are many, and the Commission is in constant contact with Member States and provides them with support, including financial support for training the national border guards to act in conformity with fundamental rights requirements. The Commission is also closely monitoring the situation at external borders and is in contact with Member States regarding allegations of non-compliance with EU law at the external borders. As Guardian of the Treaty, the Commission will take the necessary action where necessary. Moreover, we now have in place a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency with a significantly reinforced mandate and an increased focus on the imperious need to respect fundamental rights. It is for this reason that a specific Fundamental Rights Strategy has been drawn up by the new European Border and Coast Guard Agency. A fundamental rights officer was appointed to contribute to the Agency’s fundamental rights strategy and monitor compliance with fundamental rights. Fundamental rights monitors will also constantly assess the fundamental rights compliance of Frontex operational activities. They will be deployed as part of the joint operations and they will be the eyes and ears of the fundamental rights officer. The Agency must recruit 40 monitors by 5 December of this year. The new Agency has also set up a complaints mechanism. This mechanism allows any person who is directly affected by the actions of staff involved in the activities of the Agency and who considers himself or herself to have been the subject of a breach of his or her fundamental rights due to those actions, or to any party representing such a person, to submit a complaint in writing to the Agency. What happens at our external borders affects Europe. This is why the EU has always supported and also always stood at the side of our partners at the external borders as well as at the side of refugees and migrants in those countries. The EU is globally a key actor in providing assistance to refugees worldwide, especially in neighbouring countries, and in supporting third countries in developing their asylum system and their capacities to fight against smuggling. For instance, the EU supports Turkey in its efforts to host more than 4 million refugees. The EUR 6 billion facility for refugees in Turkey has been fully mobilised and clearly produces tangible effects. Over 1.7 million vulnerable refugees benefit from the emergency social safety net, the largest EU humanitarian project ever. The EU is also supporting more than 500 000 refugees’ children to regularly attend school. Our Western Balkan partners have proven to be reliable and strong partners of the EU in managing migration and countering security challenges. However, reception capacities, in particular in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, are stretched to the maximum, and migrants are often living in extremely difficult conditions. Further capacity assistance is needed to help these countries to pursue their efforts to manage migration, addressing the issue of secondary movements in the region and treating migrants in a humane manner. To support all these actions, the EU provides financial and technical support to the Western Balkans through the regional programmes funded under the Instrument for Pre-Accession so that they increase their capacity to build their national migration management system. In addition, the EU has recently provided EUR 135 million in additional assistance to Serbia, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina through the Instrument for Pre-Accession and EUR 32.6 million through the EU humanitarian aid. In all these actions inside and outside the EU, the protection of the most vulnerable, especially of children and unaccompanied minors, remains a priority for the Commission. The Commission is doing all it can to help Member States to address the situation at our external borders. The dignity and safety of all affected persons needs to be ensured and protected. A lot has been achieved, but more remains to be done. We need to find a common understanding on how we collectively shape and manage the realities of migration. We must unite around our common values and humanitarian responsibilities and seek to make our society more cohesive and integrated. I count on your continued support and that of the Council as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 373, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Emil RADEV", "mepid": "124850", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, honourable Members, it is known that the Western Balkans route is one of the main migration routes to Europe, making it also the busiest. Unfortunately, frontline Member States such as Croatia, Greece and others always bear a disproportionate burden, as due to their geographical location they are always the Member State of first entry. Evidence of this is what is happening both at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and on the Greek islands, where the influx of migrants is not decreasing. Paradoxically, while asylum seekers can apply for international protection at official border crossing points, their numbers are minimal. Instead, they use unregulated places to cross borders, often even using networks of smugglers, for a single purpose – to reach Western Europe. At the end of 2018, due to increased migrant pressure, the European Commission allocated 6.8 million euro to croatia to support the management of the European Union's external borders. This was done in full compliance with European Union rules ensuring that all measures applied at the Union's external borders are proportionate and fully in line with fundamental rights and European Union asylum legislation. As of the beginning of 2018, aid of EUR 36 million eur 100 million has also been granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina to meet the immediate needs of migrants and asylum seekers. The protection of the external borders can only be achieved in accordance with law and international conventions, as well as respect for fundamental rights and the dignity of migrants.

I think it’s high time to get out of the migration deadlock. We owe it to our own citizens to get back into the driver’s seat. In order also to preserve free movement within the Schengen area, we need strong external borders. Awaiting the Commission’s New Pact on Asylum and Migration, Renew Europe proposed its own comprehensive approach a few weeks ago: a Renew pack on asylum and migration. To relieve the pressure on EU external borders we need new international partnerships with third countries on migration. That’s the only way. Meanwhile, we need a common approach for those asylum seekers still arriving irregularly at EU external borders. We want ‘direct registration upon arrival’ amended to read: security checks; humane reception conditions; a first assessment at a European reception centre between potentially failed asylum applications and those that are not; shared responsibility for those people in need of international protection; shared responsibility and effort to quickly return rejected asylum seekers to safe third countries.  I have high expectations for this new pact on migration and asylum and hope that Renew Europe’s concrete proposals will also be taken on board. But I have still two questions: does the Commissioner agree with Renew Europe that the EU must be able to step in when the Member States at external borders cannot or will not deliver?

Mr President, for a number of years we have been overwhelmed by unwanted migration. But this is just the beginning. The population of Africa has 2000 to 4 billion inhabitants. Hundreds of millions will come to Europe. That's why we have to guard the borders. Not out of hatred towards those outside our borders, but out of love for our own people.  Left-wing activists and rogue lawyers abuse human rights to encourage and promote migration. They want non-citizens to be able to enforce rights in our home countries. Migration wants to elevate them to an enforceable human right, with the cooperation of foreign judges, for whom, by the way, no one has ever voted.  The European Convention on Human Rights, for example, was once intended to protect citizens of European countries from tyranny. Today, however, it has evolved into a tool to ram an open-border policy down the throats of our people. We must solve the migration crisis at our borders. We do this by unceremoniously returning economic fortune seekers.

However, we know that at many borders the rules are not always complied with. Push—backs are widespread in Europe. We know that from reports and judgments, and even tomorrow the Strasbourg Court will come up with a decision on Spain.  Push-backs can also go hand in hand with brutal violence and causing traumas to people, and this is especially the case at the Croatian borders, according to numerous reports and testimonies. During our working visit last weekend, we were shocked by the fact that all actors involved acknowledged this widespread violence and push-backs, but that the Government of Croatia still denies this, and this discrepancy exactly shows that the violence will not stop if the EU continues to shy away and react indifferently.  We can only stick to our rules and values if we care about violations at the borders and if we take steps to ensure compliance. I would therefore urge the Commission to investigate thoroughly the allegations and complaints, and that investigation also needs to be part of the Schengen evaluation.  The Commission informed us that it had financed the monitoring mechanism in Croatia and that this would lead to improvement, but we learned that this money is not spent on monitoring but on border control, and that no monitoring body enters the green area where the push-backs take place. So how seriously does the Commission take these allegations on push-backs? Is it only interested in a smooth Schengen accession or also in banning human rights violations at the border?

In Bosnia we were able to contact numerous migrants and refugees.

All this in the face of European marasmus in the assumption of solidarity measures to remove these people from the limbo in which they find themselves.

The massive influx of migrants to the European continent, in addition to being continuous, has become a veritable submersion. In Greece, annual arrivals have more than doubled in two years, reaching 75,000 new migrants in 2019. On the island of Samos, their number exceeds that of the inhabitants. Not to mention the access route through the continental border with Turkey, where the crossing of the modest River Evros is enough to demonstrate the total inefficiency of Frontex and the obsolescence of the 2016 agreement with Turkey. We can discuss and be underrant about the conditions in which migrants and illegal immigrants live, but it is to deal with the effects of the problem rather than to solve the causes. All those who, through their political acts or their speeches, incite the whole earth to reach the shores of Europe are responsible for these tragedies. On the contrary, all those who choose a policy of humanist deterrence will avoid these tragedies, both by the means put in place at the borders and by the cutting of all the aspiring pumps in the respective countries. By closing its maritime border with Turkey to detain illegal boats, Greece is moving in the right direction and we should be helping and encouraging it, rather than taunting it.

Last week in Zagreb he requested the assistance of the Republic of Croatia. He mentioned how the migration crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina should no longer be treated as a humanitarian crisis but as a security one. The country urgently needs over 400 extra border guards. Out of EUR 40 million allocated from European aid, only 7% is earmarked for the support of local institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Local institutions have endured most of the pressure since the beginning of the migrant crisis. The only ones who profit from this crisis are human traffickers. The Croatian police arrested 95 of them only this year. Human traffickers are so present that the Deputy Director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bonnie Glick, stated that America will have to cut their assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina if institutions don’t intensify their fight against it.

I take from this debate that the respect for the fundamental rights, including the principle of non—refoulement of all people, is a priority, independently of their status and whether they are inside or outside the EU. I agree with you that there should be no physical violence against migrants and refugees – I guess this is an understatement here – and we should ensure that adequate measures are in place to address the needs of the most vulnerable, notably the children, at all steps of the migratory routes. Border guards and police should carry out their duties in full respect of fundamental rights – that goes without saying. We have revised our legislation to ensure that safeguards are in place in case of alleged violation of fundamental rights. It is important that these mechanisms play their role. On our side, the Commission will continue to monitor the compliance of the situation at the borders with EU law. We will continue engaging with our partners and neighbouring countries, notably in the Western Balkans, to provide assistance to migrants in third countries to avoid them falling into the hands of unscrupulous smuggling networks. Regarding the question posed by you, Mr Azmani, the Commission also considers that the core challenges at our external border are inherently linked with those of the situations Member States have inside the EU. So therefore, these challenges should be addressed jointly. Many of the issues you raised tonight, such as secondary movement, border controls and cooperation with third countries – and, of course, also the humanitarian situation at our border – are key issues that will be addressed in the new pact on migration. Migration is among the most significant challenges the European Union has faced in recent years. We cannot stay idle to the suffering of the migrants at our borders.

There is no doubt that the situation at our external borders must be addressed in an effective and timely manner. As I have already stressed, we are committed to improving reception conditions for migrants, especially those of vulnerable groups. On a broader note, I would like to reiterate that the Croatian Presidency intends to continue focusing on implementation with regard to the comprehensive approach to migration. We will do our part to ensure coherent action at EU level in terms of more effective control of the EU external borders and increased external action, as well as to address internal aspects. Regarding the alleged push-backs and the situation at the Croatian-Bosnian border, as you’re all aware, I’m here today in my capacity as the Presidency of the EU Council, not nationally. However, I would like to comment on this, because I feel that Croatia has been unjustly portrayed regarding alleged mistreatment of illegal migrants. I can assure you that there is zero tolerance for violence in Croatia. This is strongly underlined by my government in all areas. We take all allegations of police violence against migrants very seriously. Therefore, there is especially no tolerance for unlawful use of coercive measures by the Croatian police against any population, as well as for non-prosecution of any crime or misdemeanour committed by police officers. Every single complaint is carefully investigated by the Croatian Ministry of the Interior. I can assure you that Croatian police respect the fundamental rights, safety and dignity in the treatment of migrants in full compliance with international, EU and national law. Croatia as an EU member has the task, in accordance with the Schengen Border Code and national legislation, of protecting the state border and preventing illegal migration. Regarding the common European asylum system reform, it remains our common priority to tackle the key issue from a broader perspective and to search for a comprehensive solution to the challenges. Extensive work has been done by the previous presidencies, and it is our intention to continue building on the foundations they set with the new Commission. We will continue working towards the approach with balanced responsibility and solidarity, in line with the European Council’s new strategic agenda. The Croatian Presidency hopes this issue will be adequately addressed in the new pact on migration and asylum, and we look forward to its presentation. Regarding the situation in Greece, it is a positive development that the new Greek Government has adopted a new legislative framework for asylum and related issues like return and reception facilities. It entered into force on 1 January 2020. We look forward to its speedy implementation.

The passivity (including European) policies since the summer of 2019, when refugees and migrants were temporarily settled in the area, could turn into a wider humanitarian catastrophe with implications for regional security. This threat persists, and neighbouring countries, in addition to the complex internal political situation, contribute to the practice of blocking access to asylum procedures and by violently deporting refugees and migrants.  The Commission cannot be indifferent to the creation of a fortress europe that is defended by gross human rights violations. It is essential to ensure that countries, primarily EU members and (candidates for) Schengen members, establish effectively independent control mechanisms to supervise the implementation of border controls, which should include a careful review of the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms.  It is necessary to continue to find a solution to the upgrading of the Dublin system for a common and joint and several European asylum policy.

We want to ensure children and young people grow up to become confident adults, skilled and respected both online and offline. Making the internet safe for children remains a priority. Children are one third of internet users and an estimated 800 million of them use social media. Let me also recall that one of this Commission’s top six political priorities is to build a Europe fit for the digital age, allowing everyone in Europe, including children, to benefit from technology within safe and ethical boundaries. The Commission has been very active on this issue over the years, with actions ranging from funding and coordination with Member States to hard law. The European strategy for a better internet for children – the big strategy – is our framework for making the internet a trusted place for children and young people. It has been in place since 2012 and has successfully brought together the European Commission, Member States, the ICT industry and civil society to deliver solutions for a better internet for children through coordination, self-regulation and funding. Our policy is rooted in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which all EU Member States are party. A strong concern with child safety online cuts across EU legislation. The e-Commerce Directive, the directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and the general Data Protection Regulation all contain provisions to protect minors online. As to future plans, the Commission will first of all be working on a comprehensive new strategy on the rights of the child, including their rights online. The strategy should include actions to protect vulnerable children, protect their rights online, foster child-friendly justice and prevent and fight violence. We will also strengthen and modernise rules applicable to digital services in the whole EU through the Digital Services Act. We will start with a broad consultation to make sure we get the balance right and propose measures. We will also work with Member States for the full transposition of the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which includes a new obligation on Member States to ensure that video-sharing platforms put in place specific measures to protect minors from harmful content online. These include mechanisms allowing users to report, flag or rate harmful content, age verification or parental control systems and transparent easy-to-use and effective complaint-handling procedures. The revised Directive also ensures that children’s data collected by audiovisual media providers are not process for commercial use, including for profiling and behaviourally-targeted advertising. Furthermore, we will present a revised digital education action plan to equip children with the skills and competences needed to thrive in this digital age. Through the current Digital Education Action Plan, the Commission is supporting outreach to schools in order to improve online safety, media literacy and digital skills. For example, the Safer Internet for EU campaign reached 30 million Europeans in 2018, and in 2019 the EU Code Week involved 4.2 million people, with 92% of the 72 000 activities taking place in schools. The Commission plans to update the plan, focusing on digital literacy and aiming at equipping young people and adults with the skills they need for life and work in the digital age. As regards the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children, the Commission has informally consulted the main stakeholders to assess its relevance and role. These stakeholders include the Safer Internet centres, industry and civil society and Member States. The preliminary feedback is positive. The strategy’s four pillars and its holistic approach are still relevant, despite emerging risks such as disinformation, cyberbullying, online hate speech, live streaming of illegal content, and new ways for children to use technology. Any possible update of the strategy will have to be flexible enough to be future-proof as the digital ecosystem continues to evolve, with children and young people among the most ardent and avant-garde users of technology. Any Commission decision on next steps will take into account the results of the latest big policy map, a study on how the strategy is implemented in Member States, the results of a new European Parliament pilot project supporting cooperation between industry hotlines and Member States’ authorities for the swift removal of child sexual abuse material online, and, of course, the work on the new strategy on the rights of the child. What we can already anticipate is that work in this area will continue to keep a fair balance between protection and empowerment measures for children and young people in formal and informal education.

The Internet is part of the modern world of the child, whether we adults like it or not. Children and young people are less and less likely to get entertainment and knowledge from books, television or radio. Everything they need is on your phone and tablet.  Yes, it gives great opportunities for creative development of the child and acquisition of valuable abilities and skills. The Internet can become a tool for levelling the playing field for children at risk of exclusion or children with disabilities. However, the growing internet and social media carry risks that often our children and parents are not prepared for. I am afraid that parents and children are often left alone with problems such as hate speech or harassment on social media. This applies both to children who are victims of such behaviour and to those who commit it. The same is true of young people's growing dependence on the internet and computer games.

During the previous legislation, I was the rapporteur on education in the digital era and also shadow on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD). So I went to do my homework. I was disappointed when I found out that the last time the Commission addressed the issue was in 2011, and since then we have just forgotten the approach which was agreed. Let me give you an example. Ten years ago, we were against the fragmentation of the market, but, two years ago, we adopted the AVMS with the famous moral development of children to be defined by Member States. The good news is that, in 2019, the Commission announced the creation of a new Expert Group on Safer Internet for Children. So we took only eight years to take the first coordinated steps. Since then, the group has had three meetings, but we’re still far from a solution. Why? I believe we have to take into account at least two important things. First, children grow fast and we have to act accordingly. Ten years for a political decision means one generation at school. Second, we cannot solve systematic problems by projects, but this is exactly what we are doing. We have of course adopted some good directives, which we have already mentioned: combating sexual abuse, xenophobia, hate speech, GDPR, and so on, but this is not enough.  What we need is a comprehensive European approach to the digital education of children, not on a project basis but in each and every school, compulsory, with good teachers, a clear curriculum, an agreed set of criteria and assessment system. But what do we have in practice? Some Member States where 60% of schools do not have an internet connection. What digital education can we speak about? I strongly believe that we have to act, but act quickly and invest proper funds, not just in the meetings or working groups, but in the schools. Otherwise eight years later, it will be the same.

Studies, but also many teachers, confirm that the increased use of the Internet leads, firstly, to a reduction in the ability to concentrate, secondly to the reduction of social skills, thirdly to the transformation of thin children into thick couch potatoes and, fourthly, to the loss of writing ability, since this technique can only be anchored in the brain at a young age through constant exercise. We are not even talking about the dangers of the Internet in terms of content, whether it is spying, grooming or confronting violence, pornography and fake news. The EU should therefore not promote the use of the Internet by children, because even the supposedly harmless, but mostly infinitely stupid, games lead to a loss of concentration and take the time for other nicer, more important things.

Half the children say this hurt them psychologically and pushed them into social isolation. Many parents leave children with their cell phones in hand. Children's dependence makes them vulnerable, aggressive and isolates them.  The internet is not a game. We need a modern education that will fortify children from these dangers.

The coronavirus outbreak is clear evidence of this, and it highlights the urgent need for close collaboration and coordination across the EU and beyond. The European Parliament is a crucial partner in these efforts, and I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss the EU’s response with you this evening. The Commission has mobilised its services and agencies, notably the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDE), and is working on all fronts to support efforts to tackle the outbreak. This includes ongoing coordination with Member States to share information, funding vaccine research and offering support through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. I will share some more specific examples of our efforts and some ideas for an improved response, but first I think it is important to salute the commitment of all frontline medical personnel, who are operating in very difficult circumstances. Last week we expressed special condolences for the death of Dr Li Wenliang, who was among the first to warn us about the coronavirus. A few words on the importance of cross—sectoral coordination at EU and Member State level would be in order here. On 28 January, President von der Leyen triggered the Commission’s crisis coordination mechanism. My colleague Commissioner Lenarčič, in his role as the European Emergency Response Coordinator, has convened meetings of the Crisis Coordination Committee with the participation of all relevant services, from health, civil protection, through research to transport, but also development cooperation and communication, to name just a few. He repeatedly emphasised that this challenge requires a joined-up collective effort and using all the tools that we have at our disposal. Relevant Commission services and the European External Action Service are constantly assessing the situation and deciding on the actions needed for a swift and coordinated response. Consular coordination and cooperation between EU Member States is ongoing in order to address repatriation and other consular needs. Thanks to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and on the initiative of some Member States, such as France and Germany, hundreds of EU citizens have been repatriated from Hubei province. Commissioner Kyriakides has been in regular contact with the Ministers of the Member States where cases have been confirmed. Under the cross—border health threat decision, the Commission coordinates with Member States through three key mechanisms: the Early Warning and Response System, the Health Security Committee, and the Communicators’ Network. Effective cooperation is key to their success, and I assure you that these mechanisms are active, sharing information and building preparedness and mitigation strategies. At the same time, the Commission has provided EUR 10 million for research on the virus, and the EU-funded PREPARE project has been activated. This will launch clinical trials across a network of 3 000 hospitals and 900 laboratories in 42 countries. Currently, Member States are implementing a variety of measures at points of entry to the EU. However, we should work with Member States to develop a common position on external borders in line with international recommendations, whilst protecting freedom of movement and the health security of all EU citizens. We also need to coordinate with key partners like the World Health Organization (WHO). The Commission is planning to mobilise funding to support the WHO’s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan in order to tackle the outbreak, to contain its spread and to foster research and investigation. Capacity reinforcement is especially important in countries with already fragile health systems. Access to personal protective equipment is a critical part of the wider response. The Commission is looking at the needs of Member States in this regard. In parallel, the Commission is reviewing country capacity for quarantine and isolation. Understandably, there are varying levels of capacity across Member States, including around personal protective equipment. Should EU transmission of the virus greatly expand, this may require cross—border solidarity and cooperation. It is important to contain the outbreak to reduce the risk of it spreading further. In addition to ensuring preparedness in the EU, we need to focus on assisting China. This helps the Chinese, but it also decreases the risk for the rest of the world. The Commission is working closely with China, both at technical and political levels. The EU has already provided 12 tonnes of protective equipment to China. This is a clear sign of our solidarity. We have been in contact with Member States and private companies to identify stocks of protective personal equipment that go beyond EU needs and could be shared with China. Yes, we need to make sure that stocks at national level are sufficient, but we also need to focus on where our support could have the greatest impact by tackling the outbreak at source. We are also looking into setting up a joint working group between EU and Chinese experts on public health aspects of the virus, which regards the potential for indirect consequences of the outbreak. One issue of particular concern is the potential for xenophobia, both online and offline. Discrimination against Asians or persons perceived as Asians or any other race or ethnicity is contrary to EU law. The Commission will not tolerate any racial discrimination in whatever form it takes. The Commission is in contact with the European Medicines Agency and networks of Member State authorities to assess the situation of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and of finished medicinal products available for the European pharma industry and the European market. So far, the outbreak is not affecting the availability of medicines in Europe, but obviously we will remain vigilant. However, the outbreak highlights the need to examine the domestic production of APIs and finished medicinal products. This is something that we are currently reflecting on, and it will form part of the pharmaceutical strategy to be launched later this year. The Commission has mobilised all the assets at its disposal in order to meet this challenge inside and outside the European Union. Our success depends on rapid communication, information sharing, political will and close coordination. All of these efforts are underpinned by European solidarity with all EU citizens and with others who are vulnerable to this virus.

And let’s be clear, there’s no need for panic in Europe, but people are quite rightly looking towards their national authorities but also towards the EU for answers. I want to, first of all, compliment the European Commission for their coordination efforts. I’ve seen previous outbreaks that were less coordinated but here, for example, the initiative taken for the coordinated approach about the repatriation of people deserves our compliments. But I also want to express a warning. Ministers of health tomorrow will be very inclined to underline that health is a national competence, and they will be right, but people at the moment don’t want to talk about the Lisbon Treaty, they want to see solutions. And, therefore, for the EPP, we expect a number of things: first of all a capacity check as to the preparedness of all Member States and I honestly get a bit worried when I hear the Commission say we might have to organise solidarity for the protective equipment in Member States where they have less access. No, we need to do that, actually, now. We need this capacity check. We need a common approach on people entering from the region into the EU, a clear communication strategy that avoids conflicting advice, which we’ve seen between Member States in the past, cooperate the vaccine – you’ve said enough about that – but also, that’s my last point, up—to—date data. How come, officially, we have data saying Africa has zero cases? That either means they have zero cases, which I find highly unlikely given their contact with China, or they just don’t check and that would be a worrying thing for a neighbouring continent like the EU.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Thank you, Commissioner, for your important start to this debate. With 40 000 confirmed cases globally and more than 1 100 tragic deaths, we must take the corona virus very seriously. We should be well aware that the number of cases in Europe has not been so great, but preparedness is important for managing and protecting the population. The world health organisation's work to understand the outbreak and the action of the virus is extremely important, as we do not yet really know how to spread. I am therefore pleased that you are mentioning the EU's efforts in the field of research into the virus. I think that is very crucial. Similarly, the work of various expert groups to identify the source of the outbreak is very important, to ensure that we can prevent similar outbreaks going forward. We do not yet know whether we are doing enough, and it is unfortunately impossible to know until we have better knowledge of the virus, its emergence and how it works. I call on the health ministers of the various EU Member States to be vigilant and ready to deal with any new cases and to disseminate all information and help each other in this. Measures to protect infection are of the utmost importance and must be given priority, while the isolation of persons and quarantine .m. We must also ensure that the corona virus does not contribute to suspecting people or leading to the spread of false information. Having said all that, it is good that the Commission is on the move, that you, Commissioner, are here today, that you are showing that your preparedness is great and that together we are looking to spread all the knowledge we have, investing in research efforts and ensuring that we have the correct information in order to protect the citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 1, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 459, "date": "2020-02-12.json", "name": "Katalin CSEH", "mepid": "197588", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, there is hardly a day that goes by without new breaking news about the coronavirus, and as we are more connected than ever the world is holding its breath anticipating the outbreak of a truly global pandemic. That’s the wrong approach, I think. This global attention has a very clear downside: deliberate misinformation; fake news; misleading reporting about the coronavirus are all around us. In Hungary, two people were detained who were spreading fake news in social media about a disease reaching hundreds of thousands of people according to investigators. That’s nonsense. And other internationally wide-spread posts claimed that more than 60% of humanity will get infected in the near future.  Let’s face it. Europe has not done much to address this issue of the spreading of fake news and hysteria. There is certainly of course a global crisis unfolding, nobody denies that, but in the face of the crisis, Europe must remain calm and composed. This is why we should not ignore the rising misinformation campaigns that spread fearmongering and mistrust.

But such cooperation will not be sufficient if it is not articulated at WHO level with all the countries of the international community affected, with a view to containing and, in the long term, overcoming the epidemic.  In this sense, the EU must ensure that Taiwan, home to 23 million people, does not remain the only country with confirmed cases of coronavirus excluded from WHO technical meetings, as has been the case since the outbreak began. This exclusion is not only inexplicable but irresponsible. In the past, Taiwan has been able to participate in WHO meetings with observer status. The exclusion of this country from meetings related to the response to coronavirus is therefore even more incomprehensible. The inclusion of Taiwan in these arrangements, as well as in the 73rd WHO Assembly to be taken in the near future, should be the subject of démarches by the European authorities.
