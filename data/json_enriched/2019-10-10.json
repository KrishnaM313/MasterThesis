Our aim is a balanced financial framework that reflects both new priorities and traditional policies and contributes to the common European objectives. It is not too easy to achieve these substantial aims, but we are working hard. The timetable is also challenging us. Even though we are in the middle of the institutional change, the Presidency will do its best to finalise the Council negotiations by the end of the year. I am personally very committed to this target.  Today’s plenary debate gives me a unique and concrete opportunity to cooperate with Parliament. I personally chair the General Affairs Council meetings, but I also represent the Council in every plenary session during our Presidency, which gives us an opportunity to have an up-to-date discussion regularly.  In the spirit of good interinstitutional cooperation and in line with the approach outlined by the Bulgarian Presidency, we are committed to continuing the established practice of holding an exchange of views before and after sessions of the General Affairs Council (GAC) when the MFF is on its agenda.  Now a few words on the EU’s challenges and our common priorities. The next MFF is to respond to Europe’s current and future challenges by increasing the share of expenditure in policy areas with the highest European added-value.  For decades, traditional policies have been supporting EU integration by fostering convergence and development as well as maintaining high standard agriculture in Europe. We can see the positive results of these investments across the Union and they will continue to foster convergence and support transition towards a sustainable agriculture. Rural development funding plays a crucial role here. One of the key challenges of our time is climate change. We already see its impact on our environment and it is set only to worsen if we do not step up our efforts. Many voices – firstly, the one of our youth – call upon us to do more. The MFF will be essential to this purpose, as it will cover the period leading towards the 2030 climate targets deadline. On climate, Member States seem to support the 25% mainstreaming target, even if some see it as the maximum and others as the minimum.  Further to the EU’s climate target on energy transition aiming for carbon neutrality, as a Presidency we see that there is the need for a fund to facilitate fair transition towards carbon neutrality. The MFF will also better support innovation and research, at a time when society is undergoing massive changes due to the digital transformation. Europe needs to stay at the forefront of research, development and innovations.  The future MFF needs to be aligned with new priorities. Managing migration requires a comprehensive approach. By providing funding and using different MFF headings, it will be possible to better respond both to international and external aspects of migration. At the same time, our expectations must be grounded in reality.  One of the biggest EU Member States is set to leave the Union.  I have had consultations with the ministers of all Member States, and in this context, many have expressed the need for the EU budget to reflect this new reality. As the Presidency, this is an element that we have to take into account. As for own resources, they must provide a fair, transparent and equitable system for the financing of the next MFF and to limit the administrative burden for the Member States.  From the Presidency’s point of view, on new own resources the non-recycled plastic packaging waste proposal seems to gain the strongest support, and a positive approach from the majority of Member States. As far as new own resources are concerned, we need to keep in mind that also here a consensus between all Member States is needed.  Now defending European values starts from respect for the rule of law within the Union, and above all, in its Member States. Rule of law is not a political declaration but a legal norm. From the Presidency’s perspective, Article 2 of the Treaty concerning the rule of law will not stay in force by itself, and this should be reflected in our policy work. Rule of law is a crucial element in the next MFF as it includes the proposal on protecting the Union budget from rule-of-law deficiencies. That proposal applies equally to all Member States and all EU funds, just like the rule of law itself.  Rule of law and democracy form the foundation of European freedom, security and prosperity. Respect for the rule of law is self-evidently linked to the legitimacy and proper functioning of the EU. One of the priorities of the Finnish Presidency is to ensure protection of the rule of law and to reinforce its links to the budget. Following the leaders’ guidance, we will continue our work on this important matter. I am convinced that there is a way to create a balanced and legally sound instrument based on the Commission’s proposal.  I am aware of the concerns of Members of this Parliament on the timeline. So far, the Presidency’s work within the Council has focused on listening to the Member States and their priorities. Now there will be an opportunity for the leaders to give the Presidency direct guidance.  To this end, the Presidency is preparing a paper that will facilitate the first substantial discussion of the leaders in October’s European Council. Obviously, this will depend on the reactions of delegations and above all, on the way President Tusk will want to conduct the discussion. On the basis of the leaders’ guidance, we will prepare a finalised draft negotiation box with numbers to facilitate an agreement by the end of the year, as concluded by the European Council in June this year.  I would like to underline once more that the Presidency is fully committed to meeting this timetable and we will do our utmost to facilitate the final stages of the MFF negotiations. It is also fundamental for us to cooperate with you in line with the previous Presidencies and to progress on sectoral MFF proposals with a view of reaching additional common understandings. Thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to our discussion.

I am concerned about a number of events that took place yesterday during the election of the Cariforum delegation's office.

While she has been a full member of this delegation since July, we have learned from the administration of our European Parliament that she cannot stand for election because she would suddenly no longer be a full member of the Cariforum delegation. She is a candidate for the first vice-presidency under this Rule of Hondt, even if she is not respected, and nothing should be able to prevent her from running. After the sometimes somewhat disturbing comments that had been made about a cordon sanitaire that would prevent us from accessing posts, is this reversal, which does not respect a decision taken in plenary, a desire to systematically exclude the members of the Group Identity and Democracy, or is it a mistake? If so, I hope it will be repaired soon.

I salute your engagement on this file of strategic importance which will help shape the future of the European Union over the coming decade.  I also recognise the intense work carried out by this Parliament, in particular the co—rapporteurs and negotiating team appointed by the Chair of the Committee on Budgets (BUDG) Mr van Overtveldt – Ms Marques, Ms Hayer, Mr Olbrycht, Mr Fernandes and Mr Andresen – to bring forward this political resolution now. The European Council will hold an exchange of views on the next multiannual financial framework next week and I can only encourage the leaders and the Council Presidency to take into due consideration the European Parliament’s positions.  The interim report that Parliament adopted in November last year was a substantial contribution to the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework. One year later, and after the European elections of May, it was essential to leave absolutely no ambiguity about the continuity of Parliament’s stance. I therefore welcome that this political resolution largely endorses the position already expressed in 2018. I also take note of the new elements that this political resolution brings forward. I will address them in a minute. But before doing so, I would like to recall the Commission’s position on the overall level of expenditure. It is certainly one of the issues, if not the issue, that steers the ongoing negotiations the most.  Parliament would like to set the next EU long—term budget at the level of 1.3% of the EU27 GNI. At the other end of the spectrum, several Member States have been repeatedly calling for a budget limited to 1% of the EU27 GNI. I believe we all need to address those divergences. All institutions need to be active and constructive in seeking a compromise. At the end of the day, there will need to be an agreement on the next EU long-term budget, and the sooner the better. We urgently need to make progress in the negotiations and avoid entrenched positions. We must acknowledge that the Union is asked to do more and better on its political priorities. This requires a modern budget focused on EU added value, and more resources for programmes contributing, for example, to climate action, research and innovation, digital security, border management, etc. On the other hand, we cannot escape reality. The Union will lose an important contributor to the EU budget so that moderate savings in the biggest spending areas – cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy – are inevitable. In the light of those two constraints, what the Commission has proposed for the next multiannual financial framework, with an overall level of 1.114% of EU27 GNI, is balanced and realistic. I remain convinced that it would be a fair outcome for all. On top of endorsing most of Parliament’s position expressed last year, this political resolution also adds a limited number of new elements.  First and foremost, let me address the point on the financing of the President—elect’s political guidelines. You will understand that they cannot infringe upon the next College prerogative. However, the Commission’s proposal of May last year and the ongoing negotiations already provide a solid framework for these priorities. The Budgetary Instrument for Convergence and Competitiveness for the euro area is one element. Another one, the rule of law, is an integral part of the next EU long-term budget: EUR 120 billion on external action investment, a closer partnership with Africa and a strengthening of the European Defence Fund with a 22—fold increase compared to the current pilot and preparatory actions, which means in absolute figures, from EUR 590 million to EUR 13 billion.  For other initiatives, I cannot anticipate on the detailed content of the new initiatives. It’s essential to continue the MFF negotiations with speed and determination. They provide for an opportunity to translate the political guidelines of the President—elect into action and accommodate them within the framework of the MFF agreement. We must avoid damaging delays in the launch of the new programmes that are in the clear interest of our regions, our researchers, our small businesses, our farmers and our young people. Let me now address the issue of climate change and Parliament’s call for a more ambitious quantified target in relation to climate—related expenditure.  The Commission is committed to delivering on the Paris Agreement on climate change and to making the Union lead by example on the global stage. That’s why we have proposed to set ourselves a high objective and to dedicate 25% of the overall next EU long-term budget, or approximately EUR 320 billion, to projects contributing to climate action. That is ambitious and credible too.  The target of 25% is based on our experience and on our bottom—up assessment of how much each and every spending programme can actually contribute to climate action. Some programmes and funds will contribute significantly to climate action. Some others among them – also those for which you propose further reinforcement like the single market, Erasmus, Creative Europe or the European Social Fund (ESF) will not.  Any target higher than 25% would require a difficult choice. For instance, the climate objective of those programmes that already contribute to climate action could be increased. In practice, this would require mostly much higher targets within the common agricultural policy, the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund because of their critical mass in the budget or, in relative terms, the overall share of the budget allocated to programmes that don’t contribute to climate action could be decreased. In practice, this would mostly affect the European Social Fund and other reinforced or new priorities, such as Erasmus, defence, security and border management. That is the harsh mathematical alternative that we are facing. I acknowledge Parliament’s intention to exercise its rights fully and I can say that I can relate to the feeling of impatience expressed by some Members that, one and a half years after the Commission proposal, the Council has not yet agreed on its position on the MFF. Please be assured that the Commission is fully committed to facilitating dialogue. We will continue to provide both Parliament and the Council with the technical information to support transparency, openness and constructive cooperation. Finally, the resolution calls on the Commission to present a contingency plan for early 2020 to ensure continuity until the next EU long-term budget is agreed. It will be up to the incoming Commission to respond to your call but, as you rightly point out, the Treaty in its Article 312 and also the MFF Regulation itself, provide the relevant legal framework if an agreement cannot be reached. Now is not the time to consider any additional measures. For the moment, our priority and focus must remain to reach a timely agreement on the new multiannual financial framework and sectoral basis acts.  Finally, let me thank this House for your continuous firm support to reform of the own resources system, to maintaining the flexibility of the MFF and to introducing a mechanism aimed at protecting the EU budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law. I agree with Members of this Parliament that it’s high time to decide and meet citizens’ expectations. We all have a collective responsibility to agree on the next EU long-term budget on time so that the next generation of programmes is operational on 1 January 2021.

Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured that we will be following the discussions of the next European summit closely. The reason is simple: Parliament is getting impatient. In May 2018, 17 months ago, the Commission presented its proposal for the next financial framework. Parliament immediately got to work and expressed its position and priorities. Since then, we have been waiting for the Commission to move forward and decide on a number of cases. However, time is running out and the time has come to move to the next level in the negotiations. It is also time to involve Parliament. The line adopted by Parliament is clear and we reaffirm today its priorities with the maintenance of the budget of the Common Agricultural and Cohesion Policy, the strengthening of emblematic programmes such as Erasmus or Horizon 2020, new appropriations for new challenges or the establishment of a mechanism linked to the rule of law. The next framework will also have to respond to climate change and preserve biodiversity. On this issue, the commitment of President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, with the launch of a Green deal and the introduction of a carbon tax at borders, in particular, is encouraging. One point of warning, however, is that these initiatives, which we welcome, must be accompanied by additional budgetary resources. I am already hearing here and there the irresponsible attacks on Parliament, which would always like to spend more, but let us be concrete: with a constant envelope, more initiatives, it means cuts in other programmes, sometimes dusting and therefore less effective public policies. Let's not give the Eurosceptics some ground to grind. I will conclude with my own resources. The revenue system, as it was designed in the 1970s, has been misguided over time. Today, the predominance of national contributions fuels the logic of fair return. In other words, we have a system in which national approaches are king, even though we should be focusing on European added value. There is an urgent need to move forward on this issue, which, I recall, is essential for Parliament. We will not agree on the expenditure framework without new own resources for the Union. Madam Minister, you know, the ball is in your court.

We need a strong European Union for this and we Greens want a strong European Union. We want an EU that is ready to give all people a future and is climate neutral in 20 years' time. To do this, we need to change the EU, and we need to invest massively. The financial framework offers us the right chance for this right now, and so let me be very clear at the outset: the position of the German Federal Government and of many other Member States is damaging Europe. It is populist simply to stand up for a 1% budget and fight for a small budget. The German Federal Government and others are acting anti-European. We expect more from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz in particular! We expect them to stand up courageously for a strong Europe and not simply put the brakes on everything. We do not understand this regular table position. After all, whoever cuts the EU budget destroys our climate. Those who cut the EU budget accept that the social divisions on our continent are deepening, and those who cut the EU budget will be less able to invest in research, fast internet and Erasmus programmes. Most of the EU budget is still spent on climate-damaging agricultural subsidies – we need to change that! Instead of mass animal husbandry, mass production, we want to promote environmental protection and animal welfare. We want to invest in renewable energy, public transport and better European rail links. Social and environmental investment is a part of us, and for us Greens, it is one of the biggest scandals in the European Union that more than 120 million people on our continent have to live in poverty. We cannot accept this and we, as the European Union, must do more to combat poverty. That is why we are particularly pleased that we have succeeded in achieving broad agreement in Parliament's negotiating team on the financial framework on important positions, that we stand together here in Parliament on the major issues, that we are prepared to act and that we will enter into tough negotiations with the Council together, because we have to negotiate hard.

To date, despite the Finnish Presidency's commitment to close an agreement by the end of the year, there is no room for agreement on the horizon. This, in my view, is mainly because we are not looking at the next financial framework pragmatically and because the majority in this Parliament has a totally utopian approach to what the next Multiannual Financial Framework should be. Many more resources are being asked, eur 200 billion more, to finance certain programmes and some new priorities. I believe that in order to reach an agreement we need to return to pragmatism and ask ourselves a question: if every time we have to negotiate the budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework, we ask for more resources and the Member States do not want to put them, obviously there is a reason. If an investment is good, I think lenders are happy to put in more resources. If they do not want to put them, it is quite clear why, namely that they do not consider programmes and spending lines to be efficient in pursuing those objectives.  Above all, I am concerned about a drift, namely the fact that the next proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework is imapped with conditionality, conditionalities that will make this instrument an undemocratic instrument and put spending and allocation decisions at the mercy of some Brussels bureaucrat.

In some countries, the majority of citizens believe that the budget should be higher. In other countries, it is considered that contributions should, of course, be lower and as little as possible. And it is also clear that, following the emergence of a proposal from the European Commission in several Member States, in cohesion countries, there was, in fact, disappointment from the fact that, even then, the total reduction in Brexit is much smaller in expenditure than what we get in our offer in the cohesion envelope. In other words, Brexit is often blamed as a reason, although that is not the real reason. Or, in agriculture, citizens expect compensation payments in the form of direct payments to actually equalise, because fertiliser or fuel costs equally in all countries of the European Union. And also in her speech, what Mrs von der Leyen mentioned about the European Commission's new initiatives is to be understood as to whether additional resources are expected from the proposal of the new European Commission or whether there are any other reactions, or whether it squeezes even more of the expenditure on existing projects.

The second, that the fight against the climate emergency needs a greater commitment than we had last year. The third, which President-elect Von der Layen and many of the Commissioners who have been at the hearings, have committed to this House to launch a number of initiatives which are not yet covered by the Commission's proposal and which we have therefore called for a review.

However, in the negotiations on the financial framework, my group will pay particular attention to one thing: it is not acceptable for European funds to be taken, but that European fundamental values and rules are subsequently trampled underfoot. The EU is a community of values and those who do not support the fundamental values in the EU should no longer receive monetary support from the EU in the future.

In France, the \"En Marche\" parties and the Republicans, always so quick to defend the rationalisation of spending and tax cuts on the national stage, here in the European Parliament, support an unprecedented increase in the budget that will lead to an explosion of the French contribution. EUR 1,324 billion is the budget you are asking for for the next multi-year financial framework 2021-2027, an increase of 40% over the previous MFF. In economics, this is called the ratchet effect, that is, the total inability of a bureaucratic institution like the European Union to reduce its budget when it reaches a certain threshold, that is, not agreeing to want to go back. The legitimate question is: who will benefit from this new financial windfall: our farmers, our entrepreneurs, SMEs, which are suffering the consequences of unfair competition exacerbated by the proliferation of free trade treaties? To that question, we are answering, certainly not. I quote your text: these additional resources are needed to deal with new responsibilities, for example, in the areas of migration, external action and defence.

We are debating today the next Multiannual Financial Framework at a very important moment in time, and we are reconfirming the position of Parliament in light of the results of the European elections. We have seen people come out and vote in large numbers, expecting Europe to do more – students, researchers, farmers, people in the cities and in the villages, people who expect more security, and people who expect us to innovate, to research more and better deliver on digital, and to tackle climate change – and it is our duty to listen to them and to deliver it to them. People expect more, and we should do more.  My first message to you, Minister, is that we cannot do more with much less. In the previous MFF, the philosophy was that if we need to do something new, if we need to allocate money for something, we take it away from something else. EFSI was created, but the Connecting Europe Facility and Horizon 2020 suffered, and examples can continue. This philosophy has to end. New priorities have to be financed with new resources. Otherwise, we need to tell students that there are fewer Erasmus scholarships, and farmers that the subsidies are smaller. We should not do that.  Secondly, Minister, my question to you is this: when and what are you ready to negotiate with Parliament? What we have seen so far from the Finnish Presidency is too little, and it is too weak. We need political commitment at the highest level now. Parliament will, with a large majority, adopt its position now.

The premise is that the resolution is very good. I support the idea of strongly reaffirming Parliament's position and the ambition to have a courageous budget for the next seven years. Paragraph 5, which introduces the review of own resources as a strategic objective, is very good.  The two points. It is very important to link the revenue side with the expenditure side in any budget, as you said positively at the hearing. Budgetary policy is not just a bureaucratic exercise, it is not a test of mathematics, it is the way in which we allocate resources to respond to the problems of our citizens, it is the heart of our democracies, without which democracies do not stand. That is why, if the objectives are ambitious – ecological transition, youth employment, research, structural funds – we must link income that is genuinely European. That is the first point. Secondly, we need a cultural change, a leap forward.

Coming from Estonia, I can be proud that, during our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, our Prime Minister, Jüri Ratas, had the privilege of co-signing, with Jean—Claude Juncker, the European Pillar of Social Rights. That was on 17 November 2017. This ambitious document, supported by the European Parliament, sets out important principles that we will have to implement now in the Member States. I have to thank Commissioner Thyssen for her hard work on improving social policies across the Union. We all know that this is not easy: every time, when it comes to social standards across the Union, somebody says ‘No, no no’, and refers to the principle of subsidiarity. At the same time, we all know that the situation is far from ideal. Since 2012, in the context of the European semester, the Commission has been issuing country-specific recommendations, not only on economics but also with regard to social policies in the euro area. This is an extremely important process but unfortunately – and this is reflected in the report – the rate of implementation of these recommendations is unacceptably low. Whereas at least some progress, or what was termed progress, was reported concerning 72% of country-specific recommendations in 2012, the figure decreased to 39%, the lowest rate ever, in 2018. So we are asking the Commission to take measures and find a way to convince Member States that the social health of the European Union is not less important than defence, the single market, or whatever other common policy of the Union. We are also asking them to consider extending these recommendations to non-euro states. I was happy to hear the new head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, during her speech here before she was approved by Parliament, promising that, during the first 100 days of her term of office, she will come up with new legislative mechanisms to ensure for Europeans a fair minimum wage. For those who are sceptical, I have to underline that this proposal will take into account national traditions and legislation, which means that nobody is going to violate the principle of subsidiarity. The thing is that we have to fight so-called ‘working poverty’, and help people who live at the risk of poverty and social exclusion, otherwise we will end up in Europe with brain drain and depopulated areas, on the one hand, and more protests and Polish plumbers, on the other. During their hearings, several Commissioners-designate referred to a bill of social rights as a universal tool to solve the problems of depopulated regions and rural areas, but we also have people with disabilities, we have a gender pay gap, we have minorities facing discrimination and people at risk of poverty, and we have to help them. This is exactly what Europeans want, not only from national governments but also from us, the elected representatives in the European Union. In the report there is also a call for the Commission to create a new unemployment insurance scheme, which was warmly welcomed by trade unions. A funny thing that happened yesterday evening was that I received a letter from the European Confederation of Trade Unions in which they asked me to support my own report. When I answered them that this was kind of funny, they told me ‘No, no, you have to support this and that amendments.’  I really believe we’re standing for the right thing here, and, colleagues, I rely on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2019-10-10.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Europe’s economy is in its seventh year of uninterrupted growth and today more people than ever have a job. Poverty is declining at a steady pace on the back of good labour market outcomes.  Europe is also stronger when it comes to our economic governance setting, and in particular the European Semester. We have managed to put social and economic policies on an equal footing, most recently by embedding the European Pillar of Social Rights. We are sharing good practices and have developed solid analysis and common understanding in close dialogue with the Member States and the involvement of social partners.  However, divergences persist across and within countries. While labour shortages increase in some countries, in others unemployment remains high. In—work poverty is still a major challenge, with almost one out of ten workers at risk of poverty. Atypical and new forms of work may have an impact on the segmentation of the labour market. In this perspective, a key priority must be to make labour markets more inclusive and to ensure all jobs created are of good quality. Furthermore, women remain at a disadvantage on the labour market, despite achieving better educational outcomes than men. Closing this gap would liberate a huge untapped potential with a positive impact for the economy and society. Ensuring effective work—life balance policies and access to childcare is crucial in this sense. In addition, technological change and digitisation are deeply changing European societies and economies. It is crystal clear that we need to step up investment in education, training and skills in order to properly accompany our people through these changing times, in order to harness productivity—enhancing technologies and also in order to ensure a just transition to a climate—neutral economy.  Indeed, bringing people to the centre of our policy—making is now more important than ever, because while poverty is finally declining across the board, at the same time we witness an increasing number of Europeans expressing a sense of vulnerability. This is triggered by income inequality, labour market precariousness, but also the uneven impact of globalisation and technological change among countries, regions, sectors and people. While investing in skills remains crucial to foster the inclusion of all people in tomorrow’s societies, social protection systems should be adapted to properly empower and protect our people. In this context, I want to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for this very balanced report. It presents well both the positive trends and the challenges ahead, and I broadly share its goals and conclusions.  Tackling these challenges, ensuring that we have a social market economy that works well for businesses and citizens, also in changing times, and fostering convergence is indeed the motivation behind the European Pillar of Social Rights. Less than two years since its proclamation, the implementation of the Pillar has already started. Its principles have been embedded in all the stages of the last two semester exercises, and almost half of the country—specific recommendations – 44% of which today address Pillar priorities.  Important legislative measures have been proposed and approved, implementing several principles of the Pillar, and EU funding has been re—geared to support implementation of the Pillar through an enhanced link between the semester and the programming of the European funds, notably the European Social Fund. Even more importantly, the Pillar has contributed to anchor job quality, investment in skills, social fairness and just transitions at the centre of the European agenda. Our Pillar of Social Rights is one of the main legacies of the outgoing Commission, but the work is far from finished, as we all know. Supported by the commitment of the European Parliament, the Commission, Member States and social partners, the Pillar is here to stay to act as a compass of our future action in the employment and social fields. Moreover, starting from the new cycle, the semester will be refocussed to integrate the United Nations’ sustainable development goals in line with the semester’s legal basis.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, further efforts are needed to make our societies more inclusive and to prepare them for future changes. Stronger and more inclusive economies and societies would also strengthen the resilience of the euro area and pave the way for the deepening of the economic and monetary union.  As you all very well know, implementing the Pillar principles on the ground, as well as pursuing the sustainable development goals, is a joint endeavour which will be pursued both at the national and European level. I am sure that the Commission will remain at the forefront to promote upward convergence of social and living conditions throughout Europe and support people, businesses and regions in these changing times.

It is vitally important that we all have well-performing social and economic policies, that these policies are not contradictory and that we move in the same direction. This report has continued to draw attention to the need for action on some persistent problems that we face in the EU. We need to take stronger action to reduce youth unemployment; tackle poverty, especially child poverty; increase labour market participation; achieve equality for each and every one of our people in society; boost competitiveness; and also think about the future and how we are going to adapt our skill sets and social systems to the future of our work, especially in rural and urban areas. I believe these are the issues and themes on which we need to take action over the coming years. Today, 10 October, is World Mental Health Day, and something I’m happy to see in this report is a call for us to take concrete measures to address mental health. It is regrettable that the EU focus on mental health has, in fact, lessened in recent years, despite its significant individual and economic cost.

Mr Toom's balanced report that we are voting on today contributes to this process.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Tom for this excellent report. I am pleased that the European Parliament is overwhelmingly in favour of this report on euro area employment and social policies, which follows the country-specific recommendations published by the European Commission last June as part of the European Semester. The general guidelines of this report reflect the strong interest of the new assembly in moving towards more social Europe with an emphasis on investment. I want to make two points. First of all, the European Commission's request to present a legal instrument so that every worker in the European Union can benefit from a fair minimum wage, respecting national traditions, is a major point for me. It has been enshrined in the political orientations of Ursula von der Leyen as a priority for the upcoming legislature in terms of social convergence. It is also one of the answers, it seems to me, to the labour shortage problems faced by most Member States. My second point concerns the workers of the platforms and their working conditions. We know that the work done in the European Union through online platforms - and this is a good thing - has increased by more than 25% in the last two years and now affects almost 5 million Europeans. While several Member States are setting up national measures on individual basis, it is time for the European Union to set the course.

We are very pleased to see that the report supports giving the Union’s social goals a much higher priority, both when it comes to the coming legislative framework from the Commission and also when it comes to financial resources within the next budget. Another important aspect to address from a Green’s perspective is the importance of combating gender inequalities in the labour market. We are therefore pleased that we, with this report, make it clear to the Commission that we want a proposal for a directive on pay transparency in order to once and for all close down the unacceptable gender employment and pay gap that we see across the Union. The same goes for the pension gap.  Finally, we are very pleased that the report pushes for a solution to tackle long-term unemployment, brings focus to the inclusion of people with disabilities in the labour market, and – last but not least – calls for initiatives at European level to ensure platform workers’ rights and social protections, regardless of their employment status.

I’ve taken good note of your positions, your concerns, your comments, and I will make sure to pass them on also to my successors. This debate reaffirmed our shared commitment to social Europe and to what is the guiding principle of the social market economy: that economic growth and social progress are two sides of the same coin and that they are reinforcing each other. This principle must steer all our work going forward. Dear Members of Parliament, this debate is special for me for one more reason: as you know, it is also my last debate here as a Commissioner. This gives me the opportunity to thank you: to thank you for the good cooperation. Of course I expected nothing less, having myself served as a Member of the European Parliament for more than 20 years. Over the past five years we worked together constructively in a friendly way, putting all this – the interests of Europe’s people – first. Over the last weeks and months, I have been receiving many compliments that the EU has become more social- and people-oriented. I always reply that these compliments should be extended beyond me, and I share these complements with you, because good results are the fruit of honest and good interinstitutional dialogue and shared commitments. Results are ultimately why we got involved in public life: to deliver what counts for people and to do our part for a dynamic, inclusive and fair society and economy. And following almost 30 years in public life, I can say that I am proud of what we have achieved and very hopeful of what comes next. But don’t get me wrong. Important challenges lie ahead; we were just discussing them. And just transitions don’t happen automatically. But the guidelines of the new President-elect of the new European Commission, Ms von der Leyen, show that our successors will build further on what has been achieved on the basis of our shared values. So I wish you very constructive years, and be sure that you can always count on me as a close ally on your work for a social Europe.

If we are serious about the economy for people, then social policies cannot simply be a appendend or a first aid to the side damage caused by participation in the global competitive race for continuous (economic) growth. Unfortunately, the appearance of the vice-president-designate and commissioner responsible for the economy for the people also shows that the future European Commission has recognised, at the declaratory level, the need to adapt the economy to climate change, but refuses or does not recognise the fundamental incompatibilities of the concept of continuous growth with sustainable development and a social union that, together with economic union, is supposed to create a European economy for the people on an equal basis.

Long-term challenges such as ageing, digitisation and its impact on work still require urgent solutions. Effective policies are therefore needed that cover different forms of employment and adequately protect workers from abuse, discrimination and continuing poverty. Let us bear in mind that long-term unemployment particularly affects young people, single parents, long-term sufferers, people with disabilities or people with health problems who still face specific barriers and discrimination at all stages of employment in order to get a job. In addition, an increase in the number of temporary or unstable forms of employment can have dangerous consequences for the adequacy of pension benefits, especially for younger generations, whose careers often have gaps that can lead to the termination of contributions, also taking into account the stability of social security systems.
