We are all aware of the scale and urgency of the challenges posed by climate change, as witnessed by the lively debates on the issue in both the Council and Parliament. Yet, global action to fight it remains insufficient, as confirmed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report, Global Warming of 1.5°C. The European Union is determined to lead the way in the global response to climate change. It stands firmly behind its commitment to fully implementing the Paris Agreement and the objective of holding the global temperature increase to well below 2°C. The EU also remains committed to maximising contributions in the fight against climate change from other relevant multilateral processes, notably in the areas of aviation and shipping. The EU is broadly on track to achieve its 2020 greenhouse gas, renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. Furthermore, it has already translated into legislation its own ambitious commitments for 2030, which will enable it to achieve emission reductions of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. The finalisation of the main elements of the 2030 climate and energy legislative package was the result of work which started in 2015 and recently culminated in intensive negotiations and agreement between the two co—legislators. In particular, the rules of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) were revised to ensure the necessary emission reductions in the industrial and power sector, and ambitious, binding reduction targets for 2030 were set for all EU Member States in other sectors, such as buildings, transport and waste. In the land use and forestry sector, Member States have to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions on their territory do not exceed removals by sinks. Combined with other sectoral policies, among others, on the deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions from cars, vans and trucks, as well as from fluorinated gases, it is estimated that these policies will have an impact on our level of achievement. In addition, robust overall governance rules were recently agreed at EU level to help ensure coherence between Member States’ long-term energy and climate policy plans and to facilitate reporting on and monitoring of progress. However, we know that more needs to be done to contribute to the long-term temperature goals set in Paris. In line with the Paris Agreement, the EU will submit a long-term strategy to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by 2020, while calling on all other parties to submit their long-term strategies on time. With this in hand, both the European Council and the European Parliament invited the Commission to present a proposal for a strategy for long-term EU greenhouse gas emissions reductions by early 2019, which resulted in the Commission’s November 2018 communication, A Clean Planet for all. The Council welcomes the communication and underlines the need to focus discussions on different pathways to achieve climate neutrality, in line with the Paris Agreement. The communication has already been discussed at the meetings of the Ministers responsible for environment, energy and competitiveness, and further sectoral debates are planned to take place in the coming weeks and months. The debates held so far have highlighted the shared recognition of the need for action and of the importance of developing the EU long-term strategy in a comprehensive and holistic manner. Indeed, the Council believes that concerted and transformative action must extend to multiple levels of governance, with an essential role for non-state actors and regional and local governments in implementing ambitious solutions on the ground. The preparation of the EU’s long-term strategy should also take into account the integrated national energy and climate plans of Member States, which in turn have to be consistent with their long—term strategies. Let me recall here that the Paris Agreement recognises just transition as an imperative to ensuring that the consequences of climate change actions for the workforce are taken into account in regions and communities which stand to be particularly affected by them. This should be taken into account when preparing long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies at EU and national level. Despite undeniable challenges, the transition to low—greenhouse—gas—emission and climate—resilient economies has already created – and has the potential to create – additional employment opportunities, for example, in renewable energy, construction and building renovation. Technological innovations will need to be scaled up in all sectors. Research, development and demonstration are expected to reduce the cost of breakthrough technologies significantly, but an enabling framework is needed to support them, and private investments need to be scaled up and the right signals provided to the markets, with the mobilisation of finance from a variety of sources. To achieve further emissions reductions, in line with the EU’s commitment to fully implementing the Paris Agreement, major changes will need to be made at society level in our choices, investments and consumption and production patterns for the next decades. The Presidency looks forward to further discussions on the Commission’s communication, including at the highest political level. The European Council will discuss the topic at its meeting next week in order to provide guidance on the overall direction and political priorities. Based on that guidance, the Council will continue and deepen the focus of debates in order to contribute to the overall process. The Council also looks forward to the high-level events planned at international level in 2019, which provide an opportunity to mobilise political will to raise global ambition, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretary-General’s climate summit, A Race We Can Win.

Your action and commitment has brought to wider public attention the necessity and urgency to act on climate change. As the world’s leading climate scientists told us in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on 1.5 degrees, we must act urgently and collectively now. And political will is vital in driving this action. In this year of European Parliament elections, we should look ahead at what else can be done. In Europe we can be proud of what we have achieved so far. The campaign for the European Parliament elections offers a great opportunity to tell our citizens what has already been achieved and have each European political party present their individual positions for the future. As you know, but probably the majority of our citizens are not yet aware, we have adopted an ambitious legislative framework for 2030. This would not have been achieved without the excellent work, commitment and determination of the Members of this House. The Energy Union, with a forward-looking climate action, is now in place. This was one of the priorities of the Juncker Commission that you endorsed almost five years ago. The correct implementation of the European Union’s climate and clean energy legislation should allow the European Union to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 beyond our current 40% target to around 45% compared with 1990. But targets are not ceilings. With the right incentives we can reach even more. This will be achieved thanks to the clean energy transition framework recently adopted, based on a greater deployment of renewable energy sources and by putting energy efficiency first on the agenda: our target of 32.5% of energy savings by 2030 could even be revised upwards in 2023. This shows our citizens that climate and energy issues are on top of the European Union agenda, that this priority is making real progress in Europe; then to our international partners that the European Union is leading by example and that we turn our pledges into concrete action. But now is also the moment to look ahead to 2050. We will have to upscale further our policies beyond 2030. The crucial thing is that we can only do it within a deep transformation of our model of economic development, one that delivers both climate neutrality and prosperity and fairness for European citizens. A model that is just for our citizens and fair for our industries. That is why the Commission adopted in November last year its Communication ‘A Clean Planet for all: A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy’. By proposing this vision, we have responded to the call by the European Parliament and the European Council. The Commission’s vision intends to set a clear direction of travel for the European Union’s climate policy and contribute to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. To see what the European Union should do we studied eight scenarios in detail. Five scenarios achieve at least 80% reductions by 2050 with varying different technologies or introduce circularity and energy efficiency. Let’s be clear, these are not enough to meet the 1.5°C objective, and they are not what the Commission proposes to do. To get to the 1.5°C objective we will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. That is why we have developed two scenarios that effectively reach this aim of climate neutrality. One is focused on technology deployment. The other contains more elements of behavioural change, circularity and increased natural sinks. The analysis clearly shows that a climate neutral economy by 2050 is possible, following different pathways, but that it will require an ambitious combination of technologies and action. This is not only to protect our environment, but also to modernise the European Union economy for a sustainable future, increase investment in competitive technologies and defend our citizens’ better quality of life. It means investing in a much more efficient economy, an economy that relies less on imported energy, an economy that provides for more local, higher-quality jobs. I am happy to see that the resolutions adopted in the parliamentary committees confirm this long-term ambition. I hope this is also the case in the plenary vote tomorrow. It is a big responsibility for all of us to lead and demonstrate that a socially fair transition to climate neutrality is not only possible, but also opens enormous economic opportunities. A transformation on this scale requires an open and inclusive debate. We all need to engage widely with citizens and civil society across Europe to reach a common understanding on the way forward. Together with my team I have already started our outreach to all European countries to launch the public debates, and I invite all of you to contribute to our 2050 vision for Europe. Here is where the impulsion that our young Europeans are giving us comes in and is a fundamental part of this debate. It is really the moment to speak out. We are all beginning to suffer the consequences of climate change. Many of us will not be here to see what a profoundly changed planet will look like in 2050. But the young Europeans that are taking to the streets, and are doing so in growing numbers and in more and more cities across Europe, will be in the prime of their adult life in 2050. I welcome their engagement – they have the biggest stake in the fight against climate change. We must embark in a process of transformation with a much greater sense of urgency than I see today. We have a little time left to stabilise climate change and fulfil the goals of the Paris Agreement. We have not yet run out of time, but we cannot afford to hesitate anymore. The actions and the words of these young Europeans are a precious spur to action now, and we have a duty to act. We have sketched out how this can be done and presented a solid analysis of why and how Europe can achieve climate neutrality; why this model can be replicated by other countries in the world; how climate neutrality, economic prosperity and social fairness can and must go together. We must listen to what the very great majority of Europeans – and especially our future generations – are telling us. We must agree on the objective of a climate neutral, prosperous and fair Europe in 2050, and on that basis, take the measures and actions that we know can make it happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Former Social Democrat German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said that anyone with visions should go to the doctor. I think, however, that we need visions in politics, and we need visions, particularly in European policy. The European Commission has presented a vision: we want to become climate neutral by 2050. And the good thing about this vision is that it is underpinned by facts and scenarios. The Commission's statement is clear. We can even create additional jobs and generate additional growth in Europe if we are to achieve this goal. Across Europe, students are taking to the streets to combat climate change, and I believe that if we adopt this resolution tomorrow and support the objective of climate neutrality with great unity, they will have already achieved a first success. But I am afraid that the students must continue to demonstrate – I hope, then also outside of class time – because we are not alone in being decisive. The Council must adopt this scenario, and this will certainly be much more difficult than here in Parliament. Precisely in order to persuade the Council to agree to this strategy and the objective and also to take concrete steps, we must now think very carefully about what we are doing. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are critical of the fact that we are now adopting a 55% target for 2030, because we have just adopted climate legislation. Planning security is also an important asset. Throwing overboard a decision that has just been taken does not help us. And I also fear that if we exaggerate this resolution now, the Member States in the Council, who do not want climate neutrality in principle, will have arguments that we should not give them. That is why I believe that we have found a good compromise in the negotiations between the political groups, and we should get through this tomorrow. A fair transition to climate neutrality is very important for the EPP – just transition. We must help the people of the coal regions to find replacement jobs. We need to enable the energy-intensive industry to produce CO2-free, for example by enabling the steel industry to produce carbon-free steel. This is technically possible, but we need a great deal of support. Our rapporteur, Christian Ehler, is currently negotiating this issue in the trialogue, namely that we in the European Union really support these technologies. We should back him up. I have invited the students demonstrating in my constituency to a discussion and, of course, the pupils have the first word. Of course, this discussion takes place in the afternoon and not during the lesson period. It is important to me that we also enter into a dialogue with companies. I still meet many entrepreneurs who say: we cannot do this, we cannot do it. That is why we must work together. Because we are not a role model for the world, if we end up being climate neutral, but the industry in other parts of the world is producing. That is why the motto cannot be 'climate protection instead of jobs' or 'jobs instead of climate protection'. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats want climate protection and jobs, and that is why we are fighting for the resolution that is now on the table to be adopted tomorrow without any significant change. I believe that we will then give the right signal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, we have guests in this House today, 60 young people from 20 countries up there on the Tribune. We welcome them because they are great and they are the representatives of the Youth For Climate movement. (Applause) It's good that all parliamentarians have the chance to see young people in their constituencies but today we have the chance to see them here, which is even better. The movement was started last August by schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, who decided to strike in front of the Swedish Parliament, holding up a hand-painted sign, but today it's a social movement. Hundreds of thousands, in more than 70 countries, in more than 700 cities, are going to manifestations on the movement's Fridays For Future. This is a social revolution that has now started everywhere and we the politicians, we the parliamentarians, have to be part of that. This is my firm conviction. One element more: I think they should be here in our place today and talk to us. They should come forward with their demands, they should question us and we should be giving answers. Indeed this was also the idea of some Groups, to invite them to speak today, but unfortunately it was not possible to have a majority for that in the Conference of Presidents. I regret very much that Conservatives, Liberals and the far right denied us this chance for an open debate today.  (Applause) Unfortunately, they blocked an open discussion with the young people who are going on the streets each week. Maybe we can do better sometime. So the conclusion was that the groups who supported that – we the Socialists and Democrats, the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group – invited them to our group meetings this week and we listened to them. We wanted to know what indeed they are longing for and the answer was completely clear. It was a call to action. It's highly urgent that we do something. 'Please do not postpone. Please don't be cheap in your political answers. Please, no more delays because you are dealing with the biggest threat in human history'. And yes, the young people are right because they want to have a life without fear, a perspective for themselves and their future families, and a life without devastation. That is why I want to say to young people that it is not enough for us to smile here, it is not enough for us to pretend that we are listening and not drawing conclusions. No, consequences must be drawn radically if we are to save this planet and if we want to ensure that everyone on this planet has a future. We take this very seriously. In my group, we have ensured that we review our political programmes, and today we are firmly determined to align our policy now, today and tomorrow, with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  This means that there must never again be a debate on the economy without the environment. But there must also be no debate on the environment without thinking about social security in our societies and ensuring that all people have something of it, of the future image of our good society that we want to build together. In other words, ecology is not just for the happy few. In fact, where jobs are lost, we have to take care of it. We need to invest, with a committed regional policy, with a committed social policy, and we must ensure – ask Mr Macron, who is in the process of getting his lesson – that justice is brought to our society. It cannot be the case that working people alone have to pay for the transformation. On the contrary, we will only achieve the ecological change if we think and practice the social change, and there will only be a good social future if we create a sensible transformation of our industrial society and if we ensure that this world can live in peace with its natural resources. That must be our programme.  I have heard what the Commission has said, I have heard Mr Liese, who is indeed committed to these issues, but, friends, that is quite simple! If you are all determined, we will do so in the new mandate. Then we simply turn the Stability and Growth Pact into a sustainability pact. Then we will no longer make the semester just an economic consideration, but we will make a sustainability policy. And to the young people: Keep on fighting!

I’m afraid the answer is no – and not only on climate but also on the systematic destruction of nature. The EU will by far miss its own objectives on the biodiversity strategy but neither the Commission nor the Council have taken any measures in order to turn the tide.  But then climate – yes, we have legislation in place, and yes, we do increase the part of the EU budget dedicated to climate change, but is that sufficient? No, we all know it’s not.

But we should also act in all other policy areas and this Monday, I’m afraid, again, we proved that we are letting the future generation down.  We voted on sustainable finance and I’m afraid that, by the right-wing parts of this House, we voted out all ambition and that is extremely important because all human action starts with investments and we applaud every percentage of green investments. But it’s worth nothing if we do not green all the other investments; it’s fighting a running battle. As we say in the Netherlands, it is mopping up with the tap open. We will only succeed if all investments are green and that is the way forward.  Today, the future generation is sitting there. We only have a limited amount of time. In a few years’ time they will be sitting here and let’s avoid that we will be sitting there and shamefully watching how they are trying to clean up our mess.

It’s about time we talked again about climate change. But I think a lot of people who are here now are getting a bit tired of people saying ‘Oh, we want to thank you, thank you for being here, thank you for telling us’. They don’t want thanks. They want action. They want politicians to act. Ten years ago, I went into this European Parliament – coming from science, going into politics – because I noticed that politicians were not acting, and I thought it’s about time that they started acting. And sorry, Commissioner, sorry, Council, you were only talking about 2050. If I follow all those marches on the street, the last time I checked I didn’t see anyone ask: ‘We want a 2050 vision’. All are asking: ‘We want action now’. We need to do more as Europe, we need to step up our ambitions now and what we hear is only: ‘we are going to talk about a long-term strategy’. Mr Liese is even saying: ‘Let’s do first a long-term strategy, don’t talk too much about action, because maybe that will shake up some countries!’ That’s the purpose! We’re talking about a climate crisis here. We are talking about action that needs to be done.  (Applause) As one of the slogans says: if climate had been a bank, it would have been safe by now.  (Applause) So it really is about time also that we need to do more and I think this is really what we can see – it’s the climate marches we see on the streets, not just the strikes by the youth, but also the big marches. Last Sunday in Amsterdam, 40 000 people on the street; in Brussels two times 70 000 people; people on the streets asking for more action. That is a social movement, a social movement that we should not let down. They are calling on Europe to do more. And if you want to talk about the future of Europe, this is about the future of Europe. The future of Europe is green jobs and that is another comment to my dear colleague Peter Liese. When you are talking about future jobs you should talk about the green transition.  (Applause) Other regions in the world are moving, are investing – look at California, but also look at the solar investments in India. Look at the electric transportation in China. They are moving. The German car industry is investing more in electric transportation in China than in Germany and that’s because there they do policies and not in Germany. (Applause) So we need to step up and we need to take action and we don’t only need to talk about targets – and by the way it’s good that people are getting annoyed because this is the debate, right? Because everyone is always saying that we do the same and we all have the same targets, but this shows we don’t, because if we go beyond the targets then suddenly you see that the vested interest of the fossil industry is still hugely protected by this side of Parliament.  (Applause) As my colleague said, on finances we still only try to say ‘okay, don’t talk about the negative impact of our financing, only talk about a little green corner’. On agriculture we don’t manage to really make sure that agriculture becomes green. On transportation, we are still lagging behind on new and future transportation, and on climate proofing of our investments we’re not delivering.  We really need to step up. Tomorrow is our first vote for higher targets. But after that, these elections, these European elections, will be about climate – about real action, because it’s time to act instead of talking.

But it's the metaphor that best describes what's going on, because we're literally cooking our planet on a low heat.

Have we done enough to secure a future for this planet and to ensure a real transition to a truly zero-emission economy, in terms of production and consumption, in terms of society as a whole?

I do not believe so, not least because the objectives we have set ourselves to date are still only on paper and are not sufficient to guarantee a lowering of the temperature, and those to come have yet to be decided.

Mr President, the observed climate change poses a crucial problem for all the people of the world. It is therefore necessary to approach them responsibly in order to anticipate and treat them. And to be effective, it is necessary to be aware of the entanglement of two phenomena. The first is the sole human responsibility, after 200 years of savage industrialization and the race for productivity, with an uncontrolled debauchery of carbon energy. The other is a natural climate cycle proven by the study of polar ice and, at the end of the last glaciation, caused a temperature increase of more than 4oC and a rise of 120 metres of seas. The man had nothing to do with it. So what to do? Stop saying that man and living organisms are responsible for everything; to get out of the angelism of the Paris Agreement; catching up with the European Union's phenomenal lag in technology and innovative alternatives; Stop establishing non-green free trade agreements; reject globalization and the commodification of water, air and land and anticipate their management; limit the pseudo-environmental constraints that are driving down the costs of cars, housing and food, and which justify increasingly unbearable taxes for people.

But when we speak to young people we have to put things straight on the table. To say that there has been no action from the Commission on climate change during these past five years is simply not fair. In these five years more has happened on climate action than ever. We agreed in Paris the first binding international climate treaty and the European Union was instrumental in delivering that agreement, leading the high-ambition coalition. The first point is that we have an agreement which establishes the objectives needed to stop climate change. We have delivered all the necessary legislation, with the support of this House, which has raised the level of ambition, for sure, and I thank all the Members of the parliamentary political groups for having raised ambition levels in relation to renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, and CO2 targets for cars and light vans, and for heavy-duty vehicles. Good work. A good job done. We are on track. And the Commission framework for 2030 has review clauses. Action will be enhanced, but to enhance action you need a sense of direction of travel. Young people are saying that they want fast action and ambition. What the Commission has proposed in this communication is that we will become climate neutral by 2050. That’s at least 10 years before what science is saying. The International Panel on Climate Change says that climate neutrality globally will have to be achieved by 2061, and developed countries have a responsibility to act faster, I fully agree. But now we are in a situation where we have legislation and we have review clauses. It is not enough, and the next Parliament and the next Commission, have a huge responsibility. I expect that the ‘Spitzenkandidaten’ and the political groups in the campaign will be ambitious in their electoral programmes, because if we all agree that we have to raise the level of ambition there should not be problems in the Council when it comes to taking decisions supporting the 2050 climate neutrality objective. If we have that objective, the next Commission will have to raise the level of ambition beforehand. That is the exercise in which we are engaged here. I expect there to be a huge debate in the campaign for the European elections – and that young people, industry and workers will be listened to, because this has to be a fair, social transition. We cannot fight climate change when there are so many people unemployed. It is impossible. We need the involvement of citizens in order to change behaviour patterns, to have electric mobility accepted, and to change the way we are using resources. And that is a revolution. I am conscious that what the Commission has proposed is very ambitious. It touches all sectors of the economy. It requires structural changes that are bigger than those of the industrial revolution. It has to have the support of all our citizens. So now we have the opportunity to answer the demands of the young people, and the European Council has to endorse ambitious trajectories that will be the guidelines for the policies that the next Commission and the next Parliament will have to agree. In the street, people are making demands, but we have to answer our young people, the workers in the automotive industries, the workers in the steel industry, the workers in the coalmines, in order to engineer a fair and social transition. The energy transition, fighting climate change, will be achieved with success if nobody is left behind – and that is our responsibility during the campaign, after the campaign and in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, again let me thank the honourable Members for this useful debate and for their comments, and to greet the young people in the gallery.

The EU's energy transition must not be as chaotic as it is now, and the shift away from fossil fuels should be gradual. There are also fewer substantive errors on the part of the EC that equate energy efficiency with reducing energy consumption. You have to invest in real energy efficiency, but it costs money. Energy poverty must not be recklessly led, yet it is growing and growing, m.in. because of the solutions imposed in the EU, e.g. in the area of the ETS.

I support a real and smart sustainability pact that focuses on young people and working people, smart and sustainable technology, innovation and a circular economy.

Let me start with the economy. Leaders will discuss the current economic situation and will set priorities for the 2019 European semester. The European Council will also endorse the euro area recommendation. Europe, like the rest of the world, faces the systemic changes brought about by such issues as digital transformation, the rise of the data economy and the transition to a greener economy. Harnessing these opportunities will be key to our future prosperity. To strengthen our economic base, we need to make sure that our different policies, whether digital, industrial, single market or trade policies, are mobilised in unison to meet these challenges and advance the strategic interests of the Union. The European Council will hold a cross—cutting and forward—looking discussion on the issues.  Another critical issue is climate change, which we have just discussed in this session. As was noted in this debate, we, as a Union, need to help raise global ambition and continue to lead the way on climate action. This means implementing the current 2030 framework, but also engaging in the long—term transition to a climate-friendly future. We know that we need to provide the right incentive for this transformation and we will have to make sure that we leave no one behind, taking into account regional specificities and different socio-economic circumstances. The European Council will discuss the issue and provide guidance for further work in the Council. China is a key global player in all these issues. Leaders will have an in-depth exchange of views on our relations with China in preparation for the upcoming EU-China summit.  Finally, a cornerstone of our democracies is that citizens should be able to vote in a well-informed and safe manner. Ahead of the European elections, the Presidency will report on the latest developments to protect the democratic process from manipulation and interference from inside and outside the EU. Leaders will also be informed of ongoing efforts to tackle disinformation more broadly, following the joint action plan presented last December by the Commission and the High Representative. Next week, the European Council will also meet in its Article 50 format to discuss the latest developments regarding Brexit. To be, or not to be, a member of the European Union, to exist or not to exist – this is the question that the British Parliament should address as we speak. Unfortunately, we are not dealing with theatre, but with the real lives and jobs of EU and UK citizens. At this very late stage, we are still determined to facilitate the conclusions of the Withdrawal Agreement provisionally agreed last year. However, this should not be to the detriment of solidarity among Member States, especially as regards Ireland. To be frank, given the additional assurances we provided in December and January, and on Monday, it is difficult to see what more we can do.  Within the limits of our principles and positions, notably as regards citizens’ rights and the Irish backstop, we nevertheless remain open to talks and clarifications, if this can help the ratification process in the UK. These clarifications should not, however, contradict the very intention of the backstop, but only confirm that it is indeed intended to be of a temporary nature.  On the EU side, we are as advanced as possible regarding the conclusion of the Withdrawal Agreement, on which I understand the consent of the European Parliament could be given in a matter of days, should all the clarity needed on the UK side be provided. It is, however, very likely that even if the British Parliament were to vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days, this would have to be accompanied by a request for a technical, time-limited extension. This would mean amending the Agreement and possibly delaying the consent process, as this extension would have to be agreed by the upcoming European Council. When considering such a request, we would expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration. However, I am confident that our institutions will be able to complete this process in good time and consequently ensure the timely entry into force of the agreement.  As I said before, we remain open for talks, as long as there is an end in sight and a purpose to these talks, which means that the UK Government and the British Parliament have to come out with a clear sense of direction as to where there is a majority and of timing as to when it will materialise. In the meantime, the only certainty we have is increased uncertainty for citizens and for businesses, with a clear economic impact in terms of levels of activity, investment and, more importantly, jobs.  It is therefore all the more necessary to continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. In this context, the Council and the Member States at national level are intensifying their work on preparedness and contingency, building on the solid work already underway. I am very much encouraged by the large number of contingency and preparedness—related measures that our institutions have been able to agree, in spite of the heavy workload at this late stage of the mandate.  The President is confident that, with your cooperation, it will be possible to complete the adoption of the remaining contingency measures in due course, but is hoping, at the same time, that they won’t be needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, so here we are. After another vote in the House of Commons, the withdrawal agreement has been voted down. Regardless of the extra clarifications given, regardless of the tremendous effort by Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker to help Theresa May clarify the issues, still the withdrawal agreement was voted down. So again, today, we will be waiting for the next vote in the House of Commons, because the only ones who can give us any direction on where we need to go from here are the Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom. I believe that this House and the Commission remain on the same line – seeking to do as little harm as possible to Europeans, whether they live in the United Kingdom or on the continent. This is our duty: to think about our citizens, to think about our enterprises, to think about our interests, broadly, on both sides of the Channel. I say this because what we have tried to do – what, mainly, Michel Barnier has tried to do – is to make sure that the red lines put on the table by the British Government, and the need for us to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and to maintain the integrity of the internal market, are brought together. And I do not see any better solution than the withdrawal agreement with all the clarifications given. So now, this is where we are. Of course, we will remain in this position of wanting to do as little harm as possible in a very harmful process – because Brexit is very harmful, to the United Kingdom and to the European Union. But it is our duty, on the basis of a vote by the British people, to work towards a Brexit that does as little harm as possible. This position will not change. Today, however, we are in the hands of the British political system. They should tell us where they want to go from here. The solution will have to come from London, and we’ll take it from there. And, of course, there are many other issues Europe has to deal with in the next couple of years, and that is why the European Council is also focusing on other issues. Industrial policy: our industry is strong and it is the engine of our economy. It employs 32 million people and accounts directly for more than two-thirds of our exports. It is one of the main reasons we have partners lining up at our door to secure free and fair trade agreements. But we must do more. We want to see strong European companies, bolstered by fair competition at home, leading in the world and addressing major challenges such as climate change. In particular, we urge Member States to make the most of major common European projects that matter to all of us, for instance in strategic areas such as next-generation batteries to store clean energy, or the work on artificial intelligence. Most importantly, we want to make sure that, as industry and technologies develop, we continue to defend our values because ultimately we are doing all of this in the interest, and for the wellbeing, of all Europeans. That is why we are proposing action on work-life balance, equal pay for equal work in the same place and the European Labour Authority, to give but a few examples. It is all part and parcel of our consistent effort to make our single market of 500 million informed consumers and thriving businesses deeper and fairer. It’s high time to deliver on all its dimensions, particularly in services, the digital economy and energy and also, importantly, the capital markets union. Ce Conseil européen sera aussi l’occasion de parler de notre relation avec la Chine, à quelques jours du sommet Union européenne-Chine. La Chine est à la fois, dans différents domaines politiques, un partenaire de coopération, un partenaire de négociation, un concurrent économique, un rival systémique promouvant des modèles alternatifs de gouvernance. Les autorités chinoises ont exprimé, à maintes reprises, leur volonté de contribuer à un avenir qui soit celui d’une mondialisation économique plus ouverte et plus inclusive. L’Union européenne, pour sa part, est l’une des économies les plus ouvertes au monde, mais elle n’est pas offerte. Elle est un ardent défenseur du multilatéralisme, sur la base de valeurs qui profitent à tous et de règles qui doivent être équitables pour tous, sans pour autant être un adepte naïf du libre-échange. Et c’est la raison pour laquelle nous avons notamment proposé de mettre en place un instrument international sur les marchés publics, afin de promouvoir un accès ouvert aux marchés publics dans le monde entier. C’est dans notre intérêt mutuel de faire en sorte qu’il y ait entre la Chine et l’Union européenne encore plus de confiance et plus de coopération, plus de réciprocité aussi, afin que nos investisseurs et nos entreprises bénéficient en Chine des mêmes conditions d’ouverture que celles offertes aux investisseurs et aux entreprises de Chine en Europe. Malheureusement aujourd’hui ce n’est pas le cas. Il va sans dire que nous avons l’obligation de défendre nos valeurs, nos intérêts stratégiques et de protéger nos industries, nos travailleurs et nos citoyens contre toute concurrence déloyale. C’est pourquoi nous avons proposé d’établir un nouveau cadre pour le filtrage des investissements étrangers, afin de préserver nos actifs stratégiques européens. Je tiens ici à saluer le travail remarquable du Parlement pour l’adoption de cette initiative en un temps record. Il est tout aussi clair que nous avons intérêt, non seulement à préserver, mais aussi à améliorer le système multilatéral existant, notamment sur les questions des aides et des subventions d’État. La Chine doit aussi assumer sa part de responsabilité. Echte Souveränität kann die Europäische Union auch als weltweite Vorreiterin im Klimaschutz zeigen. Bis zum Jahr 2050 können wir der erste große klimaneutrale Wirtschaftsraum der Welt werden und damit Leuchtturm für andere sein. Verantwortung für die Klimaziele zu übernehmen, das heißt für die Kommission, ein Viertel des zukünftigen mehrjährigen Finanzrahmens den Klimazielen zu widmen, unsere Energieeinfuhren bis 2050 mehr als zu halbieren und dafür in erneuerbare Energien zu investieren, niemandem die Existenzgrundlage zu entziehen, denn es ist möglich, Emissionen zu senken und gleichzeitig innovative, hochwertige Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen. Ich danke diesem Hause für seine Unterstützung unserer Vorschläge für nachhaltige Investitionen, auf die wir stolz sein können. Europa übernimmt damit weltweit eine Führungsrolle, wenn es darum geht, private Investitionen umzuorientieren, damit sie zu der Verwirklichung der Ziele des Pariser Abkommens beitragen und damit einen klimaneutralen Weltwirtschaftsraum schaffen. Es bewegt mich, dass viele junge Menschen wieder auf die Straße gehen, um für noch ambitioniertere Ziele zu kämpfen. Das ist wirklich ein Europa, das mir Mut für die Zukunft macht, und ich danke wirklich Greta und allen anderen jungen Leuten für diese Inspiration. (Beifall) Mut brauchen wir auch, um eine der größten Herausforderungen für unsere Demokratien zu bewältigen: die bewussten Versuche, unsere Debatten und unsere Wahlen zu manipulieren. Unsere Botschaft ist: Europa bleibt offen. Die Meinungsfreiheit ist weiterhin unser höchstes Gut. Aber wir sind nicht naiv. Wir sind uns bewusst, dass es Kräfte gibt, die unsere Demokratie untergraben wollen, und das wird im Wahlkampf eine große Herausforderung sein; wir müssen darauf achten. Ich begrüße daher, dass das Europäische Parlament und die Mitgliedstaaten die Maßnahmen der Europäischen Kommission unterstützten, um gegen Desinformation und Eingriffe in unsere Wahlen vorzugehen. Aber wir stehen erst am Anfang, es gibt noch viel zu tun. Denn souverän bleiben wir als Europäische Union nur, wenn wir kompromisslos für unsere Werte aufstehen – innerhalb der Europäischen Union und auch draußen.

Mr President, hello to each and every one of you, on this particular and serious morning, during this long negotiation process. My first words, Madam Minister, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, will be to repeat to you, on behalf of the team that I have the honour of animate with the confidence of President Juncker, my gratitude, and she is sincere and lasting, for the confidence that Parliament shows us, testifies to me. I said earlier, before the Conference of Presidents, that this trust does not fall from the sky, it is not artificial, nor is it given as a blank cheque: it is a trust that is based on dialogue, transparency, from day one, and which will remain based on this transparency and dialogue. Last night's vote, which you and Vice-President Timmermans mentioned, Madam Minister, prolongs and aggravates a major uncertainty that was created almost three years ago by the sovereign decision, which we respect, even if we regret, the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. This uncertainty affects, of course, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland in particular, but it also affects each of our countries and ourselves. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to remind you that the responsibility for the Brexit decision lies solely with the United Kingdom. Today, to break the deadlock in these negotiations, the first responsibility lies with the United Kingdom. This was made clearly and strongly by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, last night, immediately after the vote. Together, we have sought solutions for every problem created by Brexit - and there are countless of them: human and social problems, legal and technical problems, economic and financial problems - in order to manage all the consequences and to accompany the United Kingdom in an orderly exit - this has been our line from the beginning and it will remain our line.  Since the first day of the negotiations, the European Union's objective has been to reduce this uncertainty by ensuring an orderly withdrawal. Then, thanks to this orderly withdrawal and the trust base we create, we must take the necessary time - but a time that will inevitably be framed, between 21 months and 4 years - for another negotiation. I have always said that this other negotiation will be the most important, beyond Brexit and separation: that of the future relationship we want to build with the United Kingdom, which will, of course, remain, in all circumstances, a friendly country, an allied country and a partner country. This is what we have done for months with the Government of the United Kingdom, and never against it, a withdrawal agreement which is obviously in the interest of citizens, businesses and all stakeholders on both sides of the Channel and on both sides of the Irish Sea. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind everyone of a fact. If the UK still wants to leave the European Union, and leave it in an orderly manner, if that is still its will, the treaty we negotiated for a year and a half with Theresa May's government is and will remain the only treaty available. I want that to be understood. In recent days, we have again worked hard, at the request of the British Government, to provide explanations, clarifications and guarantees, in the form of two documents on which we agreed on Monday evening, Mr President, here in the European Parliament's premises in Strasbourg, which welcomed us. Mrs May has indicated that she also wants to issue a unilateral declaration. What was it about on Monday, in this final discussion between the European Union and the British government? The aim was to provide the British Parliament, in the House of Commons, with further clarifications and assurances on a particular point, which is the temporary nature of the safety net. We have gone to the end of what we can do to help the British Government get the support of the House of Commons, with the constant concern, which I have also expressed on your behalf, that of preserving, in any event, peace and stability on the island of Ireland. That of respecting, in all its dimensions, the agreement of Good Friday. It is also for us to preserve the integrity of our internal market, which is that of each of our 28 countries today, soon to be our 27 countries, that is to say to preserve the quality and security to which consumers are entitled for the products they consume, including food, food security, preservation against all animal health risks, the preservation of national budgets and the preservation of national budgets and (which requires tax controls for customs duties and VAT duties), and the security or protection we owe to all companies in each of your countries in respect of compliance with the standards imposed on imported products. I would like to remind you that this is not a theoretical or dogmatic question for Northern Ireland: it is not a question of whether flexibility is being exercised or not, it is an extremely practical issue which touches on peace in Ireland, the peace which must be definitive, and which affects the protection of the internal market. After Brexit, any goods, any live animals that enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain will also enter Poland, Slovenia, Belgium, Germany, each of our countries, since it is the single market and there will be no border. So we have to find a way - and we will take the time to do so - to make these controls operational in the three aspects I have mentioned - consumers, budget, businesses - without obviously recreating a \"hard\" border. On yesterday's vote, I found that some Members wanting a second referendum, others preferring a no deal scenario, trivialised the new legal guarantees we found in our discussion with Theresa May. However, I believe that these guarantees, these explanations, which we agreed on Monday evening with the support of the British Government, are significant. President Juncker said immediately: there will be no further assurances or interpretations. We can't go any further. In conclusion, a word about what will happen from now on. Where are we this morning? The votes announced by the Prime Minister on the no deal tonight, on a possible request for an extension, will take place in the House of Commons. At the end of these votes, it will be up to the British Government to tell us, I hope, in a positive way how it wishes to proceed in order to finally gather a constructive majority on a proposal. The United Kingdom, it is its responsibility, must tell us what it wants for our future relationship, what is its choice, what is, as you said, Madam Minister, the clear line that must be its own. That is the question now that we are waiting for an answer to. And this question arises even before a decision on a possible extension.  Extend this negotiation, for what, since the negotiation on Article 50 is over? We have the treaty, it's here. If this question is asked, we will wait for the answer. I would like to reiterate that the time is very serious, since the risk of the no deal has never been higher: the risk of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a deal, in a disorderly manner, including by accident. I recommend not to underestimate this risk or its consequences. Together, we solemnly call on all concerned to prepare for this. For our part, the European Commission, our general secretariat, President Juncker has given extremely clear instructions in this direction, all Member States, thanks to the work of all the presidencies and yours, Madam Minister in particular, are also preparing for it. We do not want that scenario. We have never worked for this option of an absent agreement or a lack of agreement, a no deal, ever. We have always worked to find an agreement and an orderly withdrawal, but we are ready, the European Union is ready to face this situation. I would like to point out that in the absence of another solution agreed, by default, by the simple operation of the treaties, it is this risk of no deal that is before us. I am asked sometimes, as I was asked this morning, 'Are you disappointed after this vote?' My answer, our answer, will always remain the same. We remain respectful of the UK and its people.

I want to speak about an impression I got when I was in Porto recently and I spoke with young people who had been working for a few years in London. After the political problems and the economic problems in Portugal, they had left the country and had worked there, and then they came back to Portugal because they had so much uncertainty in Great Britain. They are enjoying life again in their home country. They spoke about their friends in Great Britain, and they told me how frustrated the young generation is in Great Britain, how helpless they feel and how angry they are about the failure of the whole political class in Great Britain. A whole generation will suffer because of what is happening today in London. A whole generation has fewer chances for the future. A whole generation will not enjoy the same benefits as the previous generation had, and a whole generation is victim of the political failure of a political class in London. That’s why my message, first of all, is that we, as Europeans, are on the side of the young generation in Great Britain: we won’t leave you alone in this difficult situation. The first message is this. The second concerns what to do now. Preparation is needed for the worst-case scenario. We cannot rescue Great Britain – it’s up to them to decide what they want to do – but we have to prepare for the worst-case scenario. The second thing is that, if the political class fails and there is no majority possible in the UK parliament, the logical next step is to ask the people again. That is, from a democratic point of view, the logical next step. The third option on the table is a debate about prolongation – but for what purpose? We need reasonable arguments for any kind of prolongation. That is why – let me be clear, from my point of view, and from the European People’s Party (EPP) point of view – there is no need for, and no option of, a single day of prolongation if we get no clarification from the British side as to what they want to achieve in that period of time. Those are the three options on the table, but I want to add a further important element. Firstly, the young generation; second, what to do; and the third element is a kind of a fireball. We, as Europeans, are, for the moment, very stable thanks to the work of our representatives: Jean Claude Juncker, Michel Barnier, and, here in the House, President Tajani and Guy Verhofstadt. We are stable, we are strong, we are united. We have a clear opinion of we want to achieve and what we want to do. But there is a risk, in the next few weeks, that the political uncertainty in London could also infect the European decision-making process. There is a risk of this, and we need to bear two aspects in mind. One is that, again and again, discussion in the European Council is mainly about Brexit, and not about China, not about trade or Trump, and not about the real issues which are important to the citizens of this European Union. That’s why we cannot continue like this, with political space occupied only by the political uncertainty in London. The second thing is that the European elections are ahead of us. We are all preparing the campaign, indeed a few of us are already in it, and what we have to clarify is that the European elections are a place and a moment where Europeans will decide about their future. That moment cannot be occupied by legal and political uncertainty with the Brexit situation, and that’s why I think we are running out of time. That’s why the Brits must clarify – hopefully by the next Council meeting – what they want to achieve, what they want to have in the future.  For those in the European Union who believe in the project of the European Union, this development is certainly an important wake-up call. We see the economic and political uncertainty in London, and those who don’t want to follow that path now need to fight against the populists and the extremists on this continent. Brexit was made by populism, by easy answers, and they cannot give us any kind of answer now as to how they want to deal with this Brexit outcome. That is why, for the European elections, we now need to form a strong coalition: a confirmation of partnership in Europe, a confirmation about the common basis for the future of this continent, a confirmation that we believe in the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent report The Spring Summit is, in classic, the place where we agree on the economic situation in the European Union. We have already spoken this morning about climate change, and I have an appeal to the Commission and an appeal to the Council representatives: we do not have time. Let us make this spring summit a sustainability summit! Franz Timmermans is right. We must not wait to combat climate change, we must review our instruments, we must make the Stability and Growth Pact a sustainability pact, and the instruments we have to measure and recommend – the semester and what things are technically called – must become sustainability instruments. That must be the answer to the situation this spring. And I ask all those who have influence to work with us to ensure that this paradigm shift, which we urgently need, finally comes in. We need to get back to where, 20 years ago – today he bears the central responsibility for the United Nations – Antonio Guterres began to think together with the proposal – then under the Portuguese Presidency – to think together about economics, ecology, social cohesion and competitiveness. We have lost two decades. It is time to catch up with this time with a new throw for politics, for the European Union. And if it is so, Manfred Weber, that young people from London are suddenly back in Portugal, then this has something to do with the development of this country. The current Head of Government, Antonio Costa, has brought Portugal to a new flowering with a policy of social cohesion, economic modernisation and environmental policy. These are not opposites. And he did so at a time when the European People's Party and other hardliners wanted to impose sanctions on Portugal. We need this change. Let's be honest! Our societies need fresh energy, our economy needs air to breathe, and our minds need fresh thinking. Be ready! Then we no longer need to talk about Brexit, nor do we need to talk about consequential skirmishes that are taking place elsewhere. That is the answer to Brexit – no matter what happens now, in these many technical details. This must be the European response to Brexit: have fresh courage and come up with a new concept – with the people and not against the people! In any case, this is the programme that we, as the Socialist Group, are working for. Brexit has become an extremely critical situation. We know this, we can only appeal for the House of Commons to make a sensible decision against a hard Brexit. Anything else would be a decision against the people of Britain. We can only hope that Parliament can agree beyond the various groups for a policy, indeed to keep Britain close to the European Union. But if that does not work, if this Parliament remains blocked, then the people of Britain owe it something. Take back control, Theresa May, then means that people must be allowed to make decisions. When parliamentarians can no longer do their jobs because they can no longer communicate, people must have a chance to make a new decision. For it is their future and not just the future of parliamentarians. This must be put on the agenda, it must be discussed. The summit should address two important issues: the fact that our European elections are free and fair. I appeal to do more here. What has been done so far is not enough. Self-commitments of the Internet companies will not suffice. Finally, the asylum package is back on the agenda. It is a real, real outrage that we are not reacting here and that we continue to die in the Mediterranean without taking action.

Monsieur Barnier, vous avez dit qu’il n’y avait aucun autre traité possible que le vôtre. I don’t think this is true. I think there is a better solution and that better solution is to keep Britain in the European Union. (Applause) Let me tell you, please, how you can help do this. First of all, let’s stop bashing London. There are experts in this House who continually bash London. Here’s one, Mr Farage; and there’s one, Mr Verhofstadt. There’s no difference in their approach and their criticism of London. Secondly, I think it is time that the Commission finally admits that they have some responsibility for Brexit. Britain was always in favour of subsidiarity, decentralisation and competitiveness, and Brussels has continuously violated these principles. It is like a country joining a football club that then decided to play golf or hockey. So, finally, who has really left whom? Thirdly, from a business perspective, we have to recognise that Brexit is not only a disaster for Britain, it is also a disaster for the European Union. Let’s face it, Britain is today the largest single customer of the European Union and Britain leaving is the equivalent of 19 small or medium—sized countries leaving at the same time. Let’s also recognise that, in this House, Britain has always been the advocate for freedom, self—reliance and competitiveness. Without Britain in the European Union, I tell you that this European Union will remain uncompetitive compared to other regions like North America, Asia, China, Japan, South East Asia, and so on. So I think the Commission now has a historic chance to do something. Help the Remainers in Britain to go for a second referendum, and help the Brexiteers to change their mind so they can save their face. I ask you not only to support, but to offer an extension to, Britain without any conditions. That is number one. Number two: offer them some more autonomy over controlling their own immigration. That would be the trick to get Britain successfully to organise a second referendum and to stay in the European Union. The European Union will never be complete without Britain.

When a big country like the UK leaves the European Union, it’s difficult to say ‘Oh, what a fantastic thing’. It is the opposite. I think that the place of the UK is inside the European Union, and I’m also pretty sure that there will be a generation in the coming years, in the coming decades, who will return to the European Union. I am sure that this young generation already exists in the UK and that they will take a decision other than that taken by this government and this majority. But, Mr Henkel, may I ask you to tell this to your own friends in your own group, in the ECR, who are the main people in favour of a Brexit for the moment. It is rather easy to give lessons to us here, and especially to me, and to say ‘Yeah, you don’t like Britain’ – and in fact the opposite is true – but not to be capable of convincing your own people in your own group, who are not here for the moment to applaud you, I see. Nobody is there. Secondly, the reality, Mr Henkel, is the following. What started this whole Brexit was, in fact, an attempt by the Conservative Party – and you’re working with the Conservative Party, you know them very well – to ‘take back control’. That was the big slogan of the Brexiteers and it is still their big slogan. It seems to me that Britain is spinning out of control, instead of being back in control. I think, Mr Henkel, that the only reasonable way to solve this problem – and you didn’t talk about it unfortunately – is through cross-party cooperation in British politics, as soon as possible, through a compromise, a common view, between Labour and the Conservatives. How you do you go about solving an existential problem like Brexit if it is used by both parties to kill each other? For them, Brexit is a bullet in a weapon and not an existential problem of a country and of a whole continent, and that’s a shame. (Applause) So our appeal, and yours, in this plenary has to be not to attack one or other of our colleagues but to say this to the British political class: start to make an agreement between the two big parties and start to have an opinion that we can support here in this Parliament, and that opinion will be for a close relationship between the UK and the EU. That is the way forward. What is needed is that, in British politics, Queen and country should be put first, instead of the party politics that are governing the UK and the House of Commons for the moment. And that brings me to the next question, of an extension. I don’t want a long extension and I say that to you very openly. Why go beyond the European elections? If we do so, the European elections will be hijacked by the Brexiteers and by the whole Brexit issue. We will talk only about that, and not about the real problems and about the real reforms that we need in the European Union. The other thing we will do is to give a new mandate to Mr Farage: that’s the only thing that we going to do. (Noise) That’s exactly what he wants, and why does he want it? For two reasons. First of all, he can continue to have a salary that he can transfer to his offshore company. (Murmurs) And, secondly, he can continue to do his dirty work in the European Union: that is to try to destroy the European Union from within. That is the real purpose. And that is absolutely what we don’t need. What we do need now is certainty from the House of Commons, from a majority in the House of Commons, as Mr Henkel has also asked for. That is what we need. I am against every extension, whether of a day, a week or even 24 hours, if it is not based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons on something so that we know they want. Is that less ambitious than the deal? Okay, it is less ambitious than the deal, that’s your opinion. If it is a customs union, it is a customs union. If it is the deal, it is the deal. If it is a Norway-plus, it’s a Norway-plus. But, please, make up your mind in London because this uncertainty cannot continue, not for us, not for Britain, and certainly not for our citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again the President of the European Council has decided to snub our Assembly. Is this really surprising given the particularly meagre record of heads of state or government, those whom Donald Tusk likes to appoint leaders? Since 2015, not a Council meeting has gone by without discussing the issue of asylum and migration, which Donald Tusk has sought to prioritise. After more than three years, we could have legitimately expected the Council to provide a concerted response to this challenge. What nenni! The Commission has just concluded that it will not conclude anything. Heads of state or government show their inability or rather their lack of willingness to get along. As a reminder, it took Parliament half as long to find a majority of more than two-thirds around a common approach combining solidarity and responsibility. We are still waiting for them, the leaders. Where is the leadership, when the scientific world gives us twelve years, no more, to act decisively to save the climate and little more to save biodiversity? Again, leaders are simply deaf, blind and dumb in the face of the anger of Europe's youth. We are still waiting for the first meeting of the Council, which will put this at the heart of its discussions. Where is the leadership, when more and more of our fellow citizens stand up to reject a society where wealth is concentrated in an ever smaller number of hands? These inequalities are the result of fiscal and social competition between Member States, the flexibilisation of the labour market, the digital revolution and a savage globalisation. We are still waiting for this issue to be put on the agenda of the leaders. They are not even at the point of awareness yet. Where is the leadership, when within the European Council a growing number of leaders - always them - deliberately choose to undermine the foundations of our democracy: separation of powers, independence of the press and justice, respect for privacy, respect for the principles of necessity and proportionality in restrictions on civil or individual freedoms or in the use of violence to suppress demonstrations? While this Parliament denounces these serious abuses and has, for example, called on the Council to open proceedings against the Hungarian government, we expect something more, Madam, than a polite response. In any case of Brexit - and that this subject ceases to be a distraction - ladies and gentlemen, waiting is no longer an option. We cannot perpetually expect the good will of those who present themselves as leaders but who are in fact followers in the best hypothesis. The real leadership today, ladies and gentlemen, is to put the preservation of our environment, social and economic justice and the defence of democracy and our freedoms at the heart of political action and European construction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you are all familiar with the film 'And every day the marmot salutes'. I remember that when I think of the forthcoming Council summit, which in turn will be overshadowed by the debate on the consequences of Brexit and the way in which the negotiations between the EU and the UK are moving forward or are being blocked.  Important issues are on the agenda: the EU itself has been one of the initiators and main actors in the creation of the Paris climate deal. The EU is responsible for ensuring that there is a UN agreement on sustainable development. These should be the issues we are dealing with, because then, as the EU, we would be able to make real progress, influence things and ultimately influence people globally, both within the EU and in terms of what is happening around us. That would be our responsibility as the European Union.  Instead, we are faced with the fact that, for the second time, the withdrawal agreement has failed in the House of Commons. Theresa May's British government's strategy has gone against the wall. We do not have a political majority in favour of an orderly exit from the EU. That is the conclusion. We do not have a majority in favour of an orderly exit from the EU. The consequences are primarily for the people of the United Kingdom, the EU, the UK citizens in the EU, the EU citizens in the UK and the Irish citizens in both the Republic of Ireland and the North of Ireland, because most of them do not have the chance to move their companies' headquarters from London to Belfast in the short term – obviously because they expect Belfast to somehow remain in the EU. Most also do not have the chance to simply move their assets or investment opportunities elsewhere. And most do not have the chance to quickly ensure, within their own family, that family members are granted citizenship of an EU Member State – that is not possible for most people. Most suffer from this, because of their access to health care, because of the impact on education, because of the social impact, because of the impact that the whole thing will have on people, especially in economic and structural terms, on the development of their regions.  We, as the EU, should above all feel obliged to them, the citizens. We must make offers not to the government in London, not to the House of Commons in London, but to the citizens. That is our obligation, and that is why we should also stand up for it here, and I believe that there are two consequences that we need to talk about: if we are preparing for 29 March, for the unorderly exit, namely this mad Friday, which we will obviously get, then it means that we must ensure that citizens' rights are seerated. In other words, we must do something to ensure that the rights of citizens in the UK and those in the EU are not jeopardised. We have a duty here. We have taken responsibility and made commitments here, and now we have to deliver on them. It is high time that we made this clear.  And we must continue to signal firm support for the Republic of Ireland and make it clear that we are opposed to a hard border and any change to the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and that the rights and security of the people in this part of Europe must not be jeopardised.  There is, however, a very simple solution to the backstop problem: no borders on the island of Ireland, no controls, no trees. Irish unity would be the simplest solution. Then the EU would no longer have a problem, the Irish would no longer have a problem, and the Brexiteers would have none at all. That would be a solution. The British Government has today begun to declare that there are no controls between the Republic of Ireland and the north of Ireland. Perhaps it is now relying on this solution itself.

Mr Barnier, I told you that treaty wouldn’t go through the House of Commons, you didn’t believe me, it’s been rejected and I think you pushed your luck too far. You ask for too much and this morning you find yourself short of GBP 39 billion, so I’m sure you’re feeling a bit sore about that, but don’t worry, help is at hand – because the House of Commons today will do I’m sure their utmost to betray the Brexit vote. They’re even going to vote against what Article 50 said, which is of course that we leave on 29 March with or without a deal. I have to say I think the gap now between our political class in the UK and public opinion is a gaping chasm because be in no doubt, public opinion is hardening. There is a greater sense of unity in the country than I’ve seen for some years. We simply want to leave. That applies to many who voted remain as well – because they respect the very principle of democracy. We’ve had enough. We’ve seen the snarling anger towards our country of Mr Verhofstadt, the bureaucratic intransigence of Mr Barnier, the constant stream of insults that come from Mr Tusk, and we’re of one mind: we don’t want to be governed by you. We want to govern ourselves. I’m sure the next instalment of this will be the British Prime Minister, next Thursday, going to the European summit in Brussels and another humiliating display where she begs for an extension to Article 50. Well, I’ve got a solution to all of this. When I heard you, Mr Barnier, say this morning that if this Withdrawal Agreement gets passed and the next phase of negotiations could last for up to four years, I thought, ‘enough’. We don’t want to waste four more years of our lives – four more years of agony. You don’t want to waste another four years. You’ve got your plan – you want a ‘United States of Europe’, you want your army, you want everyone to join the euro, you want to get rid of the nation states – we’re just a damned nuisance. Add to that, as Mr Verhofstadt said, the European elections. You don’t want me coming back here, or hordes of eurosceptics coming back here, so there is a simple solution and that is that the British request to extend is vetoed at that European summit and we leave on 29 March. Most of the preparations have been done. Even if there are a few short-term bumps in the road, we leave and both you and we can get on with the rest of our lives. That is the only neat solution ahead of us.

The principal one being that we cannot leave without the mythical good deal.

Mr Juncker has already told Her Majesty’s Government – like naughty schoolchildren – that there will be no third chance to renegotiate.

The greater the admiration someday, the greater the disappointment today, because two weeks before the date we have party games, impossibilism in the selection of the majority in favor of a positive solution. Most of it is not a political art. I do not understand politicians who strike out non-contractual parting of scenarios while voting against the agreement – the only one on the table. So there is growing uncertainty, as a cost, on both sides of the channel – human and business, including the uncertainty of the fate of about a million of my compatriots who have found a better life in the British Isles, a better job.

It has been a big mistake not to try to bring all the forces in the House together in the interests of the country. Instead, the UK Government has decided to appease the Tories’ hard Brexiteers, a strategy that backfired spectacularly last night. Mr Henkel, you are wrong. As Michel Barnier said, the EU has always been a fair, transparent and constructive partner in this negotiation. We have done all we can to guarantee an orderly withdrawal of the UK that protects citizens. We have a specific and particular responsibility to keep protecting all the European citizens in this process and to preserve the peace process in Northern Ireland.  We have also taken into account, of course, the UK Government red lines. Let me repeat this: this is the only withdrawal treaty that is possible and the only one that could command an approval in this House. So what’s next? First, we still trust the UK parliamentarians today to reject a no-deal Brexit. That would be catastrophic for the UK. Second, we need a clear direction on how, concretely, to avoid the no deal scenario. We always said that a closer EU-UK relationship based on a customs union would not only benefit our economies, but would also solve many of the concerns associated with the backstop. It is time to stop party politics and to work constructively in the interests of citizens and the country and if this is not possible, it is clear that the only alternative is to give the people the chance to change the government or to say no to Brexit.  This is the debate we need to have, not the debate on the length of the extension. This, for us is clear: the extension is a tool and all the options are on the table as long as there is a clear political reason and perspective.

We consider the withdrawal agreement and its backstop to be the ‘least worst’ option that the people can accept. That has been totally rejected – again by the reckless political establishment in Britain. The European Union has committed to supporting the Good Friday Agreement, in all of its parts. That includes the legitimate, democratic pathway to Irish unity and, despite what Jim Nicholson said, it is a provision of the Good Friday Agreement. The British Prime Minister herself believes that Brexit is increasing support for Irish unity. The European Council said, in April 2017, that if Ireland is reunited then the whole island will remain a part of the EU. I remind the Council and the Commission of that. The EU has said that we need to prepare for a no-deal, for a crash. Who in their right mind would sit on a train that is going over a cliff or being dangerously delayed or derailed?

There is a coalition in the House of Commons that is unable to achieve a common positive majority. There are the Remainers who don't want a deal because they're hoping for a referendum and are playing hard. There are those, the Farages of this world, who do not want a deal with the European Union at all. And there are those who view this for partisan political reasons. There were three Labour people who voted 'yes'. On this basis, there is currently no majority in favour of a constructive solution in the House of Commons. That is why the two major parties must finally talk to each other. They must prove to us where there is a majority, a constructive majority, which is worth talking about. I believe that we cannot extend the deadline unless this clarification is there. No extension without clarification. It must be clearly regulated here. Just prolonging and looking at what happens then does not seem to me to be appropriate. And I believe that the House of Commons needs to come to a clarification in the next fortnight in order to move forward on that basis. We need this security after we had to negotiate these two or two and a half years as we negotiated, because the conditions were never there in the United Kingdom. Michel, thank you very much for the work you have done, that the Commission has done, your team has done. However, I believe that we could have put our hands up, but nothing would have been adopted in the House of Commons because, for the reasons I have given, there is this negative majority. More was impossible and nothing more could be delivered if the interests of the European Union were not to be violated. And it must also be clear what comes with open borders now.

We must therefore give voice to the British citizens. I appeal to the fellow members of the House of Commons to face the fundamental question of giving voice to the British people, of hearing their voices, of knowing where they want to go. It is clear that the Commons is blocked, they cannot define what they want. The only way out is to give the citizens a voice and hear their opinion, even though many of our pro-Brexit colleagues here are afraid to give people a voice. The second issue that is very important, and certainly more important than Brexit, for the future of the Union is that of climate change.

Not only to implement the far too low ambitions of 2030, but above all to raise those ambitions. If we want to do Paris, if we want to honour Paris, then we will have to do 55% by 2030 and be completely carbon neutral by 2050. In order to achieve this, it is also important that we come to a climate law at European level which incorporates our commitments made in Paris and which entails important obligations for all Member States, so that there can be no freeriders.

It’s up to Member States to consider how robust our economies are and how ready are they for an adverse economic environment, a slow-down in economic growth and possibly other implications.  The second important thing for me is China. Our representatives should be more assertive. They should more clearly articulate our legitimate interest and negotiate accordingly.

A reduced majority, but still the fourth most devastating defeat in history for a UK government. Last night Theresa May set out three options. The first was to revoke Article 50 – possibly the first time those words have passed her lips in public. Secondly, she talked about holding a second referendum. Ditto. And don’t underestimate the significance of her saying those words. The third option was to negotiate a new deal. I think, though, that the message has finally got through in Westminster that the third option is not possible in any sensible timeframe. So now it’s down to no deal or no Brexit. It seems very likely that tonight the UK parliament will reject no deal. They will not reject no Brexit. Of course, we have a limited direct role here, we have to choose our language carefully, we’re giving signals. So let me assure colleagues here that there is a strong will in the UK for a second vote. The People’s Vote campaign is the biggest grassroots pro-EU European movement. Polls show a majority in favour of a second referendum. Like all things Brexit, it won’t be easy, but don’t believe the voices you’ve heard from the Brits here today. Seven out of nine speakers today represent only 1.5% of the seats in the House of Commons. They are spouting their usual rot and nonsense. They are not the patriots. They are the ones advocating a no-deal Brexit, and that’s an act of unparalleled harm to the British people and the European Union. They are not the patriots. Nobody calling themselves a patriot would advocate that kind of harm. No one laying claim to the title unionist would advocate a no-deal Brexit. No one who wants to support the Good Friday Agreement would advocate a no-deal Brexit. They are not in the majority – actually they are all in the bar coalescing around a beer now.

But for a majority in the House of Commons that was not the main problem with her deal. There were other problems and she made no attempts to address those issues. She only tried to appease the right wing of her party and she failed. So where does that leave us? A majority in the House of Commons does not want to leave without a deal, but the only deal on the table has been rejected. Where do you go from there? Logically, there are only two possibilities: either you negotiate an alternative deal or you reconsider Brexit. The chances of an alternative deal look vanishingly small at the moment. Reconsidering Brexit needs a referendum and, as we just heard from Ms Girling, there is a majority in public opinion that wants another referendum and opinion polls show that, if there were another referendum, the British people would vote to remain in the European Union. It’s absolute folly to proceed with Brexit on the ground that it is the will of the people when it may very well no longer be the will of the people. It’s at least worth checking.

The economic, environmental, social, technological and democratic challenges can only be tackled jointly in Europe across party lines and through a united Europe in the world. That is what the election to the European Parliament is all about. That is what the composition of the next Commission is all about.

Let us look at the murders of journalists in Malta and Slovakia, the blocked constitutional procedure against Hungary and Poland, the EU bashing of populists and nationalists in Hungary, Italy, the Czech Republic and Romania. The European idea is being jeopardised from within. We must reject the threat from within in the european parliament elections.

They will go out of business. Also, we all know that if there’s a crash—out then the hard—won peace which we’ve enjoyed for the last 20 years is also in mortal danger. Therefore, I hope that today in the House of Commons they will vote to avoid a ‘no deal’, a crash—out. If they do, I think that we should immediately offer an extension – and not be putting conditions on it. We should offer it. Because we can do so for three months without interfering in any way with our elections. As my colleague, Jim Nicholson, said, this will help them to find another way – and maybe that way will be to stay. Now wouldn’t that be a countenance devoutly to be wished?

This has been the intention of the Commission from the start, this has been the way Michel Barnier has been negotiating from the start, and we feel strengthened in our approach by the debates here today. Having listened to Mr Farage and his colleagues, and seeing the hubris with which he stands here and the self-gratification of his position, I sometimes wonder whether he has gone to Sunderland and talked to the workers at the Nissan plant and said to them, ‘It might cost you your job, sorry, but I’ll get my pipe dream of so—called sovereignty’. Has he done that? Has he gone to Oxford to the Mini plant and said, ‘I know what BMW are thinking if there’s a no—deal Brexit, but I want it so badly, this no—deal Brexit, that I really don’t care about your job’. Has he done that? That would have been the honest thing to do, I suppose. (Applause) Has Dr Liam Fox ever said, ‘Well, I said it would be the easiest trade deal in human history but, on second thoughts, it’s much more complicated than I promised before the referendum’? Has Boris Johnson gone to the doctors and nurses of the NHS and said, ‘I did promise you an extra GBP 350 million a week but, sorry, I can’t deliver on that promise’? Have they done that? I think, frankly, if we want to come out of this situation, we would need a bit more modesty and honesty on all sides. (Applause) I just referred to a report by the UK Government, published in November last year, where it said that a no—deal Brexit would cost approximately 9.3% of economic growth. Are you willing to pay that price? I ask the Brexiteers: are you willing to pay that price? Are you willing to sacrifice all those jobs for your pipe dream of so—called sovereignty? What is that sovereignty going to bring to you if you live that pipe dream?

I did listen to Mr Coburn and he says ‘liberty is more important’. Then have the courage and go to Sunderland and talk to the workers in the Nissan plant. Talk to the workers in Oxford in the Mini plant and tell them, ‘My so—called liberty is more important than your jobs’. Have the courage to do that, sir. Then also go to Ireland and go to a place where, since 1998, peace reigns and violence has disappeared and tell the people there ‘My pipe dream is more important than your peace and quiet. My pipe dream is more important and I will accept a hard border if that gives me my no—deal Brexit’. Have that courage. Do you know the number 16.1 million? I never hear it mentioned. I always hear 17.4 million. Yes. But 16.1 million are also British citizens who voted to stay. They haven’t disappeared. Isn’t the essence of European democracy that we also respect the position of minorities in our countries? Isn’t the essence of democracy that we try to build bridges and to find solutions that can be carried by most people in our society? Should those not be the next steps we take in this?  To be very clear: why does the Commission stand so firm for the integrity of the internal market? Why don’t we simply say ‘let’s have open borders’? I give you one example. If for some reason the United Kingdom would decide to have a trade deal with the United States on their terms and chlorinated chicken would be coming into the United Kingdom and we would not be able to check that at the European border, then we would not be able to say to European citizens that we could protect them against something they didn’t want. We could never do that. That’s why we have always to protect the integrity of the internal market. We’ve been bending over backwards and we spared no effort – and I do pay tribute to Michel Barnier – to try and reconcile Mrs May’s red lines and her demands with our firm duty to protect the European Union and the integrity of the internal market. The withdrawal agreement is the best and only possible solution to that dilemma and I hope that this is something that will be well understood. This is a position the Commission defends on your behalf. The vast majority of this Parliament supports this and we will continue to do that: to protect the interests of European citizens, whether they live on the continent or in the United Kingdom.

This is currently lacking. The length of any extension should depend on this vision, and also on the extent to which the European block would want to negotiate. The European side still needs to make its position more transparent. For instance, regarding the backstop for Northern Ireland, is it true that an approach modelled on the situation between West and East Germany in the past has been ignored? If so, why? However, if the withdrawal agreement is indeed not negotiable, it would not make sense to allow the continuation of the negotiations for a much longer period going, say, beyond EU election day.

Since last July, I have met my counterpart, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, five times to review the implementation of the work programme identified in the joint statement. At our meeting last week, we evaluated progress in the work streams of the executive working group and I debriefed him on the process for adoption of the EU’s negotiating authorisations. I conveyed to him that there is momentum in the Council to conclude, in the weeks ahead, the discussions on authorisation for both negotiations – one on elimination of tariffs on industrial products and the other one on conformity assessment. I expressed our commitment fully to respect the implementation of the joint statement as it stands, and reiterated that future negotiations would not touch upon agriculture. I am sure that this House is fully aware of the importance of the transatlantic trade relationship, which has been and will remain a central artery of the world economy. The carefully defined, narrow and meaningful agenda of the working group can be to our mutual advantage. Given the size of the EU-US trade relationship, elimination of tariffs, even though they are today already moderately low, will lead to important cost reductions for economic operators. Many industrial sectors on both sides of the Atlantic operate with small profit margins due to the size and efficiency of our respective markets. A limited yet very meaningful agreement on industrial goods and tariffs would give transatlantic companies of all sizes a comparative advantage and would support their global capacity to compete. We estimate an increase in bilateral EU-US export of 8%, and respectively 9%, and that is around EUR 26 billion, so quite a lot of money.  In a different strand, our work on conformity assessment, standards and regulatory issues could leverage the resulting economic benefits for a free-trade agreement for industrial products. We launched consultations with stakeholders last week, inviting them to come forward with proposals, and we’re looking forward to receiving their support for our discussions with the USA in this field. I am fully aware that some of you here fear we will be negotiating under threat. In that regard, I would like to assure you that I have conveyed a very clear message to our counterparts – as late as last week and also before that – that unilateral trade actions from the USA on EU imports would risk damaging our efforts to strengthen transatlantic relations at a critical time. I’ve also made it clear that, while it would not be of our choosing, if the USA did take unilateral trade measures against us we would immediately respond. Indeed, the negotiations would stop – that is clearly provided for in the draft negotiating directive – and we would also promptly adopt rebalancing measures. I hope, of course, that wisdom will prevail, and that this will not happen, so we can continue to work towards a mutually beneficial outcome to build this relationship. The timely adoption of these mandates would be an important signal of the EU’s good faith in relation to honouring the joint presidential statements last July: no more, no less. Delay in the adoption risks initiating an unconstructive cycle of exchanges and allegations on the EU’s commitment to the joint statement. So I sincerely hope that you will support our negotiations with the USA. Your support is, of course, very important. It would show unity among the EU institutions, and unity is our strength. In contrast, and this is important, a vote by this House against these limited negotiations would be a vote against the well-balanced and proportionate approach of the July statement, which we deployed to reduce trade tensions. It would therefore be a vote in favour of maintaining current trade tensions with the USA at a time when ideas to bring down these tensions are on the table. Especially regarding cars, as we have included that in our proposal, it is much better for the transatlantic relationship to bring car tariffs down to zero percent. It’s better for the producers, for the workers and consumers: much better than slapping additional tariffs on cars and car parts. Let me assure you that I will listen very carefully to this debate, to your ideas and recommendations, and I would reiterate that, once we have started negotiations, we will actively be informing this House on a regular basis on all aspects of our discussions, as we always do.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 125, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Godelieve QUISTHOUDT-ROWOHL", "mepid": "1055", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to express my respect for you.

I therefore recommend that this House behave responsibly in tomorrow's vote and speak out in favour of such a mandate.

But anyone who suddenly demands that the Commission show a hard edge, only this language can understand Trump, does not care about all those who have to bear the damage every day through possible sanctions, be it on cars or other products.

For instance, the elimination of high tariffs on manufactured goods, such as clothing and footwear, would open up opportunities for EU exporters and increase the international competitiveness of our industries. In addition, our SMEs would benefit from the elimination of duplicate testing, inspection and certification requirements that would be possible with a conformity assessment agreement. I would add, however, one crucial condition for these negotiations: they cannot be successfully concluded without the tariffs on steel and aluminium being removed. More clarity is also needed on the inclusion of the automotive sector, as it is key to ensuring World Trade Organisation compatibility, and on how the rules of origin will work.

It doesn’t quite add up, and the escalations in our trade relations with the US have serious consequences. It is therefore crucial to keep talking and to try to come to agreements. Somebody has to be the adult in the room. For those in the House who do not want to support the European Commission here, I hope you understand that it will be gladly explained by Ambassador Sondland and other officials of the Trump administration as proof of the EU’s inability to make decisions, and that is not in our interest.

Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, President Trump recently threatened us as the European Union: 'I will tariff the hell out ouf you' if we do not agree to a trade agreement on its terms. That sounds like a saying from a bad Western. You yourself said in the Mirror a year ago, \"We don't negotiate until Trump takes the gun off our chests,\" and now they want to capitulate?  I am disappointed that you have proposed to the Council that you be given a negotiating mandate for an agreement, despite the increased threat of punitive tariffs on cars. They are even throwing their own principles overboard: although the substantial agreement is supposed to cover more than 90% of all goods traded between the EU and the US, you are refusing to study the economic, social and environmental consequences. There is not even a standard chapter with rules for the protection of workers and the environment in the production of these goods. There is no consultation with the public. You are also closing your eyes to Trump's decision to leave the Paris climate agreement – my colleagues have already spoken about it. According to our principles, the Trump administration has thus disqualified itself as a negotiating partner. You know what Trump is up to. He wants to force the opening up of our market to American agricultural goods. But that would be the end for thousands of our farmers, and for our sustainable agriculture as well. Have you forgotten the TTIP protests of millions of Europeans? In return, he does not want to give anything, but only renounces the imposition of punitive duties on cars at that time.

We talked about liquefied natural gas (LNG). There is a desire for many European countries to buy American LNG instead of LNG from other important partners and the Americans agreed to facilitate that. That is a decision to be taken by every Member State and their companies. Of course, it is not the Commission buying gas. The increase of soya beans is also a result of markets. The Commission is not buying soya beans and stocking them in the Berlaymont building. This is market policy because it has changed quite considerably. We agreed to accept the American sustainability scheme in full compliance with the directive. We also agreed that we would cooperate to reform the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We have disagreements there as well, but we also have a process where we work with the Americans and the Japanese to try to write new WTO rules in order to counter some of the state capitalism from China, for instance. That work is ongoing. We also agreed that we would cooperate on some regulatory matters in full transparency, voluntarily, with full respect for our respective protective systems. We agreed that we would seek negotiations on two limited – but still important – agreements. One on the conformity assessment – and I haven’t heard anybody question that here today – and the other one would be on a limited agreement, a tariff on industrial goods. This is what we are asking you to give your opinion on here. In the proposed mandates, there are clear conditions. We could not conclude anything if the tariffs on steel and aluminium were not lifted before we try to conclude. There would be no additional tariffs under 232, for instance, on cars. In the course of these negotiations, we will also do an external study on an impact assessment on sustainability. We will – and we have already started to – consult with civil society. It is crystal clear in this mandate – and by accepting it, you would make it even clearer in writing – that agriculture is not included in the negotiations. It is a limited agreement that we are asking for on industrial goods, including fisheries and cars. That would make it WTO compatible and the sums are not negligible for the European Union either, so we are not giving anything away. It is not, however, a full free trade agreement. It is not taking TTIP out of the freezer. TTIP is really far down in the freezer. For different reasons, it was not possible to advance under the Obama administration and it is not possible in any foreseeable future to advance now either and, of course (you too have mentioned it), also because the US have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement. As I said, there are several disagreements with the Trump administration, but the US – the US people, the US elected assemblies, the US nation – is a friend of the European Union and we have every interest to try to find areas where we can cooperate, where we can talk, and where we can have a dialogue. This is the unanimous will of the European Council as well. That’s why we are asking you to agree on these two negotiating mandates.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, discussions on the European Semester are always very politically charged. As the elections approach, they may become even more political. Indeed, the questions we have to ask ourselves in the context of the Semester are precisely those questions that make us confess political colour: \"What is the state of our economy?\", \"What are the big challenges?\", \"What priorities do we put first?\" and above all \"How do we ensure that we can pass on the welfare states we have to our children?\". Ladies and gentlemen, some of you will want to push for more investment. Others of you will ask for more budgetary discipline. Still others will propose to make the reins more celebrated. As a true Christian Democrat, I am already starting the debate. I think the best course is a sensible combination of all these options. There is no message about half-truths and easy solutions today. It is important that we tell the full story to them and to our children. As it happens, my two-year-old son is here to visit today and tomorrow. It's also for him that I'm standing here today. I want to make sure that in the future it is that welfare state that can protect him and his loved ones, even when things get tough, and if he gets sick, heal, and guarantee a fair pension, when he can re-end his life that he has built. It is that future, this great story, that legacy of decades of building the prosperity and well-being of our citizens, that is at stake. After all, ageing is one of the most important demographic developments of the 21st century. In itself, there has been tremendous progress, but it is accompanied by enormous challenges. Firstly, the cost of pensions, health care and care for the elderly will increase enormously in the coming decades and this is going to put enormous pressure on our coffers. Secondly, the ageing population is also causing proportionally fewer people to work and therefore fewer people being able to help finance all these costs. That puts our coffers under pressure a second time. So it is time to intervene, and I believe that on three fronts at once. We need to invest, and structurally reform, and get our budgets in order. Firstly, – I think it really starts there – a healthy treasury. We need to build fiscal buffers to protect ourselves from the rising costs of ageing. More older people automatically means more pensions, more health care costs and more costs for elderly care. We really need to prepare for this. If not, we'll turn the whole bill on to the next generation. Secondly, it is important to implement structural reforms that will reduce the costs of an ageing society, and thereby putting the proportionally smaller group to work as much as possible at working age. Employers need to be able to hire and fire employees more quickly. Employees should be able to switch between different forms of work more easily. My parents are still from the generation in which they worked for the same employer all their lives. That model is already under pressure. We're seeing that today. And our children, I think, will simply not know that model anymore. Politics must therefore create a framework to make that transition easier. To make employees more flexible and resilient, constant training, retraining and lifelong learning will have to become the new standard, whether we like it or not. Finally, if we really want to tackle the ageing population on this European continent, then investment in the future is crucial, not only in human capital, as I have correctly indicated, but also in future productivity, to ensure our economic growth. We need investment in research and development, in innovation and digitisation, in infrastructure projects. Wise investing today means harvesting tomorrow. That is the path we need to chart with the European Semester. A socio-economic compass that ensures that we do not get off the path and that offers a real guarantee of a sustainable future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 161, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Marian HARKIN", "mepid": "28116", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, first of all, can I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation, which I believe has led to a balanced report. There are a few amendments submitted and I think that, with the exception of one, I can support all of them. They don’t significantly change the content or the tone of the report, but they do improve it. So, first of all, can I say how important it is for the Employment Committee to have its own separate report on the Annual Growth Survey, because we have a different perspective to that of the Economic Committee. They are complementary, but they have a different emphasis, and this report, as well as the previous two reports from the Employment Committee, I believe contribute to rebalancing the importance of the social and economic issues. The economy must work for society. It must contribute to social cohesion, social inclusion and decent jobs. It must be the springboard from which individuals and families can plan their future with confidence. Many of the headline figures for the EU are positive, and I want to list some of them because they are important: the EU economy continues to expand, providing a record number of jobs for people; we are making progress on the social scoreboard; household incomes continue to rise in most Member States; the share of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion decreased up to 2017; and there are more women in the workforce. All of this is positive, yet there are very significant challenges that persist. For me, one of the major challenges is that household incomes have grown more slowly than GDP, from something like 10.9% to 15.5% over a period of 12 years. This clearly indicates to me that much of our growth is not fully inclusive. This is a key issue for citizens and for the EU as a whole and I believe it will play a role in ensuring the cohesion, and therefore the future, of the EU. Youth unemployment averages at 18.6% across the EU, which is unacceptably high. While the youth guarantee has certainly helped, the issue as regards resources is that it is woefully underfunded. Precarious work is a huge challenge, given that workers are unable to enforce their rights, with no social security and work in security as a major issue. That’s one of the reasons why I will be supporting the amendment calling for the banning of zero hour contracts. We have challenges around increasing life expectancy, with 80% of the care in the EU being provided by informal family carers, 75% of whom are women. Yes, we have our Directive on Work-Life Balance, but unfortunately on the aspect of carers’ leave, that part of the Directive is weak and allows Member States to choose not to make a real choice for carers. We have stated clearly in the resolution that the EU’s social goals and commitments are just as important as its economic goals and are not just a means of guaranteeing economic growth, but must be a specific target in themselves. This perspective underpins our approach to all the proposals in this report on the Annual Growth Survey. This report sends a strong message to citizens that we in the Parliament recognise the essential need to ensure that our citizens can look to the future with confidence.

The Council attaches great importance to the semester and I’m pleased to exchange views with Parliament on the subject. If we are all to make Europe relevant to people’s daily lives, we need to deliver on growth and jobs, high-quality education, social protection and inclusion, as well as environmental sustainability. We should stress here that it is a question of ownership for the Member States. By streamlining reforms, the European semester aims to improve the situation in each Member State and in the EU as a whole. An agreement on common objectives is therefore important. Your report shows that we recognise these common objectives. I’m glad we have this opportunity to discuss them with you today, and that you have also discussed them recently with national parliaments. To start on a positive note, evidence suggests that Europe’s economy is strengthening. Employment is growing. Investment is recovering and public finances are improving. Yet, clearly, many challenges remain. You have identified a number of them in your report. Long-term challenges remain, such as population ageing, digitalisation and its impact on work, climate change and unsustainable use of natural resources. Boosting investment remains a priority in order to promote a more robust recovery and to secure a healthy growth rate in the long run. The extension of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, in terms of financial capacity, is an important step towards achieving this goal. Let us continue to work together to spur social investment and human capital, to lift the remaining barriers and to foster a truly favourable investment climate. Furthermore, we need to support growth with smart fiscal policies, while paying close attention to the long-term sustainability of our budgets and debts. We also need to implement the necessary structural reforms in our product and labour markets in order to prepare our economies for the challenges ahead. We must provide our young citizens with high quality education and invest in their skills today. Madam President, honourable Members, as we are now leaving crisis times behind us, the legacy of the crisis remains a serious concern. Some citizens are trapped in a cycle of poverty and social exclusion, which they cannot easily escape from. This is an important issue for the Romanian Presidency. Our policy efforts need to be oriented towards the most vulnerable categories of our citizens. They also need to be oriented towards those regions and sectors that are undergoing the greatest difficulties. We need to think of new solutions to new problems whilst seizing the opportunities ahead of us. The collaborative economy represents a huge potential, but it cannot be a reason to backtrack on employment and social rights. Employment and social policies need to adapt to the changes in the labour market, whilst workers rights should remain protected. Environment policy, together with greening the economy and greening the European semester, can contribute in a very significant manner to the broad policy objective of stimulating sustainable growth and creating jobs. What is key is to focus on the full implementation of the reforms and carefully to monitor the progress in each Member State. We should share our experiences and use best practice examples to learn from each other. Only by working together closely, to push consistently for reforms and to keep supporting inclusive growth and job creation, will we be successful in creating tangible benefits for every citizen and in rebuilding trust in a strong and prosperous European Union. Thank you very much for your attention and for the contribution of the European Parliament, in particular the rapporteurs, on this important topic.

Employment figures stay at record highs and unemployment at record lows. The average levels of both budget deficit and public debt continue to go down. Our strategy based on three priorities, investment, structural reforms and fiscal responsibility, is working. Yet growth is moderating and risks are mounting. We face trade tensions and a slowdown in emerging economies. Concerns about banks, sovereign loans and debt sustainability are resurfacing in some countries. Amongst homemade reasons for the slowdown, we also see stalling reform momentum in some Member States. Some countries still have high unemployment, while others face skills shortages. Unresolved structural issues continue to hamper productivity and investment. There are still high levels of inequality within and among EU Member States. Long-term challenges, such as population ageing, remain pressing. Rapid technological change and digitalisation are changing our daily lives and the world of work. That is why decisive action is needed. At national level, we need well-targeted investments and reforms to increase productivity and to foster inclusive growth. Good times must be used to reduce high debt and rebuild fiscal buffers. This, unfortunately, is not happening in some Member States. At EU level we have made progress on the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) reform, but some proposals, on the capital markets union, for example, still await adaptations. At the Eurogroup meeting earlier this week we continued discussions on how to support reforms and investments for the sake of competitiveness and convergence. The Commission is open to amending our proposal on the reform support programme to serve this purpose.  We have just issued our assessment of the economic and social challenges in all Member States and, where relevant, of macroeconomic imbalances. We also identified priority areas for investment, providing a basis for a new programming of cohesion funds. Regarding macroeconomic imbalances our conclusion is that Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, France, Croatia, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania and Sweden experienced imbalances and Cyprus, Greece and Italy experienced excessive imbalances. For Croatia, this is an improvement. We found this year that Croatia still has imbalances, but they are no longer excessive. So this is good news, including with regard to preparations for participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) II and eventually for euro area membership.  We also found imbalances in the case of Romania. This was not the case last year. The reasons are competitiveness losses, widening current account deficits and pro-cyclical expansionary fiscal policy. We remain concerned about Italy’s public debt ratio, which is not set to decline, and reform momentum has stalled. In spring we will once again assess Italy’s policy steps and the commitments to address imbalances, as well as the level of ambition of the national reform programme. Overall, since 2011, Member States have made at least some progress on two-thirds of the recommendations but, as I said before, momentum has been slowing. To regain this momentum, Member States can count on our structural reform support service that has been providing support for 500 reform projects in 25 countries, with a further 260 projects to be financed this year. To conclude, our focused approach has helped us to steer the recovery and it must serve to keep us on the path of sustainable and inclusive growth.

The positive economic developments continue to translate into sustained job creation. Two hundred and forty million people have a job in the European Union and this is the highest number ever. Unemployment is at 6.5% and this is now the lowest it has ever been in this century. The number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion is dropping and now, for the first time, it is below the level of what we recorded in 2008. However (there is also a ‘however’), we must not forget that growth in Europe is not benefiting all citizens in the same way, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs told us. Real household income is still below the 2008 level in some countries. There is still very high youth unemployment in some areas or a high level of poverty, including high in-work poverty in some Member States. This is why your report, Ms Harkin, strongly resonates with our analysis. We take note of your calls to do more on skills, in-work poverty, regulation of new forms of work, labour market inclusion of people with disabilities, work-life balance and housing.  Since the publication of the Annual Growth Survey last autumn, we have published the country reports on 27 February and those provide a more detailed analysis of the economic and social situation in the Member States. For the second year now, we look at the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The country reports provide an idea of where we stand and of the challenges ahead and they assess policy response by Member State.  We also look at the social scoreboard. This year, we see progress on all 14 indicators of the social scoreboard. Moreover, for the first time, the country reports reflect on the investment needs in each Member State and also, more specifically, as regards European funds. Our aim is to achieve greater synergies and complementarity between the economic policies, reforms and the cohesion policy funds, and I am confident that the combined efforts of European legislation, coordination of economic policies and European funds will help to make the European Pillar of Social Rights a reality for all citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Andrey KOVATCHEV", "mepid": "97968", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. – Madam President, the Economy of the European Union is entering its sixth year of growth as a result of structural reforms, investment and responsible fiscal policies.

The report cites data and figures which confirm that the labour market situation is stabilising and improving. 2018 is the seventh consecutive year of economic growth in the European Union. Unemployment is falling, new jobs are rising, key economic indicators are positive, satisfactory. However, as we point out, this prosperity does not apply to all Citizens of the Union. The group of people who are poor and at risk of poverty still number more than one hundred million. We also have a group of NEETs who are not working, not learning, not educating. It is still more than 6 million people. There is also a pension gap between men and women of almost 40% and a work-home imbalance. These issues continue to pose challenges.  Finally, the European Union is in the process of digital transformation, which is the basis for our future and competitiveness in the world. Meanwhile, the labour shortage in key sectors for the future is in the hundreds of thousands, and 40% of european citizens do not have basic digital skills.

You know that in our eyes, socialists and democrats, this semester is too focused on purely economic and budgetary issues and not enough on social issues. Indeed, what is the point of creating jobs if they are poorly paid and poorly protected, such as zero-hours contracts? What is the point of having a balanced budget, which forbids investing in the future, in education, in training, but also in the ecological transition? What is the point of growing if it generates inequalities that are increasingly present in Europe today? Is it not true that social and cultural inequalities are the main danger of democracy? We are living it today in many European countries. In the proposal before us today, these social concerns have been heard and supported in the context of the Committee on Employment. I will mention a few: better access to education and training; The importance of decent wages and collective bargaining; reforms that do not undermine solidarity and redistribution of wealth, and finally investments in the ecological transition. I come to an amendment that the EPP wants to table at the time of the vote, which concerns pensions. According to the EPP, the only way to have decent pensions is to have private pensions. I would like to say to the EPP that private pensions are the main obstacle to equality between men and women. Women today do not benefit from the pillars of private pensions. To claim, therefore, that the problem of pensions will be solved by private pensions is to reinforce inequality towards women within Europe.

Secondly, employment is said to be better than ever, and it is true, but, keep an eye on the idea that, when there is a major unemployment pool in a nation, it is a European problem. The distribution of unemployment is also a European problem. Another thing, inequalities. There's a lot or all to do. Even if a crisis now comes, upcoming economic and social policies cannot fail to take priority to combat the growth of inequalities. And finally, two essential things for the future, to achieve a social Europe.

This picture is confirmed by this report on the European Semester for Coordination and Economic Policy, at a time when the whole socio-economic area seems to be heading to Brussels. The problems described in the report also show that the introduction of the single currency, the euro, has led to lower economic growth and higher unemployment than outside the euro area. The eurozone is doing worse than the other Member States, including the United Kingdom. The solution to this problem is therefore very simple. Simply say goodbye to the euro and, with it, the system of a centrally driven economy. However, such a simple solution eludes Brussels and also seems a little counterrevolutionary. It is felt that, now that the central control is failing, more central guidance is needed from Brussels.

The economy is weakening, the extent of the expected slowdown and its impact on the European economy will depend on our actions: on the one hand, our political action in recent years, in which we have benefited from a very pleasing economic development, but also on our political action in the coming months.  If I look more closely at the country reports, I get the impression that many Member States are not sufficiently prepared for a weakening economy. The fat years were not used. France has been on the border of the EDP for years, and the country report on Italy is a document of failure. This very worrying finding once again raises the question of why the Commission is not more vehemently enforcing the implementation of the country-specific recommendations and compliance with the fiscal rules. We see the same pattern over and over again: the country reports are disastrous, the recommendations are not implemented and the fiscal rules of the game are ignored. If we start in this way into an economically more difficult time, and also, as has been suggested since yesterday, with an unregulated Brexit, which will cost us economic performance again, then we do indeed have a problem.

Many of the proposals put forward by my group have been welcomed, and i am therefore pleased to say that the final version of this report will have a favourable vote from the Socialist group. I therefore thank the rapporteur, our colleague Tom Vandenkendelaere, for the excellent cooperation we have had and which has made this good result possible.  The main message of this Parliament is that European economic and budgetary policy needs to take a step forward to respond to the slowdown in the economy. We need concerted action for more sustainable and more inclusive growth, we need to overcome the public and private investment gap and we need to ensure that Member States with budget surpluses do more for the growth of the European economy by increasing wages and investment. Responsibility in the management of public accounts is of course still necessary, but it must be compatible with investment for job creation, with combating inequalities, with promoting convergence, with social inclusion, with energy transition, with combating climate change, with sustainable development goals.

I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, that we have been able to reach an agreement on this difficult and politically very sensitive file. It is an important file because it concerns the stability of our financial markets and the banking sector. Markets and a sector that are still vulnerable. In the EU, do not be alarmed by the amount, banks still have some 820 billion in loans on their balance sheets that are difficult or impossible to collect. These loans are substantial, invisible risks that can cause instability in the financial markets in times of crisis. Moreover, banks that have a lot of these kinds of bad loans on their balance sheet naturally have much less room to actually finance the real economy. That may be just as big a problem. It is also a sensitive file, because this 820 billion is partly made up of mortgages. From loans to citizens, to farmers, and loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Loans that years ago were perhaps provided too easily and regularly with too little information, often through no fault of that citizen or entrepreneur. And it is not about abstract matters or abstract amounts, but it is about someone's home, about your business, and about your existence. And so it was beyond dispute for both co-rapporteurs that this problem had to be tackled urgently, with ambition, but in a responsible manner. And I am convinced that we have succeeded. What do we do? Whereas in the past the ECB had to address banks individually on what to do and tell them to deal with those bad loans, now all banks are legally obliged to build a buffer for bad loans to fully cover these risks. Depending on the type of exposure, this 100% obligation arises after three years for unsecured loans, after seven years for secured loans, or after nine years for loans secured with real estate. And see how we take into account the fact that it concerns houses and mortgages and someone's existence. In addition, the ECB will of course continue to have the option of imposing an additional obligation per bank and accelerating the path where necessary. And I am well aware that this will hurt some banks. But the EPP and the CDA would rather take difficult but important measures now than pass that pain on to the next generation. What I personally think is a shame is that this legislation only applies to new loans, so for the future, while banks, especially in some countries, are still carrying a huge burden from the past. I think those corpses should also come out. So we are not there yet. This Regulation should be complemented by a Directive that addresses these old non-performing loans from the past by simplifying and facilitating their sale. We are currently working on this guideline with the same team of co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, hoping to be able to complete that process before the elections. All in all, we will then go from a legislative proposal to entry into force within a year. That is quite unique for such a difficult and sensitive file and I think we can all be proud of it.

It is good to say and remember that the main cause of the high stock of non-performing loans was the deep economic recession that hit several member countries in the aftermath of the financial crisis, to which the negative effects of austerity policies were added. In some Member States, it is also true that this main cause has been accompanied by opaque credit practices, bad management or insufficient prudence. As regards these aspects, several measures have already been adopted, both at national and European level, and this is producing a significant drop in the level of non-performing loans. The text that we have agreed - and I would like to thank my colleague Esther de Lange for her cooperation, which led us to conclude such a delicate legislative procedure in record time - has two main objectives: on the one hand, to strengthen the measures aimed at preventing the excessive accumulation of non-performing loans, and on the other hand avoiding negative incentives from the point of view of the ability to support the economy or also from the point of view of the debtors, which naturally compared to an excessive push to sell down non-performing loans would be negatively affected. What are the main points of the agreement reached with the Council? First of all, we decided to apply this prudential backstop only to new credits resulting from new loans, in line with the Council's action plan, which called for precisely this. And this is logical, because it takes a sufficient period of time to adapt to the new rules, from an accounting and prudential point of view. The second element is that in the text we outline a correct and fair balancing of the provisioning levels for banks. In particular, unlike the Commission proposal, provisioning for secured or unsecured loans only starts after two or three years respectively, thus avoiding the risk that prudential provisions are added to the contraction of capital caused by the recession, creating a pro-cyclical effect, with negative effects on the granting of credit and on the real economy. We have also eliminated the potentially negative (or we could say perverse) incentives present in the Commission's proposal that would have accelerated the liquidation of companies only temporarily unable to repay the loan, but actually solvent, with negative consequences not only on the companies themselves, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, but also on economic growth and the level of employment. Last but not least, I would also like to mention an element that we have introduced, that is a more favorable prudential treatment for those non-performing loans that are purchased on the secondary market by other credit institutions, in order to avoid an unjust penalty for specialized operators and, at the same time, provide higher protection for consumers, SMEs and all other debtors, as these institutions are subject to strict controls and regulations. In conclusion, this is a balanced text that helps us take another important step in reducing the risks of the banking sector, while avoiding negative consequences on the real economy and on consumers.

We have been working intensively over the past years to reduce risks and to strengthen the resilience of the European banking sector. With a prudential backstop regulation, we are addressing one of the major risks to which European banks are still exposed: non-performing loans. Non-performing loans had piled up in the banks’ balance sheets in the aftermath of the financial crisis and ensuing economic downturn. As we saw, elevated levels of NPLs, if not dealt with sufficiently quickly, weighed on banks’ liability and capacity to lend to the real economy. We have certainly made substantial progress in reducing the high levels of NPLs. However, the ratio remains elevated when compared historically and to other regions, and accelerated GDP growth – a key driver behind the reduction in NPLs – cannot be taken for granted. Preventing the future accumulation of NPLs is hence essential for preserving financial stability and supporting lending to create jobs and growth. To this end, the prudential backstop will put EU-wide brakes on any excessive future build-up of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets, without sufficient loss coverage. It will do so by setting a common minimum coverage level for future loans if they become non-performing across Member States and banks. It will serve as a necessary complement to existing supervisory tools that can only be applied on a case-by-case basis, depending on the individual circumstances of the bank. The prudential backstop is therefore an important part of the Union’s effort to further reduce risks in the banking system, with a view to completing the banking union. However, our work to address NPLs is not complete yet. As you know, the backstop is part of the package of measures which also aim to improve the conditions for banks to deal with NPLs through more efficient enforcement mechanisms, as well as efficient competitive and transparent secondary markets.

I am certainly not the only one who feels that the financial crisis and its consequences have inflicted considerable wounds on the unity of Europe, and that these wounds are not yet fully healed. In this context, the financial system has suffered considerably, which has had major consequences on the lives of citizens. This is how the central place of financial institutions for the good economic development of all of society has been confirmed. Financial intermediation plays a vital role. After all, this is the goal of the proper functioning of our financial system: to enable all Europeans to fully benefit from the economic potential of our businesses. It should therefore be emphasized that patients are not only banks, of course, but also individuals. Therefore, it is by viewing the reduction of non-performing exposures as a crucial part of treatment that one can realistically speak of a real cure for all stakeholders. I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteurs for providing a balanced response to the multiple challenges that have arisen. Let us not forget, however, that in order to ensure the success of this part of the treatment, one must also swallow the bitter pill of reasonable management of public finances. However, such a policy does not cause, as it is wrongly criticized, stagnation, but rather sustainable economic growth.

Non-performing loans (NPLs), as we heard, are a legacy from the last financial crisis and a decade later, the EU has not sufficiently reduced the levels, and therefore action is still needed to prevent a worsening situation in the future. Since 2015, NPLs have declined by only 400 billion, down from one trillion. Clearly, there is a long way to go and they remain a big challenge facing banks in the euro area. The only way is to clean up their balance sheet whilst we have a positive economic climate. Therefore, I really welcome the improved text from the trilogue because it ensures adequate provisioning of NPLs in the banks’ balance sheets, and a more gradual provisioning in the earlier years will reduce the potential negative impact on the real economy.  Whilst this agreement and the recently adopted banking package reduce the risk in the banking sector considerably and bring the EU a little closer to banking union, there are three major reforms that are still needed to ensure that the EU banking sector becomes more resilient. Firstly, we need a decisive step towards a pan-European depository scheme to get adequate risk-sharing and equal protection of all EU savers. This is critical. It is a pity that the right side of this House keeps blocking this for ideological reasons, and I hope the next Parliament will address this.  Secondly, sustainable finance should become the norm, not the exception, and as banks are still the main financing source of the EU economy, they have a big responsibility. We have taken steps recently in terms of the sustainable finance package, but my question to the Vice-President is: how will the Commission ensure that banks exercise this responsibility? Finally, given the massive impact on the economy and taxpayers of the last financial crisis, we can no longer have too-big-to-fail banks.

The law only applies to non-performing loans from the time this law comes into force. And not even the loans that will go non-performing now in 2019, after the law will come into force, will be immediately affected in any way, but will still have a period of three years before the first write-off measures apply. Only in 2022 will we begin to deal with non-performing loans, which at the moment do not even exist.

It was not easy to include our proposals and ideas for this regulation as the two co—rapporteurs held onto this file very tightly. Nevertheless, we have been active through the whole procedure because we are committed to those people who suffered the most due to non-performing loans. We have always said that non—performing loans (NPLs) have an inherent human dimension. They were built up because European law was implemented incorrectly. At the very beginning of this regulation, the Union acknowledges that there were important laws that were not implemented properly in some Member States: the Late Payment Directive, the Consumer Rights Directive and the Mortgage Credit Directive. Let me warn you that if we do not improve the implementation of EU law in some Member States, we may risk suffering a new wave of NPLs in some Member States in the next few years, even in the event of a new huge financial crisis or another economic crisis. Proper implementation is key. Proper implementation means prevention and commitment to our values, our rules and our Union. Parliament cannot fail in approving only one law and not the other. Without the directive, the regulation would lose all its meaning and major institutions could not have the legal incentive they need to put their non-performing loans on the market. We consider that this Parliament needs to send a strong message. It is therefore important that the whole NPL legislative package is approved. This is our responsibility.

Therefore, it is a goal that we share. But, nevertheless, we believe that there are two criteria that must prevail. The first is that more responsibility should be demanded from financial institutions when it comes to giving credit, and that means a very high demand in the provision of non-performing loans. And, the second, a very great protection of the consumer and, particularly, of consumers who cannot afford their credits, because the reduction of delinquent credits cannot be carried out at the very high social cost that was carried out in some countries, as was the case. the Spanish case. Therefore, that was our will and these are our objectives, with which we face this debate. I have to say that we are not satisfied with the regulation that is presented to us. Therefore, we are not going to vote on it for some particular reasons that I will detail below. The first, because the provisions established for future non-performing loans are excessively long. The Commission proposed that a loan should be one hundred percent provisional after eight years. You propose up to nine. We proposed seven, following the advice of the European Central Bank, as it seemed to us a reasonable timetable but, of course, a little more demanding. And, finally, because you say that this rule will take effect three years after its approval. And, finally, we also proposed that this Regulation touch on some previous credits by making all credits that become delinquent after March 1 to be included. You only propose that all those credits issued as of April 1 be covered. Therefore, we are not happy at all. And we are also concerned that, having separated the two files, with the Directive all the part of consumer protection to see how it will be. Because if the negotiation dynamics is the same as what we have had in this file, which is basically a grand coalition agreement, then that really does not bode well.

Its supporters argue that it will free up banks to lend to small businesses, but all of the evidence shows that it’s the lack of demand in the economy and not credit supply that is limiting lending. Its supporters say that we can achieve strengthened consumer protection in the directive, but in reality the package will encourage the banks to throw their customers to the wolves through the mass sell-offs of mortgages on family homes to vulture funds. This is exactly what’s happening in Ireland right now, and it has fuelled a housing and homelessness crisis on an unprecedented scale. Supporters of this proposal actually cite the Irish example with bad debt as a model to be replicated across the EU when, in reality, it is an example of exactly what not to do.  The truth is that this package is about returning banks to the situation where they can make massive profits again without any regard to the rights of borrowers who, let’s not forget, are European citizens.

Three points: first, the protection of borrowers, given that the bank is de facto the strongest and the borrower is de facto the weakest, as set out in this European directive on unfair terms, means that we must intervene and in particular the European Commission to investigate complaints of ineffective implementation of this Directive.

The second point: risk sharing.

A number of colleagues have commented on the European Deposit Guarantee Scheme. I must then take a step back and remind you that at the time of the crisis, we asked a lot from the European taxpayer when it comes to rescuing banks, guaranteeing that rescue, and guaranteeing a number of Member States . And during that crisis we said \"never again\". So the next time a bank needs to be bailed out, it's not the taxpayer, but the shareholder who gets the bill in the first instance. Now we have seen in practice that when it comes to a bank rescue or a resolution in certain countries, the state again guarantees, yet again the taxpayer has to cough up. And then I can imagine that when there are such big differences between Member States in whether or not to use public money to save banks, not every Member State is eager to guarantee one European fund right now, overnight. of bank balances across Europe. That doesn't mean we can't do anything. There is a good proposal to start with mandatory liquidity support in the case of deposit guarantee. That is something we can, as far as I am concerned, start tomorrow. The only problem is that a number of political groups already want a guarantee that we will immediately switch to that European pot. A number of recent bank rescues in Italy, the fact that a number of political groups will now also vote against this legislation for non-performing loans, shows that unfortunately the political support for this is not yet present, simply because in a number of Member States this risk reduction and the attitude required for this is not yet present. That is one. Secondly, I would like to answer my colleague Auke Zijlstra, who \"did\" a \"Nigel Farage\". He intervened in this debate, issued a two-minute statement and then left. He thinks the legislation is too weak. He comes from the Netherlands and belongs to the PVV. However, he was represented in these negotiations by a colleague from the ENF group from Italy, who sent me as a signal on behalf of his group: this legislation should work with much longer deadlines and above all be less ambitious. I added it up for a moment. I think we negotiated physically for about 20 hours, technically and with colleagues. The presence of the PVV and Mr. Zijlstra in these negotiations is exactly zero minutes. I have had dozens if not hundreds of emails as input for this legislation. The input of the PVV and Mr. Zijlstra: zero e-mails. So if I may say one more sentence, namely my response to the PVV: either do your work, write to me and join the debate, or shut up.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 227, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Roberto GUALTIERI", "mepid": "96892", "text": "speaker. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has shown that we have actually approved a balanced text. We have listened to some propaganda on both sides. There are those who say that it is too harsh, and frankly I would like to say to my colleague Valli that I am serious, because everyone knows that this is a text that has softened the Commission proposal and is more balanced than the ECB addendum and therefore now accuse us of having made a text that is too harsh I find it propaganda. At the same time, I must say, I agree with my colleague de Lange: we have not seen all these colleagues who spoke to tell us that instead we had to do something tougher at the moment of the negotiations, only to say now of course that we were too soft, too loose. So the truth is that we took the responsibility of tackling a very difficult, very delicate issue and we managed to do it well and quickly. And this is a positive case of the capacity of this Parliament to produce legislation and also of being, in some way, a subject that when something does not work well, some authority, some tendency, some position, solutions that may be suitable for some conference. but then produce problems and negative impact on the real economy, this Parliament knows how to correct and reconcile the necessary reduction of risk and impaired loans, on the one hand, with the safeguarding of financial stability, the interests of citizens, debtors, small and medium-sized enterprises and produce a regulation which I think will have a significant impact, on the one hand, in greater prudence and therefore in discouraging practices that can then lead to an excessive accumulation of non-performing loans, but at the same time it does so to a sustainable manageable, without negative impacts on the real economy.

With this report, Parliament makes a very timely contribution to this process and I therefore want to thank the correlator, our colleague Vladimír Maňka, for the excellent collaboration we have had in the last few months of work. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different groups for the excellent spirit of cooperation that allowed us to achieve, I believe, a good result. With this report, Parliament defends a two-step strategy: as regards the medium and long term, the European Parliament reaffirms its vision with full clarity in defense of the full integration of the European Stability Mechanism in European law so that it can become a genuine institution of the European Union, with governance subject to the Community method and under the democratic control of the European Parliament. This not being immediately possible, in the short term, we advocate moving forward with the reform of the European Stability Mechanism through a revision of the Intergovernmental Treaty that created it. We did not think it appropriate, unlike the Commission, to change the name of this institution to the European Monetary Fund because this could create confusion as to the competence to conduct monetary policy, which should remain with the European Central Bank, but there are more important things that we can do. and we must do: first, strengthen the democratic control of the mechanism by the European Parliament. We therefore propose a cooperation protocol between the two institutions to reinforce the dialogue, strengthen parliamentary scrutiny and we propose more, we propose that the director of the European Stability Mechanism be elected here in the European Parliament. Secondly, we recommend strengthening the role of the mechanism in promoting financial stability, in responding to economic and financial shocks and, therefore, also with the revision of its missions and competences, without prejudice to the macroeconomic surveillance tasks that must continue to be carried out. the European Commission. Finally, greater autonomy vis-à-vis the International Monetary Fund must be achieved and the mechanism should be empowered to make the single resolution fund operational and therefore contribute to the completion of the banking union. We all know that the euro reform agenda goes beyond this, it requires budgetary capacity, it requires many other things, but the reform of the European Stability Mechanism is also an important step and we now hope that the Council will listen to the proposals and suggestions of the European Parliament so that we can move in the right direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 231, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Vladimír MAŇKA", "mepid": "28192", "text": "Rapporteur. - Madam President, Vice-President of the European Commission, people remember the financial assistance to Greece as the country most affected by the financial crisis. At that time, the eurozone countries created the European Financial Stability Facility. This temporary mechanism has become a permanent European Stability Mechanism known as the Euroval. The aim was to provide financial assistance to countries affected by the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis, which had lost access to financial markets, namely Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus. However, these countries had to commit themselves to doing their homework in the form of structural reforms. The measures have led to the recovery of their economy, but have also prevented the enormous damage that would occur not only in the euro area but throughout the European Union. Let's look at these countries today. Thanks to European cooperation, Ireland achieves the highest economic growth in the European Union, Spain broke its historical records in exports, Portugal achieved a primary surplus. The Greeks, who had to undergo the most painful reforms, also no longer need a rescue program today. Once again, they can finance themselves on international markets. Greece has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs in recent years and is achieving solid economic growth. A few days ago, the rating agency Moody’s raised Greece's rating by 2 notches to B1. The Agency thinks that the reforms are already more firmly entrenched, with a high probability of further progress and a low risk of reverting the situation. At the same time, due to assistance to Greece in 2011-2012, the government fell in Slovakia in my country. But it has turned out that it is thanks to our joint European cooperation that the euro is more resilient to the crisis today than ever before. Support for the euro is also historically the highest in the euro area since its introduction. Since the beginning of the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, we have seen that its intergovernmental nature reduces its ability to respond quickly to economic and financial shocks. Therefore, the future integration of the European Stability Mechanism into the legal framework of the European Union will strengthen its ability to act and be effective. We should see this integration as part of the project to complete economic and monetary union. It is important that future integration into the EU legal framework takes into account the role of national parliaments. In the case of the European Union's budgetary resources in the future, the European Parliament should have the political power to exercise all rights of control over the budget in the context of the discharge procedure. In such a case, the European Court of Auditors should have a role in the discharge procedure. Financial resources, instruments of the reformed European Stability Mechanism, should be able to provide preventive financial assistance to Member States before they face significant difficulties in obtaining capital market funding. Financial assistance to Member States may be complemented by budgetary instruments to support economic and financial stabilization, investment and upward socio-economic convergence in the euro area. The European Stability Mechanism should not remain closed to euro area countries alone. It should be open to the participation of all Member States of the European Union.

It has also showed strong support for the Commission’s initiatives to strengthen its architecture. Today’s debate about the interim report on the Commission’s legislative proposal for the establishment of the European Monetary Fund is another step. On behalf of the Commission, I would first like to thank the committees and, in particular, the rapporteurs, Mr Silva Pereira and Mr Maňka, and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this issue. I would also use this occasion to thank those of you with whom the Commission has worked very closely over the past years to complete the Economic and Monetary Union. The Commission welcomes this interim report and broadly agrees with its most important messages. In particular, we support Parliament in its call for the integration of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) into the Union framework. As you know, this was an objective of our proposal. Since its creation in autumn 2012, at the height of the crisis, the ESM has proved decisive in helping to ensure financial stability in the euro area. Its integration into the EU legal order will not only strengthen its institutional anchoring, but will also enable its accountability to the European and the national parliaments to be increased, as well as making its functioning more transparent, a point Parliament also addressed strongly in your interim report. Another important point you stress, with which we fully concur, is on the need for Member States to respect the common rules of the economic governance framework in order to ensure that the competences of the ESM do not overlap with or affect those of other EU institutions, and to ensure that any set-up is fully compatible with EU law. I would also like to welcome your call for an anticipated introduction of the common backstop to the single resolution fund by 2020. Finally a remark on the name. We proposed ‘European Monetary Fund’, as this was the terminology used in the policy discussion, but we have taken note of the objections of the European Central Bank and of this House and we are open to reconsidering it. Maybe we can just stick with the current name, European Stability Mechanism. Since the Commission tabled this proposal, we have seen further developments on the various EMU work strands. In particular, Member States have decided to proceed with a revision of the ESM treaty in an intergovernmental framework. Work on the revision of the ESM treaty is ongoing and I trust this will make an important contribution to building a stronger Economic and Monetary Union, not least by adding the backstop for the single resolution fund and increasing the effectiveness of the precautionary instruments, while avoiding duplication of roles. In the latter respect, I would like to highlight the agreement on cooperation between the Commission and the ESM reached in November last year, which was endorsed by the euro summit.

Member States are currently working on the basis of an amendment to the ESM Treaty, but we should be very clear here that the integration of the ESM Framework into EU law will have to be addressed soon. Secondly, the accountability of the successor of the European Monetary Fund (EMF) to the European Parliament and national parliaments will be crucial.

Our Monetary Union is far from over. On the contrary. Member States that had to rescue a banking sector have suddenly found themselves in trouble. National regulators, each checking their banks on their own island, actually had no idea whatsoever of the whole systemic disaster that was to come. Some member states were suddenly unable to obtain financing on financial markets and have become dependent on European emergency loans. We hastily created the European Stability Mechanism, the ESM. That clearly did what it was supposed to do. But it is important to stress that a European emergency mechanism must at all times remain a story of rights and obligations. Member States at risk of losing funding in the financial market should be able to turn to that mechanism. There should be no doubt about that. But it is, of course, just as important that this support remains conditional, so that enough money is left in the jar for when Member States really need it. Ex ante with fiscal rules and ex post with economic adjustment programs. We must absolutely avoid an emergency mechanism to weaken the pressure to comply with fiscal rules because, so to speak, Europe will come to solve it anyway if it really becomes necessary. We know Commissioner Dombrovskis that you are personally available day and night, weekend or weekdays, to save the Eurozone. But you would also not like us to just call you without any kind of conditions. Finally this. Deepening our Monetary Union must be at the top of the agenda.

The creation of the European Stability Mechanism was successful when some Member States needed to be bailed out and no longer had market access. Today, it is a question of using this success to take a new step, and we are well aware that this step is also linked to a new environment, where the question of sharing risks and their reduction has taken steps. absolutely considerable, whether with the adoption of the PNP package (non-performing loans) and the banking package. That is why my group believes that the development of this European stability mechanism should not lead to the creation of a European Monetary Fund. We would have preferred the creation of a European Stability Fund. I understand that the agreement will be made around maintaining the existing name, but the main thing is the role that this mechanism will play in the future, because we would have liked it to be able to be used fully to ensure the stability function which the European Union, and above all the euro zone, undoubtedly still need and which it can provide the guarantee we need for the “safety net” of the banking sector. We understand that some things are changing in the Council, but from this point of view, I fear that an inherent flaw in the European Stability Mechanism persists. When the European Parliament, in the midst of the crisis, agreed to the creation of this mechanism in an intergovernmental framework, it was under pressure, in the idea that we would succeed in remedying this situation. However, today, the Council refuses any discussion on the useful proposal that the Commission had put on the table and which made it possible to progress towards the integration of this mechanism into the framework of the Treaties, which this Parliament continues to advocate. to ask and to claim as being the right way forward for the future of the mechanism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 236, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Ralph PACKET", "mepid": "195454", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - (NL) Mr President, with this report the aim is to anchor the European Stability Mechanism or ESM, and thus the financial support to member states, forever in EU legislation, with financial support as the main task. We do not agree with that. I don't believe in that focus, in bailouts. Simply giving extra loans does not solve anything, because the debts in Europe will always linger like a sword of Damocles above the eurozone. Such a bailout fund costs far too much to the taxpayer and removes the incentive for Member States to take responsibility. It is also simply much more logical to leave the organization of the ESM with the Member States, because it is they who provide the money in that fund. It is the national parliaments that must be able to exercise control over this. We should not focus on new bailouts, but on the prevention of new crises. We do this by enforcing the budget rules much better. We must also focus on settling the debts. However, if a country cannot pay off its debts, then we need to see how they can be cleared.

It is in this context that we had to imagine an instrument to pool, in a way, the over-indebtedness of certain countries. Today, it is opportune to bring this mechanism into the institutional framework, and I thank the rapporteurs for insisting on the need to maintain a close link with national parliaments. When it comes to endowing the social capital of the European Financial Stability Mechanism and granting financial guarantees, it is indeed the national parliaments that make the funds available and make the commitments. I will express regret because, fundamentally, this is about the governance of the euro zone, and I regret that we did not believe it necessary to recommend the appointment of a Minister of Finance, who could have been a vice-president of the Commission in charge of the euro. I would also like to express a wish: that the European Union uses its currency as the United States of America does, in order to ensure respect for Europe's vital interests extraterritorially.

What we are going to do practically is to introduce a mechanism, which will continue to be in its purely intergovernmental operation, within the acquis communautaire, but we do not fully communitize the operation of the European Stability Mechanism, which is very bad news. We also have a problem with the role of Parliament in this reform. Anyway - some Members have said so - we should be in the middle of the codecision procedure and not simply in an approval procedure that requires us to do this mid-debate report. The European Stability Mechanism has had a lot of problems from the beginning because of its opacity, because of the way it did conditionality, because of the way memorandums of understanding were signed ... Mr Regling gave us lessons on everything, but he never came to the European Parliament to explain, and we have been working with an institution practically in a state of economic exception, without any kind of democratic control. Of course, I believe that the experience that its operation leaves in recent years has been one of the most negative that we have had, with bailouts that have been carried out at a very high social cost and without any kind of democratic legitimacy. For this reason, I believe that it was important not only to include this Regulation - as he said - within the acquis communautaire but without touching anything at all, but to carry out an in-depth review of the functioning of the Mechanism. For example, we had proposed and wanted the report to reflect that the European budget contribute to the financial mechanisms of the European Stability Mechanism, because that way we could exercise budgetary control over its activity, which has not been accepted, but which will be in the vote on an amendment we have tabled. The second thing also that we wanted to be in the text is for future adjustment programs to be delegated acts. Why? Because that would allow the European Parliament to be able to exercise our legal rights and reject them. But that seems to have not wanted to be accepted either. But despite this, we will table it as an amendment also in plenary. Or, also, another amendment that we are going to present is that there be something that we have been asking for for a long time: analysis of social impact, especially in the things that the Mechanism does and the policies that the Mechanism develops, something that has not been done. In Greece it has not been done, for example, and it has been a real disaster. And also more ability to control the appointment of the CEO. We ask for capacity in the appointment of him, but in a truly democratic process of Parliament with a shortlist from which we can choose. And finally, the issue of the backstop: it is all very well that the ESM is going to function as a backstop, but a backstop does not work if it requires unanimity in the Council. And we should have also introduced a request that the operation of the protection mechanism occurred automatically based on certain criteria. A protection mechanism submitted to the unanimity of the Council, frankly, is not a protection mechanism.

Any administrative interference in the free market, on the one hand, helps those who are ineffective and should fail to survive, and on the other hand, they burden those who have found a way to succeed and could thrive. The creation of an institution such as a monetary fund is another mechanism of very strong interference in the economy, and interference that strictly defies the judgments of the free market. The result of this can be - and will certainly be - only one: the development of effective companies will be stunted, and consumers will be burdened with financing companies that should have failed as ineffective. The creation of such a fund and the allocation of large financial resources to it also means oligarchic privileges for large corporations, and after all, any privilege given to anyone is, in fact, discrimination against all others.

We don’t know the history. We are speaking as if the mismatches of the economy appeared with the euro. I’ll give you one example, just one example. Go back in British history to 1956. What you had in Britain in 1956 was a deficit budget and an over-valued pound and then you had the crisis there. Crisis mismatches have been part of the history of Europe since, well, since the beginning of history. There was one good German, even if German bashing has been very popular in this House. Willy Brandt, in 1969, came to a meeting of the European Council and said that Germany was ready to give 30% of its currency surplus to Europe as starting money for a European monetary fund, but on one condition: Europe had to be able to manage its economy and if it couldn’t, it shouldn’t come to this House and blame others for something it had done itself.

With this monetary fund, with stability aid, we only want to help Member States in need under strict conditions and reforms. We want this fund to have at least EUR 500 billion and possibly be part of the European budget, and which, as an ultima ratio, it also takes over the common backstop for the resolution fund of the Banking Union.  This fund is necessary to make Europe more independent, to make Europe more stable, to strengthen the euro and to be able to intervene in Europe in need without foreign aid, and to strengthen the Commission's work on rehabilitation and aid programmes.

The European Monetary Fund (EMF) aims to replace and absorb the European Stability Mechanism as an efficient and key anti-crisis mechanism. It fills a significant gap in the existing system of governance in the euro area, in the first place. What are the tasks? First of all the EMF would provide support to Member States in financial distress. One could say that is the ESM’s role, but this, as I will explain, is something which will be provided in a more efficient and prompt way. The second task is that it will serve as a backstop for banks that fall into financial trouble. So there is a chance that, by providing financing both to states and to the banks, we are finally going to break the vicious nexus of sovereign-bank connection. The mechanism will be fiscally neutral so it does give us a guarantee that it is not going to transform itself into a permanent payment transfer mechanism. Further advantages include the fact that, in terms of governance, it is going to be much more efficient because, as part of the legal framework of the European Union, the decision-making mechanism will be faster and it will be more willing and able to face crisis situations in Member States.

Honourable colleagues, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and express my satisfaction that, once again, we have also been actively working on politically sensitive issues that the Council has not yet resorted to. I support the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which are very important to us if we want to be forward-looking and think about instruments to prevent economic crises in a timely manner. Of all the Member States, only 19 are in the euro area. This makes it difficult for European monetary and economic cooperation when the economy is at risk or other unfavourable macroeconomic factors are at risk. A model of cooperation should be established in which all Member States can adopt rapid and effective solutions for the provision of assistance. The European Commission's proposal provides a good basis for creating such a model. The European Monetary Fund, whatever its name, will be very important in integrating it into the legal framework of the European Union to help countries in difficulty, and it is important that The Member States have a say in this. It is also important that its functions do not duplicate the functions of other institutions. However, this is little to do today if we want an effective and transparent decision-making mechanism. The Instrument Box for the Stability Mechanism, including democratic accountability to both the European Parliament and the Member States, must be increased. By expanding the range of instruments, it will be necessary to find a golden middle ground between solidarity between Member States and, of course, responsibility. Member States in difficulty will have to take greater responsibility for their own citizens and for other European citizens.  I therefore agree that reforming the European Stability Mechanism should place greater emphasis on support for Member States rather than banks, from which it is sometimes problematic to hold accountable.

We can only support such reflections about the future completion of the architecture of the EMU. The work is far from finished. We believe that our European Monetary Fund proposal is a step in the right direction, and let me reiterate why this is the case. First, an integration of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in the Union’s legal framework would bring the benefit of a better articulation of financial stability support to Member States in crisis, with a framework of economic policy coordination and supervision of the financial sector. The Commission, Council and ECB play a key role in that regard. It would also allow for the ESM’s accountability to be enhanced at the European level, next to the national level, and increase its democratic legitimacy. Clearly, the ESM actions not only concern individual Member States in receipt of assistance but the euro area as a whole. Moreover, it would allow for an increase in transparency and a judicial review of its actions, as is the case for Union institutions. Let me also emphasise that the integration of the ESM in the Union framework would also be an acknowledgment of the importance the ESM has gained since its creation. Let me conclude by saying that, regardless of how the ESM will work in the short to medium term, it is clear that the Member States and the ESM must respect existing tasks and roles set out in the EU treaties, without this affecting the balance of competences between the Union and its Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 272, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Vladimír MAŇKA", "mepid": "28192", "text": "   I don't know what I' – Mr President, I thank my co-rapporteur Peter Silva Pereraz for his excellent cooperation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which We are a Europe of freedom and values, we are a Europe that stands for fair competition, and we are a European Union that is strong whenever it holds together. American tariffs on European cars, Chinese cheap imports of steel and aluminium. If the Union stands together, Trump &amp; Co will do nothing against our industry. Of course, this only works with the right foundations, in other words with trade agreements between the European Union and all parts of the world. We now have such a basis with the new 868 regulation to ensure competition, including air transport, in other words in an area to which WTO rules do not yet apply. What is it all about? In other parts of the world, airlines are subsidised by the state, partly to a degree that distorts competition. Global market shares have already shifted to the detriment of EU airlines, despite increased efficiency and structural changes in airlines. Therefore, if distortions of competition give rise to complaints, then we in the European Union must become concrete, with concrete measures against subsidised dumping airlines, but also with appropriate reactions when non-European states or regions discriminate against our airlines, for example in terms of landing rights or clearance. The 868 Regulation allows investigations to be initiated even if damage is imminent or discrimination has only been announced but has not yet occurred. The fact that the Commission can take action even in the event of imminent injury is a deterrent. It is to the credit of the European Parliament that Directorate-General TRAN is already taking action in the event of imminent injury, i.e. not only in the event of damage to be proven. We achieved this in the trialogue negotiations. And only then will the 868 Regulation get teeth. It is now a real deterrent instrument that, if things go well, we will never have to use. The 868 regulation is thus also a diplomatic instrument for Europe and its Member States, which alone cannot defend themselves against discrimination. However, if we deal with the EU-28 together, we will also have global influence in air transport. The answer to \"America First\", \"Gulf-Airlines First\" or \"China First\" is \"Europe together\". Thank you to the Commission for the good presentation. Thank you to the Council for the difficult but fair negotiations. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, who have contributed greatly to this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. I am able to represent the Commission on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Bulc, mrs Bulc is ill, but I am grateful that the discussions are taking place here this evening in this constructive way. I would like to thank Mr Pieper very much for his role in advancing the report on this and the content in Parliament, and I thank the technical committee for the essential content that stems from his work. Both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs have done important work here.  The adoption of the new regulation on the protection of fair competition in air transport is a major milestone in the implementation of our European aviation strategy, which was adopted by the Commission four years ago and which can now also find a legal basis here. This legislation is a core element of our instruments for fair competition in European aviation and in foreign policy with other countries when it comes to fair competition. The changes in this sector of the transport of people, goods and goods in aviation around the world are considerable. This makes it all the more important to have a common European policy and instruments that are given to us so that we can organise and guarantee fair competition for all airlines. We are talking about air transport to and from the European Union, and at present we currently have half of our airlines based in the EU and competitors who are at home in third countries. We accept and value this competition, but also connectivity, regardless of who guarantees it.  For flights to the EU, third-country carriers have our guarantee that certain European rules will apply to them in the same way as to EU companies. As the EU, we want to guarantee fair competition on equal terms. However, we note that unchanged – in part, increasing – EU companies outside the EU do not always find the same fair conditions, but that discrimination and discrimination can take place there. We in the Commission, with the support of this House, are pursuing the idea of competition based on a multilateral framework and globally harmonised rules, but neither the WTO nor the ICAO directives are realistic for fair competition in the near future, and that is why we, as the EU, are currently negotiating comprehensive air transport agreements with third countries that deal with this fair competition. To date, flights between the EU and third countries have been largely regulated by agreements concluded by individual EU Member States. However, an appearance with 28 or 27 EU countries towards third countries does not seem very wise, and that is why the regulation that is now to be agreed for the EU provides the basis for a credible and efficient instrument with which we can combat and adequately tackle unfair practices in the interests of our Member States, our citizens, jobs and air carriers.  This regulation, which you have before you this evening and which you helped to shape, is fundamentally different from its predecessor, which dates back to 2004 and which was inefficient, in fact not really practical. The current regulation is adapted to the specificities of today's aviation sector and is clearer, more effective and more efficient in its procedures. We in the Commission continue to attach great importance to negotiating air transport agreements with third countries. In its relations with its partners in third countries, the EU will always prefer dialogue and negotiated solutions over unilateral measures. In this sense, I think today is an important day for fair competition between EU companies and third-party companies, and also for our citizens, who can and should fly with both.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 277, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Ramon TREMOSA i BALCELLS", "mepid": "97203", "text": "  Verfasser der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Ausschusses für Wirtschaft und Währung. – Herr Präsident, lieber Kommissar!

Mr President, in the context of increased competition between air transport operators at global level, fair competition, with a level playing field, is an indispensable general principle that the EU has to push for. Calling for the same rules and fair competition for all carriers cannot be labelled as mere protectionism. Just as I have been calling on some European carriers to restructure and to stop receiving state aid, I now call for more financial transparency and clearer rules regarding third-country carriers’ operations in Europe and their investments in the EU. Europe represents 500 million potential passengers for third-country air carriers’ routes to Asia. They fly to Europe to feed their respective hubs and fill their planes. Increasing traffic towards Asia should be borne in mind when the Commission is negotiating comprehensive aviation agreements with the rest of the world. I believe the EU should link the financial transparency clause in the aviation agreements to third-country investment in EU airlines. If third-country airlines receive subsidies, why should they be able to control EU airlines achieving the same results?

This also applies to international aviation. So, as legislators, we must protect our companies and workers from unfair practices with clear rules in order to secure long-term skilled jobs throughout Europe. Unfortunately, we are living in an era of trade conflicts, and only with sufficiently deterrent instruments can we ensure fair rules for Europe in global competition. A revision of Regulation No 868/2004 was therefore urgently needed. On the Council's side, however, a bizarre picture has emerged in parts. It was simply inconceivable to me that a group of states actively opposed such a trade defence instrument and wanted to give unfair subsidies to EU airlines, only to maintain the ideological paradigm of the supposedly free market. It is therefore a great success for us as a Parliament that we have been able to draw up a robust legislative text for European aviation. We now have an effective instrument to protect ourselves from harmful subsidies from third countries. This is not protectionism to the detriment of passengers or connectivity, because our airlines need not fear fair competition.

The original Commission text of Regulation No 868 unfortunately took a protectionist approach that would have allowed the Commission to impose penalties on third-country carriers before complaints against them had been properly investigated. This sent a hugely pessimistic signal to our international trading partners and would have globally damaged our connectivity and our reputation. The original text would also have enabled uncompetitive European carriers to complain about their competitors, giving the Commission power to punish them before reviewing evidence. Of course it’s right to crack down on unfair competition but not at the expense of damaging consumer choice, increasing ticket prices and costing jobs, as well as affecting the supply chain. However, following the trilogue, I can now support the final agreement, not least because it clarifies Member States’ competencies, for example on dispute settlements through their current bilateral air service agreements with third countries, and more. Therefore, I think we now strike a satisfactory balance, which I believe will allow the market between the EU and third countries to grow and innovate.

I have enjoyed working with her and I wish her the very best. As concerns this draft regulation, I would keep three key words in mind. One is ‘efficiency’, one is ‘complementarity’ and the third is ‘dialogue’. Efficiency because finally we have an instrument of a purely trade-defence nature. The regulation will now empower the Commission to investigate if there is a reason, or rather a reason-based complaint, and on its own initiative. Efficiency also because the Commission will not have to wait for EU airlines to be affected: it will be in a position to act if there is evidence of a so-called threat of injury, and that has been one of the key issues in the negotiations. Efficiency too because we have a clear timeframe: a timeframe to investigate and a timeframe to terminate the investigation. We also have the possibility of shortening the timeframe should a matter of urgency arise. And efficiency also in the sense that the regulation provides the Commission with actual means to restore fair competition through the adoption of measures of a financial or operational nature. Complementarity: of course, the regulation as such would not make our industry competitive but, together with the comprehensive bilateral agreements that we are concluding, we have a whole system. An investigation, as it proceeds, can, at a given moment, feed in into the bilateral efforts to resolve a problem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to vote on one of the latest regulations of this mandate for the aviation sector. Unfair competition in the aviation sector is a scourge. Take, for example, the Gulf companies: they are subsidized by their states, particularly to pay kerosene and airport charges, which is a real scandal. These practices are the cause of the destruction of thousands of jobs among their competitors who cannot keep up, and so many employees put on the hook. This scourge leads to another scourge, because every time this unfair competition causes the closure of a direct link between Europe and Asia, it is in favour of a longer, therefore more polluting, route through the new Gulf hub. We see clearly, through this aviation sector, that social and ecological issues are intimately linked. The explosion of air traffic is a social and climatic bomb. As employees, consumers and citizens, we are all victims. As I recall, the aviation sector is 3% of global emissions - the equivalent of emissions from a country like Germany. What is this text doing to remedy this? Too little, I'm afraid. The evil is deep. Air reform is a huge challenge. We saw, during the Paris agreement to save the climate in 2015, that the sector was even excluded from the negotiations. But what makes me sad is to see Europe today submitting to a global system that refuses to take its part in the fight against global warming. However, we have voluntary countries in Europe, ready to take up the problem of aviation head-on, and which are now putting several solutions on the table, such as the creation of a kerosene tax or the ban on direct mail flights, as was recently done between Brussels and Amsterdam. Commissioner, we no longer have time to wait for the airline industry to reform itself. It is up to us, the European legislators, to take these challenges hand-in-hand and meet them. The aviation sector is an economic challenge, a social challenge, but it is primarily a climate challenge.

A strategy that contributed to the degradation or destruction of flag companies, which fueled the privatization processes of the sector, both airlines, infrastructure or services such as assistance at scale. This process results in severe damage to countries, but also to workers who have seen their labour rights and precariousness in the sector significantly degraded.  It is in the sacrosanct competition that this proposal focuses, based on a dichotomy between european and non-EU companies in the single market. It seeks to interfere in the organization of the sector in foreign countries, creating conditionalities for the authorization of operating companies that have state subsidies. Nothing new. They also interfere with national strategies for the aviation sector.  Omitted are the consequences of so-called competition between EU-based companies and the single market to foster so-called low-cost companies that add up to profits at the expense of the degradation of the quality of service, the assault on workers' rights, as often as in breach of labour laws.

In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in connections within both the European Union and to third countries. The market is growing rapidly in the shadow of competitive pressure from outside the European Union. The sources of this pressure lie, inter alia, in the competition for access to emerging countries' markets and the increasing process of globalisation. Major competitors for European airlines, for example, have been carriers from the Middle East, which have enormous capital and offer a high standard of connections at a relatively low price. In addition, they do not necessarily have to comply with EU regulations, which on the one hand facilitates their rapid development and expansion, but on the other hand absolutely distorts competition.  I agree with all my previous previous members, who say that we should make every effort to ensure that new agreements with emerging and strategic markets are concluded precisely in the light of the fair competition clause. An efficient system of compensatory measures is needed to ensure a level playing field for European airlines, and I believe that this regulation will be a tool that will strengthen the European aviation industry. Remember, however, that in the end it is the passenger who chooses the airline. This is determined by both the price of the ticket and the quality of services, the certainty of travel and the timeliness. I hope that the airlines that we will strengthen – European airlines – will have this absolutely in mind.

It is therefore absolutely necessary for us legislators to protect the aviation sector by means of tools and mechanisms that penalise unfair practices of companies in third countries, but also ensure effective connectivity. Such practices, as in the case of State subsidies, can seriously distort competition in the air transport market. As regards air transport activity at European level, it must take place in an environment characterised by open and fair competition, taking into account, however, very important aspects, such as working conditions, service quality standards, but also environmental protection. Finally, as co-chair of the Intergroup for the Development of European Tourism, I would like to send a message to European companies and draw their attention to their own business practices, which often cause them to lose to companies in third countries. My recommendation is to stop discounting the quality of the services they offer for an additional profit to the detriment of the interests of passengers and to maintain a balanced value for money.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would like to begin by thanking you very much, a thank you to my shadow rapporteurs, who have worked hard with me to draw up good guidelines and, in particular, to set priorities for 2020. It is not an easy year because this year, on the one hand, is the transition to the multiannual financial framework and we must try to make a sensible transition. Secondly, it is not an easy year because, in the Brexit vote, we are moving from one disaster to the next, so to speak, and ultimately we do not know what is to come in the end, and thirdly, because we face major challenges – on the one hand, the promotion of competitiveness, jobs, social prosperity within the European Union, then challenges in the area of development aid and in the areas of migration flows and people. , which suffer a great deal in other countries, and thirdly, of course, issues of security, that is to say internal and external security, and issues relating to the fact that we want to protect our citizens as much as possible.  I would simply ask, Commissioner, that you also respond in particular to our wish, particularly in the area of Erasmus and youth, because we firmly believe that only if young people have safe and good jobs, if we have an industry and an economy that is able to offer competitive jobs, and we want to invest in these technologies of the future, so to speak. , want to educate young people well, but also want to enable them to get to know other countries as part of their training, to get to know their European neighbours, to have contact with them, and to promote these programmes in particular.  We also have programmes where the success rate in the area of Horizon Europe is quite low, and I repeat it – I think I repeat myself slowly every year, and somehow I get a little tired of repeating it – because I actually want programmes like COSME, programmes such as Future and Emerging Technologies, where we sometimes have up to 97% rejection rates, not because the programmes are bad. , not because the projects are bad, but because we do not receive enough money from the Member States – and I also hope that young people in the European Union will have promising jobs, jobs in which they can find social protection, sustainable jobs, and that companies will be able to encourage and support investment in this area. I believe that this is our core mission to fulfil these two tasks, to promote young people so that they are well qualified on the one hand, in such a way that it is permanent, and, on the other hand, to support jobs and innovation in such a way that sustainable jobs can be created here in the European Union, competitive with other countries on the planet.  I hope that this year – and I am quite frank in this regard – we will meet Member States that are not talking to us again in the last three days; since the Council is not here today, I am still saying this into the microphone and put it in the Minutes, because it would make sense if we did not discuss the essential issues with each other at three o'clock in the morning, but could perhaps agree on essential content beforehand, even if that is only in the next parliamentary term. Nevertheless, I would like the Council to deal with this budget as early as possible, and I would be very pleased if the Commission took our priorities into account.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 299, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. With your debate today, you are opening up the budget discussions for 2020 – a special year, firstly because it is the last year within the framework of our 2014-2020 budget, and secondly because we have uncertainty with Brexit and no one knows today whether our UK colleagues want to participate in the budget next year with all their rights and obligations. , which they adopted unanimously with us in 2013, including in the Council, and thirdly, because we have a year of change, a year of change in Parliament and also in the Commission. This makes it all the more likely that we should contribute to stability, so that budgetary programmes have a positive effect on the development of Europe and that the objectives we have in common are also supported and achievable with European money. I would like to thank Mrs Hohlmeier for her wise preparatory work, which consists, on the one hand, in bringing together the different expectations of the political groups, of colleagues in the committees, here. This is not easy year after year and all the more difficult in the election year. I would also like to thank the Members who were prepared to get involved and not to campaign around a position of Parliament, and I also thank her for the fact that her objectives, those of Parliament, are basically those that are also seen by the Commission. A year of change. You are now responsible for Parliament's position. I am confident that the next Parliament does not see this diametrically differently, but builds on it. That is why I hope that as many people as possible in the next Parliament will feel responsible for budgetary policy, that is to say, will be re-elected – from the rapporteur to many others who could bring their powers to budgetary matters and could also contribute to the next Parliament. The change in the Commission is an equally exciting question, because the concilication period will in any case start with the Juncker Commission on 29 October, may end with the next Commission on 18 November, or, if we have to stay longer in our tasks, because you do not accept the next Commission on time, with the Juncker Commission. Let's wait and see. In any case, I believe that continuity in the matter is very important for the stability of Europe. \"A bridge to the future Europe, investment in citizens, innovation and security\" is the title chosen by Mrs Hohlmeier. I think it is a smart title that will convince citizens of the added value of Europe and European finances. Our common priorities are still competitiveness, economic growth, better and more jobs and living conditions, research, the young generation, the fight for ecological developments and the fight against climate change. And we share the view that promoting economic growth and competitiveness is a very high priority. The last six years have been, by and large, good years for the European economy. Year after year, economic growth was higher than initially predicted. Year after year, we had more tax revenue than the estimate predicted. Year after year, the number of jobs has been increasing, unemployment and youth unemployment have fallen – far from sufficient, and much remains to be done. But the last six years have been good years. And, according to all the forecasts, economic development is now gloomy. All the more reason why a 2020 budget must have instruments that are used against stagnation, against recession, against a crisis, for economic growth, for jobs, for prosperity, for competitiveness within the framework of our limited finances. From COSME and our SMEs to start-up funding for innovative minds in the European Union, from Erasmus+ to our intercultural skills, from cybersecurity to the fight against climate change and for nature conservation, we have a wealth of programmes that are heading in the right direction and that must now be decided and strengthened within our limited resources. And in doing so, we need as much flexibility as possible. Parliament and the Commission should fight together, and in part also against the Council, to ensure that flexibility can be taken in a timely manner and that we can respond to the challenges and tasks that we face next year. We will then ensure that there is a sufficient level of payments, particularly in cohesion policy. Everything that has been done should be paid, made by payments, so as not to see a wave too much into the next decade. to be transferred. The Council adopted its guidelines in the Ecofin Council on 12 February, and today and in the next few days you will be the second budgetary authority to supplement your guidelines and priorities. As the Commission, we will do mediation work as far as we can in order to reach the best possible agreement between the Council and Parliament. The spring trialogue on 20 March is the first opportunity for this. Once again, their priorities are almost identical to those of the Commission. I thank you for the good preparatory work and for the fact that you have all been able, unable to mix the election campaign with what we all have to do in terms of craftsmanship for the 2020 budget in the interests of our citizens – thank you very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 300, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, my thanks and congratulations to Ms Monika Hohlmeier, my colleague, and also to Commissioner Oettinger, who is doing such good work on this portfolio, as he did on the previous portfolio on energy. I remember that well. It’s good to have good people leading us and they should be given credit.  It will be important that the 2020 budget sets out the right direction for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). For this reason, we must ensure that it sets out the key priorities we wish to achieve over the next decade. The budget must be strong, it must be well financed and it must be forward looking, as the Commissioner mentioned.  I welcome the rapporteur’s focus on innovation and research, an area I have been very much involved in in my time in the European Parliament. This is paramount to the EU’s continued growth, job creation in the 27 Member States and indeed the enhancement of our global competitiveness. I welcome the importance the rapporteur has given to successful programmes, such as Horizon 2020, Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (COSME) and digital investments.  Secondly, I welcome the prominence given to the climate challenge. We have a big challenge ahead to ensure that 2030 targets are met – we discussed those this morning in the presence of Commissioner Cañete – and that we implement the measures needed to ensure that the EU remains at the forefront of climate action. Indeed, it has shown great leadership again during this Commission, starting with the Paris Agreement a few years ago. Without sufficient funding for these actions, we will not achieve anything. Through the very successful programmes and instruments, the EU budget can help to mobilise the actions needed. This has been successful in recent years, with European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), for instance, alone having delivered 35 750 gigawatt hours of additional electricity, 90% of which is renewable. Additionally, it has ensured 5 000 gigawatt hours of energy savings per year. Its successor, which I’m involved in, will also help to make that a reality into the future. InvestEU is a big programme and it will build on EFSI and, indeed, we are actually in trilogues on that at the minute.  These results show the value of an ambitious, strong and adequately funded EU budget. I hope that we can continue this into 2020 and set the agenda for the finalisation of discussions towards the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.  Finally, I concur with the Commissioner in his reference to Brexit. It is extraordinary that only by 308 votes to 302 they decided not to crash out of the European Union. There will probably be a big deficit in our budget and I hope that the other Member States will see the sense of filling that gap so that, collectively, we can do the things we really want to do and can do better collectively, rather than on an individual basis.

This has not escaped anyone: the context is special, since it precedes our common deadline for all, on May 26th. It honours us, but it also obliges us. Defining the European budget is not, in fact, a simple matter of numbers. Drawing the outlines of an appropriate budget is essential to translate our political priorities into a concrete picture. What we are advocating is a budget that enshrines investment in a sustainable and inclusive development report. For, yes, it is possible, no displeasure to the bearers of populist and nationalist rhetoric, who dress their discourse with false truths and lies. First of all, I would like to thank Monica Hohlmeier, our rapporteur, because she has made quality initial proposals, budgetary guidelines which have enabled constructive compromise work and which have given each of us negotiators the opportunity to feed a constructive report for a sustainable European future. The priorities that have guided the work I have done on behalf of my group are as follows. The first is to strengthen the social dimension of the budget by being very vigilant. There are a number of important things. First, the future of the youth employment initiative, a program that has already proven its worth and continues to help thousands of young people outside the traditional channels to move into the labour market. Secondly, the preparation of the effective implementation of the European social rights base from the 2020 budget. Then, the promotion of policies of inclusion and the fight against all forms of discrimination, but also the enhancement of cultural policies and policies in favour of youth and citizenship, such as Erasmus or as a creative Europe. Nor should we forget, it is important, to protect European citizens and to respect the commitments made in the fight against climate change under the Paris Agreement. We must also increase our vigilance in defining a migration policy that focuses both on the origins of flows, by pursuing development policies in the countries of origin, and on the integration of refugees on European territory, without merging this aspect with security issues. The second priority is to strengthen the anticipatory dimension of supporting this budget in the face of all the changes facing Europeans, in order to avoid the stagnation of our economy, as the Commissioner said, while stimulating competitiveness and sustainable, green and inclusive growth for a society of solidarity. The third priority is to provide all the solutions to avoid the new payment crises, as the Commissioner said earlier, and I do not hide from you that the latest information on Brexit is causing real concern. The fourth priority is the use of all the opportunities and flexibility instruments in the MFF and the current financial regulation to develop a strong and ambitious budget. It is time for the Council to take responsibility. To be pro-European in speeches is honourable, but to be pro-European in fact is more engaging, and it is indispensable today. Therefore, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for this 2020 budget that we are carrying today is not only responsible but also a bridge to the next MFF.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this may be my last budget. One thing is certain, however, for meds in the current Parliament, this is the last budget to prepare. As you all pointed out, this is also the last budget of the 2014-2020 Multi-Year Fiscal Framework. In such a context, including Brexit, the effort could have faltered, but it was not, and I thank our rapporteur, Monika Hohlmeier. I will express our support for the guidelines and lines of force it proposes for the 2020 budget. We wholeheartedly welcome the desire to have instruments and means to stimulate and support strategic investments, particularly in the digital and artificial intelligence sectors, for the benefit of European economic growth and the creation of quality jobs. We support the demand for additional resources for programmes such as COSME and FET (future and emerging technologies), which undoubtedly contribute to the success of start-ups and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. We strongly support the strengthening of the resources for Erasmus, the youth employment initiative, the European Solidarity Corps, Commissioner, whose barely created it has already attracted 93,000 applications from young Europeans. Congratulations on this idea. We also wholeheartedly support Mrs Hohlmeier's emphasis on the need to provide the necessary payment appropriations as early as the 2020 budget to avoid the mountain of late payments that we had to resolve in 2014 and 2015. I have lived through this period and I have bitter memories of the Council's insensitivity to the serious problems that these delays have caused for companies, research centres, researchers and ordinary citizens. We support the necessary strengthening of the means to ensure better control of our external borders, to intensify the fight against smugglers in the Mediterranean, and to improve the conditions for the reception and integration of those who need our protection and to whom we have a duty to grant asylum. We support the additional budgetary efforts that we must devote to strengthening our security, domestically, on the one hand, by enabling the many instruments and agencies we have created to operate effectively, while ensuring scrupulous respect for citizens' rights, and externally, on the other hand, by giving substance to the efforts finally undertaken to lay the foundations for a coordinated defence capacity at European level. Three more concerns to conclude. Research and innovation, as you all said, are the keys to the economic future of our society. Our words are not followed by deeds. Today, Europe is ahead of South Korea, Japan, the United States, and soon China, in terms of the share of GDP devoted to research and development. I cannot understand and I do not accept the attitude of the Council which, by refusing the application of Article 15, paragraph 3, of the financial regulation, has not authorised for this year's budget the appropriations available for the Horizon Europe programme, because of the non-execution of certain projects. Such an attitude is unacceptable and must change. On the other hand, we must step up the fight against global warming, young people shout it in the streets, we proclaim it envy in our debates, our seminars and our publications, and yet I must note that, over the period 2014-2020, we have not devoted the 20% of the total budget that we have agreed to spend on it to protect the environment and combat global warming. This is not acceptable and it has to change. Finally, I want to break a spear in favour of increased support for our budget for UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for helping the few million Palestinian refugees.

On many aspects it can be a good starting point for the upcoming negotiations. For instance, the report is right when regretting that the Union is falling short of our climate goals, and that we are not even in a position of achieving the moderate 20% target of climate-related spending. This morning, we’ve heard here in the presence of young climate activists a debate on the need to take action against climate change. These engaged youngsters asked for urgency in delivering a climate-neutral economy based on renewables as soon as possible, but we are not delivering, not in climate change mitigation, not in halting biodiversity loss and time is running out. That’s why we need a much greener budget, that’s why we need climate-mainstreaming and climate-proofing. That’s why we need to act once and for all in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs.  The report is also right when calling for a higher social ambition in the next budget. Yes, without social cohesion, there is no union of equal citizens. We need more resources for the Youth Employment Initiative, to fight against poverty and for the integration of migrants. We need to deliver on the pillar of social rights, because social rights are also European added value.  It is also positive that the report underlines the need to bolster innovation, technological transformation and digitalisation, but the report is wrong in insisting on the need to fund defence through the EU budget. The defence spending that many of you see as a priority will be inefficient. It won’t address in the correct way problems of fragmentation, duplication and overcapacity, and there are indeed other much more pressing priorities to be covered by the EU budget.  Finally, a word on the procedure. Members of the Committee on Budgets and Commissioner Oettinger will surely remember what happened with Article 15.3 of the Financial Regulation during the last conciliation. This time, from the very beginning of the budget negotiation, we say very clearly that we want this provision to be used. This time we shouldn’t be fooled again.

He might be on the phone to his bookies placing a bet on some of the things in this and I’ll get round to what I think is quite a wild bet in a moment.  This is a really ambitious budget proposal. There’s lots of extra spending. What have we got here? It talks about Erasmus getting lots more money, more money for free movement, more money for the administrative budget and of course military spending — you know, that thing that we were told in the UK wasn’t real and was a dangerous fantasy. There’s lots of that, but then there’s something in paragraph 28 that I think is really important. The UK will pay up its share into these schemes, you say. Well, at the moment, nobody really knows what’s going to happen. Yes, okay, you’ve been fortunate. You’ve got Theresa May, who throws money like confetti because she frankly doesn’t know what she’s doing and you’ve got the Labour Party that would love to come in and be friends with you. All of this probably means you’re making a good bet there but, on the other hand, there is chaos at the moment. As anyone who turns on to the BBC Parliament channel or reads a British newspaper will know, there’s complete chaos and it could well be that these jaded old parties with their pathetic, timid leaders may well crumble and split into independent pieces, and then you might get someone who listens to what the British people are saying and they are not quite so keen to throw billions and billions of pounds as a farewell gesture, when there are problems at home that need looking at and issues at home. So yes, I understand why you’re taking a gamble with this and why you’re spending such huge amounts on the expectation of British money, but I do think you’re being a gambling man and you’re all counting on something that no one can be absolutely sure of.

We are discussing the 2020 budget and this is an extremely difficult and complicated budget for the whole of the European Union. Mrs Hohlmeier's thanks for taking up this task are all the more to be said.  Why is this budget difficult? Firstly, this is the last budget for the 2014-2020 perspective, which really means even a greater flow of invoices for projects that have been carried out in previous years. We need to be aware that, over time, 2020 will be the year of increased spending on some of the projects that have already started. Secondly , this is the last year – from a financial perspective – which is in a very precarious and unclear situation with Brexit. As my honourable predecessor said, we are in chaos, and the budget must therefore be designed in such a way that it can be adapted in some way to an unpredictable and chaotic situation. It is not inconceivable that the 2020 budget will have to be modified depending on the situation that will be with Brexit. Thirdly, it is a budget that is actually being prepared in parallel with the work on the new financial perspective. And what is interesting about this budget is that, in fact, this budget introduces certain elements as early as 2020, which we are working on for the years after 2020, and therefore today, as if the rapporteur shows us that there are certain elements that need to be done without waiting for the first january 2021. It therefore draws particular attention to the need to strengthen projects – i.e. actions – on pro-development actions such as Horizon 2020 and Erasmus. We are talking about this in a new perspective, that this needs to be increased – even three times in the case of Erasmus – but already in 2020 we need to go down this path. Similarly, it is very interesting that we are entering the path of defence – in the programmes preparing the future defence fund, in other words – 2020 is really a preparatory year for the new financial perspective, not just a closing year. Similarly, when we talk about innovation, about modern solutions, and also about climate issues. In other words, 2020 is, on the one hand, an uncertain, unclear situation when it comes to Brexit, on the other hand it is a matter of increased spending, and at the same time building a bridge between 2014-2020 and 2021, and in this sense this budget is an extremely challenging one and will have an impact on the next perspective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 311, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "   Mr President, I would first like to thank Monika Hohlmeier for listening and making the necessary compromises.

Speaking of which, dear Mr. Etheridge, I regret to tell you - I think he's gone, too bad! That, contrary to what you have said, the European Union's budget has been shrinking steadily since the 1990s. Commissioner, I am speaking to you. I would so much like to be wrong, I would love to see an end to this absurd tussle between Parliament and the Council. I would so much like, Commissioner, that the Commission does not systematically place itself in the intergovernmental logic on budgetary matters. I would love to be able to assure us with conviction that Parliament will commit to stopping this budget, if and only if funding for the fight against climate change increases in line with the commitments made in this multi-year fiscal framework 2014-2020. I would so much like to be able to ensure that the 2020 budget will be able to strengthen the financing of the integration of migrants and asylum seekers and to end the UNION's funding for the outsourcing of our immigration policy. I am so worried about the European project and I would so much like to be able to promise that the new challenges will be able to benefit from new funding, that Parliament will not accept that the new priorities are financed at the expense of solidarity policies. I would so much like that Brexit does not, once again, be used as a pretext to cut the EU budget. I would like to convince you so much that gender-based budgeting is broken and that there is an urgent need to accelerate this process for gender equality.

Allow me please to speak from my heart now, and it’s perhaps not so much about budget. I would like to point out, contrary to Ms Ní Riada and Mr Etheridge, who said that the Commissioner was not listening, but actually Mr Oettinger was receiving information about Brexit through his left ear, and listening to us through his right ear, so dear Mr Etheridge — where are you by the way, are you listening? Ah, no — learn to multitask, otherwise you’ll never become a Commissioner. So now I go to my budget experience and say it has been a great honour to serve on the Committee on Budgets, to learn from Mr Deprez, Mr Olbrycht, Mr Fernandes, from our great rapporteur, Monika Hohlmeier, and Ms Gardiazabal and many others. Even from Mr Kölmel, by the way, he is a good economist, but we never actually delivered as much as we had hoped on climate change policies. And now my final point is that, on this very Friday, the school strike for climate comes to Estonia for the first time. My son will be among the participants, my father, a former Member of this Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, will be there and will give his support as a climatologist. Where do you think I shall be? Of course, I will be with them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Your comments today enrich the work of the Commission, because we are currently preparing our draft budget for next year, which we intend to present to you in a few weeks' time. This is the purpose of Parliament's position, including that of the Council, and that is what we will build on our proposal. In this respect, I take Parliament's expectations seriously that we will include Brexit implications in the Commission's draft budget. We will know more in the next few days, perhaps tomorrow. And rest assured, the 2020 draft will be based on whether the UK's friends are prepared to participate in the 2020 budget with all their rights and obligations, or whether Brexit without a deal will lead to the conclusion that there will be no deposits from London next year, but also no participation in programmes. Our legal view is independent of this. We believe that the budgetary framework will be binding on all 28 Member States by the end of 2020, that it was adopted unanimously in 2013 and that therefore all legal means should be used to achieve obligations and rights by the end of 2020. Nevertheless, according to the precautionary principle, we could then present a draft budget in the late spring, which will be drawn up without the British and without their deposits and disbursements. In other words, we would then be short of EUR 12 billion, and we in the Commission must close this gap with our proposal. I am not going into detail at this time about the development of the 2019 budget. However, it may be that, in a few days' time, we will have to present to this House an amendment, a kind of supplementary budget for the current financial year, in order, for example, to fill in a funding gap of EUR 6 billion – EUR 12 billion next year, six billion this year. And you know as well as I do that the only level in Europe that has no right to take on debt is the European level. The Member States have the right and the opportunity to take on debt, the regions as well as the municipalities. At European level, we have an absolute obligation to finance our tasks and expenditure through revenue every day, and the road to the bank is and remains blocked. Once again, perhaps in a few days' time we as the Commission could be forced to start deliberations, to make a proposal on how we will make up for six billion this year and how we will make up for twelve billion next year. I will come back to this House and the Council as soon as we have a little more clarity from London. Incidentally, for a Brexit gap in the budget framework over the next decade, as a Commission, we have always proposed my formula to make up for the Brexit gap at 50% through cuts and 50% by slightly higher deposits. If the formula seems comprehensible, fair and convincing, then it can also be the formula for 2019 and 2020. Six billion this year would have to be compensated by a supplementary budget in the form of three billion slightly higher deposits and in the form of three billion made by cuts, and the twelve billion next year with six billion through cuts and six billion with higher deposits. Mrs Riada criticised me for being on the phone for a short time. In fact, I could hardly believe the result in the House of Commons and therefore asked. But I mean, I have listened to at least two-thirds of her speech, she listens to me to zero percent. The Commission does not deserve any respect. But it is clear that democracy takes place in a credible way when one criticises and accepts the answers in attendance, and vice versa. Mr Etheridge, with all the weight he has and which is considerable, has been arguing here about an incredibly high level of European budgetary expenditure. A clear sentence for our citizens: every european citizen who earns EUR 100 through his or her hands, through head work or through investment, will give up EUR 50 of the EUR 100 – through taxes, levies, fees and contributions. That is the national quota of Europe, an average of 50%. And of the 50 euros, one euro comes into Europe's budget, 49 remain in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Glasgow, Stuttgart or with social security systems. One in 50 is Europe, 49 are the Member States, the regions, the municipalities, the social security systems. That is why I believe that Europe should at least be worth this one euro of 50 to us, especially if Europe can use it to finance and realise added value. And the Added value can be seen in Erasmus+, for the benefit of a young generation that is experiencing and getting to know Europe at the right time, in major research projects where no Member State or university, not even the best, nor Cambridge and Oxford, can compete on their own against Google and against Silicon Valley in general and against the Chinese. I would like to hope that the friends from the United Kingdom will continue to cooperate with Europe in the field of research. This is what the researchers in Oxford, Cambridge and London want, so that Great Britain does not become Little England in the field of research despite excellence. Added value is the crucial task of European programmes, of every euro we invest at European level, and this is due to Parliament's expectations and also to the Commission's proposal, which I am convinced will bring in the spring. I think Mr Olbrycht's idea that 2020 is, on the one hand, the last budget of the current budget framework, but also a bridge budget to the next budgetary framework. Some programmes are already testing programmes for a modern budgetary framework in the next decade, and we should take this into account in the further discussions. Thank you very much for your speeches, thank you very much for coordinating Mrs Hohlmeier. We will weigh up very carefully what you are deciding, we will also make it largely our basis and then come up with our proposal in the late spring, which will hopefully not include all of them in dramatic, if dramatic, consequences from Brexit, as it could then happen. I hope that as many of parliament's budgetary experts as possible will also be in the next one. And I would like to thank those who do not return for many good conversations. I take Mr Tarand, for example, if he does not come back. I think his collegial and fair manner across party lines was decisive.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, thank you very much for this very intensive and good discussion. On Brexit, I honestly admit that I was appalled by a result of 312 votes to 308. For it was a question of whether or not to produce a completely disordered mess. And I find this to be something almost spectacular to me and almost a disrespect to friends among friends who have worked together for many years and championed common goals. Nevertheless, there was then a four-vote majority.  I hope that a little bit of common sense will come in, because Britain is not only interested in Horzion Europe. Britain is interested in cooperation in particular on security issues, and more recently the UK is interested in many types of cooperation. Suddenly, when things get away, you realize how important they are. I hope that the sensible forces will still be right and that we will still have an opportunity to develop an orderly cooperation.  I would like to say one or two sentences on what has come from the shadow rapporteurs. I believe that our essential task is to really stand together with the Council and also to strengthen the Commission's back if we are to pursue the necessary finances for our important priority areas. I understand that the Greens – almost like a Pavlovian reflex – have an anti-defence policy, but to make the claim that all expenditure in Europe is double and triple that of the Member States is precisely the wrong intention expressed here to the outside world.  We have the intention to use synergies and not to do everything twice and three times and fourtimes, but to implement projects together, for which otherwise everyone would have to carry out individual research, with individual tenders each country would have to spend more money individually on itself than if we jointly implemented corresponding research and projects together. I would also like, ladies and gentlemen, to have the courage to stand together in the key core areas at such a difficult time at times of European times, not to allow ourselves to be divided, because if we, as a Parliament, face the Member States and defend our position, then we have a chance to achieve a great deal and perhaps to awaken some of them. , that one should not only count against each other in static figures, but also actually see and use the added value of the expenditure that we can generate with each other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The European External Action Service and the European Parliament have been working hand in hand, showing in practice, how different institutions can work towards the same goal. Let me also thank honourable Member Ramón Jáuregui for his strong commitment and for heading the European Parliament delegation to the country.  The situation in Nicaragua remains tense. Although the most visible part of the violent repression has passed, there are still so many political prisoners unlawfully arrested. Several of them face charges of terrorism for having taken part in demonstrations. Jail conditions for a number of prisoners are unacceptable. Civil society organisations and independent journalists are continuously harassed and many have had their legal status cancelled.  The European Union has been clear in condemning this state of affairs, most recently in the January Foreign Affairs Council conclusions. We have called on the authorities to free all political prisoners and ensure due process and decent conditions for all. We have urged for a genuine dialogue to be resumed and for political reforms to be enacted. We are ready to use all our policy instruments in response to developments in the country.  The ad-hoc Delegation of the European Parliament, led by Ramón Jáuregui, accompanied by our head of delegation in Managua, has greatly contributed to amplifying these messages. I’m glad that you managed to have a full programme of meetings with the opposition, civil society organisations, independent journalists and families of victims and prisoners to visit inmates without any restriction and to engage in a direct discussion with President Ortega and his wife, President Murillo. I understand that many of these encounters were heavily charged and emotional, and that it took a lot of courage and stubbornness to organise them, but they were necessary and important and we are truly grateful for your work.  Some recent events give us some hope and I am convinced that our work has contributed to creating a more positive climate. First, the Government of Nicaragua held high-level meetings with the Organisation of American States, with some international actors and the business community. Second, 100 prisoners were sent home under house arrest. This was one of the requests that the European Parliament’s delegation had made to President Ortega.  Finally, meetings with the opposition started on 27 February. These initial meetings led to the adoption of a roadmap, setting rules for a negotiation process and identifying participants. The possible inclusion of witnesses and international guarantors for the agreements to be reached remains a sticking point, as do possible re-conditions related to a further release of prisoners.  We are available to consider technical support to the mediation, should that be necessary. The UN, the Organisation of American States and possibly the European Union might be asked to be involved in the process.  Although these are encouraging developments compared to a few weeks ago, we remain very cautious. We still do not know how serious the government is about restoring fundamental rights, as enshrined in the constitution, in particular, freedom of assembly and expression. Heavy police presence in Managua is maintained.  The change of the penitentiary regime for 100 prisoners is a positive step, but we do not forget the over 600 prisoners who remain in jail, often in inhuman conditions and some of them on hunger strike. Nor will we forget that all the accused must enjoy due process and justice as guaranteed by the constitution of Nicaragua. This is why the Civic Alliance is pressing for prisoner’s rights and their release.  We need to see how far the government is willing to go in opening up to the opposition demands and to engage in political reforms. The partisan management of the regional elections on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua a few days ago did not demonstrate a willingness to do things differently. I hope that a renewal of the Supreme and electoral courts in April will not be another missed opportunity to change course.  We must also salute the work done by the opposition in learning from the mistakes of the failed dialogue in July 2018.  We hope more result-driven negotiations will enable all Nicaraguans to feel represented, find justice and, eventually, cast their votes freely for the future of their country.  So, despite the legitimate doubts that we may have about this nascent process, despite the open wounds and the many victims still seeking justice, we should all encourage the steps currently being taken. We now expect a negotiating table and further concrete signs from the government side, as this is the best way to achieve a peaceful way out of the current crisis.  We Europeans will remain vigilant and ready to react to any further deterioration of human rights and the rule of law, and we will continue to accompany any positive step towards a political solution to the crisis, together with our international partners. Let me thank the European Parliament once again. Your engagement will continue to be precious in the weeks ahead.

During our visit, Commissioner, to which you referred, in January, the European Parliament was able to see — as other international missions have already done, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the group of independent experts, the high representative of the United Nations, who, by the way, have not been able to return to the country — that the situation in Nicaragua is not compatible with the human rights clause , which is an essential element of our Partnership Agreement.  In the resolution adopted by our Parliament on 31 May, we have already found the murders that had taken place, arbitrary detention, torture and the disrecognisement of all fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of the press.  You were right, Commissioner, that our visit to Nicaragua's prisons was particularly emotional. It's hard to see 20-year-olds sentenced to more than thirty-thirty-five years in prison. Unfortunately, the information we receive from Managua is that, indeed, as you said, there are still more than six hundred political prisoners.  The women we meet in La Esperanza prison are on hunger strike for ill-treatment and several prisoners have also been mistreated in Model Prison.  I believe that we would serve the cause we are defending, Commissioner, and that we would disappoint the expectations of the people of Nicaragua if we were complacent about this situation. It is therefore imperative that, in order for this national dialogue to succeed, the unconditional and immediate release of political prisoners, the cessation of harassment of the opposition and the guarantee of the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right of freedom of the press, and which can be achieved, Commissioner— has not yet been achieved. , a roadmap for the citizens of Nicaragua to re-own their destination and to take the floor.  I believe, Commissioner, that in this Parliament we have done a very dedicated job, with great patience, but the time has come, Commissioner, to move from words to deeds.

I'll start by making you a little confession, if you like, intimate. The whole delegation of the European Parliament, which visited Nicaragua for four days, lived excitedly — even with a feeling of great compassion — everything we saw and everything we heard. And I want to begin by claiming that this Parliament is with the people of Nicaragua; with the people who mourn their dead; with the people who suffer because their children are in jail; with the people who suffer restrictions on freedom. This is a bankruptcy, very serious, very serious, absolutely condemnable, of what we call the rule of law and the conditions of freedom and democracy. This is happening in Nicaragua. I would like to address my colleagues on the left, who have made an amendment to our resolution saying that there is no interference from the United States in Nicaragua. No ladies and gentlemen, there's no interference. The problem, Mr Pimenta, if I may, is that there is a revolution that has become totalitarian. Excuse me, there was a revolution that has become totalitarian. There was a revolution that was historically explained and unfortunately crushes freedoms and crushes its people. I have always claimed freedom from the left. \"Socialism is freedom,\" we have always said.  And the European Parliament supports these people. The European Parliament supports serious dialogue. I hope there's a serious dialogue! But it has three basic conditions that are not being met. The first is that political prisoners must be released. The second is that there can be no restrictions on freedom, that there has to be free movement for leaders, for social movements. And the third is that international organizations have to return to the country, because they are respectable and are the credit and observatory that human rights are fulfilled.  And the European Parliament's political position is that if that dialogue moves forward, as the Commissioner said, Europe will help. I'm telling Commander Ortega. If there is serious dialogue and there is a path to freedom, we will help.

Now Alex walks again, but out of tribute to the victims of the police brutality. The people call him \"el maratonista\", the marathon man. For Ortega, however, he is a terrorist and a coup-plotter, as is the other symbol, the young student leader Amaya Coppens. 24 years old, a compatriot of mine. We visited her in the prison \"La Esperanza\". \"Show what is happening here\" she says, and she asked, \"because we don't want Nicaragua to be the new Venezuela\". She just ended a 13-day hunger strike. This is her homemade bracelet in the national colors, white and blue. Admirable, courageous and strong. I received a letter today from her father, her Belgian father. Harrowing situations. People like her are the future of her country. You won't let that future languish in a cell. Ortega has chosen the path of repression, censorship and violence. That path is dead. The only way out is for the political prisoners to regain their freedom. This is the prerequisite for a new national dialogue. There must also be new fair elections. We have all said this to President Ortega personally, but the pressure, Commissioner, must be stepped up. It will have to be tangible in the form of targeted and individual sanctions. We have an association agreement. There's a democracy clause in there. I count on us to be true and faithful to our principles and that our treaties are more than a piece of paper.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 322, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Javier NART", "mepid": "125005", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr. President, Sergio Ramírez, Henry Ruiz, Luis Carrión, Dora María Téllez, Monica Baltodano, Jaime Wheelock, Víctor Tirado, Moisés Hasan, Ernesto Cardenal, Hugo Torres, Gioconda Belli, Brooklyn Rivera, Carlos Tonnermann, Humberto Ortega... All of them are radical opponents of the government of Daniel Ortega.  For those who understand that this Government is a victim of the reactionaries to the salary of imperialism, I will illustrate: they are my fellow Sandinistas fighting Somoza, against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, where I was and where I was wounded on the southern front Benjamin Zeledón. It was an honor to be there. They are commanders and ministers of true Sandinism, today betrayed by Daniel Ortega; they are the ones who, from the barricades, from prison, from persecution and torture, defended and today continue to defend freedom, democracy and dignity for their Nicaraguan homeland, which is also mine.  I will recall that, of the six members of the National Directorate, five are against the regime—the Sandinista National Directorate—as are all members of the 1979 Revolutionary Governing Board, like thousands of fellow Sandinistas. They are the true Sandinistas, today persecuted by Daniel Ortega for defending what they defended yesterday against Somoza: freedom and dignity.  Repression, exile, hundreds of dead, corruption, violation of human rights, that is today Daniel Ortega's Nicaragua, defended, from sectarianism or ignorance, by salon revolutionaries to the last Nicaraguan, of course. Because they don't care about Nicaragua, but their own myths, their own stories, the revolution of others, but never their own.  The motion for a Resolution to be presented tomorrow is the result of a general consensus. It requires the suspension of the European Union Agreement with Nicaragua and the imposition of personal sanctions on Daniel Ortega and that Government which suppresses and imprisons its own colleagues, its own people.

They know that the wave of protests, regimenting legitimate expectations and the population's aniggities, was manipulated and orchestrated by sectors of the more reactionary right, deliberately provoking violent and dead clashes. They know that this wave of violence was directed not only against the authorities and the government, but also against members of the Sandinista Front who were attacked, kidnapped and murdered. They are aware of the government's initiative to launch a broad dialogue that will end the clashes promoted by the opposition and build peaceful solutions. They know that the United States Government imposes sanctions and threatens Nicaragua with an economic veto, preventing access to credits from international financial organizations in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.

Now the Sandinista Daniel Ortega no longer has an enemy to fight, he no longer has a dictator to depose or the Contras and the CIA to deal with. Now he's the dictator. Meanwhile, the country finds itself torn apart by killings, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture and all-out censorship, not to mention the constitutional reforms that have allowed Ortega to perpetuate himself in power, far beyond the limits allowed by the Constitution.  In short, nothing is missing: there are all the ingredients of dictatorship. A dictatorship that is of little interest to the world, because Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries on the planet. A dictatorship that, in order to remain in power, does not count on the support of the people, but on that of the snipers, who shoot at helpless demonstrators and kill hundreds of them.

That was the cry of helplessness of the prisoners of La Esperanza prison, subjected daily to constant beatings, inhumane treatment, deprived of their most basic rights and who cannot see their relatives, when we visited them last January. They're innocent. They are in prison simply for defending their ideas in a country ruled by a tyrant where peace, freedom and democracy are neither guaranteed, fundamental rights are respected, freedom of expression nor assembly is defended. Women, however, who, despite all that they are suffering, do not give up, and thus confess it to us with admirable strength.  After all they told us and what we saw, we demanded that the prison authorities, the Deputy Minister and Ortega himself not have a single retaliation. But, once again, the tyrant did the opposite and the escalation of repression continued, further increasing, until now, a month and a half later, to an unsustainable situation.  The reality of Nicaragua is extremely worrying, at least for all those who feel Democrats and defend fundamental rights not only for us but also for the citizens of any country. Since the crisis erupted in Nicaragua, more than 300 people have been killed, 1,400 injured, nearly 700 political prisoners and nearly 50,000 exiles. Don't you think these figures are enough? I personally find them chilling and I believe that this Parliament cannot remain impassive for another second. Europe has to do something. You have to act. Commissioner, the restoration of democracy in Nicaragua is also the responsibility of your Commission. The Union must be involved and firm. A regime like Ortega Murillo's cannot ask the opposition for dialogue. It's a farce. In order for real dialogue to exist, the immediate release of political prisoners and the cessation of all forms of abuse or intimidation against the Nicaraguan people is essential. That's enough. Nicaragua deserves to live in peace, and the groups in this House should thus pass it on to the revolutionary who betrayed, as has been said very well, an entire country as soon as it rises to power.  These tyrants who arrived with pseudo-democratic subterfuge to appear to have a certain patena or democratic credential are also afraid of free and democratic elections. You know why? Because they know they don't have majority support, and they're afraid of losing the privileges of their looting and unscathed corrupts. From here I defend today the imposition of specific sanctions against the members of the Government of Ortega and their henchmen.

Abuse in Nicaraguan prisons must cease— as we all claim — and the deprivation of liberty of these young women and other political prisoners must also cease. Daniel Ortega's regime, it has also been said, has to take negotiations with the opponents of the Civic Alliance seriously and meet their minimum demands. One of them, the release of political prisoners. It must also end the press crackdown and, finally, other demands that we set out in the motion for a resolution which we will vote on tomorrow.  Since April last year, it has also been said, there have already been nearly four hundred dead and well over a thousand injured people who have claimed the crisis in Nicaragua, unseeded by protest demonstrations in front of the regime. The crisis has to be resolved through negotiations with the opposition and, as we have been demanding in this Parliament since our resolution of 31 May last year, it must culminate in fair, transparent and credible elections.

It is to all of you that I address, especially to the fathers and mothers who have seen their children killed by policemen and paramilitaries during the protests, all the students who have their careers and their future interrupted as a penalty for their peaceful participation in these demonstrations, and those courageous men and women who, unlawfully detained for exercising their freedom of expression face immense hard prison sentences , many of them confined to inhuman and degrading cells that are not even worthy for pigs.

The European Union should apply individual specific sanctions to those responsible for the Government of Nicaragua for crimes against humanity and activate the democratic clause of the Association Agreement between the Union and Central America.

As the Council's work has resulted in a very extensive text, the Council's decision to ask Parliament to consult again must be welcomed.  The European Parliament supported by a large majority the previous zwiefka report, pointing out several areas that were particularly important to us: the hearing of the child, the use of mediation in family matters and the placement of the child outside the family. It is to be welcomed that all these issues are included in the final text. This is particularly important in the often difficult situation of the court's decision to place the child outside his or her biological family.  I would like to point out here that it will still be up to the court to decide whether the child will be placed in foster care, a care institution or relatives after taking into account the origin and cultural environment in which the child has previously been present. The new rules on cooperation between the relevant services will allow reliable information to be provided and for the court to take a decision in the best interests of the child. However, it is necessary to warn against a false interpretation of that provision, which is that it requires courts to issue a child of a given nationality to a family from the same country. It is still up to the court to decide whether or not to do so.  New, more detailed rules and rules for determining jurisdiction in parental care cases are also a good solution. The starting point remains the court of the country where the child is permanent, but the emergency situations described in detail are foreseen. Now the consent of both parents may also determine changes of jurisdiction, or the court having jurisdiction may decide that another court may, for the best interests of the child, be more appropriate to hear the case.  There is also a new article in the procedure for the return of the child after parental abduction, which refers to the decision to refuse the return of the child under Article 13 of the Hague Convention. It concerns a situation in which the court or office called upon to deliver the child proves that it is impossible to return for the best interests of the child. These are dramatic situations where a child experiences physical, psychological or sexual violence. This is a good record that clearly defines the procedure to be followed.  Furthermore, as requested by the European Parliament, the enforcement procedure, that is to say, the certificate of recognition of a judgment of a court in another Member State, has been abolished.  Although it took the Council more than two years to establish a common position, it should be considered that the Member States were up to the task. The Council text takes into account many possible scenarios that occur in childcare cases and parental abductions, where often nothing is black and white. The presented text has been adapted to the complex life situations in which our citizens and, above all, children are located. In many places, it is emphasised that the court is to take into account, first of all, the best interests of the child as a determinant in decision-making. We should therefore support the draft report, which I present today on behalf of Tadeusz Zwiefka and which endorses the final text of the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 343, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Julia PITERA", "mepid": "124898", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Brussels IIA regulation is a key tool for navigating cross-border legal issues in family matters and providing protection to children.

In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zwiefka, for his excellent cooperation and for the swift procedure for this second opinion. You will have noticed that many of Parliament’s requests expressed in the first opinion are included in the compromise text. On the other hand, I know that the text does not include everything that many of you asked for. We must remember that these rules were agreed by unanimity, that the negotiations were not easy and that the text includes significant improvements. In particular, a great achievement is the abolition of the intermediate procedures to obtain cross-border enforcement of all judgments – the so-called exequatur. The new rules on enforcement of judgments will provide more legal certainty. In child return proceedings, I am very pleased that there will be shorter deadlines applied to different stages in the return procedure. The text reinforces the rights of children by ensuring that their perspective, with only a few exceptions, will be heard in the legal proceedings concerning them. The mutual recognition of Member States’ practices in this respect will avoid refusal at the stage of recognition or enforcement, thus allowing proper circulation of judgments in the Union. Furthermore, the compromise will provide clearer rules on the placement of the child in another Member State by establishing an autonomous consent procedure for all types of cross-border placement. The rules also ensure more effective cooperation between central authorities, which should continue playing a key role in supporting courts and competent authorities in applying the regulation. I look forward to hearing your views and I trust that there will be strong support for this regulation from the European Parliament in the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 344, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, as European Parliament coordinator on children’s rights, I welcome the Brussels IIa Regulation because it strengthens our legal toolbox to protect children. It facilitates the mutual recognition of cross—border decisions in parental responsibility and child abduction. It improves the efficiency of judicial proceedings and gives more legal certainty. For example, when a cross—national couple splits up and one parent returns to the country of origin and brings a child without the other parent concerned, the procedures to return the child are now simplified and accelerated. This regulation affects the daily life of so many international families and children and child abduction has devastating and long—lasting consequences on the child. The longer the child is abducted the greater the impact is on the child’s life and time is key to reduce the harm on the child. Therefore, I welcome in particular the following major steps forward: clear time limits for both the decisions taken by the judge and the enforcement, restriction in the number of appeals that generally delayed drastically the return decisions and the obligation of the courts to hear and take into account children’s views in all proceedings concerning them. And this is crucial to uphold the fundamental guiding principle of the best interest of the child as a primary consideration and it also recognises that the child is a right holder. I regret, however, that Member States could not agree on common standards regarding hearings proceedings. Ensuring that the child’s voice is heard is not enough and this right can even become a burden for the child if it is applied without procedural safeguards and a child friendly practice. As coordinator for the European Parliament on children’s rights, handling many cases of parental abduction, I have seen that court hearings can be intimidating, with traumatic effects on children. I therefore call on you, Commissioner, on the Commission and on the Member States to develop common standards and to share best practices on safeguards for children. We need to avoid double victimisation and create a climate of trust and I’m also glad that mediation is given due weight. It often remains the best way to seek long—term, lasting solutions. Much more needs to be done to promote alternative dispute resolutions among parents and professionals involved in the cross—border family disputes. And in this respect the coordinator on children’s rights has an important role to assist parents and children in solving faster the disputes and fulfil every child’s right to see and meet both parents.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 345, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

A few months ago, the European Parliament drew particular attention in its resolution, which Mrs Pitera certainly remembers, to the outrageous practices of the German Jugendamts, which prevent children from foreign families living in Germany from contacting the language and culture of their home country. Thanks to the efforts of the Polish Government, this regulation obliges Member States to preserve the rights of the child to national, cultural, religious and linguistic identity in proceedings concerning the establishment of foster care. The procedure for exchanging information between authorities, which was also proposed by the Polish, will allow the government to quickly identify and identify, for example, the child's relatives who can take care of him.

We also think that it is right to encourage the use of mediation, where of course it is possible.

It allows for the free movement of judgments, public documents and agreements throughout the European Union. The Regulation also clarifies issues relating to children and the procedure for dealing with judgments given in this field in other Member States.  In addition, the Regulation lays down conditions for the return of children wrongfully abducted to another EU country. In this respect, the Regulation strengthens the return mechanism provided for in the Hague Convention, which is the main legal instrument governing parental kidnapping. Please note that it applies only to international abductions and detentions. There is therefore a need to further improve judicial cooperation between EU Member States so that it can deal with the growing number of cases of citizens in cross-border relationships.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2019-03-13.json", "name": "Emil RADEV", "mepid": "124850", "text": "  in writing. – When we talk about family law and parental responsibility, there is nothing more important than protecting the interests of the child. Very often, when parents have some kind of conflict or it comes to a breakup, the child can not understand what is happening. This is our role as legislators – to ensure that the best interests of the child are always put at the forefront. The revised text of the proposal to change the Brussels 2a Regulation does just that, with the text already containing a number of safeguards on the protection of the child's interests in the event of a separation between parents or in cases where one parent kidnaps a child. We see that an obligation has been put in place to enable the child to express their opinion during the process, which can be done directly or through a representative. We must keep in mind that the opinion of the child in such a proceeding is always extremely important and it must be heard and taken into account, regardless of his age. I have stated before that procedures should be as short as possible and conducted in a language that is understandable to the child.

The European Parliament has overwhelmingly supported my previous report, pointing to several areas that were particularly important to us: the hearing of a child, the use of mediation in family matters and the placement of a child outside the family.  I am pleased that all these issues are included in the final text of the Council. This is particularly important when the court decides to place the child outside his or her biological family. The new rules on cooperation between the relevant services will allow reliable information to be provided and for the court to take a decision in the best interests of the child.  I would like to warn against a false interpretation of this provision, which is that it requires the courts to give a child of a given nationality to a family from the same country. It is still up to the court to decide this independently, taking into account the origin, the cultural environment and, above all, the best interests of the child.  The Council text takes into account the many possible scenarios that occur in childcare cases and parental abductions, where often nothing is black and white.
