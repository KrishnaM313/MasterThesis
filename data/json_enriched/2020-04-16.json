I would like, at the beginning of the debate, to express a thought, together with you, the victims of the Coronavirus, their families and their loved ones. In addition, I would like to send all sick people our best wishes for a speedy recovery.  At the moment, our health workers are at the forefront of the fight against this virus and deserve all our support, admiration and gratitude for the work they are doing and for the generosity that distinguishes them by operating in often dramatic situations. And our thoughts go, of course, to all the volunteers, the health professionals and the people who are bringing their support to those in need. I have said it and I repeat, the humanity of our citizens is the greatest wealth we have.  I would also like to thank all those workers who keep our societies, farmers, employees, all those who work in telecommunications, security workers, armed forces, supermarket cashiers, line technicians who allow us to make connections, to call and to be close.  Many people, all active in their different fields of competence, who with discipline and a sense of responsibility have not given up: all of them naturally go our thanks.  Nor should we forget all those citizens who make a difference by simple gestures, respecting preventive measures, buying food for an elderly neighbour, perhaps calling them isolated friends, taking care of the most fragile people. Small gestures of concrete solidarity, as our Parliament has also wanted to do by opening its kitchens to prepare 1 000 meals a day for the homeless and volunteers: 100 vulnerable women will be housed in our premises in Brussels. But also in Strasbourg, in Luxembourg, we gave the authorities the willingness to use Parliament's premises for emergency-related activities.  These are the cities that host us, to which we owe a great deal of gratitude, and I would like to greet the citizens of Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg with you to say that it will soon be nice to meet again and continue to work together for the European Union. Parliament's initiatives have been marked by an emergency. I confess that I have found myself taking difficult initiatives, but I have always supported and encouraged all the political groups, no one excluded, and the advice of so many Members. Of course, parliament's functionality would not have been possible without the extraordinary support of our staff and our administration which, with courage and a sense of duty, has been present, and of all the Directors-General. I would like to ask the Secretary-General to extend our gratitude to the workers who are perhaps the most hidden, the cleaning women, the security men, and all those on the staff of our Directorates-General who have made it possible to make the decisions we have taken operational.  Every effort, including that of keeping Parliament open and functioning, with all its bodies, must show that we, the institutions, are capable of caring for people, that we want to make our values live in the emergency too, that democracy does not stop.  These are difficult times and much more will have to be done, including a profound reflection on the society in which we will find ourselves after this difficult season. But the European Union is already fully committed to meeting the needs of citizens and Member States, in their interests, in their common interest and during this crisis, and then we will be even more so, because we want to emerge from this crisis stronger, stronger and better able to face tomorrow the challenges that the global world will present to us. The European Union is acting to support health systems, to make medical products and essential medicines available, to support research, to help and preserve jobs, to support families and the poorest, and to provide aid to farmers, fishermen, entrepreneurs and workers. Only together can we achieve results for the good of our citizens, and that is also why it will be of the utmost importance to coordinate the gradual elimination of containment measures and the way out of the crisis.  We take on the appeal of the European Commission – and I thank the President for her presence – for an orderly and coordinated exit from the emergency to avoid return effects that could be devastating. It is particularly important to keep our democracies alive and to listen to our citizens. As their elected representatives, we shall be debating and voting in this session on a resolution which is very the coordinated action of the European Union to combat the pandemic and its consequences, together with other urgent measures.  Our commitment is to give guidance on the best measures to be taken and to indicate the necessary funds to make as many resources available to the Member States as possible. We must be ambitious because our citizens, the citizens of Europe, are waiting for rapid responses to resume their lives. We are the voice of the citizens and we must be proud and proud, at this time, to contribute with discipline to being useful in building a better future for our peoples.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents on Thursday 2 April, I decided, together with the leaders of the political groups, to convene Parliament for the extraordinary part-session today and tomorrow, 16 and 17 April, in order to vote on the Commission's new measures to tackle COVID-19 and to discuss and update the European Parliament's position on how to combat the pandemic and its consequences.

Mr President, Madam President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in a debate which is essential because it brings European democracy to life, even when we are faced with circumstances of unprecedented character and exceptional character.  As you have done, I would also, of course, like to address my first words in support of those who, directly or indirectly, are affected by this crisis, by this virus which is hitting Europe but which is also hitting the world. And, as you have done, also express our thanks, our gratitude for all the citizens, all the citizens, especially at the European level, who are mobilised to accept such exceptional restrictions on freedoms so fundamental and so basic, which directly affect the intimacy of each and every one of us.  You also tell you that, in a moment like this, there can be no doubt, the slightest hesitation: the only possible option is to stick together between citizens, between countries, with all the regions in the world. This is the basis for the determination and action that we, the European institutions, must mobilise with each other. So I would like to share with you some of the information to show how, at the outset of the European Council, with the Member States, we are also trying to take on a number of responsibilities. Three European councils held by videoconference were devoted to this coronavirus crisis and this ambition to try to improve, day after day, the way in which actions are coordinated, the way we cooperate between European countries. You understood that the first ambition, when we measured the scale of this crisis, was to work to reduce the spread of the virus and thus to encourage action, with border restrictions, which have an impact on the functioning of the European Union, especially the internal market, with also the mobilization to try to support our researchers. , to ensure that we can be mobilized on vaccines, on therapies.  It is in this sense that, in the context of the G7 and the G20, in full cooperation with the European Commission, we are trying to mobilise efforts, to encourage - through, for example, a donor conference - a mobilization so that we can, as soon as possible, be able to hold scientific solutions through vaccine and therapies. To be very concrete and very direct, the last European Council gave a dual mandate to the President of the Commission and the President of the European Council: to work on a Road Map that addresses both the formulation of recommendations, principles of good practice, to encourage maximum coordination between European countries when we can gradually enter the exit phase , the strategy of phasing out these restrictive measures which had to be decided by most European countries with varying intensities, but still an approach that is in fact similar. The second part of the mandate is to propose to the Heads of State and Government a common joint strategy in order to be able to gradually, in the short, medium and long term, develop a strategy for economic recovery and, I would also like to say, economic transformation. Because I am convinced, like many, that we will have to learn all the lessons from this crisis and see how we can also ensure that tomorrow there will be more strength, more efficiency, more cooperation, more capacity to work together. I would like to share with you what are, in my opinion, the four chapters for which it is very important to open the debate and try to take some decisions, to take steps together. The first priority, in my opinion, in order to succeed in such a recovery strategy is certainly the single market: how is it possible to repair the single market as soon as possible? But it is not only that: it's also how is it also possible to strengthen, to deepen the single market? Because it's our first strength at the European level and it will be essential to try to consider that the European Green Deal and the digital agenda will be, no doubt - in my opinion - the first priority. It will be a very strong leverage in order to be successful in the next few months, in the next few years. I also think that it will be very essential to build a very strong industrial strategy and also, at the same time, to consider the network of the European SMEs as a very strong pillar. It's important, it's essential to continue to support our SMEs and to give them the possibility to build a strong strategy for the future. I also think that the issue of the circular economy is going to have to be further developed. There are very strong proposals, I know, which have already been debated in the European Parliament, which are announced by the European Commission. Because this strength of the internal market, this ability also to develop the circular economy further, to rely on the digital agenda, on this transformation through climate change also, it must give us the opportunity to have more capacity for strategic independence from the European Union.  It is also for this reason that, in my opinion, the international role of the euro must be taken into account: more strong European assets also contribute to this ability to have this international dimension for the euro. The second important point is, of course, the possibility to develop a very strong strategy in order to invest, to invest massively with the current approach, with a national dimension but also with a European ambition, and it's certain that we will continue all our political efforts in order to reach an agreement on the next European budget. We had the opportunity to discuss a lot in the last two weeks, the last month, about this very difficult topic. But maybe it's a unique opportunity. The next seven years: how is it possible with this European budget, to give some tools, some possibilities in order to develop this strong strategy which we need for our common future? The European Investment Bank is also an instrument that must be used. You know that a few weeks ago, in the proposal for a negobox, before this coronavirus crisis, I had strongly advocated that the European Investment Bank could be increased to increase its leverage and to concentrate on investments. It is certain that, as far as investment is concerned, there is an essential dimension of solidarity, in connection with the internal market, for that matter, because it will be important to guarantee the level playing field and to ensure that all European countries, that all Member States, that all European citizens can be taken with the same ambition to succeed in ensuring that we can meet the challenge we face. The third point I would like to mention, which is also essential to us, is the external action of the European Union. The geopolitical ambition of the European Union is, more than ever, necessary to promote the values to which we deeply believe, to defend the interests that are being tested, as we have seen, particularly in recent weeks.  On this issue of external action, we are very convinced that a very specific focus on the relationship with the African continent is going to be important. I am delighted that we, together with several European leaders, together with several African leaders, have been able to express very, very strong ambitions together.  In the short and medium term, it is a question of further supporting health systems on the African continent, of re-opening this debate on debts that weigh heavily on the capacity of action from the African continent, but also of ensuring that in the medium and long term, one has an ambition of intelligent investment in a partnership of mutual interest with the African continent. , in infrastructure consistent with the digital agenda, in line with the Green Deal, with climate change.  There is, I am totally convinced, a mutual interest, an objective alliance that must be fully mobilised in the coming months and years. Finally, the 4th point I would like to mention is this requirement to ask the question of European governance, to also ask the question of European resilience. How can we, in hindsight, learn from this crisis to be stronger tomorrow, to improve decision-making processes, to improve cooperation processes?  I have the impression that what has been announced - you have discussed it a lot - this conference on the future of Europe will offer, perhaps in the coming weeks in the coming months - when there will be the capacity to really start this ambition - the political space, the democratic space, to enable, not only the European institutions but also the European citizens wherever they come to be involved in this ambition. How do we learn the lessons together?  And finally, it is certain that, within the framework of this ambition to succeed in a transformation strategy, a strategy of recovery, the values that founded this European project, these values of unity, solidarity and freedom must be benchmarks, must be be lighthouses that light the way. Indeed, we must address this crisis, we must address this situation, we have also addressed this ability to raise our heads, to get our heads out of the water, by being fully mobilized on these values that must be highlighted, which must indeed be considered to be central and as driving forces.  So, as you can see, there are many challenges and I think That European history has shown that it is when we are faced with the most difficult, that it is when we think that the obstacle is insurmountable that we often find the resource to stick together, the resource to come together, the resource to be engaged in the field of unity , the resource to be creative.  This is going to be necessary. There is no doubt that there are different sensitivities, opinions and ideas in Europe about what to do in the short and medium and long term. However, I am totally convinced that with optimism, determination and this fierce desire to bring to life this democratic heart of the European Union, to ensure that we can make our institutions work because they guarantee the legitimacy of this European ambition, there will be the capacity to make progress.  In any case, you can count on me, on the European Council, to maintain a close dialogue, Mr President, with your House and with the European Commission. Thank you for this motion for a resolution which, in fact, does define the scope of the work which will have to be implemented in the short, medium and long term. You can count on the European Council, also given the reality of the European Council and the 27 Member States that make up it, to be a stakeholder and to try to move in the right direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "    I now declare the first voting time open.

Nous nous souviendrons de la jeune maman polonaise qui ne verra pas son bébé grandir et du jeune entraîneur de football espagnol qui ne verra pas son rêve se réaliser.  Nous ne les oublierons jamais, les mères, les pères, les sœurs et les frères, les jeunes et les aînés du nord ou du sud, de l’est ou de l’ouest, les amis et les collègues, les voisins d’à côté et les étrangers de plus loin, ceux qui ont des choses à dire et des choses à voir, ceux sur l’épaule de qui on pleure et de l’amour desquels on dépend.

You cannot overcome a pandemic of this speed and this scale without the truth. The truth about everything: the numbers, the science, the outlook – but also about our own actions. Yes, it is true that no one was really ready for this. It is also true that too many were not there on time when Italy a needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes, for that, it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology. But saying sorry only counts for something if it changes behaviour, and the truth is, too, that it did not take long before everyone realised that we must protect each other to protect ourselves. And the truth is that Europe has now become the world’s beating heart of solidarity. The true Europe is standing up: the one that is there for each other when it is needed the most. The one where paramedics from Poland and doctors from Romania save lives in Italy. Where ventilators from Germany provide a lifeline in Spain. Where hospitals in Czechia treat the sick from France. And where patients from Bergamo are flown to clinics in Bonn. We have seen medical supplies go from Lithuania to Spain and respirators go from Denmark to Italy. In fact, we have seen every piece of equipment go in every direction across Europe, from whoever can spare it to whoever needs it. This makes me proud to be European. Of course, there are still some who want to point fingers and deflect blame. And there are others who would rather talk like populists than tell unpopular truths. To this I say: ‘Stop it – stop and have the courage to tell the truth. Have the courage to stand up for Europe’. Because this Union of ours will get us through. But it will only be as strong tomorrow as we make it today. And if you need inspiration, just look at the way the people of Europe are standing together – with empathy, humility and humanity. And I pay tribute to all of them. To the delivery drivers and the food suppliers. The shopkeepers, the factory packers and the balcony clappers. The companies changing their production lines to make the supplies we urgently need. I pay tribute to the Portuguese volunteers sewing masks for their neighbours, or the seven-year-old Greek pianist who composed an ‘isolation waltz’ to keep people going. Above all else I thank and I pay tribute to our heroes: the medics, the nurses, the careworkers. They are the ones with bruises on their faces and tragic images in their minds. The ones holding the hands of the sick as softly and as lovingly as the families that cannot be there. They are the ones saving our lives and saving our honour. The ones we must protect so that they can protect us all. Und genau darauf konzentrieren wir uns. Deswegen legen wir jetzt einen gemeinsamen Vorrat an medizinischer Ausrüstung an. Deswegen investieren wir gemeinsam in Forschung nach Impfstoffen. Deshalb kümmern wir uns zentral um die Beschaffung der am dringendsten benötigten Güter am Weltmarkt. Und deswegen haben wir ein Team der besten Expertinnen und Experten aus ganz Europa zusammengestellt, die regelmäßig ihr Wissen teilen, das Leben retten kann.  Aus diesem Grund verzichten wir auf Zölle und Mehrwertsteuer bei der Einfuhr von medizinischem Gerät aus Drittstaaten. Und das ist auch der Grund, warum wir Anfang dieses Monats ein einfaches, aber großes Versprechen abgegeben haben: Wir werden jeden verfügbaren Euro, den wir haben, auf jede erdenkliche Weise nutzen, um Leben zu retten und die Lebensgrundlagen der Europäerinnen und Europäer zu schützen. Deswegen haben wir vorgeschlagen, sämtliche noch verfügbaren Mittel des aktuellen Haushalts in ein Notprogramm zu lenken. Dadurch können fast 3 Milliarden Euro direkt dorthin fließen, wo sie gebraucht werden: in neue Beatmungsgeräte und Schutzausrüstung, in mehr Tests und mehr medizinische Hilfe für die Schwächsten, einschließlich derer, die in den Flüchtlingslagern warten.  Deswegen schlagen wir vor, jeden verfügbaren Euro aus den europäischen Struktur- und Investitionsfonds zur Bewältigung der Corona—Krise einzusetzen. Das bedeutet, dass wir volle Flexibilität ermöglichen: Die Mittel können in anderen Regionen eingesetzt werden. Sie können überall eingesetzt werden, wo sie am dringendsten gebraucht werden, unabhängig von den sonst üblichen Schranken wie Kofinanzierung, Zweckbindung oder Obergrenzen. Mit diesem Paket, über das dieses Haus heute abstimmen wird, geht Europa an die Grenzen seiner Möglichkeiten. And the same principle applies to protecting people’s livelihoods. Europe has had economic crises before. But we have never had an economic shutdown like this. Nobody is to blame and everybody will need support. We need unprecedented measures to do this and to make sure our economy is ready to bounce forward as soon as possible. And here again, the truth matters. Europe has done more in the last four weeks than it did in the first four years of the last crisis. We have made our state aid rules more flexible than ever. In the last few days alone, we have approved schemes that will provide EUR 1 billion to Croatian businesses, EUR 1.2 billion for Greek SMEs or EUR 20 million to Portuguese fishermen. There are many more examples I could pick, from Latvia and Estonia to Belgium or Sweden. For the first time in our history, we triggered the full flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact. Along with bold measures taken by the European Central Bank, this provides unprecedented fiscal and financial power. And last week’s decision by EU finance means a further EUR 500 billion will be available to all of those who need it. As part of this, I urge all Member States to make the most of SURE – the new scheme proposed by the Commission to protect Europeans against the risk of unemployment. It will provide EUR 100 billion to help governments make up the difference if your employer has reduced your hours or if you are self-employed and need support. The beauty of SURE is two-fold. First, it will help those in need to pay their rents, bills or food, and keep other businesses alive in the process. And second, it is the definition of European solidarity. The Member States that can, will put up guarantees so others can support the hardest hit in their countries. As a result of all of this action, Europe’s collective response is well above EUR 3 trillion. This is the most impressive response anywhere in the world. But we know we will need more. A lot more. Because this will be a long haul, and the world of tomorrow will look very different from that of yesterday. I am convinced that Europe can shape this new world if it works together and rediscovers its pioneering spirit. And for this, I want to cite a sentence from the Ventotene Manifesto, written by two of Italy and Europe’s greatest visionaries: Ernesto Rossi and Altiero Spinelli, one of our founding fathers.  Writing from their prison on a remote island, at the height of the war, when all hope of a united Europe seemed lost, they gave us these words of confidence: ‘the moment has arrived in which we must know how to discard old burdens, how to be ready for the new world that is coming, that will be so different from what we have imagined’. Dear friends, this moment has arrived once again. The moment to put behind us the old divisions, disputes and recriminations. To come out of our entrenched positions. The moment to be ready for that new world. To use all the power of our common spirit and the strength of our shared purposes. The starting point for this must be making our economies, societies and way of life more sustainable and resilient. Finding the answers in this new world will require courage, trust and solidarity. And it will need massive investment to jump-start our economies. We need a Marshall Plan for Europe’s recovery, and it needs to be put in place immediately. There’s only one instrument we have that is trusted by all Member States, which is already in place and can deliver quickly. It is transparent and it is time-tested as an instrument for cohesion, convergence and investment. And that is the European budget. The European budget will be the mothership of our recovery. And for that reason, the next seven-year budget must be different to what we have imagined, just as Spinelli said. We will use the power of the whole European budget to leverage the huge amount of investment we need to rebuild the Single Market after corona. We will frontload it so we can power that investment in those crucial first years of recovery. Because this crisis is different from any other one we have known. It is severely hitting completely healthy companies because public life has shutdown. And this is why we will need innovative solutions and more headroom in the MFF so it can unlock massive public and private investment. This will kick-start our economies and drive our recovery towards a more resilient, green and digital Europe. By that, we not only support but reshape our industries and services towards a new reality. It will mean investing in our digital technologies, infrastructure and in innovation, such as 3D printing, to help us to be more independent and make the most of new opportunities. And it also means doubling down on our growth strategy by investing in the European Green Deal. As the global recovery picks up, global warming will not slow down. First-mover advantage will count double and finding the right projects to invest in will be key. A more modern and circular economy will make us less dependent and boost our resilience. And this is the lesson we need to learn from this crisis. Investing in large-scale renovation, renewables, clean transport, sustainable food and nature restoration will be even more important than before. This is not only good for our economies, it is not only good for our environment, but it will reduce dependencies by shortening and diversifying supply chains. And we also need to keep another reality in mind. While the crisis is symmetric, recovery is not. Because not only the virus hits but also the economic shock. Some regions will bounce back and others will have a harder time. And therefore, cohesion and convergence will be more important than ever before. The single market and cohesion policy are the two sides of the same coin. You need both to ensure prosperity across the whole European Union. This is the Europe that I believe can emerge from this crisis. One that does everything it can to protect lives and livelihoods. One that is open to the world but can take care of itself. One that is more resilient, green and digital and that invests in its future together. This is the path to recovery. It will be a long road and the whole world will be trying to find its way. This crisis will likely redefine our politics, our geopolitics and possibly globalisation itself. And in this new world, Europe will need to stick together through thick and thin. And as I look around in our Union and I see all that humanity and that ingenuity, I know that we can and we will do just that. They say a strong soul shines bright after every storm. If we all stand up for Europe today – with courage, trust and solidarity – I know that tomorrow Europe’s soul will shine brighter than ever before. Long live Europe. Vive l’Europe.

For the duration of the plague, Parliament cannot close and cannot become a remote institution. Like supermarkets or firefighters, Parliament is an essential service during the pandemic. In times of extraordinary powers for governments, Parliament is the hospital of democracy.  We're here today, but millions of citizens are wondering where we were when all this started. Following Ursula's example, I tell him: we could have acted earlier, we could have acted faster, we could even have acted together. That's why you have to apologize.  European governments and European institutions are not to blame for the plague, but they should have expected it and must have reacted quickly. We didn't do one or the other. So it would be nice if, from here, we apologized and stopped treating the dead elders like war heroes: they are victims.  We were wrong not to give importance to a virus because it came from China and we can make a mistake again if we settle in the certainty that this nightmare will end when summer comes.  In Spain, we learned yesterday that at least 5,000 dead have not been counted — almost all elderly people who died in homes or residences – and that, as more tests are done, more contagious will appear.  We are always wrong when we believe that this virus will go for the best hypothesis; this virus always bets on the worst hypothesis. Now we're making plans as if the virus wasn't coming back in the fall, but what if it comes back? We're assuming that if he comes back he'll weaken it or we'll have a vaccine, but what if we don't have it? The second wave of the 1918 flu was the worst. We assume that Europe has already paid the tribute, but what if it explodes in Africa or explodes in the Middle East? I'm not saying we get to the worst; I ask that, as policy makers, we never rule out the worst.  In China, where it all began, there were 3,300 dead. Spain, with less than 4% of China's population, has already had 18,000 – and we are not counting them all – and Italy, 21,000. If we take into account that Italy and Spain have two of the best health systems in the world, it is pertinent to ask: has China told us the whole truth? What game are we playing?  The four riders of today's Apocalypse are: coronavirus, unemployment, nationalpopulism, and lying—lies kill as much as the virus.  In Europe, plague is killing our parents' generation and we all have a feeling that the Council is treating the issue as usual business as usual. Indeed, Mr President, is the single market the Council's first priority, precisely at this very moment? It seems that some governments come to Brussels just to see how much money they can take, and that others come to Brussels to make sure that others don't take that much money, but that no one comes to worry about all Europeans. Coming to Brussels to defend only national interests is also nationalism, even if our prime ministers do not know. If the fear of death affects us all, if death affects us all, if the virus does not distinguish countries, what is the point of national governments being distinguished affected or killed by their nationalities? Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, we are no longer at the time of Draghi's 'what is needed', but at the time of now or never.  China built a hospital in less time than the Council needs to convene —not to meet, to convene. Does that mean that the Chinese dictatorship is more effective than our democracy? No, it means we're not effective, that's all.  This is the time to show that Europeanism can also be effective, that Europeanism can also be epic, that Europeanism can also be patriotic, that Europeanism can also be human. It's time to prove that borders will never be the solution. If the European Union does not serve to deal with a pandemic affecting the whole continent, what is the European Union for?  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is time for now or never. Within the EPP, and among the groups that have signed the Resolution, we have made a great deal of consensus effort. I hope it will set an example for the Council. The European Union represents the great hope with millions of Spaniards affected or killed or sick with the virus, millions of Europeans affected, killed or sick from the virus.  Let's not give the populists the reason. Let's not give the nationalists the reason. Let's not give the reason to liars: Spanish flu killed more by hunger than by fever. Let's not give the virus the reason.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr. President, President von der Leyen, President Michel, let me have the first words of this House for the victims who have died from COVID-19 and also for all those who are now in hospitals, at home, trying to overcome the disease. And a thank you also to so many professionals who these days are risking their lives for others, starting with health workers, but also for state security forces, cleaners, supermarket and pharmacy workers, carriers, farmers, nursing home caregivers... To all of us—because let's not forget that most of them are women—thousands of graces.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a pivotal moment in our history. This coronavirus pandemic has hit us in a way we couldn't have imagined: our safety, our freedom of movement, our daily lives, we still don't know how they will change. Some things are out of control, it's true, but others depend on us. Let us be clear: it is up to the decisions we make now that Europe will be strengthened or that citizens lose confidence in this project.  While at the beginning of this crisis we saw selfish attitudes and nationalist reactions spontaneously emerge, we have gradually managed to get the European Union to react and implement solidarity measures, because that is why the European Union exists. It was created after World War II, in a time of devastation, to avoid competition between States and ensure that reconstruction gave prosperity to all. We are now living in a time of crisis only comparable to the Great Depression and we need another reconstruction plan comparable to the Marshall plan. An increase in the budget is not enough; it must be a real investment strategy and strengthening strategic sectors to ensure Europe's future. That is why this is the moment when we can and must be ambitious and rebuild Europe on a new basis.  This crisis is highlighting great social inequalities, as well as inequalities between territories. We cannot allow this crisis to open an even greater gap. On the contrary, public policies are needed to ensure that we are all equally protected to succeed.  It's time to strengthen public policy, starting with health. It's time to protect the millions of Europeans who are losing their jobs and who don't know how to make the end of the month or how they're going to be able to pay their rents. It is time for a strong and supportive European economy, and finally to provide the eurozone with all the mechanisms it needs to deal with international financial onslating. This includes, of course, mutualizing a portion of our countries' debt, as we propose with the issuance of reconstruction bonds. It is time to renew our economy to be more environmentally friendly and natural resources, and also to digitize it. This crisis has shown us that technology needs to be democratized so that all citizens and businesses, wherever they are, can benefit from it for work, for study, for research, for relationships between people. We are seeing these days how there are many children who, for lack of resources, cannot access the follow-up of online classes, and we must understand that action is needed in this regard.  All these ideas are not new, they have been on the table for some time, such as the European Green Pact or the Eurobonds, which we were already talking about during the 2008 crisis. But now it becomes more urgent than ever; it's time for truth and we can't fail history.  We know what needs to be done, we have put it black on white in the joint resolution which we have been able to negotiate between the four major groups in this Parliament. I would have liked, of course, to join more groups and I hope, in any case, that Members and other members and other groups will join this strong call from the European Parliament for the European Commission and the Council to act.  We know what to do; there is only a lack of political courage to do so and, in this Parliament, we are demonstrating that today we are aware of our historical responsibilities, that we are able to overcome our ideological and national lines to think about the common interest of all Europeans and all Europeans.  In this Resolution we propose urgent and other measures in the medium and long term. All are necessary: the urgent ones to save lives, first of all, but also to create an emergency network that so many people need to survive. The more determined our action is now, the less impact the economic and social crisis will have, the sooner we will go out, and we will all regain normalcy and economic activity sooner.  Indeed, at this time of unity and cooperation of the international community to combat the pandemic, it is regrettable to see how Trump, for example, proposes to stop funding to the World Health Organization, and I believe that in Europe too we must raise this issue and vindicate it.  This is a crisis affecting all the countries of the European Union and we must get all countries out of it with equal strength and determination. It would be unacceptable for COVID-19 to create new inequalities between Member States, thus delaying European convergence.  There are many citizens who are unenchanted with the European Union, but that means they believe in us: they are disappointed because they expect more from us. This is the opportunity we have to show you that it is worth believing in the European Union that the principles of solidarity and justice that we set out are true, and that it is now time to prove it.  If the Commission and the Council did not live up to this crisis, Parliament will now require them to take responsibility. It's not too late, because we have a long way to go. I say to the heads of government in the Council: we are on time, but we do not have a minute to lose.

Dear President David Sassoli, dear Charles, dear Ursula and dear colleagues, first of all I want to pay tribute to our health professionals, tired from weeks of fighting COVID-19. The whole of Europe thanks you and, I know, the battle is far from over. Tribute also to all those who demonstrate the strength of our democracy and its ability to face difficult decisions that change the lives of millions of citizens.  The Europe we need is one of solidarity movements, collective creativity and generosity on a daily basis. We are living through difficult times, a test for all of us, but this ordeal, as well as the choices we make, will determine our way of life in a sustainable way. We will build the world from the lessons we learn from this crisis. First, we have a responsibility to learn all the lessons from this health crisis. We are not going to face things better if we do not recognise that at the beginning of this crisis, the withdrawal of the choice of certain Member States and the initial impotence of the Commission left a bitter taste for the citizens of Europe. This is the starting point, if we want to heal ourselves not only from the virus but also from our selfishness that makes us powerless.  If we have to put on masks to protect ourselves from the virus, we must drop the masks that prevent us from acknowledging our mistakes. We have seen the fragility of our health systems and the need to build more resilient systems. The Europe we want is not that of unnecessary walls but that of the trains and helicopters that we see crossing borders, taking patients to places where beds are still free. The Europe we want is the one that will find the cure for the disease and is ready to share it.  The momentum of solidarity and spontaneous cooperation must be structured into a European health mechanism that makes Europe better prepared and more sovereign for the next time. In the face of tomorrow's crises, Europe must be ready to face the next crisis in full independence. For this, we need to think now about this European health mechanism that must be in place. Second, the economy. We all used the same phrase: Whatever it takes. Now let's take action. Not a single one of our Member States is able to emerge strengthened from this crisis on its own, regardless of its power and membership or not in the Eurozone. We must not be lonely but in solidarity this time.  As I have said to the Member States and to the Commission, this is not the time to play with little arms. Let's hit hard with a massive stimulus package, as Ursula von der Leyen said, with a new Marshall Plan, with the prospect of digital and green deal. We have the strategy, we now need the ambition to put this strategy in place. It is for investment, it is for jobs, it is for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the industries of tomorrow. This crisis is putting a strain on the internal market, which must be respected and strengthened. Thirdly: no, authoritarian regimes are no better equipped than our open, democratic societies, based on freedom and respect by each of the collective rules. Fear, concealment and withdrawal are not antidotes but poisons. Under no circumstances should democratic values or our individual freedoms be called into question. And that,'s what everyone needs to hear, including Viktor Orban. We must do whatever it takes also to heal our democracy and restore the rule of law by all possible means. On all these subjects there is a question: what will Europe be after this crisis? A mammoth with feet of clay or on the contrary an agile and robust shuttle that is always where it is needed? Let us not wait for the next crisis to understand that our future as Romanians, Italians, Poles or Swedes will not be directly proportional to our individualism but it will be directly proportional to our ability to work together. This crisis demonstrates the urgency of tackling the conference project on the future of Europe, which is more relevant than ever. Let us therefore seize this opportunity to put the European house in order with courage, to build a safer, more community and more democratic world. This crisis should not be the occasion for yet another war. Let us make it an opportunity to fight against our self-sufficiency, our hypocrisies, our prejudices and renew the world in which we live from what we have learned from this crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Marco CAMPOMENOSI", "mepid": "35016", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von der Leyen, Mr Michel, thank you for being here. I hope that this will be the last meeting at which our colleagues cannot reach Brussels, because it is important, just as we are calling for the national and regional parliaments to work, for full activity to be carried out in Brussels too, because that is what our citizens are asking for. I come from Liguria, from the North-West of Italy. Lombardy is a region close to my city, everyone in my region is aware of friends, relatives, who are either in a situation of serious suffering or have disappeared.  What perhaps some people do not know and have not understood is what is the frustration of those who are facing this emergency alone, or because they are alone in living the quarantine situation, or because alone, without the comfort of their loved ones, they have found themselves facing hospitalization, loved ones and relatives who may not even be able to celebrate the funeral.  Of course, the tragedy is not just the health tragedy, it is an economic tragedy, it is a tragedy for companies, the self-employed and workers who want to go back to producing, and that is why it will be necessary to establish standard and uniform procedures, so that the production system can return safely, and above all in the safety of workers, it can soon return to being fully operational. The problem is that, if we get out of this situation quickly in part, it will be thanks to a system of rules that existed at European level and to which we must necessarily derogate, and it is very important that we understand and examine our consciences that this system of rules is what has meant that Europe in recent years has been the continent where there was the least growth in the whole world.  It was obvious that at the first exogenous cause, such as the one we are experiencing – but it could have been a war, a strong trade crisis, a speculative bubble, like the one a few years ago – it was obvious that the system would have extreme difficulties. So one mistake that you don't have to make is, after the health emergency, to restore that system of rules that failed as if nothing had happened.  Because then we are talking about a European Union that until the other day favoured relocation through trade agreements that today make us understand that we are not, we were no longer able to produce certain things. I see some presidents, even the French saying: no, we need to return to productive autonomy, not just in the health sector, we think of the agricultural sector and many others.  Research: a few days ago, the President of the European Research Council resigned, denouncing the impossibility of working in this area at European level. So much use is made of the word truth, an attempt is made to give a European perspective, analysing a point of view which, in my opinion, is almost always and only that of a communication defending the European Commission itself, because this European Commission is a victim of itself, of the communication it has given in recent years, selling itself to the citizens as a system with a budget that Of course, it may be useful, we will work on it, but it will be able to shift very few resources.  What is needed first and foremost is for states to be free to make their own policies. We have an ECB that has a system of rules that does not work, that is not that of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, and we will certainly pay the price for that.  Not to mention the fact that there will shortly be a very important European Council, in which the Italian President-in-Office of the Council will go without a mandate from the Italian Parliament, which is also the victim of a division and debate, that on the ESF, on the stability mechanism, which has reached a very serious level.  I'm sure Italy will make it. I am not sure that the European Union will be able to overcome this crisis. Europe and the Member States and Italy will succeed. But I don't think the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, my fellow citizens, my fellow citizens, I am speaking to you from the Brussels Chamber of the European Parliament, where, in normal times, the heart of European democracy beats, a heart that is now beating in slow motion, a sign that we are all affected by the pandemic. The days we live are fraught with gravity. Our thoughts naturally go first to the tens of thousands of victims of the virus and their loved ones, faced with unexpected death and mourning made more difficult by the very circumstances of confinement. We also want to express our deep gratitude to all those around them, day after day and at the risk of their own health, the sick and the victims. We also take to heart all those who, in the midst of the pandemic, are on the job to ensure that our societies can simply continue to live. Europe is facing the worst crisis since 1945. The shock of coronavirus reveals the flaws of our societies, bringing to light what too many policy makers, until now, did not want to see or hear. Today, some are pretending to discover that austerity is killing, while years of underfunding of our health care and elderly services are sending thousands of people to their deaths.  They seem to discover how profit-driven globalization has made our societies vulnerable. They are aware of the devastation wrought by social inequalities: millions of Europeans have turned into poverty and forced unemployment in less than a month. Many of them can no longer afford to eat enough, while food banks are seeing their demands explode or worse, have to close because of a lack of help from our governments.  With the crisis, they realize that those who, until yesterday, were considered by the statistics \"at risk of poverty\" have now fallen there. Whether it is educational inequalities, the digital divide, access to decent housing, quality employment or adequate social protection, the situation reveals and further accentuates all dimensions of the precariousness experienced here in Europe. Today, the invisible cannot be forgotten. That is why, beyond the immediate impact of the pandemic, I am deeply concerned about the consequences it may have in our societies. The first risk is that, once again, it is the most fragile who are paying for a crisis in which they have no responsibility. I am thinking of those who are confined to housing that is too cramped or left to their own devices without a fixed home; those whose jobs are hanging by a thread; these asylum seekers trapped in totally inhumane conditions at the EU's borders; to the people of the South, already weakened by war, dictatorship, conflict, resource depletion and climate change, who will take the pandemic head-on.  If our collective response to the pandemic mirrors what we did after the financial crisis ten years ago, inequality within and between our societies will explode, endangering their existence. Secondly, in the name of the health emergency, our democracies will find themselves permanently weakened, abused as in Poland, or even suspended sine die as in Hungary. That powers be taken over by governments at the expense of parliaments, the judiciary and the independent press. And that we see our societies moving inexorably, in the name of their security, towards a state of permanent and widespread surveillance. Third risk is that the pandemic will provide the ideal alibi for all those who have built their fortunes on the limitless exploitation of our planet to put an end to even late, even insufficiently ambitious attempts to bring our societies back into harmony with the nature of which we are a part and on which we depend. Climate change, biodiversity collapse, resource depletion are not stopped by coronavirus. Relaunching the global economic machine indiscriminately could give a fatal boost to these dynamics even more lethal for our societies than the pandemic. The fourth risk is that this crisis will deal a fatal blow to the idea of transnational democracy that is the European project. When the pandemic hit our shores, the restrictions placed by several Member States on the export of health and medical equipment to the most affected countries sent a deadly signal: that of everyone for themselves. And today, some persist in their refusal to adopt and jointly lead a collective strategy that is not not only to respond to the pandemic but above all to rebuild and then redeploy our economies.  In this regard, we are convinced that the European Union has the means, collectively, to rebuild its economy, provided, of course, that we mobilise them collectively. And if we have to go into debt, we have to borrow together to pay back together. To leave each Member State alone in the face of this challenge is to condemn the monetary union and, ultimately, the European Union.  In this regard, I want to speak directly to Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch Minister of Finance, and his boss, Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and to all those behind them. I would first like to tell them that their country, like Germany, like Finland, like Austria and all these 'sober' states, were the first and main economic beneficiaries of European integration.  I say to them loud and clear: economic solidarity is the price to be paid for this single market and the single currency to which they are so dear. And it is truly scandalous to hear lessons from Dutch politicians in budgetary discipline, at a time when their country has been working for decades to deprive other Member States of tax revenues that are their rightful share. My fellow citizens, my fellow citizens, at this stage, the picture I have painted for you may seem rather bleak. But you know me, you know the Greens, the European regionalists, the Pirates, we are not the ones who give up when the storm rages. The worst is never sure if you solve it. For this crisis that we did not want could also open new horizons for our societies, making victims as unexpected as they are timely. The first could be this hierarchy of trades, based on their income, which places the bosses of multinationals, traders - these professional speculators - and renters, so few of whom deserve the names of investors - or football stars at the pinnacle of our companies. Today we rediscover how essential the work of those who care for us, who cultivate the land and produce our food, who allow us to move or who collect our waste, who, yesterday and tomorrow, will allow us to learn or who, through their art, make us think, vibrate, and broaden our horizons. A second victim of the pandemic is the idea that the market is the best guarantor of general well-being. The global financial crisis ten years ago had already denied this ideological assumption, but for some it has a hard life. The reality is that the defence of the public interest, starting with that of life, is, first and foremost, the responsibility of democratic institutions and the public services they organise for the benefit of all. More fundamentally, coronaviruses could deal a fatal blow to the myth that makes human beings the undisputed master of nature. It reminds us that this nature, we are part of it and we depend on it for our lives. To be savvy gardeners, we need to know the rules and follow them. Another victim of the virus could be this obsession with the \"always faster, ever faster, ever greater, ever further\" which leads us to press without limits the lemon of the planet and the living in all its forms, including us. Because we discover that the global scale is not always the most appropriate and above all that the excessive maximization of efficiency - measured solely on profit - is always at the expense of our resilience, i.e. our ability to suffer shocks and respond to them. In the process, could finally succumb to homo economicus, this dehumanizing perversion that reduces the human being to an ego mobilized by the mere maximization of his material interest in the short term. For we rediscover that life requires, of course, a degree of material comfort but also of time, of space, of ideas that allow us to be in relation to others and to the world.  My fellow citizens, my fellow citizens, the pandemic marks a sudden and global pause for humanity. It is up to us to seize it and choose, together, the path that our societies must take. For us, it is unthinkable and totally irresponsible to simply want to \"relaunch the machine\" on the course that was his before the coronavirus. However, let us not embrace simplistic solutions. For example, while the pandemic has exposed the extreme vulnerability of our societies as a result of the international division of labour produced by neoliberal globalization, self-sufficiency and withdrawal do not provide better signs of resilience. Between local and global, between efficiency and resilience, we will have to create new balances by building on the diverse wealth of our territories.  What we are called to do is to rethink the way our societies function, taking as a compass life, a dignified life for all, rather than profit. This requires collective intelligence and creativity. Beyond the immediate fight against the pandemic, it is up to us to prepare this mobilization, together with all those who, even today, are inviting new ways of living, producing, moving, exchanging, being in contact. We're ready for it. In conclusion, I want to make this clear, at the heart of the European institutions and in particular by addressing the Heads of State and Government represented here by the President of the Council, who will meet again next week: in the face of the pandemic and its consequences, it is the very raison d'être of the European Union that is at stake. If we are not able to act in a totally united way in the face of a challenge of this magnitude, which strikes us all, what is the meaning of the European Union? For us, it is clear that national selfishness will lead us to shipwreck; it is only together that we will find the way to our future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 9, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Raffaele FITTO", "mepid": "4465", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i too would like to thank you for this opportunity, and I too hope that we will be able to return quickly to work in the parliamentary chamber of the relevant bodies. I too would like to begin with an Italian thought, in this context, to the very many tens of thousands of victims who are unfortunately, every day, coming more and more to our attention and to the situation, so dramatic, what we are experiencing, and I too would like to emphasize the excellent and commendable work of health workers, doctors, all those who, from volunteering to law enforcement, , are enabling us to tackle this dramatic pandemic. But I think it is essential, at the moment, not only to represent what we hope will happen, but also to make some reflections of clarity on what has happened, and we must say, very clearly, that Europe has arrived in an absolutely unprepared way. It has come unpreparedly about its coordinating role that it should have played, but what is more serious is that some States have shown and manifested a very serious selfish attitude, at a time when the word solidarity, which I have often heard again this morning, should have taken over and represented concrete attention to those countries that were imagined to be the only or only victims of this pandemic.  But I think that this is an issue on which we will have to think calmly, not least because of what will happen in the next few days and months, and I want to do so, because after the health tragedy, I think it is essential to make strong and, above all, rapid reflections on what Europe will have to put in place from an economic point of view in order to prevent this tragedy from also becoming an economic tragedy and which, in a devastating way, will lead to an irreversible crisis in Europe and the Member States. Member States.  In this respect, however, I have a duty, here too, to make some essential preconditions. The first is that of a bad feeling, that we continue to think as we thought a few months ago, before this pandemic, both because of the times that are characterizing the discussions, the negotiations and the postponements, but also and above all because of certain attitudes that even in the resolution we are voting on today emerge and which our group strongly denounces. Finding time and space for political exploitation and to call for the triggering of Article 7 as a procedure against the Polish and Hungarian Governments seems to us to be out of place in relation to the situation we are experiencing and the dramatic emergencies we are facing.  In this context, However, I think it is very important that we also concentrate our efforts on economic solutions. Economic solutions will have to emerge very clearly from the point of view of concreteness and effectiveness in order to provide answers to citizens, workers and our businesses, to respond to the sectors most affected, I am thinking of tourism, I am thinking of transport, I am thinking of agriculture, manufacturing, all sectors that are in a dramatic situation and that need clear measures , which have certainly seen in the European responses – I am thinking of the activation of the instruments with the EIB, I am thinking of the SURE programme – the first important initiatives, which, however, need to overcome many red tape and which certainly need to be included in a broader reflection that is that of the European budget.  I have listened to the still clear defence of some of the sticking points of the discussions of recent months. If the budget is not radically changed, it is unimaginable to think that we can still discuss what were the programmes that have been indicated in the past. The Green deal in this context should, I think, be an opportunity to review the choices that will have to be made in this direction.  At the same time, I believe that we must try to provide clear and effective answers with innovative instruments that can express a Truly United Europe. I believe that this is what the citizens of Europe really expect, and this will be the clear contribution that the Conservative Group will make to this debate and this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 16, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Manon AUBRY", "mepid": "197533", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Unitarian Left, how, of course, cannot we share, first, the thoughts of the victims, the tribute to the carers and all those on the front line, and the call for solidarity of our Parliament in the face of the economic, health and social crisis that is hitting the peoples of Europe hard?  In the face of the storm, European states owe themselves collective and selfless assistance. As we know, joint health planning is essential to protect us all. But let us say it now, any incantation will restore wishful thinking as long as this House merely contemplates, almost tetanus, the debacle of the coordination of European governments. Our role today must go beyond that, we must first be clear about the causes of the disaster. How can we explain that, in the joint resolution before us today, there is not a single word, a single mention of the responsibility for budget cuts in our public health systems? How can we debate the health crisis without clearly acting on the grim record of austerity? 100,000 beds closed in 20 years in France, 14% of resuscitation beds disappeared in Europe in the space of 10 years. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, austerity is killing! And we here in the European Parliament should turn a blind eye? The submersion of our care services does not come out of nowhere. By 63 times between 2011 and 2018, the European Commission recommended that Member States reduce their health spending. Liberal governments did not ask for a better excuse, moreover, to justify the breakdown of our hospitals. This evidence should have been recognized in order to learn political lessons.  Today, it was our duty, therefore, to firmly mark our rejection of all the austere conditions to benefit from European funds such as the European Stability Mechanism. The result, it's terrible. As its people die, Italy does not know whether to accept this poisonous gift from the Union and I am ashamed of the embarrassed silence of this House in the face of the impossible dilemma imposed on the Italians: to sink or to give in. This taboo hides another, just as absent from our debates, that of public debts, used by liberals as a sword of Damocles that weighs on the peoples of Europe. I can't believe you haven't seen this little music, which is echoed by the employers' unions and the governments that serve them: the crisis is expensive, we will have to make efforts, we will have to work harder. Honestly, no need to listen to the song to the chorus because we already know it very well: the people will have to pay for the crisis, and especially the poorest who are already suffering it head-on.  Your tributes to all the professions on the front line will then ring false at a time when you will ask them for sacrifices. As if the decline of social rights and austerity were the only possible way, as if this debt were inexorable, insurmountable, condemning us to tighten our belts for decades to come. Rather than remain prisoners of this logic, we should remember the words of Albert Camus's illustrious prisoner: \"What interests me at the moment is to escape the mechanics, to know if the inevitable can have an outcome\". And we know this issue. By affirming first that the cost of the crisis must be precisely distributed, by involving large fortunes, multinationals, tax evaders, and then claiming the need to use monetary policy to avoid the use of austerity.  Why should we rule out any real debt pooling? Why prevent the European Central Bank from directly financing the states, as the Bank of England has just announced? Why refuse to mention the question of the gradual erasure of the debts of the crisis, as has already been done in the history of our continent? It is time, ladies and gentlemen, to break all these taboos. This is the only way to loosen the noose in the face of the epidemic today and facing the climate challenge tomorrow. But all these issues, and I regret it, you prefer to ignore them. This is what a strong Parliament should have defended in order to weigh in on the current debates, which it unfortunately dismisses all too often.

It is in times of crises that we are realising how limited and narrow the scope of our institutions actually is. Both of you have addressed the issue of the future of the European Union and the future depends on how we manage this crisis. Unfortunately, the EU does not have a great track record in crisis management. Unfortunately, the 2008 financial crisis continues to have long-lasting effects and the EU has made a mess of that. The repercussions are unbelievable and devastating, especially in the periphery of the eurozone.  The migration issue was also mismanaged. Crisis management at the time of migration was a disaster, with lasting effects even today. We can only hope that the management of the coronavirus will be different.  Mr Michel, you referred to pressure from the citizens to reform our institutions, and you are quite right. In the wake of the crisis, reform of the institutions is necessary, because if no reforms are going to be made, European citizens will write the European Union off and they will turn to solutions that appear simpler, clearer and more efficient. So, if the EU can’t learn to adapt, its adversaries will be very quick to point out the problems and to capitalise on them. The post-COVID era must be built on cooperation, on the principle of solidarity – as we have heard so many times today – but also on subsidiarity, which entails dealing with issues at local level as much as possible. Certainly there are issues where the nation states are better positioned to act efficiently and effectively, but more and more of our challenges require broader cooperation, which require action at regional, continental and global level.  Full institutional reform is inevitable, and whatever we do now, it has to prepare us for the future.

With all due respect to the Council – who has actually left this debate now – what she needs now is no theoretical, bureaucratic debate about the Single Market.

International Monetary Fund estimates that the eurozone's GDP will plummet by seven and a half points. Measures such as the European Investment Bank's extraordinary plan or the Sure Fund's European integration fund to support income and protect work are therefore very important.

A debate has opened on the use of 410 billion ESA capital, following the proposal to create a new line of credit within it, without cross compliance. Each country will consider whether to use it, but in any case we are convinced that it is absolutely not enough. That is why I am proud that today Parliament is tabing a resolution putting recovery bonds on the table as a means of financing reconstruction through the issue of common bonds at Community level.

It is not a question of general solidarity with certain countries, but of preserving for future generations the entire political and social model of the entire European Union.  We don't waste time, we don't have any more. President von der Leyen mentioned Altiero Spinelli and Ventotene today, but we must live up to that story, not just mention it, and I say this not only to President von der Leyen, but also to all the leaders of our Union.

This text is neither Nordic, nor Latin, nor of the East, nor of the West. It is not owned by any of our political families. It is only for carers in Bergamo, Madrid and Mulhouse that we have demanded a European health strategy. It is for cashiers, bus drivers, families that we want a sovereign Europe to produce its masks and protection tools. It is for our jobs, our SMEs, our very small businesses that we are asking the European Investment Bank for more money. It is for the democrats of this continent that we defend the rule of law in Hungary. Finally, it is for our French, Italian, Slovak and Dutch children, those who will enter the labour market in three or five years, in particular, that we protect and want to invest together. Invest together by raising debt together without pooling past debts. This is also what our people tell us. Mr President, this empty room is a bit misleading because this institution is always full of the aspirations of the European peoples. Here we represent a hundred political parties all over Europe, we are the European people, elected by the Europeans and we have an agreement.

The European Council is at odds with a European public opinion which agrees with the main principles of this resolution which we are going to vote on. So I have only one message, Mr President, and it is more for the members of the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, heads of state and government, you were looking for an agreement, we must not look any further, it is there and it brings together all the ambitions. It is the expression of the European people, efficiency, democracy, our values. So listen to Parliament, listen to these citizens, listen to MEPs.

And when it comes to denouncing nationalism and populism, the European Union has shown, at the beginning of this crisis, unpreparedness and indecision. Washing our hands is not enough while our health systems are crucified and our economies on land. When societies are faced with crises of the magnitude of coronavirus, they actually have an alternative: myth or fantasy. The myth plunges into a collective imagination and shared principles. Fantasy, on the other hand, diverts people's attention to dreams whose European history is full of brutal awakenings. First of all, I want to have a thought for the ravages of the doctrines of the European Union and its zealous servants. In France, it is this government that presents social security budgets that are constantly declining and which, in 2020, will still require a saving of 4.2 billion euros, of which almost one billion on hospital spending. The EUR 3 billion that the European Union is proposing to the Member States will not compensate for the damage of the budgetary savings of recent years. So Austria and Denmark propose their own deconfinous strategy. Well, immediately, the Commission wants to present a unified plan, not to fight the coronavirus but to gain credibility at the expense of nations. Germany decides to close its borders at the outbreak of the crisis, so the European Commission protests to defend the free movement of Schengen rather than human lives. At a time when the recession and the financial and economic crisis are shaping up to be a major one for the labour market, the Commission is obliged to suspend all regulations as they would worsen the recession. So what is a financial architecture really worth that needs to be cut down and removed with every crisis? The European Commission takes advantage of the disarray of the peoples to continue its ideological agenda: Albania and Macedonia's accession to the European Union, the continuation of the enlargement of the Union, the pressure to increase the contribution to the European budget. Peoples will look at those who have cradled them with fantasies and draw conclusions from them. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a localised scope will remember that they cannot benefit from privileged access to the markets in their region because of European rules. Large companies unable to adjust the workforce without social devastation will remember that the Union is the economic entity that protects and least supports our national champions. Our farmers without fixed prices and quotas curse an unbridled free trade that was sold to them as profitable. The countries that could benefit from the European Solidarity Mechanism cannot do so because they know that it is not the people who will judge its effectiveness but a Brussels administration. National diplomacy must now prevent the migratory flows that are sure to happen as a consequence of the crisis. Meanwhile, the External Action Service is proving ineffective on Libyan and Turkish soils, from where future coronavirus immigrants will come tomorrow. It is the myth of Antigone, European if any, that should guide our action. Antigone, as you know, agreed to be sentenced to death rather than obeying unconserent laws. Sophocles placed these words in his mouth: \"For me, I do not recognize for a friend the one who loves only in words.\" Our European Commission would do well to question what happened next to Creon and its city.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ID", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "   – Dear Mr President, Honourable Commissioner, honourable Members, first of all, I have not heard anyone in this chamber rebuke Communist China.

As usual, we hear that the solution is more market. Yet today we are facing a colossal market failure. And I'm not just talking about shortages, the shortage of masks or respirators. I am also talking about vaccines and medicines. Velen van de 130,000 slachtoffers hadden waarschijnlijk kunnen vermeden worden, want dit is niet de eerste dodelijke corona-epidemie. We hebben SARS-1 gehad, we hebben MERS gehad. Wetenschappers stonden toen heel dicht bij de ontwikkeling van een medicijn, van een behandeling. Maar wat gebeurde er? Het geld droogde op. Het geld droogde op, in waarom? Because multinationals preferred to invest in something else, which paid off more, a skin cream, for example. And then there, the cynicism is total. Now that everyone wants a treatment, that everyone is looking for a vaccine, Big Pharma is ready to put the grapple on it, to grab this through patents, through exclusivity to sell it to people because we know that there will be money to be made. For me it is very clear, there will be no profits on this pandemic, we cannot let that happen. En daarom moeten wij vandaag de Europese geneesmiddelenwetgeving aanpassen. Die beschermt vandaag beter de octrooien, de winsten van de big pharma dan de gezondheid van de mensen, en dat kan niet langer.

Our response, the European response, has already made a difference on the ground. We have proven that solidarity can win over selfishness and we can help European people in need. Three weeks ago we stood in this Chamber and we granted EUR 37 billion to the fight against corona. And then, in this Chamber, I asked the President of the European Commission to do more. I said that more is needed and I asked her to allocate every single euro of the EUR 4 billion in reserve – unused in the budget of the Union for 2020 – to the fight against the coronavirus. And now the Commission is proposing exactly that. It proposes allocating more than EUR 3 billion to people in need and I think we should approve this. And we should approve it quickly. It will become law and it will reach those in need – patients, doctors, hospitals. But I say more is needed. This is just the beginning and we should plan for the future. Europe should help where there is the biggest need and this is in hospitals. We see countries, we see regions, we see cities not capable of saving the lives of their citizens.

Let us create a European healthcare solidarity fund to invest in hospitals in need in every corner of Europe. I propose the creation of a EUR 50 billion fund which should improve the situation in hospitals in every corner of Europe and make sure that wherever people live in the European Union, they receive good healthcare. The question is, do we have the money? And my answer is of course we do. We should put the money where it is most needed – saving the lives of the citizens of Europe.

They do not ensure other trade relations with China, or the preservation of our strategic sectors.

The first Marshall Plan was up to 4% of the GDP of the countries concerned, 4% of GDP for several years. Today, no country alone can finance a truly massive recovery plan, no country alone can find the necessary resources. And if they are financed by debt, the stimulus packages will be too weak and short-lived. That is why Europe is the solution, it is at European level that new resources can be found. You have to remember what Roosevelt did when he came to power. The country was devastated. Roosevelt, to create millions of jobs, decided to triple the federal budget, he tripled the federal budget in a few years. But Roosevelt is a strong man, he wants a balanced budget, and to have a balanced budget, he creates new resources. It creates a federal income tax, it creates a federal tax on the richest. Obviously, the first year, it doesn't work and Roosevelt accepts debt, he leaps for a few years. But then, because his stimulus package is quite massive, these taxes pay off and the budget is balanced. We have to do the same, we have to move very quickly on new resources. When I was a kid, the income tax was 45% in Europe. Today, it has fallen to 20%. Income tax has been halved while dividends have doubled. We must move forward on this tax, create a European income tax, fight against tax evasion, put a small tax on financial transactions. Today, some countries are blocking on new resources, because it is for MSF, a general budget. But these same countries are asking to move faster on the Green Deal. They will not block whether these new resources go to a Marshall Plan for climate and employment. So, Mrs von der Leyen, don't be afraid, Mrs von der Leyen, be Roosevelt!

Asylum for the world, climate emergency and gender delusion are collective symptoms of a neurotic evasion of the hardship of self-assertion and the omnipotence fantasies of an impotent patient: Europe's flight into disease.  The Corona crisis makes it clear that Europe is sick and therefore more susceptible to disease. More people are dying here than anywhere else in the world. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, albeit close to the source of the infection, acted quickly, with border closures, masks and tests. As a way, fewer people died and the economic damage remains less. Eastern Europe also has fewer deaths, because Viktor Orban and others care about their country and not just about the world. Western Europe, on the other hand, has failed, warnings have been struck, borders closed too late, protective clothing not worried or even destroyed, and migrants and migrant workers flown in untested.  What now? Ministers are wringing their hands, not knowing what to do. There is only one thing they all know: we need more Europe. Why only? Because, like Louis XVI, we issued warnings and are making more and more debts? It is now necessary to harmonise and level the way: unemployment and deposit insurance, health policy and taxes. Why? And from now on, all debts shall be made together, each according to his needs, and everyone shall be liable according to his possibilities. And until that is the case, the ECB should print the money.  All this is madness. Harmonization does not mean optimizing, debt does not socialize, reduce it, and printing money does not mean being richer. How do you go bust?

And there are powers outside that could exploit our vulnerabilities if we unjoint ourselves, if we give in to small selfishness, to nationalism, to lying, if we hear the siren chants of the fanatics of exclusionary identity. We must demand. This Parliament must demand that every mechanism be used to help resist and overcome the health crisis and the weakness of the economies of families and businesses. We cannot spare any effort to protect citizens. First, to save lives and then to save jobs, freedoms and the project for the future, especially from the younger ones. The President of the Commission has listed measures. The Eurogroup agreement is well oriented, but it is not enough to deal with the wounds that are emerging in this crisis. That's why we need the massive economic reconstruction plan. A temporary plan, funded in part by existing instruments. But also those 'reconstruction bonds' guaranteed by the Union budget. That could be history. We can't fall short.  And it is certainly time to act in a way that allows Europe to abandon this mere lender mode of the states. We need to invest together in the future. Our parents and grandparents built these institutions without which we would be adrift today. Many of them are dying. As Europeans, we must prepare policies so that it never happens again.

It was prepared quickly and in line with the rigid Parliament committee recommendations, and as a result, it brings measures addressing the real needs of the citizens. Thank you for this excellent cooperation. In the second part, I would like to draw your attention to two great occasions related to COVID. Parts of the industry and energy sector have gone into serious existential risk. Facing the need to decrease the carbon footprint and at the same time to absorb the negative effects of the COVID crisis is a deadly mixture. Imagine, for example, regions whose economy is dependent on coal and tourism. The industrial and energy sector needs to survive and recover first, in order to be robust enough to succeed in the climate transition.  Therefore, I most strongly welcome you, and encourage you to put forward a short-term suspension of the emissions trading system, for example between the years 2020-2022. With this step you would save employment and prevent an increase of energy poverty inside the EU; you would stabilise businesses and the regions most challenged with the climate transition; you would get the situation under control and you would deserve respect for it.  Also, let me draw your attention to the European spas – a unique sector combining medicine and tourism. This sector has enormous potential to improve public health, not only in general, but also specifically after the COVID disease.

What is happening in Hungary and Poland shows that it is high time for wider Community competences. Women's rights and LGBTI rights must become one of the European Union's priorities. We can no longer escape responsibility, because equality of men and uniform guarantees of their rights are our key values, and restricting the right to abortion will hit women who are already excluded and discriminated against, women living in the countryside, the less well-off, the unemployed.

We need solidarity between different parts of our countries, we need solidarity between the states of the European Union.

I would add that we will have to do something else. To do more with a more ambitious budget, to do more also with a mutualisation of the debt, necessary to cope with the economic shock and the social shock.

It is our public services but also the social consultation for the determination of wages that work for redistribution. All this has been undermined by austerity in recent years. So we'll have to change that. European solidarity will also be expressed through European taxation, fairer taxation.

When the lungs are attacked by an aggressive virus in a body where the heart is not big enough or strong enough, the human being dies. Then a child loses his parents and a girlfriend his beloved.

After all, we are already talking about them as the backbone – for millions of jobs and the economic opportunities of the European Union. But now in the corona crisis, they are also our lungs. Just as we sometimes compare the climate with the lungs that are supposed to provide our children and grandchildren with a planet we may be familiar with giving them.  These lungs, Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises and the climate, need a strong heart, a heart that keeps production and innovation going in the workplace and puts bread on the table for millions of families, a heart that keeps the exchange of goods going between businesses and their customers, a heart that provides the economy to research and develop it. We need to buy the mouthbands we're missing. The EU needs a heart that can lead to the necessary green transition, so that, regardless of the 2020 corona crisis, there will be a carbon-neutral EU by 2050.  The heart I am describing is, of course, the internal market. We created it as a consequence of never going to go to war with each other again. It is therefore essential that we protect the single market, our common heart, which must beat – even through the corona crisis – regularly, tirelessly and completely free from barriers. Only in this way can we realise and disseminate, in particular, the climate initiatives and climate solutions that the planet needs and which the rest of the world, even after the acute phase of the corona crisis has been overcome, will look to the European Union to learn from and, above all, buy from.

That is why I would perhaps like to begin with what my colleague Pina Picierno just said at the beginning: nothing will be the same as it used to be – that is certainly true after this Corona crisis. That is why the debates in the Member States and the debate in this House should change somewhat. We should focus more on solutions and not just talking about old, existing problems.  That is why it is right that the resolution today focuses on two essential points: firstly, the point of solidarity between the Member States and, secondly, how we can get out of this crisis together.  I would like to highlight two examples: one is that the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said at the outset that it is very important to her that we restore the internal market. However, the internal market cannot be restored by the fact that the Commission has been standing down in recent weeks and saying at every opportunity that the Member States should do everything because they have been given more flexibility in state aid law and, wherever a problem arises in the economy, that responsibility is passed on to the Member States.  We have seen it very carefully in the area of tourism, in the case of the Package Travel Directive, where the Commission says that this is a task for the Member States. However, this means that each Member State may choose a special solution through state aid law, which in the end does not provide the consumer with the uniformity in the internal market that he may have wanted when he booked a trip in the neighbouring country. That is why, if the Commission wants to keep the internal market together, it must also carry out its tasks here. We have shown it impressively in the medical devices directive.

The recovery bond, which we are currently voting on and proposing, needs to be combined with all available tools that will enable our economies to become more liquid. Only by overcoming fears and stereotypes, only by strengthening the presence of the European Union can we stand by the citizens at this darkest hour.

Cohesion funds should be cut among the last in the next budget. I welcome the proposal to use €3 billion to acquire medical devices, protective equipment and support medical workers. I call on the Commission and the Member States to keep an eye on unverified ads across social networks and portals. Masks and disinfectants of dubious quality are offered at inappropriately high prices.  It is a good suggestion that we redirect the unsuseed funds of the Fisheries Fund to help fishermen.

Let me remind you that we are still waiting for adequate measures to mitigate the damage in the tourism sector.

Today, as Ms Düpont has rightly pointed out, we have to express our appreciation to our citizens, who are demonstrating enormous resolve and responsibility in respecting the rules for staying at home, respecting social distancing, which is sometimes very difficult, studying with their children or working from home. And I think that today, also, this debate has clearly demonstrated that Europe is rising to the challenge. We heard many examples of how the people and the Member States are helping each other, how we learn how to deal with this crisis and how we are preparing for the economic aftershocks, which for sure will come.  And for that I really would like to thank all of you: you honourable Members of this Parliament, for your energy, for your patience and also for expressing what the citizens that you represent feel in your Member States. The COVID-19 crisis is described by some as a dramatic accelerator – an accelerator for the good in us, and we have seen that in the civic responsibility and the heroism of many people who just make our society function despite this dramatic crisis. We have seen how our decision-making became faster, and I agree with Mr Mureșan, who said that really, in four or five weeks we did more to tackle the economic aftershocks of this crisis than we did in four years in the previous financial crisis. But to be honest, COVID-19 has also accelerated this negativism of fake news: dangerous populism, which is testing our democracy, our rule of law. And to all of you who are concerned with this as it was expressed by honourable Member Lamberts, I would just like to assure you that we in the European Commission remain very vigilant as to what is happening in all our Member States, and we are in intensive contact with Hungary, with Poland, and we are analysing all the fake news and all the negativism which is spread on social media and we are telling them to stop it, to minimise it, and they are cooperating with us. Therefore, all of you – and I think it was very well expressed by Mr González Pons and Ms García Pérez and Mr Cioloș, that the future of Europe is decided now, and that what we need is a Europe which would be different, which would be more patriotic, more democratic, and stronger. And therefore, I would say to all of you who expressed very clear opinions on how much we need the development of massive economic investment, today I hope that you would support the package, which is aimed at immediate aid measures. But we all know that we need to invest massively in recovery, in saving our jobs, in protecting our economy from very often hostile and unfair actions. We need a Marshall Plan for the future of Europe, which will be more solid, which will be sustainable, clean, digital and, as many of you said, more resilient. Only in that way can we develop our future European destiny. We just simply have to bounce forward and we have to use the potential, the Single Market. We have to take maximum benefit and advantage from the twin green and digital revolutions, and we also have to learn the lessons of this crisis in building a more resilient and stronger Europe. In the past, as you would remember, we had to deal with different dependencies as well. The lessons learned from these dependencies was that we have to be strategic and decide which supplies we have to have simply here at home. Therefore, we are opening special storage facilities where we are stockpiling the most important medical equipment and medicines. But we also have to look at how to diversify globally and not be simply dependent on one single country or company. And we also have to decide, after good reflection and good analyses, what we need to produce here in Europe, just to be sure that when we would need it most, we will simply have it. Therefore, I think that all of you who said that we need a more ambitious, more strategic, and more united approach should be applauded. And we need also to have the means to finance this effort. We need a strong MFF, but we need it also in a different shape – simply this time if we need the multi-annual budget, which we can front-load, which we can use almost immediately. So we can focus on the areas where the help is needed immediately – where we can make sure that we would prevent future crises and that we would be bouncing forward into the new economy, that we would fight for high quality jobs, as was mentioned by many of you, by Mr Botenga and Mr de Lange. And here I will be very open, honourable Members of the European Parliament: we would very much rely on your support to get an ambitious, modern, front-loaded Multiannual Financial Perspective, which would help us to overcome the crisis, modernise Europe, and really deal with the economic aftershocks, which we are all expecting from this crisis. Several of you raised the issue of protective equipment, masks. I want to reassure you that we are working 24/7 – my colleagues Janez Lenarčič, Stella Kyriakides and Thierry Breton are working very hard to make sure that we would very soon see the good results of the joint procurement, which would make sure that our doctors, our nurses and our citizens have all they need for their work. I also would like to applaud European industries, where more and more companies are converting their usual production to produce masks, disinfectant gels, or simply started the production of ventilators, which are so much in need in our hospitals. I believe that in a couple of months, with the strong power of the European industry, we will show what I believe will be very impressive results. Ms Ries raised the issue of the elderly and the most vulnerable. My mother and my mother-in-law in Slovakia are in a similar situation. Therefore, we adapted the funds for European aid for the most deprived and most vulnerable. Let’s have a look together and see if the adaptation is far-reaching enough – what can we do more to make sure that we would help also those who need it most? To conclude, I would just quickly react to two very important remarks. One by Mr Caspary, who was raising the issue of the virus-tracing app. Here I would like to reassure all of you that what we are talking about will be a European app on which the best expertise that Europe can offer is used; that it will be tracing the virus and not tracking people; that it will fully respect protection of personal data. It would be voluntary for the people who would like to use it. It will be anonymous, and in practice it should work in a way that it would inform you by text message that you might have been exposed to the virus and you should take the necessary precautions. Mr Verhofstadt, Ms Spyraki, Mr Larrouturou, Mr Silva Perreira, raised, very forcefully, the issue of the MFF recovery plan, and I would add also what we are working on: adapting the Commission work programme, which we want to present to you before the end of the month. I think that all the measures altogether, as our President, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted, made it possible that within a short period of time we mobilised more than EUR 3 trillion coming from the Member States and from the European budget. I agree with you, we need more, and I believe that with your support we can get a good multiannual financial perspective. But we also know that to get there, a lot of diplomacy is required, because the decision on MFF is unanimous, and therefore we are working extensively, especially our President, talking to the leaders, making sure that the proposal we put on the table would be ambitious enough but at the same time will be supported by all EU Member States, because this is what we need at this point in time. We want to learn from the past. We want to use leverage. We want to use the best of our policies, which deliver good services and progress to our Member States. And I believe that all these would be properly reflected in our next proposals. To conclude, I just really would like to thank all of you for your ideas, for your suggestions and the support you demonstrated today, during all these very difficult weeks, and I believe that with your support we will build the new Europe, which will emerge from this dramatic crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 64, "date": "2020-04-16.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  Thank you very much, Commissioner.

The transport of patients and the construction of mobile field hospitals will also be financed. This is an unprecedented act of European solidarity, the beginning of a new opening of integration. All reasonable understood that only together and only strongly cooperating, we would be able to deal with such disasters. And there will be more and more of them, because the pandemic has not stopped the climate catastrophe.  Recent events have highlighted the importance of joint European action. That is why, in the European Parliament resolution, we call for extremely broad action by all the EU institutions to combat the virus, but also to rebuild and modernise the European economy quickly and powerfully.

Because Greece, thanks to the quick reflexes and determination of its prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, but also the effectiveness of the Greek government, treats the COVID-19 pandemic in an exemplary way. The Prime Minister has made responsibility for human life a top priority. The Greek people took on their own responsibilities, heroically, on the front line of the battle and in every house. Despite the long-standing crisis, Greece is implementing an ambitious programme to deal with the consequences of the corovirus in terms of solidarity and justice.

The pandemic does not discriminate, it knows no borders and nationalities. In order to defeat the common enemy, all Member States must assume their responsibilities.

The implications associated with the COVID-19 outbreak detonated it, gave it new and unexpected contours, aggravated it. COVID-19 is a huge public health problem, with enormous economic and social consequences. But these consequences, the impacts on workers and peoples, depend on the economic and social context in which the response to the pandemic is operated. Under capitalism, as is demonstrated, these consequences will always be more painful for the overwhelming majority of the population than what would be necessary. The situation faced by workers and peoples requires significant measures of public investment in the protection of health, the social protection of the most affected and disadvantaged, the defence of wages and employment with rights, and the relaunch of economic activity.

A number of measures were due to come a few weeks earlier.

It is therefore also necessary to discuss strengthening the EU's competences in the field of health, which would allow for a faster response and more effective coordination of national action from the outset. I believe that the €3 billion earmarked for the provision of medical equipment, the creation of strategic medical supplies will be felt by citizens as soon as possible in the form of direct aid, and thanks to the number of measures taken, economies will be gradually restarted.

At its most extreme, it is currently reflected in the world's dependence on China's capacity to manufacture critically important protective equipment and breathing apparatus. As a result of the crisis, Europe will have to reassess its own security of supply and global production chains. There are a number of sectors in industry where Europe is heavily dependent on imported materials and components. Global production chains are long today and often not transparent to companies themselves. In Europe, as a result of the crisis, many industrial companies have had to close down due to a shortage of components, as mobility restrictions around the world have put long production and logistics chains on hold. There is no point in pursuing full self-sufficiency, but Europe should be able to ensure the continuity of critical production even in different exceptional circumstances. The coronavirus crisis is a big lesson in that. Although the EU has taken into account the risks of energy dependency and electronic dependency in recent years, food production, the pharmaceutical industry or now access to critical protective equipment have not been sufficiently assessed from the point of view of security of supply. It is certain that as a result of the coronavirus crisis, global production chains will change. The EU must make a stronger effort towards European production, which will also be able to operate in exceptional circumstances. This may also contribute to accelerating the transition to a circular economy. The action plan for the new circular economy presented by the Commission in March, which aims to move from linear production chains to the circulation of materials and raw materials, would reduce dependence on critical imported raw materials.
