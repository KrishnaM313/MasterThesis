Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a speech I had the honour of giving before you on 15 July, I presented to you the general guidelines, in accordance with the right of the President-designate of the Commission under the Treaty. It was not an exercise in style, it was a program presentation, a project presentation, a content presentation, a presentation of ambitions. The commissioners who will form my college, if you invest it, are bound by these general guidelines. I am not asking the commissioners for blind obedience. As I said in Brussels, when I presented the college, \"at my age, you don't start a career as a dictator\". I would like the Commissioners to feel free. The President-designate of the Commission has been asked to do everything possible to be able to form a political college, so respect the fact that the Commissioners have political opinions and, through their reflections, inform the debates within the Commission. I was invested President of the Commission on the basis of a programme that binds me to the European Parliament. I have a contract with you, Mr President, as well as with the European Parliament, and I intend to respect the terms of the contract that I outlined before you last summer. The Commission, which will take office on 1 November, if you agree, will succeed that of José Manuel Barroso, who was president of the institution for ten years. I would like to pay tribute to José Manuel Barroso, who was president for a very difficult time. The Barroso Commission has had to deal with the economic and financial crisis and its consequences. The Barroso Commission has been able to integrate 13 new Member States into the multiple Community arrangements. I consider that José Manuel Barroso has done a good job and that, very often, he has been criticised in a way that at times has seemed painful to me. Mr Barroso has not demerited and I would like to thank him for the extraordinary work he has done.  (Applause) In July, I promised you that I would set up a Political Commission. I told you that the next Commission would be political and very political. It was like an ecumenical wish that many of you expressed. The Commission is not a gathering of anonymous senior officials. Directors-general, all competent, must obey the commissioners and not the other way around. So I've done everything I can to say it? - see \"heavyweights\" appointed as members of the Commission by governments and by the President-designate. The men and women who will make up my college have held important positions in their respective countries, functions, in fact, of high responsibility. The Commission will consist of four former prime ministers, 19 former ministers, three former foreign ministers, several former finance ministers, seven outgoing commissioners and eight Commissioners who have been members of the European Parliament. Their political origin reflects the fact that the Commission must be very political. I promised you a more political Commission. Its composition sufficiently indicates that it will be more political than those that preceded it. I promised you a more effective Commission in July. Again, this is an ecumenically shared wish by most of those who make up this assembly. I have chosen to reorganize the architecture of the Commission. I have chosen to appoint - which had not been done before - a first vice-president in the person of Frans Timmermans, whom I would particularly like to welcome this morning. (Applause) I made this choice because I have known him for centuries and also to bring to the Commission the political balance that the appointment of the various Commissioners has only sufficiently imposed. I have read, in most European newspapers, that Frans Timmermans will be my right hand. I hope that from time to time it will also be my left hand, but it will be difficult. I have appointed several vice-presidents. I intended to appoint the High Representative as vice-president, as the treaty provides for. My intention, at first glance, was to appoint the Commissioner of Budget Affairs as vice-chair because the development and implementation of the budget is, in fact, horizontal in nature, and I had the idea of asking former prime ministers to perform leadership functions within the college. Premiers are used to the difficult job of coordinating the work of others. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they do not succeed, but they know what it is about when it comes to coordinating. I have therefore asked those who were prime ministers to be vice-presidents of the Commission. I decided to charge Frans Timmermans with the application of the principle of subsidiarity - better regulation, as they say in English. This is an important case. We had said and promised the voters and The citizens of Europe to make Europe a machine, a forum, an ambition, a factory that would deal with the big problems and that would abandon the small subjects who find a better answer in the respective Member Countries and at the level of local authorities. Mr. Timmermans will oversee the principle of better regulation. Heavy work than the best regulation. Heavy work, which will affect all Commissioners since all must participate in this effort to restore the European Union and its political reflexes and behaviours. I decided that Frans Timmermans would also take care of sustainable development. This is an important ambition. It is a project that carries far, a daily concern.  I could not follow the proposals of your Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Security that the \"sustainable development\" competence should be assigned to the Vice-President for Growth and Investment. I have chosen to ask Frans Timmermans to take care of this particularly important aspect of our collective action because the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will constitute much of Mr Timmermans' work, already provides for respect for sustainable development, as is Article 3 of the Treaty, which prescribes it as a standard of action. The Vice-Presidents I have chosen will be responsible for the Commission's priorities, which I outlined to you in July of this year. There will be a Vice-President who will be responsible for the Energy Union in all its dimensions, including renewable and new energy. A Vice-President will be responsible for growth and investment, a second in the European digital market and a third in the euro and social dialogue.  It is not small chiefs who will instruct the other commissioners. The Commissioners of the Commission are equal in law. They are project vice-presidents, coordinators, facilitators, gatherers, organizers of ideas and initiatives. I have noted, during the parliamentary hearings and in the virtuous part of published public opinion, many doubts and questions about these \"unknown animals\" that are the vice-presidents coordinating the work of the Commission. I was surprised to read this. Everyone had told me that the Commission should operate more efficiently. Almost everyone had complained that the college was made up of twenty-eight commissioners, one commissioner per country, and that there were too many of them. I had a choice between a revision of the architectural organization and a fragmentation of skills so that I could distribute them among twenty-eight commissioners. So the question is simple: either you want twenty-eight Commissioners each working in their own corner, wallowing in the spirit of a bell tower, dealing with small skills, which would see the light of day after the commission's powers have been broken down and to pieces, or do you want commissioners who have nothing to do or commissioners acting under the friendly aegis of vice-presidents who would coordinate their work?  If you want a Commission like the previous one, you should have told me. But if you want a more efficient Commission, which takes care of Europe's great ambitions, which organises them, structures them, then there is no choice but to appoint a number of vice-presidents to implement the Commission's main political priorities. I will give you two examples: there is a Vice-President in charge of the euro and social dialogue, there is a Commissioner for Economic, Financial and Fiscal Affairs and another for social affairs, and there is the European semester. It is clear that someone , in fact, the vice-president in charge - must coordinate the initiatives of the Commissioner for Social Affairs and those of the Commissioner for Economic, Financial and Fiscal Affairs. The European semester is not an economic and financial semester. The country-by-country recommendations that the Commission will make must necessarily take into account the social aspects of Europe's economic and monetary construction. (Applause) There's a whole debate around triple A. Everyone loves triple A. In fact, within the euro area, there are still two countries to which triple A has been conferred: Germany and Luxembourg. Germany has a good chance of keeping it, as for Luxembourg, we'll see... But I would like the European Union to find and acquire another triple A. I would like Europe to have the social triple A, which is as important as the economic and financial triple-A. (Applause) We have appointed a vice-president of growth and investment. It will coordinate the action of all the Commissioners who will contribute to the growth and investment policy: the Commissioner for Transport, the Commissioner for the Digital Economy, again the Commissioner for Economic, Financial and Fiscal Affairs, the Commissioner for Social Affairs and Employment, the Commissioner for the Establishment of the Single Capital Market, the Commissioner for the Internal Market and so on.  If we want to present an ambitious investment package to the Europeans - and therefore first to Parliament - someone will have to organise it. Since there are several jurisdictions that need to be merged and there are several commissioners who have to bring their different policies to the centre, it is obvious that a vice-president has to coordinate the work. I want to end the silo. I want to put an end to this mode of governance that every commissioner works in his corner. I want to put an end to the bell-tower mentality which can be distinguished, very often, by observing the work of the Commission. I draw your attention to something that virtually no commentator has noticed. The big loser of this new architecture is me — I like your protests — for the simple reason that I delegated much of my presidential prerogatives to the vice-presidents. Project vice-presidents cannot be set up if the President continues to evolve at the head of the Commission as has been the case so far. But I would like to say here that, of course, in order for a item to be put on the Commission's agenda, I first want the approval of the Vice-President in charge of coordination. But the one - and I would like to say this without threat - who delegates his prerogatives, can also take them back, if he really has to. For the rest, the Vice-Presidents will be responsible for the work which, until now, was the prerogative of the President of the Commission. I promised you in July that the new Commission would have a sufficient number of women. We have nine women commissioners, as many as in the Barroso Commission. I had to fight for national governments to offer me nine women. At the end of July, two weeks after speaking to you, we had three women appointed by governments. I had to convince many governments to send a commissioner and I had to turn down a lot of male candidates. I will not tell you which ones because I do not want to embarrass the prime ministers I have managed to convince to nominate a woman commissioner. But, in fact, nine women out of twenty-eight commissioners, that is a number that remains ridiculous. (Applause) So since we are all, in principle, part of national political parties, and as, in principle, we all know our prime ministers, start raising awareness of this issue by national governments tomorrow morning. I am a little embarrassed to have to tell you this, since Luxembourg has not appointed a woman. He'll probably do it next time. Since Ms. Reding was Commissioner for fifteen years, we have not accumulated the ... (Comment off microphone by Rebecca Harms) No, in the short term I will not be able to change my sex: in the long run perhaps, but not in the very short term.  I told you, my dear friends, during the debate we had in July that I would listen carefully to the hearings. How can I not listen to the auditions? I have followed parliamentary hearings with varying interest, I must say, numbering twenty-nine in total. I told you in July that the Commission was not the Secretary General of the European Council and the Council of Ministers and that I would not be the valet of the European Parliament. But I listened to what you said and I thought it appropriate to draw a number of consequences from the hearings that took place before our eyes. The Commissioner proposed by Slovenia had to be replaced by another Slovenian Commissioner and I decided to give her the important transport portfolio. As I did not want to question the basic architecture of the Commission, I chose to appoint Mr 'Eef-ovi' As Vice-President in charge of the Energy Union, since in the past years he was already Vice-President and therefore has an idea of what the coordination work I ask him to do can represent. I have already told you that I have proposed to my friend Frans Timmermans to enrich his portfolio through all the policies related to sustainable development. I listened very carefully to all those who complained that I had disused the skills of drugs and products from the Health Commissioner's portfolio to the portfolio in charge of the internal market. I did not have the idea — and those who know me know it well — that medicines, that health products, as medical activity itself, would be a commodity like any other. Health is not a commodity. And so, sensitive to the call for me to put this division of skills in order - it was a wish expressed during the parliamentary hearings and widely taken up by many of the medical professions - I decided to reallocate these powers to the Commissioner for Health. (Applause) In my view, space policy is a promising area and it seemed to me more appropriate to assign the Commissioner responsible for the internal market for space policies, as was the case in the Commission's previous compositions. With regard to citizenship, I have followed your debates, I have been sensitive to a number of remarks which reflected unease, so I have chosen to assign the citizenship file to the Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs - powers to be shared, of course, with the Commissioner for Justice. I also added sports to Mr. Navracsics' file. These are the conclusions I drew from the hearings that were yours. (Comment off microphone by Michèle Rivasi.) I have more than carefully followed your debates and you have seen how we have organised the situation with regard to the Commissioner you have just mentioned, in a way that is inaudible to others. Mr President, finally, I have taken note of the intense debate around the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations. Let me, once again, state my position clearly - the position that I set out on 15 July 2014 before this House and which you will find in my political guidelines. I will not accept the jurisdiction of the EU Member States being limited by special regimes for investor-state disputes. The rule of law and the principle of equality before the law must apply in this context, as elsewhere. The negotiating mandate sets out a number of conditions that would have to be respected in such a regime, as well as an assessment of its relationship with domestic courts. There is thus no obligation in this regard: the mandate leaves it open and serves as a guide. I had thought that my commitment on this point was very clear, but I am happy to clarify it further and to reiterate it here today, as a number of you have asked me to do. In the agreement that the Commission will eventually submit to this House for approval, there will be nothing that limits the parties' access to national courts or which will allow secret courts to have the final say in disputes between investors and states. I have asked Frans Timmermans, in his role as First Vice-President in charge of the rule of law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to advise me on that matter. There will be no investor-state dispute clause in the TTIP agreement if Frans does not agree to it too. I am confident that, with your support, we can negotiate an ambitious trade agreement with the US along these lines, fully respecting European interests and the rule of law. I am strongly committed to the ambition of concluding the trade agreement with the US, but I have promised this Parliament, and I promised during the campaign, that I will be attentive to European rules. It may be that, in relation to European protection rules, we will have to negotiate further with our American friends to bring this agreement to fruition. However, I wanted to be as clear as possible on this specific issue. Herr President! Ich rede jetzt in der Sprache des Weltmeisters, obwohl der Weltmeister zurzeit eine erkennbare Formschwàche hat. (Heiterkeit) Der Herr President denkt, das wre eine vor-bergehende Schweche. Auch Deutsche messen sich daran gew-hnen kunnen, dass sie dauerhaft schw-cher sein kunnen. Herr President! Ich mechte einige zus-tzliche Erkl-rungen abgeben zu Punkten, die in der Debatte der letzten Woche eine hervorgehobene Rolle gespielt haben. Ich hatte Ihnen im Juli versprochen, ich wurde ein 300 Milliarden Euro schweres Investitionspaket vorlegen. Investitionen sind von vitaler Wichtigkeit fer die europeische Volkswirtschaft und fer die Menschen, die in Europa leben und arbeiten. Europa kennt eine unwahrscheinliche Investitionslacke - einen Investitionsr-cckgang von 'ber 20% im Schnitt im Direktvergleich mit dem Vorkrisenjahr 2007: 36% Investitionsr-ckgang in Portugal, 64% Investitionsr-cckgang in Griechenland. Volkswirtschaften, in denen nicht investiert wird, kunnnen nicht wachsen, und Volkswirtschaften, die nicht wachsen, kunnnen keine Besch-ftigung sicherstellen. Dieses Investitionsprogramm liegt mir sehr am Herzen. Ich mechte yesterday in go Deutlichkeit sagen, dass die Versuche, mich von diesem Vorhaben abzubringen - die inzwischen selbstverst-ndlich gestartet wurden , nicht fruchten werden. Ich werde dies tun! (Beifall) Dieses Investitionsprogramm kann nicht durch weitere Schuldenaufnahme finanziert werden. (Beifall) Wir messen Sorge dafar tragen, dass durch intelligent Einbringen 'ffentlicher Geldmittel die Privatinitiative angekurbelt wird, sich angesprochen fehlt. Die Wirtschaft muss wissen, dass auch sie eine Aufgabe in der Gesellschaft zu erf-llen hat. Nicht nur Staaten sind zustondig, um Arbeitslosigkeit zu bek-mpfen: Die Wirtschaft hat eine original eigene Verantwortung. Ich appelliere an die europeischen Wirtschaftslenker, das Ihre zu tun, damit sich die Lage auf den europeischen Arbeitsm-rkten verbessert, und dass es zu einem Investitionsfluss kommt, den wir dringend ben-tigen, um von der Stelle zu kommen. (Beifall) Ich werde dieses Investitionsprogramm nicht, wie urspr-nglich geplant, innerhalb der ersten drei Monate der Mandatsdauer der Kommission vorlegen. Der zust-ndige Vizepresident Jyrki Katainen und ich werden dies noch vor Weihnachten tun. Eile ist geboten, und wir messen dieser Forderung so schnell wie meglich gerecht werden. Dieses Investitionsprogramm wird keine Konjunkturprogramme - wie in den siebziger Jahren in einigen Mitgliedstaaten versucht - auf den Weg bringen. Konjunkturprogramme sind Strohfeuerprogramme. Was wir brauchen, sind zielorientierte Investitionen, die mittelfristig zu mehr Wachstum fàhren, Investitionen, die die Kraft der europeischen Wirtschaft stunken. Nicht einfach Geld in die Hand nehmen, nur um den Eindruck zu erwecken, man tete etwas, sondern Geld in die Hand nehmen, mit dem Privatsektor gemeinsam, um mittelfristig die Wachstumskr-fte und das Wachstumspotential in der Europischen Union zu. Das sage ich auch deshalb, weil die Hauptaufgabe, die vor uns liegt, die Bek-mpfung der Arbeitslosigkeit ist, nicht nur, aber vor allem im Bereich der skandals hohen Jugendarbeitslosigkeit in vielen unserer Mitgliedstaaten. Im Rahmen dieser Gesamtanstrengungen muss man selbstverst-ndlich auch an der europeischen Digitalagenda, am europeischen digitalen Binnenmarkt arbeiten. Der Kollege Oettinger wird sich um dieses wichtige Sachgebiet kunmmern. Allein die Besch-ftigung mit der digitalen Agenda, allein die Investitionen, die in dem Bereich get-tigt werden messen, werden einen Wachstumsschub von 250 Milliarden Euro in den nechsten Jahren zur Folge haben. Wir werden das tun. Es wurde in den letzten Monaten viel 'ber den Stabilit-tspakt moniert, diskutiert, aber wenig nachgedacht. Auch yesterday mechte ich Klartext sprechen. Ich halte mich an das, und die Kommission insgesamt auch, was der European Rat im Rahmen seiner Befugnisse am 27. Juni in Sachen Stabilit-tspakt gesagt hat. Die Regeln werden nicht ge-ndert. Alle Regierungen, 28 an der Zahl, waren im Juni der Auffassung, dass das Regelwerk nicht tangiert werden soll. Das war doch klar. Hab ich da etwas falsch verstanden? Das Regelwerk wird nicht tangiert! Aber dem Regelwerk wird jener Flexibilit-tsflankenschutz geboten, den die einschl-gigen Vertrags- und sonstigen bindenden Text uns vorschreiben. Es wird also relativ undramatisch zugehen. Wir werden das tun, wozu der European Rat uns aufgefordert hat. Wir werden das tun, was ich in meinen Ausf-hrungen yesterday am 15. Juli vorgetragen habe. Haushaltsdisziplin muss breast! Flexibility muss breast! Strukturreformen messen kommen! Ohne Strukturreformen, die dauerhaft zu einer Belebung der europeischen Wirtschaft und der europeischen Arbeitsm-rkte fàhren, kann es keine Flexibilitet geben - damit die Dinge klar sind. (Beifall) Aber ich mechte auch denen, die denken, eine 'berzogene Austerit't, eine exzessive Sparpolitik fehrt automatisch dazu, dass es zu einer Wiederbelebung der Wachstumskr-fte und der arbeitsmarktpolitischen Impulse kommt, ich mechte diesen Kollegen sagen, dass Es ist nicht so, dass Defizite und Schuldenst-nde automatisch zu Wachstum fàhren. Wenn es so wre, dass hohe Defizite und hohe Schuldenst-nde zu Wachstum fàhren wurden, dann màsste Europa wachsen wie noch nie in seiner Geschichte, denn wir hatten noch nie so viele Schulden zu verantworten, wie dies der Fall ist. Aber zu denken, dass Haushaltskonsolidierung allein wachstumsf-rdernd ist, ohne mit der notwendigen Flexibilitet von den notwendigen Strukturreformen und Investitionszielen begleitet zu werden, ist ebenso falsch. Wir brauchen beides: Haushaltsdisziplin, wachstumsorientierte Politik, Investitionen, damit wir uns mit der gebotenen Geschwindigkeit in die Zukunft bewegen kunnen.  Finally, I have observed, ladies and gentlemen, that many questions have arised around what I said in July on the issue of enlargement. I have appointed a Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and Membership Negotiations. A number of your commissions have proposed to rename this portfolio \"Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement. I have chosen, after a meticulous debate, first with myself and then with a few of my friends, to name this portfolio \"Commissioner for Enlargement Negotiations\". I don't want to deceive people or people. Do not give the impression to those who are candidate countries that they could become members of the European Union in the next five years. There will be no new members during the mandate of this Commission. It is absolutely not feasible. So let's not tell stories. Let us not make those who are waiting for membership believe that it can take place in the next five years. Of course, the accession negotiations will continue with the same momentum, the same verve and the same commitment as so far. I would like to welcome the candidate countries to the European Union by telling them that the negotiations will indeed be accelerated, if necessary, but that it is not realistic to think that they could be carried out safely by 2019. Finally, there is another problem that bothers me, that bothers you and that is scandalous: it is the unpaid bills of the European Union.  (Applause) It's an old problem. I was, at the same time as Mr Verhofstadt, who does not like to be confronted with his youthful mistakes, as Minister for the Budget. Already at that time, in the \"budget\" Council, we had discovered unpaid invoices. However, the European Union, to be credible, cannot be a bad payer. It must honour its commitments. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the few clarifications I wanted to make to our debates and to your questions, which were many. We are operating in an international context that shows us day after day that we live in an increasingly dangerous world. The so-called \"Islamic State\" movement is the enemy of European values. We cannot accept such acts. (Applause) The Ebola crisis requires a strong, rapid, organised and concentrated response from the European Union. I do not feel that we have been up to the task in the fight against this epidemic. (Applause) And I note, with enormous sadness, that as long as the phenomenon hit the African continent alone, we have done nothing. On the other hand, the day the epidemic arrived in Europe, we started to move. We should have done it sooner. (Applause) The problems associated with illegal migration remain unresolved. I have asked the former Foreign Minister of Greece, also a former Greek Defence Minister, to take charge of this issue, just as I have asked the Cypriot Commissioner, if I dare say, in charge of humanitarian aid, to go to Africa as soon as possible to mark the presence of the European Commission on the ground.  The problems related to illegal migration and legal migration will be treated as real priorities by the Commission, which I hope will take office on 1 November. I would like to repeat what I have already told you in July that we are rediscovering the virtues of the Community method. I would like this Commission and this Parliament to be the champion, the craftsmen and the architects of a rediscovery of the Community method. The intergovernmental method, urgently and at the moment, has its virtues, but I believe in the virtuous triangle between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I would like us to rediscover that method. I told you that we feel bound by a five-year contract with your Parliament. The first reference body of the new Commission will be Parliament. The Parliament that made sure to draw the normal, natural consequences of the 27 May election from the expression of universal suffrage. I concede that there are those of us who were not in favour of political parties putting forward tops of the list, but that has been done and I say to you today - I say this especially to those who have not approved this process - that you will not come back to this subject.  (Applause) In 2019, the European election campaign will be a true pan-European campaign and everyone will know before going to the polls...  (Applause) Democracy is also European. It is continental, and by becoming more democratic, Europe does not take away from the importance of states and that of nations which, I repeat, are not provisional inventions of history but are made to last. Who wants Europe must respect the nations and the Member States. We do not build Europe against nations that have their traditions, their virtues, their wealth, their raison d'être. We are not building Europe against the Member States but with the good will we meet all over Europe at the level of civil society, our societies, our Member States and our national parliaments. I give you my conviction. This Commission will be the Last Chance Commission. Either we succeed in bringing European citizens closer to Europe or we fail. Either we succeed in making Europe a political whole that deals with big things and abandons small things, or we fail. Either we succeed, together with the Member States, with governments, parliaments, social partners, to drastically reduce the level of unemployment, or we fail. Either we give a perspective to young Europeans or we will have failed. I would like us to seize this opportunity to move Europe. Europe deserves this and I am counting on you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to support the Commission in the many tasks before us, to you and to the Europeans.

I would like to begin by thanking you for the calm, calm speech we have heard, for the experience that has come from it and for the political approach behind it. To begin with, I would like to start by saying, on the question of the gender of the President of the Commission, simply to get rid of the appeal: stay as you are – that is how we like you, and it is a good thing! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which I would like to remind you today that we are putting an end to the process of constitution at European level. The focus of this process was first of all on the citizens, on the voters. You have elected a few colleagues, the voters in Europe who reject Europe must be respected. In the overwhelming number, however, they have elected MEPs who want to shape Europe, who want to move Europe forward. This is expressed by bringing the Commission into office now. This is reflected in the concept that we had a leading candidate, that Jean-Claude Juncker was elected, that we were more involved than we used to be. That is why Europe has taken a major step forward in terms of democracy in recent years. We can describe this question, the citizens, the voters, with today, well with the last three weeks. As MEPs, we have the task of having exercised our right to examine the colleagues who have been proposed to us by the Member States. The hearings were a golden hour for European democracy, for the European Parliament. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have taken every hearing seriously, but we have also given every candidate a fair chance, regardless of nationality and political orientation, to present themselves properly and to convince us. The expectation here is not that we expect a perfect expert, but we expect a political person who is burning for Europe, who is burning for its content and who wants to work hard for the next five years. No national level knows this principle that ministers must be held accountable to a parliament in advance. That is why we should be self-confident as European democrats. We have this right, we are proud of this right, and we have also seen it in an exemplary and exemplary manner over the last three weeks. We can be proud of it. A thought for the timetable, because there was always a question of how long it takes: democracy costs time, and, by the way, money. That's so. However, I would like to remind you, even as a parliamentarian, that the discussions in the European Council on Mrs Mogherini, on the question of the High Representatives, took us more than a month to reach the results of the European Council. In this respect, I also believe that we, as parliamentarians, are in good balance with the timetable and have therefore worked well. Now back to Europe: Jean-Claude Juncker has presented us with a team and today gave us answers to the Commission hearings in the various specialist committees of this House. Thank you for that! Secondly, he has presented a concept which coordinates and concentrates with the Vice-Presidents. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support this. Thirdly, he thought: how can I bring the Member States on board? And if in recent years we have heard many times from the Dutch Government, for example about Frans Timmermans, what Europe should not do, then I think the approach of having a Dutchman now who says' 'Okay, I am implementing this' and explains it at home. I think it is a good idea to bring the mood of the national level into the Commission. Fourthly, he has made it clear that we are getting a citizens' commission. The citizens of Europe are at the table. the student from Spain who has to leave his homeland because he cannot find a job, the entrepreneur who has problems in the digital sector with 28 data protection requirements. It takes the citizens on board , which is important – and it seeks partnership with the European Parliament. I would like to express my sincere thanks for this. Congratulations! We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support the proposal that Jean-Claude Juncker has made to us. I do not know, ladies and gentlemen, how you are doing. But I want to start working now. After this inaugural process, I burn on the content. I now want to work as an MEP. I am pleased that we can now get to work. The issues are certainly not easy. It is about a stable Europe, where we have to abide by the rules, it is about growth, it is about how we can meet the migration challenges of our continent. It's about Respect – once again, thanks, dear Jean-Claude Juncker – respect for the national level. This, too, is an important point for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. And over the next five years, the question is that, after years of looking at our own problems, Europe will turn its attention to the outside world and take care of the tasks of our time. Yesterday we saw the departure of José Manuel Barroso. He has described to us the tasks that have stood before us in recent years. The message that has stuck with me from his final report is that, despite all the challenges – if we Europeans stick together, if we are creative, if we work together, if we are committed to solving the problems, then we can do it. We solve the problems of the future if we work constructively together on the issues. With this motivation left to us by José Manuel Barroso, we can now get to work. Yes to this strong Commission! The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants success. Run to work!

You, Mr Juncker, are not the result of a downward compromise, but of the choice of citizens. We will support it by pressing it, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be the critical soul of the majority, that is what the Commission needs. We have done so in the negotiations over the last few weeks, we have it in the hearings. If Frans Timmermans had not become Vice-President responsible for sustainable development, this Commission would be weaker.  Today you have said important things, you have talked about a political contract with us, we are proposing a pact with the citizens because we are interested in people's lives, not abstract politics. You spoke of one of the most important products for people's lives, medicines. You entrusted responsibility for medicines to the Commissioner for Industry and the Internal Market. But what did medicines and health have to do with the internal market? Today he announced to us that medicines and pharmaceuticals will once again be the responsibility of the Commissioner for Health. We do not want to put political flags on, but this was our battle and we are proud of your answer. He also made some timely and important statements on the TTP. For us, two points will be decisive for the European Pact that we are discussing today: the first is the investment plan, we will not accept a simple cosmetic operation. The credibility of this Commission and probably the future of the European project are at stake in investment, and you are aware of that. We will support you, in this challenge you need us, but we also need you! We need you not to allow the European Parliament to be marginalised in drawing up the plan.  Together we must challenge the most recalcitrant Member States, and I propose three horse moves: firstly, let us give part of the capital of the rescue fund to the EIB by strengthening its capital; secondly, we intelligently count European investments, which, as Europeans, do not have to be calculated in national budgets; thirdly, it goes against the current, points on culture, because today growth depends on creativity. Look at the results of the Nobel Prize last week, how many Europeans have been awarded. Today we need to increase funding for cultural programmes fivefold, it can be done, so that we will win all European citizens the most important Nobel Prize, that of growth and civilisation, and it would also be a way of erasing the shadow that culture and education are secondary subjects to be sacrificed in the name of political bartering with the weakest states and countries. The second pillar of the European Pact is social Europe: growth is not a fetish, investment and growth must serve solidarity. Here, too, we are leaving people's lives, we do not want a downward war between European workers, so we want the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised; and then action must be taken to support women, especially working women.  You have done your utmost, we recognise that in order to have adequate representation of women in the Commission. We have not succeeded, it is not his fault, but there is no need – Weber is right – to change sex. We are acting to support women, especially working women, by taking concrete measures. In this parliamentary term, we must approve the Maternity Leave Directive, which has been guiltily buried by the European Council. His speech as a statesman and pro-European was also embellished in his final jokes by a timely fresco on foreign policy and a timely reference to immigration. Here, too, we are pleased to see a change of pace and a greater ambition than with Federica Mogherini and the new responsibilities assigned to the Commissioner for Immigration, we will finally be able to cultivate; And we know how necessary it will be today in the face of the terrible emergencies that the African continent is experiencing. Mr President, Commissioners, you have a titanic task ahead of you. The Group of the Party of European Socialists will support you and invite you to be courageous, do not stop and if you stop do not worry, because we will push you.

Mr Juncker, I wonder if I could just start by pointing to three things that you mentioned in your speech. First of all, you described yourself as ‘the big loser’. If I were you, I would not be so harsh on yourself. Secondly, you hit the nail on the head when it came to the debate on what some call public investment and what others call debt. We need to resolve this issue. We need to make sure that we learn the lesson that you simply cannot spend more money than you have got. You simply cannot ask taxpayers for money they have not got, and we need to make sure that we have financial responsibility. Thirdly, we welcome your announcement that Luxembourg should perhaps propose a female Commissioner for the next term. We look forward to the return of Astrid Lulling in this Chamber. Yesterday we debated the legacy of President Barroso, and we looked back at his Commission and we called his Commission a Commission of crisis. What will we say about your Commission in five years’ time? In our group, we will ask: did the Juncker Commission lift its eyes from the institutional naval-gazing and look to the world beyond Europe to see those competitive economies? Our group will ask: did the Juncker Commission tackle the important issues of energy security and the digital single market and pursue open trade; and did the Juncker Commission face up to the challenges of the future rather than looking back to the past? As an open and democratic group, the ECR had a number of discussions about this Commission – in fact, probably more than I would like to mention – but that is part of being an open and transparent democratic group. So, as we cast our vote today, let me share with you some of our concerns, but also some of the things that we like about your Commission. First of all, let us be positive. We welcome the fact that the structure does not look like desperately seeking 27 places for 27 people. We like the fact that you have torn down the silos and have come up with an integrated structure focused on outcomes. That is a positive plan: it is a plan for action. We like the fact that you are looking to cut red tape and to complete the digital single market; and that you are looking at energy, the economy and competitiveness. We are impressed by some of your appointments. We like the fact, for example, that the gentleman next to you, Mr Timmermans, asked the question, ‘Does Europe need to do all this?’ Surely at times it is best to leave it to the Member States. Do we really need this regulation? Thirdly, some Members in my group feel that you have offered a genuine olive branch to us, and we hope that both sides face up to the challenge of grasping that olive branch as we look forward to working with you over the next five years. But I have to say we are also disappointed. We are disappointed that you did not support Parliament’s request for a budget control Commissioner. We see the appointment of a French socialist, given their record on the Stability and Growth Pact, as a mistake. It is rather like putting an alcoholic in charge of a wine bar. You might say that it is like putting a Houdini or an escapologist in charge of a prison. It might lead to better security, but it will also lead some people to say: if he can escape and get out of it, so can we. Some of our national delegations did not like some of the people appointed because of their record in their home Member State, but we know that the process is over. We know the deal has been done. We know that the large groups will vote for your Commission. Our group will not join this cosy consensus. We will abstain. As you get down to work, where you pursue reform, we will work with you and your Commission; and where you look back to the past, we will confront you with the challenges of the future. There is much work to do, and we wish you well.

Have a little courage please, Mr Kamall, at the start of this new Commission! We need clear statements and clear positions. We had a lengthy discussion yesterday in our group, and our conclusion was that we will support this Commission as part of the pro-European coalition that also supported you, Mr Juncker, when you were appointed President of this Commission. This Commission has not received our support for free, however. We expect a different Commission from the previous one. We expect a Commission with ambition, a Commission with vision, a Commission that can lead us out of the crisis. We do not expect more of what we have seen over the past five years, namely a Commission that became, more and more, the secretariat of the Council, a Commission that waited first for the green light from Paris and Berlin – or rather, Berlin and Paris, to reverse the order – before it acted. To give you one example, we are still waiting in this Parliament, five years after the start of the financial crisis, for the legislative package on economic governance. That is the reason why we are giving you our support: to change the way that the Commission is operating and to return to the Community method and lead us out of the crisis. More precisely, what we hope to see from your Commission are three specific things. The first is a credible strategy on investment and growth. And I hope, colleagues, that we can end the stupid discussion we have had for five years with some saying that discipline is more important and others saying that investment is more important. Can somebody, perhaps, tell us that both are important, and that you do not have to make a choice between fiscal discipline, one the one hand, and investment and growth, on the other hand? It is impossible to have investment and growth without fiscal discipline and it is – as you said, Mr Juncker – impossible to have economic growth in the future without good, sound public finances. I hope that Mr Katainen comes up with a plan as soon as possible. You are talking about EUR 300 billion, mostly from repackaging, but you know what the problems are. The problem is that the investment gap today in Europe is not EUR 300 billion. The investment gap in Europe is currently more than EUR 800 billion. Close to one trillion is lacking in investment – private mainly – in our infrastructure, in digital, in the energy grid, in transport and in innovation. I hope that, in the coming months, you can come forward with a credible strategy and a plan for closing that gap – but not in the traditional way of saying ‘Yes, we will increase a little the amount of capital in European investment.’ You need to come forward with a credible strategy like Delors did to create the internal market for consumer goods. We need a new way forward in the integration of the European Union, in digital, in energy, in innovation and in our capital markets, which are not unified at the moment. That is what we are waiting for, and we need it as soon as possible. The second thing is: can this new structure work? We have always been in favour of coordination and clustering, and I hope it can work, but I have to tell you that I have doubts about it. In a marriage it is very clear: you do not decide everything together. In my marriage, I decide the questions of peace and war, and my wife does the finances, so there is a clear division of power, but I do not know whether appointing two Commissioners for the Stability Pact is the way forward. I think it could be a source of problems, though I hope it is not because I am very much in favour of coordinating and clustering. I hope, in any case, that we will not see internal battles in your Commission. We had a long deadlock in the European Union with discussions between Paris and Berlin on the Union’s future strategy. We cannot afford to have a deadlock because Mr Dombrovskis and Mr Moscovici have different opinions about the application of the Stability Pact and about future strategy. I want us to look at this question closely and I want you, Mr Juncker, to intervene immediately if such a deadlock exists. Lastly, the new Commissioners should also be unequivocal on European values. There is a problem there. You have already indicated the problem. Mr Navracsics may be competent to be a Commissioner, but perhaps not with the portfolio you assigned to him. You announced a few minutes ago that he should no longer be responsible for citizenship. I think that is a step forward, but does it solve the whole problem? I do not think so. Yesterday you received a letter from Mr Bernard Foccroulle, the director of the music festival of Aix-en-Provence, in the name of a long list of eminent European artists, painters, composers, actors, architects and directors of opera houses and theatres. I want to tell you that we fully back the content of that letter. If you do not have other proposals to make, I hope that the structure you have established in your Commission, with Vice-Presidents coordinating and controlling the work of the other Commissioners, will also apply to the portfolio of Mr Navracsics, and that Mr Navracsics, in doing his job, will be under the control of the different Vice-Presidents of the Commission responsible for civil liberties. That said, the credibility of this Commission is not only a question of economics. It is also a question of values, because Europe is also about democracy and about human values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Neoklis SYLIKIOTIS", "mepid": "124689", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, GUE/NGL has expressed serious reservations in all the hearings of the new Commissioners. The reason is political. The Juncker programme positions that our new Commissioners are called upon to follow are strongly opposed, as they reflect the new Commission's commitment to the neoliberal policies pursued to date and have led to the process of deindustrialisation of the European south, to further increase unemployment, particularly among young people, to deregulation of labour, to the shrinking of the social state, to poverty, to the suffocation of small and medium-sized enterprises, to memoranda and to harsh austerity.  Some of the Commissioners, such as Mr Cañete, have conflicting interests with their portfolio. Others, such as Mr Navracsics, have taken positions that are directed against the peoples of Europe. In the end, however, they remained with the same portfolios, even though they were highly critical and despite the negative climate that existed against them. As GUE/NGL we condemn this which proves that the new Commission is the product of a transaction between the EPP, the Social Democrats and the Liberals, the product of a practice that tends to ridicule the Decision-making processes of the European Union.  The European Union, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, needs a change of course, with policies that create new jobs and safeguard the social state. The solution against the crisis lies in strategies that will boost the economy and social development rather than austerity policies.

You all know that I appreciate Mr Juncker. I do not think I am alone in this, but I am in the good large majority in this House. Nevertheless, my group will say no to the Juncker Commission. We have decided this after a long period of consideration and intensive consultation. To take Mr Verhofstadt very seriously, I believe that the very decision to give Mr Navracsics this particular portfolio is a reason in itself to say 'no' to this Commission after the experience of the last legislature – I would remind you of Viviane Reding and her problems. But, of course, we have more reasons. I don't want to go through that in detail. I would also like to make this clear by an analysis of the things that are important for the Greens in this situation of a new beginning. Mr Juncker, it is comforting that you are breaking with this idea that economic recovery can be generated by the strictest budgetary discipline in the crisis countries. We like the investment program you are announcing. We just do not know where the money is going to come from, which is needed to an even greater extent than you have outlined so far. The second thing that really dismays us is that this idea of the investment programme has not yet been combined with an idea of how the European Union, how we want to win the future for the citizens of the European Union. I say this very seriously in relation to the forthcoming summit. The fact that, after ten years of committed climate debate, we are now preparing a climate summit to dismantle the European Union's climate policy speaks against the fact that this European Commission, old or new, has actually recognised what the challenges for the future are. (Applause) It is not acceptable for Mr Oettinger to have to conduct these pitiful negotiations on gas supplies from Russia, while at the same time preparing the Heads of State or Government to drag down the targets for renewable energy and even energy efficiency at European level. This is not about gaining sustainability, but about abandoning the goals that could actually stand for better developments. I think that this was indeed missing as a balance sheet in your speech, and also the construction, the distribution of the portfolios for climate and energy, the complete lack of the idea of sustainable development, which is really a serious reason for us to say no to this Commission. (Applause) The suspicion that growth is to be generated by deregulation alone is also fuelled by the TTIP negotiations: European achievements are being abandoned. The citizens' commitment to good agricultural policy and consumer protection could, after all, win European support. In my opinion, this has not been sufficiently recognised in the old Commission and in the new Commission. Refugee policy has been a very big issue. But a major failure in recent years lies in the refugee policy that had been promised. The fact that no portfolio of its own has been created is actually a distancing from this insane challenge. If you look at the southern side of the Mediterranean, and if you look at what we are doing so far, it is really not the responsibility of how this issue is dealt with. Let me be the last to wish Mrs Mogherini luck. Mr Juncker and Mrs Mogherini are taking over these top positions at a time when, despite the ceasefire, the war is actually continuing in Ukraine. They are assuming their responsibilities at a time when, in the face of the escalation in Iraq and Syria, we hardly know how to respond. I really hope that the Foreign Ministers in the European Union will finally recognise that good European foreign and security policy can only be achieved together and that the eternal dispute over where competence lies has brought us into this very weak situation today.

Well, I tell you what, Mr Juncker, I will come and see you there, but you are going to have to introduce me to them because this is very much a bunch of nonentities, unknown. I spoke to MEPs this morning who will be voting later, and most of them could not even name half of them. The one from Britain is so obscure that his name is Lord Hill but it should be Lord ‘Who?’! The British public could not pick the bloke out of a line-up! He has never been elected to anything in his life – which means he is perfect for the job.  I do not think that the European public or commentators understand what the European Commission really is. The Commission is the executive. It is the government of Europe and it has the sole right to propose legislation. It does so in consultation with 3 000 secret committees, staffed mainly by big business and big capital, and all the legislation is proposed in secret. Once something becomes a European law, it is the European Commission itself which has the sole right to propose, repeal or change that legislation. The Community method which was championed this morning, the means by which the European Commission makes law and holds law, is actually the very enemy of the concept of democracy itself. It means that in any Member State there is nothing the electorate can do to change a single piece of European law. So we will be voting against the Commission today, not on the basis of the individuals, but on the basis of the fact that it is a fundamentally un-, in fact, anti-democratic form of government.  I suspect you are in for a tough time with this Commission. You are going to have the euro crisis which has not gone away and is going to get worse. You are also going to have the UK debate where it has now become unacceptable to the vast majority of British citizens for there to be total free movement of people extended to half a billion people to come to Britain.

Yesterday, you did not feel any sorrow when Mr Barroso was adopted. And today there is no joy in Mr Juncker being enthroned with his Commission. I can explain to you why this is the case: because both Barroso and Juncker are not candidates of the European family of nations, neither are candidates of the hearts of the peoples of Europe, and because both represent the minimum consensus of the European nomenclature and therefore, in our view, cannot have the appropriate legitimacy. Mr Juncker, what if you said ' you have to lie when things get serious'? And, Mr Juncker, what is it like when you said: 'You are continuing to move the train of centralisation and you are waiting to see if there is not enough resistance from the population, and then you move on'?

There is nothing more to say about this. It's just embarrassing. There are speeches in this House that make me think. Speeches, as the GUE or the Greens are talking about today, which basically require a Commission to present 100% of its own party programme, a Commission that is staffed by all the Member States. It is hard to understand how such standards can be applied. The question that arises is whether this Commission has an idea, in terms of occupation and concept, for how to deal with the problems in Europe in these difficult times. I find it interesting and courageous to tackle a new structure. Nor do I know whether this idea works 100%. But this is at last an attempt to get more effectiveness into the work of the Commission. Finally, there is someone who is not just swearing about the need to concentrate on doing what is important and essential and perhaps leaving the details to the Member States. Everyone has been chatting about this for years. Now it is finally being documented in the form of a structure, in the form of a Vice-President. But, of course, President Juncker, we also want to see action. That's clear. We also want to see the results afterwards. But the structure offers the opportunity. And it is a Commission – and I think this is very interesting and exciting, and much more support would have to be organised for this – with weaknesses and strengths. All people are never equal, but it focuses on the issues that are crucial for the future of the people of Europe. That is the reality of the people. Let's do something! Let us create something that improves living conditions, that working conditions improve, that growth is created. What is the point of these sayings from all these programmes if they are not effective? That is why it is right to say that we must look carefully at where we are having an effect and by what means. That is why it is right to say that we cannot organise a straw fire, simply burn the money, but it must have an effect. That is why we need to consider whether the money we are already spending is always spent correctly and effectively. That is why it is also right that, of course, austerity must be at the beginning. If you're constantly wasting your money, you'll have no chance of designing. It is also right that priorities are being set – and I have been talking about this far too little today – in research, innovation and shaping the future. That is why it is right to argue with the Council about where these priorities should be made in the future. I find it annoying that savings are being made in the 2015 budget, and particularly in the field of research. That is nonsense. We are all talking about innovation and investment. Yes, investment must take place in this area. The Socialist Group has just said that Nobel laureates are increasingly coming from Europe. Do you also know where they are being promoted?

The voters on the right side of the House – there are very few people left there – they also want a change; they want to dissolve the European Union.

Europe needs to move. We have talked a lot about the economy, about foreign affairs, about an energy union – lots of concrete things – but I have heard very little about values.

Mr President, I support your idea of combining the tasks of commissioners in an interdisciplinary way: energy and climate, industrial policy, entrepreneurship and the market – to at least name a few. The most important task that I have heard in your speech is to get out of the effects of the economic crisis (they are still being felt), namely to restore economic growth through investment, but not only, and the return of jobs to the Member States of the European Union, to the whole of the European Union, to maintain the free movement of people, because attempts are being made to restrict that freedom (we have also heard about it in this House today), or the full implementation of the Services Directive. , which can also have positive effects in economic development. Economic growth will not be possible without a rational energy and climate policy, which must be adapted to the development of the Member States on the basis of their own energy resources. The Ukrainian-Russian crisis shows that its own resources can be the basis of security. Many of us, including myself, are ardent supporters of the approach to legislative work under the banner of better regulation.

This slowdown in growth is worrying, because Europe is on the brink of recession and deflation. They should think about why, because all the other countries in the world have now overcome the consequences of the financial crisis, except the eurozone. It is not only the crisis countries of the eurozone that are in trouble, but now – as you said – the world champion also has a lack of form. The world champion, you said, has to get used to the fact that he may not be well in the long run. And while you've been thinking about football, unfortunately it's the same for the economy. For Germany, Germany is now shrinking, France is shrinking, Italy is shrinking. The crisis has at the heart of the European Union, it has not been overcome. You should start to think about whether the eurozone crisis has something to do with the euro.

And it will be up to you to solve that equation: how to continue to comply with stability pacts and how to grow at the same time. From Spain, many Members will support you, but we will ask you as representatives of the Spaniards to create jobs, especially for young people; don't forget the farmers, who are now paying for a foreign policy that they have not done as a result of the Russian veto; that there is a common immigration policy, because irregular immigration is a common problem; and that there are energy interconnections to save citizens from expensive energy and that it might not come.

People’s health must come first, so I am delighted that you have listened to our concerns and reversed your decision.

It is easy to see why many people say the EU is in crisis. This Commission has the opportunity to turn the tide – to take a different approach – so here are a few suggestions. Revise the Posting of Workers Directive and stop the exploitation of migrant workers and the undercutting of local pay and conditions. Take action to protect people from the scourge of precarious employment practices such as zero-hours contracts. Tackle excessively high energy prices across the EU. And get our young people into work. Mr Juncker, this Commission cannot just defend the status quo. Europe is a force for good in the world but it could be so much better.

The jobs, growth and investment package which you said you will present shows that we are on the right path. I have long advocated the wider use of financial instruments to stimulate private investment in the real economy. With the current public financing capacities we need to be more focused and more efficient. We need a change of paradigm in financing. Only this will allow us to raise the necessary investment.  A word on one priority announced, and there is no need to say how important the digital single market is for stimulating growth and creating employment in our economy.

I believe that we can already congratulate you on the great step forward that we have taken for European democracy with the procedure that led to your election. But more democratic legitimacy for the Commission implies more expectations on the part of the citizens and I would like to emphasise four challenges for the future college. First of all, yes to a more political and effective Commission, but yes, above all, to a more coherent Commission. That each Commissioner no longer works in his corner implies greater coherence between the internal and external policies of the Union. Common policies, better coordination and solidarity between the Member States: all this is valid to meet the challenge of the Energy Union as well as that of our foreign policy. Secondly, a comprehensive approach to migration, as you put it forward, involves genuine migration diplomacy, as well as a migration policy based on increased dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin and transit, particularly with the countries of the southern Mediterranean. Because we need to anticipate and tackle fundamental issues, such as insecurity or youth unemployment. It also means strengthening a smart visa policy that can serve our economic objectives. Thirdly, there is an urgent need to remove the feeling that there are different categories of European citizens. In this regard, Mr Juncker, I would ask you to confirm your support for the entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area, and to defend relentlessly the principle of the free movement of people. Finally, there is the issue of equality between men and women.

I would like to congratulate the Irish Commissioner, Phil Hogan, on being given the heavy responsibility of the agriculture portfolio, and I would ask President Juncker maybe to help him to reverse the decision of recent days to raid the emergency funds for farmers, as a result of the pressure put on them due to Russian sanctions, taking EUR 451 million and reducing it to a little over EUR 80 million. That is not acceptable. I also welcome your commitment, President Juncker, in relation to the EUR 300 billion and especially the involvement of the private sector, because it is private-sector entrepreneurs, rather than bureaucrats, who create jobs. With regard to trade, I would urge you particularly to place great emphasis on liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in Europe, in order to improve security and diversity of supply, and also on electricity interconnectors, which can be very effective, particularly using intermittent renewables. Lastly, I want to welcome your commitment to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). I would also ask you to ensure that the Comprehensive Trade and Economic Agreement (CETA) with Canada and the Singapore deal are brought to fruition as soon as possible. Mr Juncker, you have a very ambitious plan. Please make the plan a reality from the word go.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "   Mr Juncker, i would like to thank you for your comments.

That we will fight energy poverty by increasing energy independence from unpredictable big neighbours. This is particularly true for the Baltic states.

I welcome the end of eight months of uncertainty in the EU with today's vote. However, the Commission's formation was preceded by a number of anomalies and oddity that need to be addressed in the future. The most obvious would be for the President of the Commission, after the selection and vote of the President of the Commission, to start consultations with the Member States, to offer portfolios to them, and only then to request personal proposals from the Governments of the Member States. The current system is reversed, and Member States designate comissars in such a way that they have no idea at the moment of marking which areas they will be responsible for.  The shortcomings of the current process have given way to politically chargeable and unfounded attacks, which ultimately mean a loss of prestige not only for the country but also for the Union.

The personal qualities of the President also seem to foretell the right balance between charm and firmness, a long leash and swift retribution. The new arrangements, however, also leave some questions unanswered. At the top, the presidentialism of previous years was accompanied by an ʽambush cultureʼ, which essentially meant sacrificing collegiality for the sake of presidential power, underpinned by a super-strong Secretariat-General (in itself a normal thing). In time, every Commissioner learnt to use the system to clear his or her files, and the habit became second-nature.

I would now be campaigning for us to apply the thinking in compromises, for us to get out of political views, and instead to reach the compromise. Because we will only achieve solutions for the citizens of Europe through compromises. I would therefore once again ask all Colleagues to be aware of their responsibilities. Anyone who does not support and reject the Commission today, if there is no majority for it, risks a bit of crisis and instability in Europe. I would like to appeal once again to Mrs Harms, to the Greens: i would answer the counter-argument that we are voting against for certain substantive reasons that everyone can understand: Europe will certainly not be better off in the forthcoming climate talks if we do not have a functioning Commission. This argument can also be brought along, and it should perhaps be weighed up again. That is why I would argue that everyone in this House today should argue, not just from a party point of view, that anyone who presses a button now is not just arguing from their personal national glasses or party or factional goggles, but is aware of their overall responsibility.

When you spoke about the investment plan, you said that it is also the private sector that has a great responsibility, and you are right. However, I remain convinced that the recovery of the economy cannot be exclusively contracted out to private individuals, and in its investment plan there must be a clear commitment to public resources and public investment.  On the single market, we agree with you that structural reforms are needed to reduce barriers to growth. However, beware of the rhetoric of structural reforms, many states have been making bold structural reforms for many years. We cannot continue to say that this is not enough, that they must always do more! Perhaps if, despite these reforms, growth does not start again, the problem is that structural reforms alone are not enough, but we also need a revival of domestic demand. The main problem with the European economy is the weakness of domestic demand. One last word that I have heard little about: solidarity, which is the basis of the European project. Between European states, between European citizens, but also beyond Europe. You rightly mentioned the Ebola tragedy. Well, this must be the test to show that Europe is there.

You cannot reduce youth unemployment – much as you would like to – because you do not have the instruments to do so. You did not mention innovation (which I think is to your credit), because the European Commission or European Parliament do not have the instruments to boost innovation.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the way in which he has been a member of the European Parliament. The decision we are taking today is a political decision. It is not a decision whether we think you, Mr Juncker, are wise enough to lead this Commission, or whether we consider Mr Timmermans to be the born communicator. The real question is: is the Commission political enough to bring about the necessary change that is just around the corner?  You yourself have described the drama of the task. You described it very well. But what you have initiated is not, in our view, sufficiently gripping. It is incomprehensible enough whether this European Union will actually make a massive start in the coming weeks, months and years in order to become a democratic, sustainable, solidarity-based Union. By this yardstick, you did not convince us. Too many members of your Commission are provoking doubts that they are willing and able to do exactly what the citizens have said with the election and what has also led to this leak between the citizens and the European institutions, that you want to introduce precisely these course corrections, that you are against an austerity policy, that you will actually work for more democracy, for a different EU migration policy, that puts an end to us pursuing migration policy with joint police actions or with Frontex, but creates the legal way to get people here and also be protected by us. Criticism of Mr Navracsics' nomination shows that no one is taking away his transformation into a champion of more democracy, cultural openness or even media freedom. Does anyone really believe that the new Commission will push forward the fight for the protection of animals, humans, the environment and the climate as massively as it should be? Even when asked at the hearings, we were not able to see how the triple-A that you so invoked for a social union is to be enforced. If, at the hearings, even the Commissioners questioned were not even able to state clearly that austerity policy is not in line with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, with the granting of human rights, how can this change succeed? How is this turnaround to succeed? However, our criticism is not only directed at you and the Commission. I honestly admit that we are also disappointed by some of the Members here in Parliament. Unfortunately, some groups have become hostages to the grand coalition, have allowed themselves to be turned into a game, and that has begun with the nomination and election of you, Mr Juncker, as President of the Commission.

In fact, the package between the Member States' governments and the political groups in this House and the three parties behind it was too tightly laced in terms of power politics.

Your Commission was in fact born in complete disrespect to the principle of collegiality, with a strange concentration of powers and providing for figures and places that had never been introduced before, all endorsed by a European Parliament that is not even able to respect within it, the democratic principles of proportionality and representativeness. A European Parliament that applies proportional methods only when they are in favour of the majority and tramples them underfoot when they benefit minorities, even if the minorities represent millions of European citizens. All this under the eyes of a European Council, representing the States, capable of endorsing, for example, the situation in Greece, where people are being taken away from health care, only at the same time to give billions of euros to banks and financial structures. We have a heavy responsibility to defend the weakest, the citizens, from the merciless war that is taking place in Europe between major interests.

To save the euro, he applied austerity plans to the people of southern Europe with unprecedented harshness with catastrophic results on unemployment, debt and impoverishment. Mr Juncker, let us now talk about your Commission, an institution which is not based on any popular legitimacy. To moralize and regulate the financial sector, you have appointed Lord Hill, a close friend of the City, who has spent half his career as a lobbyist, working for hedge funds or big banks. To deal with the issue of the euro and social dialogue, you chose Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister who led the most serious austerity plan in his country, which resulted in a mass exodus of his population. You have appointed Miguel Arias Caete to the climate and energy portfolio, and this man has very close ties with two oil companies, which he himself founded and which his family continues to control. By lacking such ethics in politics, independence from lobbies, you humiliate and insult all Europeans. Your new Commission's roadmap is terrifying: a new kind of total free trade agreements are planned with Canada and the United States; competition with the very powerful American agriculture risks bringing our farmers to their knees, survivors will have to take an even more productive approach at the expense of product quality and respect for nature. This agreement will align all the standards, the collective preferences of the French, with the American standards. Finally, shame on the European Commission! It is in the process of imposing private justice for multinationals against states in these free trade treaties. Thus, you will have completely destroyed our old democracies, at the mercy of the attacks of transnational firms. But the work isn't finished, is it? You need to dismantle public services a little more, they will have to be competitive and competitive or disappear. That is the role of the TISA Treaty, which the Commission is currently negotiating. These treaties will unfortunately enshrine the takeover of multinationals on democracy in Europe. Finally, your 300 billion euro bank loan programme will have an indigent effect on the economy since, once again, it will only act indirectly on the real economy and employment. What can I say, in conclusion, about your desire to bring Turkey into the European Union? Oh what a visionary you are, Mr Juncker! The people of Kobane are blown away!

It really is a sign of support and confidence on the part of Members of this House. This vote paves the way for the necessary final step, the appointment by the European Council, which must be completed by the end of this week. In the coming months and years, the Commission will have to play a key role in meeting the challenges we face. These are formidable challenges, including increasing Europe's competitiveness and creating jobs, developing a coherent European energy and climate policy and the problem of insecurity in our neighbourhood, and there are many others. Of course, the Commission cannot face all these challenges on its own, it also needs the cooperation of this Parliament and the Council. I would therefore like to take this opportunity, Mr Juncker, to underline the Council's commitment to cooperate with you over the next five years. We will have to work closely with each other, as well as with this Parliament, if we are to implement the Agenda agreed by the European Council from the beginning of this year. The measures we implement and the policies we adopt will be the basis on which we will all be judged by our citizens, and this is more difficult today than ever. I am therefore pleased that you recognise that the citizens of Europe not only expect things to be done, but to a large extent they want them to be done differently from the past. The way in which you have organised the Commission is a clear sign of your willingness to operate differently, and we welcome that.  At the same time, Mr Juncker, you showed in your speech that you are a staunch supporter of the European ideal.

The great political pact between the EPP, S&amp;D and the Liberals is very positive and hopeful, given that the European Parliament has been shaped in a way that neither the EPP nor S&amp;D can articulate alternative majorities in the House. This shows that the two major parties must be able to reach agreements on matters of general interest to the EU.

For the first time in the European elections, citizens had the opportunity to choose between different leading candidates.

Juncker's Commission reform, with strong vice-presidents, creates leaner structures and, hopefully, less bureaucracy. So there are a lot of positives in Terms of European policy. A strong Commission is needed right now, as Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande set out to circumvent the rules for stable finances and sustainable economic reforms in France.

I am a member of a generation in my country that lived through its childhood and early youth in the totalitarianism of communism. My family has always been an opponent of communism, some have even been locked up in prison for years. Mrs Mogherini has had a secret period – at some point in her CV – when she has a significant inclination towards communism and ties to the current undemocratic Russia. Normally, I could not support such a high representative. Of course, she may have changed her past views, but even her past experience in foreign policy does not convince me that she should support the entire EU's foreign policy. Finally, I decided to support the Commission as a whole. The explanation is simple. But Russia's autocratic forces would be most happy about its non-establishment. I wish Mr Juncker and his team every success, I am aware that he did not choose Mrs Mogherini and we MEPs will closely monitor and scrutiny her actions.

I do not understand a European government that advocates equality and in which one of its members has made women smaller and where that member, through business gymnastics, thinks that he can buy what is the fundamental value of politics: ethics. A European government where its commissioner, Portuguese like me, has launched my land, an OR-Madeira, into misery. Education and Culture were left in the hands of those who gaoured press freedom and inquined student mobility. I do not understand a European identity, united by its culture, left in the hands of those who do not believe in it.

We understand the reasons and hopes of many researchers working in this area of basic research, especially when we refer to the objective of reducing the production of nuclear waste as the ITER project promises to do.

The agreement obliges EU member states and the Republic of Korea to eliminate 98.7% of customs obligations on the value of trade for industrial and agricultural products over the next 5 years. During 2012, Croatia made a profit of about $8 million through exports of radiotelephony transmitters, turbo-jet engines and debris from starch production to Korea, while in 2013 it made a profit of $12 million by exporting predominantly the same products, showing a 50% increase in exports.

I look forward to it being rapidly mobilised by the Commission and directed in particular to areas such as infrastructure, research and development, innovation and human capital. I hope that the Commission will also ensure that the implementation of the economic policy recommendations for individual Member States is properly monitored and coordinated and better linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including m.in. poverty reduction in the Union.  Secondly, I support the idea of a European legal framework introducing minimum standards for the use of the Youth Guarantee.

During the debate in plenary last month on the situation in Iraq and Syria, we all recognised the complex terrorist threat that Isis poses not only to Iraq and Syria, but also to the whole region and to Europe. The intentions of the terrorists are clear, their aim is to occupy as wide a territory as possible, to achieve financial autonomy and to spread their law based on force. The despicable actions for which they are guilty go from the heinous murder of hostages and prisoners to abuse of children and women, persecution of members of religious and ethnic minorities and the vilification of sacred and cultural sites. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to discuss the situation in Kobane, which has been under siege by terrorists for over a month. The fight is fierce and unequal, the terrorists have managed to transfer huge forces and a large amount of heavy and sophisticated equipment that they have taken over since the fall of Mosul. The speed of this transfer demonstrates ISIS' logistical expertise and kobane's strategic importance to the terrorist group. On the other side of the barricade there are a few hundred local fighters and volunteers, who can count only on modest weapons and with great courage continue to defend their city, street to street and house to house. Kobane has already become a symbol of resistance to the regime of terror and oppression imposed by ISIS. The fall of Kobane would send the message that ISIS can defeat this resistance and could increase the attractiveness that ISIS itself exerts in Syria and elsewhere, as well as encouraging terrorists to continue their offensive action against other targets. This is unacceptable to the European Union and its partners. The time has come to show with facts how determined we are to contain and defeat ISIS. Kobane is a further example of how it is necessary for the coalition to act on a military level to contain ISIS, but while this military engagement is still ongoing, it must be acknowledged that the deployment of armed forces alone is not enough. Continued commitment and global and coordinated action will be needed to counter the regional threat posed by terrorism and violent extremism, as well as to address the basic instability and violence that have allowed ISIS and other terrorist groups to take hold. This is what the European Union as a whole needs and is committed to achieving. ISIS has been able to proliferate thanks to non-inclusive policies in Iraq and instability in Syria, the result of the brutal war waged by the Assad regime against its own people, massive human rights violations and systematic obstacles to democratic reforms.  Our political commitment must go hand in hand with our diplomatic commitment, our cooperation in the field of security and the fight against terrorism and our policies to promote the socio-economic development of the region. From a military point of view, it is crucial that the decision announced on Monday by the Turkish authorities to authorise the passage of Iraqi peshmerga to Kobane will result in concrete action before it is too late. The EU has publicly called on Turkey to open its borders to ensure supplies reach the people of Kobane. We hope that this appeal will not go unheeded. More generally, we consider the fight against ISIS to be a key element of our foreign policy towards Turkey. It is essential that all regional partners implement the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including 2170 and 2178, and step up efforts at national level to stem the flow of foreign fighters and prevent ISIS from benefiting from profits from illegal sales of oil and other goods. Turkey has shown great generosity by taking in more than 170 000 refugees from Kobane. The European Commission has presented an emergency humanitarian aid package of EUR 3.9 million to support the supply of non-food products and health care, as well as food aid to refugees who are not staying in refugee camps. As you know, the European Union continues to lead the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria with the mobilisation of almost EUR 3 billion since 2011. The Commission is engaged in a close dialogue with the turkish authorities on how to improve continued support for kobane refugees in Turkey. However, 7 000 to 10 000 civilians are reportedly still trapped in the city and in need of assistance, and there are fears that ISIS has already committed large-scale abuses in areas around Kobane that are under its control. The dramatic situation in Kobane must not lead the international community to forget the catastrophic situation in other Syrian and Iraqi cities and areas torn apart by the civil war. International efforts for a Syria-led transition remain a priority for the EU in order to maintain the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country while safeguarding its multi-ethnic and multi-religious character. Lasting peace in Syria is not possible unless the legitimate claims of all ordinary Syrian citizens, including those belonging to ethnic and religious groups including the Syrian Kurds, are taken into account. The EU is determined to support all efforts for a political situation, reached by common accord on the basis of the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 and in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. To this end, we will continue to give full support to the mission of the UN Special Envoy, Mr de Mistura.

Mr President, let me begin by, on behalf of a number of colleagues, to regret that the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, did not deign to come and participate in this last session and at least greet us. This is a tragic example of the lack of dialogue we have had over the past five years. On Kobane and the Islamic State group, many things have already been said, and we are witnessing almost live, unfortunately, the agony of this Kurdish city. I would like to focus my remarks on three points, which are more directly related to what the countries of the European Union can or could do. Firstly, eight Member States are now intervening militarily in this conflict, either by airstrikes, by training Kurdish and Iraqi fighters, by deliveries of equipment, or by these three actions at the same time. Could it not be envisaged - has it been at European level? A slightly more coordinated action, particularly in terms of training? Indeed, the European Union knows how to mount military training operations because it does so in other parts of the world. Could we not use our instruments of the common security and defence policy rather than relying, once again, on an ad hoc coalition under exclusively American coordination? The second point - you alluded to it: turkey's attitude. I have never been under any illusions about the assumption of Turkey's entry into the European Union, but it turns out that, legally and politically, Turkey is a candidate country and, under that statute, it is bound by obligations to converge its foreign policy with regard to the positions of the common foreign and defence policy of the European Union. That is absolutely not the case today and I find that totally unacceptable. Let me say that beyond the European Union, Turkey is a member of NATO and that an alliance like NATO's is based first of all on the perception of common threats. When we see Turkey's current attitude towards Kobane, and more broadly with regard to the organization \"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\", we can ask a lot of questions. Third, and I will end on this, Mr President: our attitude towards Syria. I understand the difficulty of considering that, to some extent, we would have common interests with the Syrian regime, but I do not believe that doing moral zeal to send back to back, permanently, Syrian regime and terrorist organizations is a solution.

In this respect, the S&amp;D and I deplore Turkey’s inaction in the face of this jihadist assault and its refusal to join in practice the anti-Islamic State coalition. As a future candidate for membership of the European Union and as a member of NATO, it is important for Turkey to show readiness to cooperate and coordinate with the EU and NATO. This is not the case right now. Let me say respectfully to Turkey that we do understand its legitimate right to fight terrorists – any terrorism – but, at the same time, it is morally very difficult to accept that failing to support Kobane Kurdish fighters at a critical time could be explained by Turkey. Kobane’s fight is highly symbolic, not because they are fighting for their town, but because it concerns a wide confrontation between all those fighting Islamic State and al-Qaeida’s global jihadist forces everywhere. In recent days, Turkey has finally taken steps forward and this should also be noted by Parliament. Yes, Turkey allowed Kurdish forces to cross its border with Syria to help fight against Islamic State but as Mr Della Vedova mentioned, this should be put into practice and not be just declared. We should also not forget the extensive number of Kurdish refugees in Turkey, which stands today at very high numbers and those humanitarian actions and important contributions from the European side which are also very much needed. I have to emphasise that for us the military operation should have an exclusive aim – the destruction of ISIS and all groups linked to al-Qaeda, and should include all relevant regional players. The coalition should better define the goals of the operation and should also design a strategy to stabilise the region after the war phase.  Finally, do not forget Iraq and Lebanon...

With estimates of up to 1 000 civilians, many of whom are elderly and vulnerable, remaining still in Kobane, its defence from ISIS is vital to prevent a potential massacre. So I take this opportunity to salute the brave efforts of the Kurdish YPG forces on the ground, and I also welcome Turkey’s belated decision to allow Peshmerga troops to cross the border – though of course it is a little too late for what we would normally expect from a NATO ally. Furthermore, there are still reports that Turkey is failing to effectively prevent jihadi movements from Turkey to Syria, and in addition, the Turkish Government continues to refuse to outline the details of the secret deal regarding the release of its 49 hostages held by ISIS. Sadly, the threat of ISIS continues to grow as they consolidate their powers, and it is clear that we in Europe must do all that we can to support the military efforts of the United States. So I am particularly pleased that my country, the UK, has announced yesterday that it will be deploying intelligence and armed drones across parts of Syria, marking a welcome shift away from the policy of engaging only in Iraq. Credible reports that ISIS fighters have captured chemical weapons in the form of mustard gas from Syria is but one example of the dire consequences of the danger posed by the evil threat of ISIS or ISIL or the so-called Islamic State – call it what you like, but ultimately it must be totally defeated.

It is irresponsible not to pay well-deserved attention to what is happening in Kobane.  Since 21 September, Kobane has been resisting a terrible siege by Islamic State forces. A life-and-death struggle against barbarism, which is the same as saying against intolerance, against each and every human rights. For thirty days of terror, Kurdish People's Protection Units have defended Kobane. They have fought bravely, without any foreign aid, without Turkey's support, except for some sporadic bombing by the coalition. It is true that, since last Monday, Turkey has made a policy change, a change that could become final in the settlement of the siege on Kobane, a change that consists of freewaying Iraqi Kurdistan security forces and allowing coalition aircraft to take off from their bases. However, we cannot forget that Turkey's policy over the past four weeks has come at a very high cost in human lives and that the ultimate positive solution to bullying on the city is still far from there. But it wouldn't be fair if I just criticized Turkey. We are also here in the European Parliament, and it must be acknowledged that, once again, we have not lived up to what the situation requires. We must therefore react and take urgent action: first, the European Union must exert greater diplomatic pressure for Ankara to re-consider its policies in relation to northern Syria; second, Turkey must hamper the Islamic State's illegal hydrocarbon trading network across its border; third, Turkey must also return to peace talks with the Kurdish people; fourth, the European Union must push for a stronger and more unified response to the threat of the Islamic State, and more forcefully support the coalition. I will not tire of demanding a true common foreign and security policy that allows us to anticipate and be prepared.

Mr President, every day Kobane becomes a little more a symbol, a symbol of resistance against Daïch, a symbol of Kurdish resistance. Why then does the international community, and especially the coalition of the same name, not treat the fight against Daïch in Iraq and Syria in the same way? In both cases, the Kurds are on the front line. Of course, the Iraqi government has requested this intervention, but not Syria. We all know why. The fight against Daïch must be coherent. This monster did not come out of nowhere. It is indeed the result of the deterioration of the situation in Syria, of the way in which the international community has, without reacting, allowed the Syrian people to be massacred by their dictator. This monster, Daïch, has long been helped and probably still is, directly or indirectly, especially by the Gulf powers. Daïch is a barbaric, terrorist organization that is now out of control.  There is an urgent need to react and it must be said loud and clear, especially to Turkey, that its procrastination is not in order and that it cannot claim to start a peace process with the PKK and refuse any help to their Syrian friends. Weapons, like all Kurdish fighters, not just Iraqi peshmerga fighters, must be able to actually cross the border, in the only place where it is possible, that is Turkey. At the moment, these are largely just words. We cannot, at times, salute the courage of the Kurds, sometimes call them terrorists according to internal interests in Turkey. It is time to call for the PKK's exit from the Union's terrorist organisations, including to help the peace process in Turkey. It is time to help the Kurds without delay in their fight against Daïch for the benefit of all minorities and democrats in Syria as elsewhere. We must react quickly to avoid a second Mosul.

Turkey has taken in refugees from Syria in a very generous way and we must also support them in this. It is also to be welcomed that Turkey has finally opened the border to allow Peshmerga fighters to go to Kobane, because it is a question of preventing the advance of clearly identifiable ISIL fighting groups into settlement areas. The Council of Foreign Ministers has called for the border to be opened, but it has not explicitly addressed the situation of the Kurds. However, if we are looking for a viable solution, the question of cross-border support for the Kurds or the identity of the Kurds in the region must not be left out. The EU should also work to reopen the peace process between the Turkish Government and the PKK. The EU should also make it clear to the Turkish Government that the toleration of ISIL's thriving trade in archaeological treasures or other goods through Turkey's informal economy urgently needs to be stopped. We hear of progress and regression in the pushback of ISIS in Kobane. But there are other very negative news, such as the capture of the small Kurdish town of Karatapa by ISIS on Monday or the current siege of the Yazidis.

The interested eye of those in Qatar and various Persian Gulf states have allowed so-called charity and benefactors to cheerfully stuff the pockets of ISIS.

Those of us who still remember the war in our corner of Europe also remember the heroic resistance, e.g. Vukovar against a more powerful aggressor, and that is why we know how important it is for the international community to show solidarity towards the victims, in this case, the people of Kobane, who are victims of violence and a new form of extremism. Of course, ISIS is a global security threat and wants to spread not only in Syria and Iraq, but the idea of a caliphate goes even to the south of Europe - it's a crazy idea. However, recruiting fighters on the European continent itself is already a destabilising factor. Of course, if we knew that ISIS controls not only territory but also resources, so it can also be financed in this way, and the fight against the Islamic State has shown that it has borders in our relations with regional partners as well, and I agree that we must revise relations with Turkey, Erdogan's Turkey and the policies it leads from the Balkans to the Middle East.

And in this debate we talked about Turkey, also about the United States; with Turkey, by the way, I think we need to be aware that we need a smart demand, because We need Turkey.  But I am much more interested that we are talking about us, about the European Union, as Minister Della Vedova has done. There is no doubt that we have acted late and warmly, there are undoubtedly still many Member States that are resisting entering this task and that we need them. That we need strongness and we need action, and we need humanitarian aid. Right now that is essential and urgent, not only for the people who are suffering, but also for the neighbouring countries that are making a huge effort in the care of refugees, which are numbered in impressive numbers. We ourselves would not be able to care for that number of refugees.  So Kobane is a symbol, but unfortunately the complexity of the problem we face in that region is much greater. Islamic State is currently controlling large areas of Syria and northern Iraq, and its threat is growing and very violent. Terror spreads, and the death of innocents, too. Human rights violations are massive, in Syria, in Iraq, at the hands of virtually all contenders. It's very complex.

We are also facing the trauma of the families of people who were executed in a barbaric way, but we are also facing one more trauma. We are facing a trauma of a lack of a comprehensive EU strategy on Syria, on Iraq and, of course, a strategy that would also deal with the grave situation in Kobane.

Now we celebrate allowing Kurdish guerrillas to enter. I can't celebrate a murderer s leaving murder alone when he decides it himself. Turkey has been seeing with criminal passivity how IS criminals did the dirty work against their enemies. Turkey is a NATO country and its foreign policy, which sometimes borders on international crime, has serious implications for all of us here and for the countries of the area. Added to this is the disastrous Western strategy: decades of policies based on the destruction of secular national identities, especially in Iraq and Syria.

As you said yourself, ISIS derives some revenue from the sale of conflict oil but actually, more importantly, uses oil refineries in its territory itself. That gives it a degree of operational independence, an energy independence which needs to be curtailed. ISIS controls three main refineries, two at Syria’s Deir al-Zor and one near Mosul. They have been degraded by air strikes but the issue is the importation into ISIS terrority of mobile oil refineries. This is not complex technology. It takes barely 10 days to put a mobile refinery together and on to a lorry, and that is giving ISIS real operational independence, so a very concrete question for you: will the EU step up cooperation, particularly with Turkey, Jordan and the KRG to stop the importation of this technology to ISIS-controlled areas, because if we can choke that off we start choking ISIS itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 671, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "James CARVER", "mepid": "124971", "text": "   Mr President, my thoughts and prayers go out to the brave and innocent people of Kobane, who continue to suffer at the hands of Islamic State. They have now been under siege for over a month, and the situation continues to look desperate. There was some calm over the past few days as brave Kurdish forces appeared to be successfully pushing these murderous barbarians back, but – as we speak – IS have renewed their assault. Turkey, an official EU candidate country, stood shamefully by and callously watched the horror in Kobane for too long, even though it could have intervened. David Cameron’s Conservative Party is politically allied to the governing Turkish AKP, whose officials have previously found a voice to claim that women should not laugh in public. And as the world has now seen, they have remained deathly silent for too long, watching Kurds fight not just for their lives but also for the very existence of their culture. This refusal to act swiftly raises serious questions over their status as potential EU members and, indeed, over British support for Turkish membership. How can the Conservative Party seriously support people who act in such a manner? IS may be fighting for Kobane now, but we know that they will not stop there. They will continue to slaughter innocent people who do not accept their twisted interpretation of Islam until they are stopped. I fear that it is only a matter of time before some of the EU citizens who have been perverted by this warped mindset return to commit atrocities on our streets.

It must be acknowledged that our passivity, as the European Union, underlines our lack of a strategic vision on the real risks of the world to come. It also underlines our lack of knowledge of the true aims of a number of fundamentalist and terrorist groups, those of Daïch but more broadly those of Al-Qaeda, Aqmi, Jamaa al-Islamiya, etc. It also underlines our irresponsibility towards our fellow citizens and our children. It is obvious that Daïch's aims go far beyond the capture of the city of Kobane or the massacre of its inhabitants. The fall of this city would be a psychological victory for Daïch as well as for all the movements I have quoted and which pledge allegiance to him. It would also be a powerful encouragement or a powerful cause of recruitment for jihad in general, both there and here. So today I am making a finding: the Americans are intervening, and quite massively, some countries in the Arabian Peninsula are also intervening. Even Turkey today seems to be making a move, and we? What are we doing outside of speeches and a number of humanitarian actions? What do we do as such?

In this debate, I join calls for Turkey itself to play a full part in the international coalition. But those who simply want to use this issue to bash Turkey must equally acknowledge that the country is receiving more than 500 refugees a day from Kobane, according to UNHCR, and has given support already to 1.2 million refugees who have fled there from Syria during the past three years. We should welcome the announcement that the Turkish border is open to Peshmerga forces, but remember that there are large numbers of diverse people fighting under the name Peshmerga, which simply means fighter in Kurdish. We have to acknowledge that this is not a conflict between armies, and there is proper concern about the rules of conflict being ignored. However, to call the Kurdish fighters terrorists – suggesting this is a fight between one set of terrorists and another, as Ankara has done – risks undermining opposition to IS and risks the progress of the Kurdish peace talks in Turkey too. These risks must be avoided. As the new High Commissioner for Human Rights has said, IS is indeed the antithesis of human rights and ‘a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement’. Europe should support his call for Iraq to join the International Criminal Court to strengthen the legal, as well as the military, fight against them, and as we meet today the US State Department still says there is ‘a possibility that Kobane will fall to ISIL’. But while the battle for Kobane is the focus of our debate today, the violence we want to see ended is that which continues across Iraq and Syria, with battles raging in the east of Syria and in the suburbs of Damascus adding to more than 200 000 deaths since the conflict began. What about the siege by Syrian forces of more than 300 000 people around Aleppo, who are literally being starved to death, and the 200 air strikes they mounted against their own people yesterday alone?

If Kobane is indeed a humanitarian tragedy since 300,000 Kurdish refugees have crossed the Turkish border to escape the IS massacres, one can still wonder about the magnifying glass effect on Kobane.  For the Kurds of Syria, first of all, Kobane represents only a small proportion of the Kurdish population in northern Syria, the towns of Afrine, Aleppo and Al-Hassaka are also heavily populated by the Kurds. As for the Battle of Kobane itself, it is just one of the many battles that are being fought in Syria right now. It can even be said that it is not the most essential for Syria's political future. On a strategic level, the outcome of the fighting between loyalists and rebels for control of Handarat hill overlooking Aleppo is, for example, a much more important issue than the struggle for Kobane. Other battles between loyalists and rebels, between rebels and IS, between IS and loyalists, between the Al-Nusra Front and Hezbollah are taking place everywhere.

Fortunately, in Kobane his forces are no longer being imposed, thanks in particular to the bombing campaign of the international coalition and the struggle of the Kurds. What is happening in Kobane is important, but we must not forget other areas of conflict: the Iraqi region, for example That of Ambar, where IS unfortunately remains very active and is getting closer and closer to Baghdad. Without prejudice to military action in Iraq, where the reconstruction of the Iraqi army seems crucial to me, we also need political solutions. IS is closely linked , it was remembered here earlier, I think by the Italian Presidency - with Sunni discontent in Iraq. That is why we need the new Government to carry out an inclusive policy and regain Sunni and Kurdish confidence.  The situation in Syria is very complex, it has also been said here. In addition to the need to counter IS, we must continue to seek a political transition. Moderate forces that have unfortunately lost all prominence in recent times must be helped. And we must continue to support the efforts of the United Nations special envoy for this political transition.  Actors in Syria should not be exclusively Assad and IS. To defeat IS and safeguard the territorial integrity of Syria and Iraq, we need the collaboration of all states in the region and, of course, Turkey and Iran. No state in the region should benefit that IS can prevail and found a new Afghanistan over former Iraqi or Syrian territories, or mixed from both countries. We, the European Union and the Member States, must continue to seek solutions for the region, also in close coordination with the United States. IS, in addition to its destabilizing flaws throughout the area, can also be a global threat in which European fighters are present for more inri.

Around 200 000 people have escaped the terror of Islamic State, seeking refuge in Turkey. As has been said already by many previous speakers, Kobane has become the symbol of the fight against this terrorist organisation, which poses a threat not only to the security of Syrians, Iraqis and countries in the region, but a threat to all of us. That is also the reason why we have to be united in our fight against IS. The situation in Kobane has already deeply affected the internal situation in Turkey. We witness different groups within Turkish society attacking each other and putting extra pressure on the settlement process. It is of crucial importance that the peace process remain on the table and that all sides continue with the road map that is to be set up. It is our moral obligation to support the Kurds fighting off IS and defending their city in Kobane. What Turkey has done in terms of taking up a huge number of refugees from Syria is to be commended, and I also welcome the latest statements that not only humanitarian aid can pass through the border from Turkey to Syria but  also the Kurds from Iraq will be allowed to reinforce the Kurds in Kobane. We have to jointly ensure that we will not allow Islamic State this important symbolic victory, as it would also certainly set back the morale of the Iraqi Kurds.   Not neglecting the situation in Kobane, we must also take into account the overall situation. The threat of Islamic State has certainly not diminished, also in Iraq, where it has even become bigger in some parts of the country. Last but not least, let us not forget that a large part of the funding of this terrorist organisation comes from the illicit sale of oil and goods. We have to ascertain that EU Member States are in no case involved in the illicit trade and all channels used by IS to sell this oil need to be closed off.

I am sure that the new High Representative and Vice-President Federica Mogherini, whom I wish you well in her work, will keep you updated on developments in political and security terms and on the European Union's responses to the crisis in Kobane and more generally in Syria and Iraq.  The immediate priority is to support regional and international efforts to rein in and defeat ISIS, in Kobane and the rest of the region. Today Kobane is the symbol of resistance against ISIS, it must become a symbol for all Syrians and Iraqis of the possibility of defeating ISIS and ending its terrorist regime. We take note of the Turkish Government's decision to facilitate the passage of iraqi Peshmerga Kurds to help the Syrian Kurds defending Kobane. I said this at the beginning, and I repeat this in these conclusions, it is essential that this decision is translated into concrete action as soon as possible. As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, a further important aid package is being studied by the Commission. The European Union will continue to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, to work to alleviate the suffering of all those involved in the fighting in these two countries and to assist neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon and Jordan, which are facing enormous social and security challenges. On the subject of illicit oil trafficking, which has been mentioned several times, ISIS is already designated by UNITED Nations sanctions, the effective and concrete implementation of Security Council resolutions is essential for this and the European Union is actively intervening with all regional actors to ensure compliance with these obligations. We and the international community will need to make constant efforts. On Monday, the Foreign Affairs Council asked the High Representative and Vice-President to draw up an overall strategy for Syria and Iraq, and against the threat of ISIS, taking into account the diplomatic and political dimension, security issues, humanitarian aspects and socio-economic development. The overall strategy will be drawn up by the end of the year. The European Parliament has an important role to play in supporting this effort. Your personal commitment to defending universal human rights and values is indispensable.

Joint actions by global players need to intensify to prevent IS from gaining more ground.

Among other things, Hong Kong is an indispensable channel for trade and investment between the European Union and China.  In order to meet the commitment made in 1997 to the European Parliament, the Commission and the EEAS publish annual reports on developments in the political and economic situation in Hong Kong, since the transfer of sovereignty to China. While adhering to the 'one China' policy, the Eu ropean Union is very keen to ensure that the 'one country, two systems' principle is fully respected and applied. The European Union attaches great importance to Hong Kong's stability, economic prosperity and democratic development, which in turn depend on respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in law, including the right to assemble peacefully, freedom of expression and the independence of the judiciary.  Hong Kong is at a crucial stage in its democratic development. We have repeatedly expressed our support for the introduction of universal suffrage for the election of the Chief Executive in 2017 and the Legislative Council in 2020. We are convinced that a responsible government contributes to stability and prosperity, helps to maintain Hong Kong's credibility and its position as a key international business centre. The EU welcomes the fact that a public consultation has taken place and that the people of Hong Kong have been able to express their views on electoral reforms. The government has received more than 130 000 proposals, which shows that Hong Kong has an extremely active civil society and citizens who aspire to a high level of political participation. However, the debate has highlighted a political polarisation within Hong Kong society and the difficulty of finding a compromise, especially on the procedure for nominating candidates for the role of chief executive. At the end of August, the Standing Committee of the National People's Assembly of China adopted an electoral reform decision which many in Hong Kong considered too restrictive and conservative: this decision could eventually prevent pan-Democratic candidates from participating, as it provides for the candidates to be approved by at least 600 of the 1,200 members of the nominating committee.  Although it is legally in accordance with the basic law, politically this decision has been difficult for many Hong Kongers to accept and has raised protests, which have been going on for more than three weeks now. The protests were largely peaceful, thanks to the considerable moderation shown by both the demonstrators and the police, although unfortunately there have been some incidents. The Hong Kong Government, while supporting beijing's decision, believes that there is room for flexibility to find a compromise solution. We welcome yesterday's talks between the government and student representatives. They are the first step in a dialogue that could lead to a solution acceptable to all parties.  On many occasions we have expressed to our interlocutors in Hong Kong the European Union's support for the introduction of universal suffrage. We have also expressed our concerns about the situation to the representatives of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong. At their meetings with The Chief Executive, Mr Leung, in Brussels in May, Presidents Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso stressed the importance for us of the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and rights and the introduction of universal suffrage.  Both in Hong Kong and in Brussels, our consultations are continuing in close coordination with the Member States, which are following developments with the greatest interest. We very much hope that the parties will continue the dialogue and reach a consensus on a fair electoral system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI", "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 730, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – We have all watched, I believe, very carefully, what is happening in the last two months in Hong Kong, an important partner of ours, and commercially, and politically, and I would like, first of all, to express my regret that the Union has been silent or so silent about the situation in Hong Kong. I believe that we must not be afraid to defend democracy in all parts of the globe, to say how important freedom of expression, political freedom, among others, to participate in elections and to vote are at all times. Universal voting has no value if the process of validating applications is restricted before voting. I also mentioned, when I saw what was happening in Hong Kong, an old observation he made more than half a century ago, in reference to the totalitarian Raymond Aron regimes, which said that in these regimes it is not the voters who decide who leads, but the rulers who decide who votes. There is a small nuance in Hong Kong that has been introduced, because we have the impression that it is not the voters who determine who governs, but the governments who select the candidacies. This is unacceptable and, from the point of view of the Union, as we understand democracy, and I would also say from the point of view of the promises made by Beijing several years ago. Of course I was pleasantly surprised by the predominantly peaceful nature of the demonstrations, and I hope that both sides will continue to demonstrate restraint and avoid the use of force, because if the situation were to be complicated from the point of view of violence, it would certainly take on a very serious dimension.

It was felt that these principles could challenge the Communist one-party state of China, so the ‘one country, two systems’ mantra was established. This settlement allowed for Hong Kong to have a large degree of autonomy for 50 years as provided for by the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the so-called Basic Law. While these negotiations did not initially secure the right of universal suffrage, there is a reference to an ultimate aim of universal suffrage within the Basic Law. Over the past two decades, we have seen a growing desire in Hong Kong to achieve that creditable aim, and we are now seeing a demand, in particular, for 2017 to be the year when that change finally comes about.  I strongly believe that the European Union should now be standing firm in support of Hong Kong on this issue, provided the protests are being held in a peaceful manner and within the law.

Let us hope that that could happen all around the world. It would be a better place. I hope and pray that it is true.  A great hero of mine, President Reagan, famously said: ‘Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. We must be thoughtful, protect it, and hand it on to them to do the same.’ Many of us thought that President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and their allies had defeated the tyranny of Communism in the last century. Sadly, in China, its vestiges live on, and there are many new anti-democratic tyrannies around the world, not all of which show their true faces, but are a force for evil all the same. Protesters are carrying umbrellas in Hong Kong to protect themselves from teargas. We must hope and pray that these good people will stand firm in Hong Kong; in many places around the world we need people to stand firm in their battle for democracy. We hope and pray that good will prevail over evil and right will defeat wrong, and that the umbrella can become a symbol of democracy, protecting individuals against tyranny.

She told me that the government there is trying to isolate them from the international media but that they want their voice to be heard all around the world. So let me use my parliamentary speech to tell this House what she told me. Christine told me that the police are beating the protestors. One of her friends was taken to what she called a ‘dark corner’ and was beaten by no fewer than seven policemen. She said their heads are bleeding. The umbrella is not just a symbol of the protest. She told me that it is the only defence they have against the widespread use of pepper spray and tear gas. She believes that has been exported to Hong Kong from my own country, the United Kingdom. Christine said the protestors had been cleared, not just by police, but by what she called the mob – violent people she and her friends believe have been mobilised and paid for by the government, using tactics she says have been learned from Vladimir Putin. These are the very same individuals who have raised a petition against the protestors which the government itself appears to have exposed its own complicity in by this week publicly endorsing the petition. Christine says the protestors have been provoked by the statement of the Hong Kong Chief Executive to the international media, but not the local media, that people earning less than USD 1 800 per month – the poorest half of the population – will be disenfranchised. She said that a privileged group is taking control of the election. They want civil nominations with everyone having the right to vote. She says the protestors have been disappointed by the talks yesterday and today, and that what they have been offered is not even close to what they want. Christine said the portrayal from Beijing of their protest as a so-called revolution inspired by the West is a total myth. She asked me to make clear that the West is not trying to overthrow the government but to say on her – and their – behalf that democracy must be universal. Today I endorse those messages. Everyone will form their own conclusions after listening to these and other testimonies. For my part, I make three. I express my own disappointment that the dialogue appears to be producing little outcome. I am concerned that my own country, which is party to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, has chosen to grant seven export licences to export GBP 180 000 of tear and CS gas to Hong Kong up to as late as March this year, which is surely being used against the protestors.

The events in Hong Kong are of fundamental importance. That is why millions of people around the world, especially in China, are watching things develop. For most, the hope that these events can usher in a positive development prevails in Hong Kong and beyond. It is therefore to be welcomed that the High Representative is making a statement on Hong Kong in this situation. So the events in Hong Kong are not just of local significance, they allow us to assess how much China stands by the commitments it once made. The formula \"One country, two systems\" from the period of Hong Kong's transition made it possible to continue democratic conditions in the city. This was a major step forward in comparison with the conditions in the adjacent areas of China. It was perceived as deficient by the local population of students, intellectuals or trade unionists. Hong Kong is one of the richest regions in the world with a high level of inequality. Many people therefore have a great interest in change and participation. The origin of the protests had its background here as well. It is therefore worth supporting the citizens' efforts to develop democracy and fighting for a flawed, flawed democracy to become a real democracy. Even if not everything was negotiated in the 1980s as we are discussing today, the principle of democracy is precisely that it can be further developed. China would be well prepared to accept such a thing. Unfortunately, Beijing refuses to engage in constructive dialogue with the protesters, and unfortunately Beijing is also resorting to repressive measures against all those who show solidarity in China with Hong Kong's democracy. This policy is not only contrary to the principles of human rights, it is also short-sighted. In the long run, no society based on market principles can do without democratic structures. The \"one country, two systems\" principle would also allow China to have the necessary experience for this unstoppable process. The people of Hong Kong are therefore fighting for freedom in Hong Kong.

I asked for this picture to be removed and, by not receiving a reply, I pulled the picture away to take it to the person in charge. Then I went to another place and a security gentleman stopped me and treated me like a thug. But in this Europe, excuse me, in a month's time the Holy Father arrives here, but is it possible to show off such a blasphemous picture? It's a disgrace! But who is Catholic like me, you must always feel insulted seeing certain things? And if I get out of here and see that picture again, I'm still going to want to take it off again, because my religion dictates to me, it makes me see something I don't accept. So how do you have to respect all other religions, I ask myself: but if there had been for example Muhammad with a naked woman nearby, would they not have said something? The Christian religion, Catholics can't see things like that all the time. And I just wanted to say this because they treated me like a criminal. And I apologize, Mr President, I just wanted to say this because I'm waiting outside for security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 758, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   Mr Buonanno, you have one minute to make a point of order.

The adoption of a plan for 5 years in 2012 has broadened and deepened our political dialogue. In this context, we are discussing a number of issues, including governance and human rights. The granting of the General System of Preferences (GSP+) to Pakistan from 1 January this year offers a further opportunity for deepening dialogue and assessing progress on human rights. Since 2008, Pakistan has maintained a moratorium on the death penalty. The European Union regularly reiterates to Pakistan its firm position against the death penalty, which is cruel and inhumane punishment. The EU delegation is constantly monitoring the situation and calls on Pakistan to maintain the moratorium. During the 2014 strategic dialogue, Pakistan confirmed its intention to maintain the moratorium. Blasphemy laws are the most important instrument of oppression of religious minorities and stipulate that an insult to the Koran is punishable by life imprisonment and that the use of disparaging terms against the prophet is punishable by the death penalty. A number of blasphemy death sentences have been handed down by numerous courts, but so far none have been carried out. The defendants are usually acquitted or placed on bail by the courts of appeal. This means that they can spend several years in prison awaiting trial. The main criticism leveled at the laws is that the sanction – the death penalty – is disproportionate to the nature of the crime. However, another serious concern is that a considerable number of blasphemy cases are based on false statements. There is a complaint, in most cases against Muslims, but also against non-Muslims, to resolve personal diatribes or to fuel sectarian and inter-faith tensions. This abuse seems to be on the increase in recent decades. Pakistan has acknowledged the abuses and committed itself to working to prevent them. As set out in the European Union guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion and belief, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June 2013, 'laws that criminalise blasphemy and restrict religious and religious freedom [ ...] they can have a serious inhibitory effect on freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief; the European Union recommends the decriminalisation of such crimes.\" In addition, the EU will strongly oppose the use of the death penalty, physical punishment or deprivation of liberty as sanctions for blasphemy. In the case of Asia Bibi, the European Union is following developments very closely. Last Thursday, the Supreme Court in Lahore upheld the judgment handed down by the Court of First Instance, which sentenced her to death for the crime of blasphemy in 2010. Asia Bibi now has 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The High Representative/Vice-President has repeatedly expressed his regret and deep concern at the decision of the Court of Lahore to confirm the death sentence on Asia Bibi. Cathy Ashton has hoped the verdict will be overturned quickly by the Supreme Court. The European Union calls on Pakistan to ensure that all citizens fully respect the human rights enshrined in the international conventions to which it is a party. Asia Bibi is the first woman to be sentenced to death for the crime of blasphemy and her case has caused a lot of uproar in Europe. Despite this, his case is not the only one.  Allow me to congratulate the European Parliament on its strong commitment to human rights in Pakistan, expressed through numerous resolutions and political mobilisation. The European Union, through its delegation in Islamabad, will continue to follow the case of Asia Bibi closely and call for her release. Although the European Union does not consider intervening in an ongoing judicial process, it will consider raising this case and the broader issue of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with its Pakistani counterpart. We will continue to urge the Government of Islamabad to consider reducing the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty and to respect its obligations towards freedom of expression and freedom of religion and belief.  These issues were addressed in June in the human rights dialogue in Islamabad. The next opportunity will be As early as next week, when Special Representative Stavros Lambrinidis will visit Pakistan. Finally, as I have already mentioned, the GSP+ regime provides a very useful framework for assessing and promoting progress on human rights in Pakistan.

Despite these pressures, Asia Bibi's appeal against her death sentence was dismissed by a court the other day. The conviction is simply absurd and I would like to recall the circumstances which gave rise to this important debate in Pakistani society and which led to the unfortunate condemnation. Thus, in 2009, Asia Bibi took water from a well and offered it to another Muslim woman, who refused it under the pretext that Asia is Christian and that water is therefore impure. There has been an altercation and Asia Bibi is today charged with blasphemy and, moreover, is in the death row waiting for her execution by hanging. I recall that, although the death penalty provides for the death penalty, the blasphemy laws in Pakistan do not contain standards of evidence, nor the requirement to prove a specific intention, nor a penalty for false allegations, and, more seriously than all of them, they do not contain any clear indications as to what blasphemy constitutes. Laws are often used for personal vendettas and to persecute religious minorities and, in particular, Christians. The case of Asia Bibi is emblematic of this. On the other hand, the possibility of pardoning Asia Bibi provided for in the Constitution must also be taken into account in order to put an end to this woman's ordeal. I also hope that the security of Asia Bibi and his family will be ensured by the Pakistani authorities. Indeed, we must not forget that once a person is accused of blasphemy, his and his family's security is in danger. The vast majority of people accused of blasphemy in Pakistan do not, by the way, reach the execution, but are either being detained or killed while in custody. Asia Bibi's family was also forced into hiding from death threats and feared, according to media reports, that she would be killed once released. Beyond that, I believe that the Pakistani authorities must urgently revoke the laws of blasphemy, because such abusive processes, which have nothing to do with the idea of justice and tolerance, do not happen more quickly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 763, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Afzal KHAN", "mepid": "124962", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, can I first of all correct what the President’s office has just said.

Her health has greatly worsened during the years she has spent in almost total isolation. It is worth remembering that the death penalty for blasphemy has, however, never been carried out in Pakistan. We know that an overwhelming number of cases registered were against Muslims, with only 4% against other minorities. All individuals facing charges, their families and those who speak out against the law face terrible reprisals or lose their lives. Blasphemy laws are common across the world, but must be used to promote religious harmony and not in persecution of others. The abuse of these laws encourages extremists to enforce their notion of truth on others, thereby increasing religious intolerance, discrimination and violence. This is unacceptable.

It is a serious threat to the European Union, and we saw what happened in Brussels only half a year ago when a returning foreign fighter opened fire in the Jewish Museum in Brussels and killed four people. We need to step up our efforts to stem the flow of foreign fighters and we need to work together in the European Union. First of all, we need to ensure better information exchanges between the Member States, notably by establishing appropriate mechanisms. One such mechanism is the passenger name record data that the Council mentioned. PNR data could be an essential tool to carry out trend pattern analyses, identifying potentially high-risk travellers. This enables the authorities to better detect those foreign fighters travelling to and from the EU by air that were previously unknown to law enforcement agencies. PNR is also a very important tool to detect traffickers and drug smugglers. Of course, an EU PNR needs a clear legal framework and coherent data protection safeguards across the EU in line with Article 8 of the Charter, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice. EU legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and the application of the measures, and imposing appropriate safeguards so that the persons whose PNR data has been retained have sufficient guarantees to protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and any unlawful access or use of that data. I really hope that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs can look at this again. As you know, Member State after Member State is developing its own PNR system, and it would be much better to have a joint system with common rules, not least when it comes to data protection. Another strand of action is the detection of returnees from conflict zones to Europe, and therefore issues of border security and border management play a role here. The Schengen Information System (SIS) is an effective tool for the detection and disruption of suspicious travel by sharing information about foreign fighters. It allows today for specific action to be taken on the basis of alerts. The Commission is making efforts to accelerate and improve the information exchange on SIS alerts among Member States, and it is crucial that Member States use all the possibilities offered by the system today. It is also important that Member States carry out minimum checks on persons as required by the Schengen border code and systematically check the travel documents of all persons at external borders against the relevant databases. There are voices calling for a revision of the existing framework on this, but it is important to first look at how we can use in an optimal way the existing tools and measures and make the best of them. The situation is urgent and the Commission is, of course, looking at technical discussions, but for the moment we do not plan any initiatives in this area. You must also understand that the Commission reserves its position until the next Commission is in place. Looking forward, aviation security capacity-building in third countries is a priority. The Commission stands ready to support work in this field highlighted by the European Council in August. We will continue our work on detection technologies to make sure that our own aviation security is as strong as it has to be. A very important strand here not to be forgotten, because it is key, is preventive work. We need to address, as the Council mentioned, terrorists’ use of the internet. We know that many of these organisations recruit via the internet. That is why we have started a dialogue with internet providers to see if we can cooperate in developing counter-narratives online and in cooperation, for instance, with returned people who can tell their stories. As you know, we also created three years ago the radicalisation awareness network. It plays a very important role in helping local actors and Member States to improve the tools and understand the root causes of radicalisation. We have networks working in all Member States with families and victims to draft counter-narratives, to pool the research, and we are working on exit strategies and will very soon be setting up a sort of centre of excellence that will be at the disposal of Member States for all this. At this point I would like to reiterate that security and fundamental rights are intrinsically related here. Combatting racist and xenophobic crime, intolerance, discrimination, including promoting integration and social cohesion, is a key element of EU policies. It is very important not to stigmatise any group here. We will also do everything to give priority to the enforcement of the Framework Decision on combatting racism and xenophobia by means of criminal laws. Honourable Members, Member States are meeting a lot to discuss these issues. The Commission is trying to be helpful, creating forums for the exchange of information. We need to step up our action here to combat this dangerous phenomenon of foreign fighters. We should use the existing tools at our disposal to the maximum extent made possible by border measures and national databases.

I greet the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, thanking him for the work he has done so far, in these years, and wishing him many successes in the future. Serious and constant human rights violations in Iraq and Syria under DAESH control have become a clear threat to international security. We are faced with acts of extreme cruelty: mutilations and beheadings of civilians and soldiers; sexual slavery of women; recruitment of children and kidnappings. In short, they are dedicated to generating terror with targeted or mass killings of civilians, also causing mass displacements of population: thousands, millions of displaced persons and refugees. The recruitment of fighters by the so-called Islamic State is not an isolated event throughout history: large international conflicts with certain Islamic countries throughout often become a good opportunity for the recruitment of jihadists. It happened in the 1980s with Afghanistan, in the 1990s with Chechnya, and it happened again in the 2000s with the Iraq war. But the big difference with all these conflicts is that the terror generated by DAESH is on track to outperform all those experienced in previous decades. This terrorist group recruits its members through a studied and lengthy work of recruitment through social media, which began even before the outbreak of the Syrian conflict. We are faced with a serious threat that increases day by day. The number of European fighters is estimated at 3,000, including 300 Belgians, 700 French, 500 from the United Kingdom, 51 from Spain. It must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that the return of these fighters to Europe after having participated in armed conflicts and receiving military training poses a grave threat to our security. The Union must therefore face and face this great challenge without ambages. And as I have said many times before this House, the best tool to combat them is the prevention and action of the intelligence services. Yes, we are definitely going to support the European PNR. President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Malmstrom, it is anachronistic and it is useless that there are thirteen PNRs funded by the Commission or that countries such as France or the United Kingdom have their PNR. I will support Timothy Kirkhope's initiative and I will do everything I can to unlock something that remains dead, sadly dead, since April 2013. So yes to the European PNR; not only to detect those who return, but also to detect those who come out or intend to leave. Yes to SID alerts and also to incentivize and promote greater aviation safety.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 782, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Birgit SIPPEL", "mepid": "96932", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

As the previous speaker said, it is a question of possible increased security in Europe, of nothing more and nothing less. However, we must not, of course, underestimate the danger posed by people who are prepared to commit violence and their supporters. But people must be able to trust that all the measures we take are based on respect for European fundamental rights. Extremism is not Christian, Jewish or Muslim. It is about power, it is about rejecting our common European values, about our democratic systems. We must defend and protect them. Surveillance of suspects is legitimate, but people must not become suspects simply because they belong to a particular religion or ethnic group. This obscures the view of other possibilities. I am thinking, for example, of the Nazi underground in Germany, whose members were able to murder undisturbed for years because certain criteria were left out, even though there were indications. The idea of withdrawing travel documents, which is currently under discussion, is critical not only because of freedom of movement. Even worse is the issue of a replacement identity card. This stigmatizes people without being charged or tried for a crime.

There was talk here that preventive action is needed in the strategy to combat radicalism of the European Council mentions the need to educate educational institutions, social and health services, religious communities to combat this problem. Of course, it is easy to say, this work is very complicated, the education itself takes a long time and the implementation of what has been learned and the skills that have been learned even longer.  But even more important than that is creating conditions in which radicalism will not occur. Radicalism of every kind occurs in conditions of social exclusion and especially poverty in these last years of the economic crisis. And that is why the key question is how to eradicate the conditions in which this type of radicalism is developing, but also every other radicalism, and therefore I remind that ten years ago European leaders said that they have failed to integrate immigrants into their countries, even those who have lived in these countries for years or more, and I think today's situation is no better than those last ten years and therefore I call on the Council , the Commission and Parliament to work to create social inclusion conditions in Europe and eradicate poverty, which is one of the conditions and fertile soil for the growth of radicalism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 785, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Sofia SAKORAFA", "mepid": "125091", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

The roots to this go deep. Having grown up in the region myself, I am slightly familiar with it. The very existence of many of the states we are dealing with goes back to the historic actions of a number of our Member States, not least my own. Even in today’s New York Times a foreign fighter is quoted as saying ‘ISIS is the divine vehicle that will dismantle the European borders drawn by Britain and France at the end of World War I’. This goes back a very long way, and unless we comprehend the causes, and also much else – and I disagree that a massive security infrastructure at home is the solution when the causes are deeply rooted elsewhere – that disjoint in our values, because we are not seen as being impartial, is exploited by recruiters in highlighting our selective and partial application of our own much-vaunted values in our dealings with the region.  Even now we see that, while some rightly condemn the barbarism of ISIS, we are rather quieter in condemning similar actions by a number of our allies.

Or is it perhaps wise to agree on a reasonable, measured catalogue that does not automatically assume that you are taking away your passport from unsuspecting people? If a passport or a travel document is taken away, then there must be very clear criteria behind it, that someone wants to leave for Syria accordingly comes from corresponding very suspicious circles and accordingly has also potentially already appeared as a Salafist or as someone who has shown himself to be very violent. I do not want us to ask ourselves in hindsight what we could have done, but the task we have is to ward off crimes and, accordingly, to ensure that serious criminals, when they return to the European Union, are arrested, put a stop to them and do not give them any opportunity to spread throughout the European Union. That I agree that we potentially also need to think – not just potentially – about how it can happen that a small, radical group of people is on their way, that is right. But to say that Europe's young people are on their way is certainly wrong. But thank God it is a very small but extremely brutal, a horrible, a torturing, murderous and raping force. I think it is wrong to trivialise these or not to take measures into account. We have to keep a bit of an overview, that is necessary.

Since we adopted that resolution, more than 1,000 jihadists have left Europe for Syria and Iraq. We must have a coordinated European approach to tackle this problem. As Jean-Claude Juncker rightly said in his speech this morning: IS is an enemy of the values of Europe and IS is an enemy of everything That Europe stands for. The 2013 Council adopted four priorities for such a coordinated approach: prevention, information exchange, criminal justice and cooperation with third countries. I now wonder: what is the state of this approach and have concrete results been achieved? A specific question I would like to ask is about Europol's focal point for travellers. The purpose of this is to exchange and analyse information about suspicious persons who may wish to leave. Are all countries now active in this network? If not, do you believe that participation should be required to ensure the most efficient approach possible? Point two: does this system also apply to returning jihadists? Can we also monitor people returning from Syria and Iraq through a European register in which all countries participate? Finally, I would like to join my colleague Frank Engel: we must fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq, but we must also pay close attention to the reasons on which young people are radicalised in our own Member States and the ways in which organisations are given the space to facilitate and organise travel to Syria and Iraq from our own European countries. Member States must also take responsibility and take important steps on these issues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 804, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Deirdre CLUNE", "mepid": "124988", "text": "   Mr President, the compilation of accurate statistics in relation to the numbers of actual foreign fighters is problematic, due to the secretive nature of those travelling and many of the circuitous routes such individuals take in reaching their destinations; but it is happening and there is no doubt about it. We hear various reports of figures, in their thousands or hundreds, I do not know, but certainly it is happening. The phenomenon of individuals travelling from all over Europe to the fighting has affected the majority of European states and it is one to which Ireland, my own country, gave priority during their recent Presidency of the Union in 2013. In that context, Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of Member States to carry out a review of the strategy for counteracting radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism. A primary point of focus in this review was the foreign fighter issue, and a number of initiatives have been developed to combat this phenomenon, including: community relations, which I believe are very important; media campaigns; enhanced tracking of movements; engagement with third countries, notably Turkey; and engagement with internet service providers to curb radical on-line content. It is widely accepted that this problem cannot be resolved by security-related measures alone and that a key issue in addressing it is a programme of proactive engagement with the communities affected. Meaningful engagement with these communities is an essential part of the process, in order to avoid any sense of profiling of stigmatisation of sectors of the population. The protection of fundamental rights and recognition from the outset that the majority of people wish to go about their daily lives in peace and to play a productive part in society is enshrined within this engagement. The growth of extremism which we are now witnessing across the reign is a cause of considerable concern, which I know is shared by all of us in this room. The blood lust and inhumanity which ISIS is displaying in Syria and Iraq has shocked and appalled all civilised people. The destruction and displacement of the ancient Christian communities of northern Iraq has been harrowing to witness. All of this taken together harks back to a mentality and a culture which we thought had long been consigned to history. It is a frightening new reality for the world and one which we must address head on.

One way is through coercive measures that have been talked about lately, such as restricting the right to travel for people suspected of terrorism. Or through the accelerated adoption of the Passenger Information Directive, as called for by the Council. However, these measures must take into account fundamental human rights and the protection of personal data and there must be sufficient guarantees that they will not be misused.  However, the above proposals are short-term solutions to a much deeper problem – a number of Europeans feel excluded from European society and are looking for another opportunity for personal realisation, be it through terrorism.

The first is ignorance, and I have heard many approximations this evening in this debate, the second is naivety, and I have also heard a lot of very naïve words, and the third is widespread stigma, of which I have also heard some examples. The phenomenon of European fighters in jihadist movements has always existed. It is not new in itself, but it is new in its scale and the means it uses, that is, the mass communication technologies that are used to convert and radicalize fragile elements of our society. In the face of this extreme threat, terrorist in nature, which plays on the emotional and the spectacular, each institutional level must take its responsibilities. It is not necessarily at the collective level of the European Union that the best solutions lie, we must be aware of this. The June 2013 findings are good conclusions which, I believe, contain a fairly accurate diagnosis of the steps that can and should be taken. However, the main implementation of these measures is the responsibility of the Member States because the pillars of internal security - i.e. intelligence, the police and the judiciary - are the Member States. I do not believe at all in the effectiveness of bureaucratic, hasty and ill-suited European mutualisation. Efficiency depends on better cooperation between the judiciary, the intelligence services and the police, not the establishment of a new bureaucratic European superstructure. In this regard, I wonder, like many experts, about the usefulness of giving Europol a pilot role in this coordination. I do not think that is Europol's job and I believe that the national intelligence services are much better equipped for that. A final word on the responsibility of the European Parliament. Parliament must be more active and expert on these issues and not get lost in completely vague, smoky and naïve theological debates. I believe that we should take responsibility by quickly adopting the NRL because it is one of the tools we have to effectively strengthen the fight against terrorism.

The problem is leaving, but of course the same danger is opened by their return from the battlefield. I would also like to mention european fighters who are often left out of statistics.

It is also, as has been said, not a new phenomenon. We have all seen the horrors that are committed in Syria and Iraq by ISIS and other groups. Decapitation, rape and murder of innocent civilians: children, women, men, journalists, health workers. This is terrorism and barbarism. It is clear that it has nothing to do with Islam, and a huge majority of Muslims all over the world are condemning it.  But we do have Europeans travelling to fight with these groups and this is a problem. They commit terrible acts there and they can do us a lot of harm when and if they come home – and by the way there are no indications whatsoever that they come to Europe as asylum seekers. This is false.  We need to create police cooperation, intelligence sharing and in fact we are setting up different platforms where they can share information. From what I hear this is going well, especially amongst the most concerned eight or nine states, but more and more countries in the European Union are concerned about this right now. It would be helpful to have a PNR and I think a system could be set up that is robust when it comes to data protection but still serves its purpose. We can use SIS and border control measures much more efficiently. They allow for a lot of things to be done today, and Member States should make full use of them.  We also need to cooperate more on the preventive side. Local communities, religious leaders, teachers, civil society can play a very important role at local level to identify young people, young men – and women: increasingly there are also young girls travelling to fight – to identify them and prevent them from going when it is possible. We have more than 1 000 experts from all over Europe connected to the RAN network, the Radicalisation Awareness Network, and they can help Member States with advice, setting up local action plans, setting up exit programmes, and advising on how to put up centres where worried families can call: Where do I call if I am worried that my son or my brother is planning to go away? There have to be structures from this and we can share a lot of information and good practices here. Of course, integration and social exclusion need to be given further attention here so we can combat exclusion and ensure that European citizens do not feel the need to leave. We also need, of course, to respect human rights and avoid stigmatisation of certain groups.

This joint police operation, known as \"Mos Maiorum\", is underway from 13 to 26 October 2014. It is the latest in a long line of similar initiatives, in fact the sixth operation of its kind, organised by successive presidencies, since operation Hermes, under the Belgian Presidency, took place in October 2010. Mos Maiorum was prepared on the basis of the guidelines contained in the 2010 Joint Police Operations Guide. The aim of the guide was to implement the Stockholm Programme which, as you know, was partly intended to improve security within the European Union and to combat organised crime. The main objective of 'Mos Maiorum' is to gather information from participating Member States and schengen associated countries in order to weaken the capacity of organised crime to facilitate illegal immigration to the European Union. 'Mos Maiorum' aims to identify the modus operandi used by criminal networks to illegally bring their victims into EU territory and to identify the link between the illegal crossing of the Eu ropean Union's external borders and illegal migration within the Schengen area. These objectives can best be achieved through the exchange of relevant data at EU level and the introduction of a more efficient and comprehensive information sharing model. The implementation of this joint operation does not imply, for the participating States, any deviation from any aspect of the EU acquis with regard to migration flows and the guarantees it provides to the persons concerned. Similarly, the operation has no negative effect on the reception capacity of Italy or any other participating State. In addition, the rules of conduct of the operation clearly provide for all relevant activities to be carried out with full respect for human dignity and human rights, with due particular attention to vulnerable groups. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this brief presentation has helped to clarify the context of the operation, which aims to dismantle illegal criminal networks that seek economic profit by putting the lives of innocent people at risk.

Europe is, from its origins, a defence of the rule of law and it must remain so. Immigration must be a matter of state regardless of ideologies or governments. The 'Mos Maiorum' operation, coordinated by the Italian Ministry of the Interior and in which all Member States and Schengen partners can voluntarily participate, must pursue a few objectives to which the Presidency of the Council has already referred, but essentially identify, prosecute and disarm organised crime groups; detect irregular immigrants and gather relevant information for research and intelligence purposes; give a clear and up-to-date picture of the situation in relation to human trafficking operations, its modus operandi, the main trends and possible changes they may undergo, as well as developing joint measures to achieve an impact on irregular immigration, especially on its side of border controls and border surveillance activities. In my view, \"Mos Maiorum\" should not be understood ely as persecution or as a massive raid of irregular immigrants, but as a real persecution against mafias dealing human beings. Applicable protocols and actions must be produced regardless of the political moment and with a continuity that guarantees its success. This continuity in border control policy can be reflected in the fact that the template to be used by Italians to report on the operational results achieved is similar, if not the same, to that already used in previous operations: the Belgian one, in October 2010; Hungarian \"Mitras\", in April 2011; Denmark's \"Balder\" in April 2012; \"Aphrodite\" and \"Perkunas\" of Cyprus in October 2013. All these operations have, of course, been involved in respect for human rights. Europe is a territory in which the rule of law must govern. We must worry about preventing deaths and abuses at our borders and, in turn, facilitating the entry and legal defense of those who need our protection.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Two weeks ago, a description of the mos e-mail operation \"Mos Maiorum\" was published. The debate on this has been very controversial ever since. Of course, we need police cooperation at European level, and we must also combat smuggling gangs. There are similar actions such as 'Mos Maiorum', as we have heard, regularly under the various presidencies, albeit under different names. However, it is not acceptable for police cooperation to remain our only response to the current refugee dramas – but the impression is once again created. I would like to see more political ambition on the part of the Member States and, above all, a clear commitment to human rights, to the right of asylum, rather than always referring unilaterally to problems. We must observe how 'Mos Maiorum' is implemented in the individual Member States. It is unacceptable that migrants should be stigmatised, criminalised or even traumatised by police. Just last week, we saw police brutally beat up an immigrant on the Spanish border with Melilla. We could not be sure whether he died. In view of the current challenges, we must also once again address the issue of the distribution of asylum seekers in the EU. After all, 'Mos Maiorum' is not just about combating organised crime, it is also about recording so-called secondary migration movements – in other words, specifically asylum seekers who do not apply in the country of arrival, as Dublin actually provides. My own country, Germany, has complained regularly recently that other Member States are not taking their task seriously and would just forward refugees to the north. However, if we now conclude that Dublin III is overburdening the states at the external borders, then we must also come to the conclusion that Dublin is not an adequate response to the challenges. We must distribute vulnerable people fairly in Europe. To do this, we need a distribution key, for example based on the size and economic strength of a Member State, in order to clarify how many asylum seekers each state receives. In the medium and long term, however, we must also find other answers. We need safe routes to Europe, because those that are supposedly illegal are only illegal, because there are hardly any legal ways for refugees to reach European borders, European states at all. We certainly need other legal immigration opportunities for those who are not persecuted but want to work with us.

I have read justifications for the secrecy surrounding this operation; many of them sound logical enough, but we are in an elected assembly with co-decision powers and a role in the appointment of the directors and allocation of the budgets of European agencies. When operations are undertaken in a way which is secret from this Parliament, then the obvious conclusion is that something is wrong. The most essential element of any immigration policy is trust by the people of Europe. I believe in a fair but firm immigration system, but I also believe in one which follows the rules, where correct rights are applied and procedures are followed.

This sounds very good, and of course these criminal networks should be stopped! But chasing undocumented people is tackling the problem at the wrong end. As a result, it is the undocumented refugee, or migrant seeking a job, rather than the criminal networks that are in trouble. Simply because the criminal networks and traffickers exist and operate in the Middle East and North Africa, and thus they are outside the field of operation and the scope of Mos Maiorum.  For many people, as Mr Sippel has said, it is that the traffickers are the only desperate opportunity for people to come to Europe, because there are no legal means. Instead of investing in massive deportations of undocumented people, we must now do more to strengthen the legal ways of coming to europe, such as labour migrants, students, researchers, or workers. We must also take our asylum responsibilities seriously. If you eliminate the business idea of people smugglers and instead create legal and safe roads, then we will succeed. But then we need to harmonise rules and simplify the rules so that we can welcome overseas workers in a dignified way.

Smuggling networks and organised crime are identified much more effectively in other ways. There is already a developed cooperation for this. Mr Maiorum is a wrong priority, and it shows that we have a fundamental problem. The problem is racism, xenophobia and nationalism.

The people of Europe want a Mare Nostrum plus, and words are no longer enough. We must move from words to deeds. We will have legal ways to get into Europe.

They certainly don't find really dangerous people, criminals, organised criminals.

The irregular migration phenomenon to Europe is also fuelled by the absence of legal channels of entry and by the Dublin Regulation, which imposes too heavy a burden on countries that are subject to the migration emergency more than others.  The Dublin system induces asylum seekers to rely on illegal networks to reach the desired European destinations, even when they would be eligible for international protection in any Member State, since they cannot choose the country to apply for international protection. Almost semi-colonial exploitation and war industries that contribute directly or indirectly to conflicts and miseries, do the rest.  Border and entry states in Europe, such as Italy or Greece, are facing a structural emergency that requires a huge waste of resources and which, we repeat, cannot be curbed by an exceptional police operation such as 'Mos Maiorum'.  It is, moreover, an operation that risks unwittingly fuelling the business of immigrant reception and detention centres, which are increasingly at the centre of organised crime interests and unscrupulous businessmen. This is, I would like to stress, a business on which attention must be paid, not least because it feeds on the skin of human beings, migrants, who often risk falling victim to violations of their fundamental rights. In short, 'Mos Maiorum', in our opinion, is in danger of being a mere media operation, made up of numbers and statistics to be fed to the public, which will not help to solve the problems of irregular immigration and whose costs will, once again, be a cost to the taxpayers of the Member States. I would therefore like to ask whether the Council really believes that an identification and registration operation can contribute to the fight against trafficking in human beings?

It is right to identify those who have entered Europe illegally, but are not mentioned here in the 'Mos Maiorum' programme specifically either the methods or the means, and therefore how this action will take place? Very difficult, very problematic. I'd say it's pure propaganda. It is grotesque that the European Union, having opened its doors to anyone, to mass immigration, should now present us with a police control programme when hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants have entered. Because we are not going to tell the citizens: that through Mare Nostrum at least 70,000 of the 140,000 who have entered the last year have not been traced. We do not know who they are, where they come from, what their criminal records are and also the hygiene and health conditions, in the midst of the Ebola tragedy, which should also worry us about the conditions of those who have entered, even the illegals themselves. Italy therefore proposes a 10-day program when every day they come in and out and we do not know who they are.

And to put Ebola and refugees in one mouth is simply outrageous to me. (Applause) I am so outraged that I have to let my anger go a little bit. There are political differences of opinion here on factual issues, but this is simply real racism, and in pure nature. We do not want to hear that in this Parliament, nor do we want to see it. I believe that measures such as 'Mos Maiorum' are necessary.

I know that border guards and also police authorities have an extremely difficult task in fulfilling their mandate in the fight against organised crime, since the traffickers have a great deal of financial resources and excellent logistics, and do not shy away from any crime in order to obtain financial and criminal advantages for themselves through trafficking in people. That is why such measures are necessary, even if we would prefer them not to be carried out. However, I would also be equally pleased if, in the context of the fact that we want to better manage refugee flows and not hand them over to organised crime, we would agree as quickly as possible on the possibilities of improved governance, including through legal means, in order to potentially support, in addition to the vehement fight against organised crime, which, as I have said, I support 100% of the risk of organised crime. , also to take away substance, so to speak, by reinforcing legal channels by resettlement and by other methods.

This is a well-established practice, as we have just heard, in an attempt to monitor, collect and analyse information on migratory movements with the ultimate aim of combating traffickers. I do not want to dwell very much on this, but I would rather stress my concerns about the very reason why the Eu ropean Union is taking measures such as 'Mos Maiorum', a deployment of 18 000 law enforcement officers, a gigantic police operation aimed at stopping, controlling , – I insist – and identifying the largest number of migrants present on European territory. But there is a real need for such a deployment for a fight against traffickers that happens once in a while \"every time\". The risk of these operations being carried out by a presumption of guilt or the danger of migrants is high, as are the risks of weakening the fundamental principle of the free movement of persons within the Schengen area. The external borders of the European Union are the responsibility of all its Member States, in application of the principle of solidarity and the protection of asylum seekers here on the basis of values shared by us cannot be the responsibility of individual governments. We will evaluate and ask for a careful assessment of the results of this operation, and in this regard I call on the Council to present them and share them with this Parliament.

That is all very well, but migrants stream in from Africa, the Middle East and beyond for a variety of reasons: poverty, oppression and most lately the result of some Islamic countries descending into a form of fundamentalist barbarism. These varied causes need a concerted and coherent foreign policy response by the countries of NATO and the West if we are to do anything to alleviate them.  One of the main reasons that migrants flood to Europe from all corners of the world is the EU’s open borders policy, because once in one European country it is easy for them to make their way to their European country of choice, and in many cases the migrants’ country of choice is the United Kingdom. We only have to look at the chaos and anarchy in Calais where thousands of illegal immigrants daily fight to gain entry to Britain after having travelled across Europe to do so.  We need genuine cooperation among nation states to address the root causes of mass migration and to police our borders, but while we still have an open borders policy in Europe these efforts will be in vain.

The European Union facilitates people smugglers and thus life-threatening crossings in rickety boats because Frontex does not act as border security but as a shuttle service.

It is not to fight migrants. We are facing very sophisticated, natural organised crime that exploits migrants and brings them to Europe under inhumane conditions. Therefore, I support cross-border cooperation of our security forces to combat the slave trade of our time. Why? Because it operates across borders. We cannot on the one hand be outraged that people are dying in the Mediterranean and on the other hand criticise Europe when we start operations to fight the traffickers.  Of course border police need to check the borders, the external borders of the European Union, and of course we need to interview the migrants too, because they might have relevant information to combat the perpetrators, to identify them – the roots, the methods, how they are paid.  What is important for me is that these police operations are conducted in full respect of fundamental rights and in accordance with EU and international law. Migrants should not be pushed back, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement. They should be given the possibility of applying for asylum if they think they need international protection. Children especially should be interviewed by someone trained in children’s rights, without a uniform and in a language that they can understand. Police need to share information with each other, because otherwise they will not be able to be effective in combating international crimes. But they should fully respect data protection rules.  Any act of discrimination based on nationality or ethnicity is in violation of European values and laws and it should be treated as such by the Member States. But we cannot put everything in the same box. This is not about migration policy. We have a dramatic humanitarian situation. We need to implement the Asylum Package, we need to have sharing of responsibility among the Member States, we need to create more legal ways to the European Union. But this goes hand in hand with combating organised crime.  I also think, as my colleague Mr Kirkhope and others have said, that full transparency is necessary in this operation, and democratic control.

What we know, however, is rather worrying, starting from the name, \"Mos Maiorum\", which evokes the idea of superiority, of the Roman virtus to be affixed to those who come from outside, to the breeds considered inferior. As soon as we heard about the operation, we proposed a question to the Council with some colleagues asking for clarity: clarity on the objectives and how this operation will be carried out, which appears to involve some 18 000 policemen. It is not clear, and this is what I am asking you to report back to Parliament, what frontex's involvement will be and what confusion has been made of it. It is unclear what will happen to the people identified and questioned shortly afterwards. It is not clear what guarantees there are on respect for their fundamental rights, including asylum seekers. It is an operation that seems to be the result of the usual seuritarian logic that in recent years has not only failed to achieve anything, but has made the situation worse, often result in open violations of human rights and the prohibition of collective refoulement enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union and other conventions. A logic that tends to criminalise victims rather than target executioners. We must not forget that the majority of people travelling to Europe are now fleeing war theatres, torture and discrimination of all kinds, and that it is international law that establishes our legal duty, not just our moral duty, to offer international protection. In Europe, with 'Mos Maiorum' we have unclear police operations in common, in Europe we have a cemetery in common: to this has now been reduced our Mediterranean Sea, which is a European sea. But how long will we have to wait to have a genuine European asylum policy in common? And to see Europe focus not only on combating illegal immigration, as it has done so far, but also on creating legal access routes? There is only one way to combat traffickers and organised crime, certainly not to round up migrants in Europe and certainly not to set back the line of intervention as will happen with Triton from 172 miles just 30 miles from Italian territorial waters, if mare Nostrum is renounced. The only way to combat traffickers is to prevent migrants from ending up in their hands, anticipating our intervention, for example by opening humanitarian channels for legal and refugee-protected arrival, or at least safe havens in which to seek asylum in transit countries with the involvement of international organisations. And if we really want to tackle the root of the problem, Europe should take on a ruthless fight against inequality on a global scale, in a world where 70% of resources are in the hands of 30% of the population and we are part of that 30%, I wonder how we can be surprised at migratory flows.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 845, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Anders Primdahl VISTISEN", "mepid": "124875", "text": "    Madam President!

I say this because by demonizing a new business, I believe that we do not serve its purpose unless we have arguments to criticize with evidence and evidence.

An operation in which the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, not all, agree to put in place an identification which points more to victims of the illicit trafficking of persons than to the mafias behind them and therefore nothing should be objected to because, in principle, it is a legitimate operation of the Council within its competences.  It happens, however, that it causes concern, and for good reasons. Firstly, because the Socialists have been invariably denouncing the prejudged and sesaad view that is being applied on immigration from the Council of the European Union with regard to everything concerning the control of the Union's external borders.  Secondly, because, once again, the person trying to access the Union's external borders is targeted as a propitious victim, not the mafias they are dealing with their desperation.  But thirdly, and fundamentally, because no gate is being left open to regular immigration and, therefore, irregular immigration, which is stigmatized as illegal immigration, is being criminalized.  Above all, we are concerned about the potential threat to fundamental rights posed by the profiling of the racial or ethnic origin of asylum seekers or access to the Union's external borders and, of course, we are concerned that this also has an impact on some particularly vulnerable borders, as is clearly the case with the borders of Southern Europe.  This is the case, why not say it, of my country, of Spain. We have recently met in Melilla some episodes that produce a lot of concern.

It is precisely because of the importance of these objectives that we must avoid the risk that these operations will end up harming, above all, those, often minors, who have not yet formalised their asylum applications and therefore the victims rather than those responsible for trafficking in persons.

The Council considers that the conduct of 'Mos Maiorum' contributes to the objective of greater security within the European Union, through strictly proportionate and necessary means, without compromising the protection of third-country nationals concerned. The implementation of Operation Mare Nostrum, and I say this also as a member of the Italian Government, among other activities clearly demonstrates Italy's attitude towards those who seek to reach its borders and was an operation on which we have received a great deal of criticism for its effectiveness in terms of saved human lives and for any kind of attraction that this could have had.  I would like to specify that it is made clear in the rules of conduct of the operation that no person concerned will be subject to discriminatory treatment on grounds such as sex, race, ethnic or social origin, or religious origin. The collection of information about the persons concerned or their nationality, gender and age is not associated with the identity of the person. The operational instructions of \"Mos Maiorum\" expressly stress that no personal data must be included in the relevant forms and if this happens such data would not be processed by the Italian authorities and recall that in the cases that arise the criteria of the relevant case law of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will certainly be used in strict compliance. The Presidency is also convinced that operation \"Mos Maiorum\" will contribute, as in the case of similar previous operations, to providing the necessary information for operations aimed at dismantling criminal networks that endanger the lives and well-being of so many people every day.

Parliament, however, postponed the discharge for the director of BEREC, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. The problem with BEREC last spring was not one major thing, but several smaller issues that when taken together showed significant shortcomings in the office’s administrative culture. Budgetary planning, recruitment, internal controls and procurement were all issues that Parliament demanded be addressed.  The key arguments for postponing the granting of the discharge until now were the following: the committed appropriations carried over did not correspond to legal commitments; and difficulties in the planning and/or implementation of the body’s activities, as the carryovers for 2012 were mostly related to delayed recruitment and the absence of an effective policy to ensure the timely presentation and reimbursement of mission costs.  There was considerable room for improvement regarding the preparation, execution and documentation of procurement procedures. Recruitment procedures examined showed significant shortcomings and a number of outstanding issues as regards the internal controls were also found. But since April, the BEREC office got a new administrative manager and during the summer the agency took action to solve the remaining problems. The Court of Auditors evaluated the measures taken in its report published during the summer. Normally the Court reports would only be available in September, but since BEREC specifically requested early publication the report was published in July. I can tell you that it was very positive reading. Most of the issues were addressed and have been solved. In fact out of the 13 comments that the European Court of Auditors had in both, four of them in 2011 and nine in 2012, 10 have been completed, one is partly completed and two are ongoing. In the case of the two issues that are still ongoing, the office has taken measures and the Court points out that there is significant improvement in both areas, so we can expect swift correction to this as well.

We will close the process for almost a year in tomorrow's vote by refusing to give the Council's final report for the fourth year in a row if we accept my proposal from the presenter and the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control. My new fellow Members may not know this, but the rejection of the Council discharge is nothing new, as the European Parliament has refused to grant the Council discharge for the previous three years. This decision was taken essentially in the commission and in plenary because the Council refused to cooperate with Parliament during the discharge procedure.  The European Council does not attend the commission hearing on the grounds of a gentlemen's agreement reached in the 1970s and refuses to cooperate with the relevant commission. The fundamental problem is that the Council does not recognise that Parliament has the right to conduct the closures against it, as it does for all other EU institutions, even though this right of Parliament has been certified several times. Most recently, in a letter of 23 January 2014, the European Commission clearly stated that all institutions are subject to the closure procedure in the same way, and this of course also applies to the Council.  Our commission requested information on a number of issues in question, but the Council did not provide Parliament with the necessary documents on any of the following matters, so we were unable to carry out the discharge procedure on its merits. Serious shortcomings can be heard in relation to the council's so-called 'Building of Europe'. The building in Schuman Square has been built since 2008. Despite repeated requests from the commission, the Council did not provide information on the costs of the project so far, as well as on the total amount of the investment and how it was funded. The construction is linked to the purchase and demolition of the so-called 'Résidence Palace' building, which was previously partly located on the same site, and the council office also refused to provide information on the costs associated with it.  As far as the strategy for restructuring the Council administration is concerned, the Committee on Budgetary Control has also contacted the Council on several occasions in relation to the savings made, but to no avail. Without answers to these open questions, we cannot propose granting discharge. On this basis, my fellow Members, as a proposer, which was also supported by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is that Parliament should not grant the Council discharge for the financial year 2012.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 872, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to try to dispel some of the misunderstandings that exist between our two institutions on the issue of discharge and the budget of the Council and the European Council. First of all, I would like to stress what unites us: the European Parliament and the Council both attach great importance to the principle of sound financial management of the European institutions. But, of course, it is the Commission's budget that is in the spotlight for its political and operational dimension and value. Both Parliament and the Council want all the financial operations of all the European institutions to be properly, properly and soundly run. And both our institutions should be particularly careful to seek high quality standards in the management of their respective budget sections of the European Union. Article 319 of the Treaty clearly defines a single discharge procedure for the entire Budget of the European Union. Following the presentation of the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors, the Council approves a recommendation to Parliament for the discharge to be granted to the Commission as to the implementation of the budget. Finally, Parliament adopts this discharge decision. Parliament has also developed a practice involving the adoption of individual discharge decisions relating to the budget of the other European institutions. This is a practice which, as has already been said, is not required by the Treaty and therefore not binding. From the Council's point of view, the discharge procedure is only that relating to financial and budgetary management, and does not extend to individual initiatives or policies in general. Recently, for a number of years now, the Council has shown a major imbalance between what Parliament feels it should examine in relation to the Council's budget and what Parliament itself makes known about its management. Your report today reflects these two points that remain between our institutions, and it is on this basis that you are today called upon to vote for the fourth time on a decision refusing to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union's budget section relating to the Council and the European Council. However, I consider in all sincerity that there could be a way out of this situation. I noted with interest paragraph 21 of the draft report we are debating today, and I quote from a passage in the report: 'Parliament and the Council could make some progress by establishing together a modus vivendi procedure with a list of documents to be exchanged in order to fulfil their respective roles in the discharge process.' In fact, this solution is not very far from what the Council has proposed on several occasions in the past, for example in the draft Memorandum of Understanding sent in 2011. If Parliament is now interested in discussing a list of documents to be exchanged, we could obviously sit down and discuss openly the details of that list. Personally, I could also imagine going beyond that. Instead of a complex bilateral procedure, the Council could unilaterally make additional financial information available on the websites of Parliament and the Council. I would call this proposal a 'friendly competition' between our two institutions to make our financial management even more transparent. The Italian Presidency is ready to explore every possible solution for a modus vivendi on the discharge procedure, also in agreement with the other two presidencies of our trio: Latvia and Luxembourg. Of course, this modus vivendi should have the placet of both our institutions: Parliament and the Council. A minority of people in both our institutions would not be enough.  After these more conceptual and general comments, allow me to return for a moment to the specific discharge process for 2012, which will in principle be concluded with today's vote. I would also like to point out that the Court's audit of the 2012 implementation of the European Council and Council budget found no serious shortcomings or errors. In its annual report, the Court referred exclusively to two marginal weaknesses in the design of a procedure. In addition to this problem, the Court made no comment concerning the accounts of the European Council and the Council or the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. This is therefore a good result that you should take into account when you vote.

However, I would also like to thank the Council for the new mode that has been proposed. It sounds quite dramatic if we do not relieve us for the fourth year in a row. We do not insinuate that the money was misused to a large extent, that it was misused or that it was even defrauded. That is not what we are concerned about. No, representatives of the Council, it is a question of transparency. I find it highly unsatisfactory that, in the past, the Council has simply failed to comply with our request for information. Who can even understand how the money was used in the construction and refurbishment of the Council building and whether the tenders really got things right? After all, the Court of Auditors has also found something on the subject of calls for tenders. I think it is the job of a democratically elected Parliament, the European Parliament, to be behind. It would really be a good sign in our dealings with each other if the Council recognised this and cooperated with us on budget discharge. Yes, you are right: there is no binding obligation – not at the moment. That is why I would like to mention your offer to really implement documentation obligations in the interests of transparency, which we may then be able to impose on each other. I do not think that we in This Parliament can stubbornly stand up either. In any case, this is also the concern of my group, and we will perhaps also take back our demands on the depth of information somewhat. I believe that we owe this to the European taxpayer and to the citizen, because this is really about the sensible use, about the trustworthy use of European funds.

I believe that historically we have always complained that, at the time of the adoption of the Council's discharge, the Presidency was not here, and I also thank Mr Della Vedova for his words and his offer, which I hope we can use to improve not only relations but above all transparency. I would like to say - and thank - the two rapporteurs, Mr Sarvamaa and Mr Deutsch, who presented us here today with two examples of how Parliament controls and controls the budget and also protects the financial resources of the European Union. In the first case, the case of ORECE, the Agency for European Regulators for Electronic Communications, has identified not major problems , as Mr Sarvamaa has said very well , but small ones which, as a whole, generated an impression of not good management and, above all, that could lead to the growth of greater problems. I think it has been done very well, in frank dialogue with the Court of Auditors, with the Commission and with the managers of BEECE, to improve public procurement, the selection of staff, the prevention and management of conflicts and, above all, greater visibility as a body of the European Union, something that is also of interest to THE ORECE and which , precisely, I understand — and I congratulate Mr Sarvamaa on his good management and the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the ORECE managers themselves, has been improved. A good practice of how with small steps and with good dialogue you can improve transparency. On the opposite side, a bad practice of the Council, which continues to be used not to recognise the democratic and healthy right for the European Parliament to audit the accounts, especially in areas where, it is true, no illegality has been raised, and we recognise this, but there are small mistakes pointed out by the Court of Auditors in proceedings or in conception regarding public procurement and building policy. These are small things, but just as THE ORECE has achieved a great step in terms of transparency, in the case of the Council it would also be expected.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their work and then complimenting the Italian Presidency. The fact that you are here this evening is a positive signal. In my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Budgetary Control has organised a hearing on the legal position of the European Parliament in the context of the Council's discharge. And if we look into the Treaties, it is clearly stipulated that in the budget discharge procedure the Council makes a recommendation, but the discharge is clearly located in the European Parliament, the directly elected Members. This is not reciprocity, it is an asymmetry. And how the European Parliament, under its own competence, designs the discharge procedure, how we divide it up, how we discuss it, is clearly the competence of the European Parliament. That is why I do not understand the Council's reservations about another discharge procedure, nor do I understand why the Presidency and the Council do not pass on the information requested to Parliament. As the rapporteur, Mr German, has pointed out that the gentlemen's agreement, if it did exist at all, dates back to a time when the European Parliament was not directly elected. We have had very different circumstances since 1979. We have had the Treaty of Lisbon since 2009 with a clear strengthening of the European Parliament, and in the light of this, I would like to appeal to the Council: please get involved in a sensible, proper discharge procedure! It is not acceptable for ministerial officials to want to control the European Parliament's budget. On the contrary, every public expenditure by the taxpayer must be controlled by directly elected Members, by democratically legitimised representatives, including the Council budget and the Council budget.

I was president of the Slovenian Court of Auditors for nine years, and when I read my colleague Deutsch's excellent report, I could not believe my eyes, and I was really surprised.  The Council therefore refuses to cooperate with Parliament on its discharge, refuses to explain how it spends taxpayers' money and builds many buildings, a huge lyoh building that is thought to have already cost EUR 330 million by now. However, it does not give any precise breakdown of the final or actual costs, and the question is whether the Council should not also be a model for financial transparency and the first in openness, an example to all other institutions in sound financial management and accountability, not only of course To Parliament, but also to the general public. And what's in that building, in that egg, of course, the windows on all sides, and we're still wandering in the dark about the clarity of the costs that have been spent.  I understand what we have heard before, that this story is long and complicated and that this old gentleman's agreement is behind it, but of course it has to be said that the world has changed tremendously since then, at least the expectations of financial accountability and transparency are much greater and the public is also, of course, demanding maximum transparency.  The central institutions of the European Union, however, must set an example for others and make every effort to be credible in the eyes of taxpayers and voters. And therefore, of course, as long as that is the case and as long as the Council does so, all of our group will vote against granting discharge to the Council for the financial year 2012, as well as next year and a year after, if the Council does not change its tactics, and here I think That Italy has a historic opportunity to take a step forward.

I have been here for a few months and I learn that for the sixth year running the European Parliament has proposed in the first instance that discharge be postponed for the Council's budget. Basically, the Council does not recognise Parliament's role as the ultimate discharge representative and has set in fore a whole process with various rapporteurs or legal experts to try to understand who is right between the parties.  I do not want to take sides openly in this power game, because I see this as an insult to the taxpayers of European citizens, who want extreme cooperation between the actors in the institutions. I believe that, as in a team, everyone must cooperate as best we can in order to achieve the maximum, and so Parliament is in a sense right to protest, not granting discharge, since the request made to the Council does not seem to me to be such utopian. Unfortunately, I note that this game between the institutional actors during each debate comes to an end. In this case and in the trialogues, it is evident that the European project is perhaps a little too ambitious and slow to move forward. On the one hand, we have the Heads of State who are highly Pro-European in the election campaign and are pushing for this to exist, for it to be standardised in a single flag, but then the unification processes encounter major problems and contrasts. Perhaps we are close as borders but we have too many economic differences, too many cultural differences that have their roots over the centuries and in history and national interests that are more or less right to defend and protect. And then there are those powers of interests, various lobbies and globalisation with its greed that so easily penetrates the hearts of those who should make politics more justly, protecting the weak and solidarity, delegated by such a high honor of representation elected by the people. In short, in this small battle of principle between Parliament and the Council, there is the reason for the failure of this institution, the too many differences and the forcing applied without taking into account the damage it causes to those who dream of a true Union of peoples from the outside, in the name of brotherhood, solidarity and sustainability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 879, "date": "2014-10-22.json", "name": "Patricija ŠULIN", "mepid": "125103", "text": "    President-in-Office, thank you for the floor. While new times are facing us, they require the prescribed approaches when certifying discharge. The transparency of our action is very important, because it is the only way to gain greater citizens' trust in the European Union.  The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have also concluded an interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters and sound financial management. The agreement is thus binding on all institutions. Now we are in front of a problem where the Court of Auditors has noted for several years in a row that the Council is not giving further answers to the Court of Auditors' recommendations. Once again, we are in front of a situation where the Council has still not informed us and prepared a written explanation on the use of budgetary resources for the purchase of the 'Residence Palace' building. Nor did it explain what the measures would be implemented during the construction of the Europe building and did not elaborate on the costs incurred so far and other financial statements in this regard. These are just some of the examples that demonstrate that the Council does not cooperate and does not take into account the opinions and requests of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament. Because of this situation, we are not giving the citizens of the Union a good signal.

We have a duty to establish all the facts that are relevant for the adoption of the correct discharge decision, so before doing so, we must determine with the same care whether the Council is really using the funds properly, and the Council must give us real, correct and complete information. However, the Council is not involved in this. It seems that we do not have the right instruments in our hands to encourage the Council to cooperate, to present and explain everything we ask for.

I believe that this must be noted: inaccuracies in budget monitoring, the need for improvement in the preparation, implementation and documentation of procurement procedures, a lack of information on conflict-of-interest policy, a lack of transparency in financial statements, etc. BEREC has, of course, been given the opportunity to comment on all these allegations. That is what they have done, and we received an Office report in July, and it shows that most of these allegations have been rectified and that there will be improvements here in the future.

The European Union agencies have an extremely important role to play. They impact directly on the daily lives of our citizens and they perform important tasks. They perform technical, scientific and supervisory tasks helping the Union institutions.  But even more important, from the budgetary control perspective, is that these agencies, which now number over thirty, function properly and efficiently. In order for this to happen the agencies should seek and deploy best practices. The combined budgetary impact of the decentralised EU agencies is almost EUR 1 billion per year. So the efficient and prudent operation of these agencies is not irrelevant at all to EU taxpayers.  And it is not just budgetary discipline and solid planning that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control are interested in. It is about potential conflicts of interest; it is about procurement and contract management; it is about lack of transparency and rigour in recruitment. It is also about excessively high carry-overs and troubles in verifying grant transactions. To sum it up, this is about looking after the EU taxpayers’ money, seeing too that our common resources are used wisely. It is all this that makes the discharge process really important for all of us. And it is that which makes me so happy tonight to conclude this debate on my behalf by noting that this particular agency, BEREC, now deserves our discharge.

First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support, for their valuable thoughts now in terms of what has been said in plenary and for the joint work they have done in the budget committee in the past. I think that I am convinced that the current state of play, the fact that the two fundamental institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council, the European Council, cannot agree on the procedure for the closure procedure, is a poverty certificate for both institutions and, as we often say, is a very bad message to European citizens. Moving the current state out of this deadlock is the start of a dialogue and the development of an agreement that can finally resolve this situation, which I think is one of the most important tasks for us MEPs in the parliamentary term ahead.  As Mr Liberadzki said, there have been several proposals from Council representatives that give us confidence, and we still regard his proposal at today's meeting of the Italian Presidency as such, the credibility of which will be given by the substantive negotiations in the weeks and months ahead and, hopefully, by the agreement.

There is a need to continue the pressure on the Agency to further improve the areas criticised (financial transfers, low transparency, high conflict of interest). On the contrary, the Council is the least transparent body that consistently refuses to cooperate with Parliament.
