One month later and Christmas has come early. I am here to deliver on my promise. I am doing it here at the European Parliament because this is the institutional place where important events have to happen. Today Europe is turning a page. After years of fighting to restore our fiscal credibility and to promote reform, today we are adding the third point of a virtuous triangle: an ambitious yet realistic investment plan for Europe. Europe needs a kick-start, and today the Commission is applying the jump leads. Investing in Europe means much more than figures, projects, money and rules. It is about people – mainly about those amongst our citizens who are unemployed. We need to send a message to the people of Europe and to the rest of the world: Europe is back in business. This is not the moment to look back. Investment is about the future. Of course, we should never neglect the sacrifices that many in Europe have made over the past six years to overcome the crisis, nor should we stop the push to bring down barriers, open up markets and reform what does not work in our economies. These are necessary but not sufficient conditions for growth. Yes, we need structural reforms to modernise and preserve our social market economy. Yes, we need fiscal responsibility to restore confidence and the sustainability of our public finances and to complete this virtuous omne trium perfectum we now need to boost investment. No tree can grow on soil and air alone. The investment plan we are presenting today is the watering can. For the first time, the Commission is presenting all three components of Europe’s future economic success together – not pitched one against the other but grouped in one single simple message, namely that Europe can offer hope both to its future generations and to the rest of the world as a promising, attractive hub for jobs, growth and investment. Why are we doing this? First, because not only are we faced with a serious investment gap but we are caught in an investment trap. When we talk to investors, they all agree that Europe is an attractive place to invest in. But when I look at the figures, they tell a totally different story. Investment levels in the European Union are down to EUR 370 billion below the historical pre-crisis norms. While investment is taking off in the US, Europe is lagging behind. Why? Because investors lack confidence, credibility and trust. Secondly, because we are confronted with a major paradox. Despite the huge liquidity in the world’s money markets and corporate bank accounts, investment in Europe is not rebounding. Thirdly, because our public resources are stretched – our debt levels have increased from 60% of our GDP to 90% in the space of just a few years. Public expenditure already represents close to 50% of the European Union’s GDP. What we need is a smart use of public money geared to unlocking investment. Public expenditure should be used for what it is best at doing: funding our schools and welfare systems, not servicing our debt. Today we are responding to these European pathologies and keeping our eye on the one ball that matters: the real economy. This is not the time for national, political or ideological fights. It is the time for a major political and social consensus, a grand bargain to put Europe back to work. I often hear that we need ‘fresh’ money, but what I believe we really need is a fresh start and fresh investment. Others say that we need more debt. We do not. National budgets are already stretched. The European Union operates on balanced budgets, and the abundant liquidity can allow Europe to grow without creating new debt. We will not betray our children and grandchildren and write more cheques that they will ultimately have to pay off. We will not betray the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact that we have agreed jointly. This is a matter of credibility. However, if Member States chip in capital to the Fund, we will not take these contributions into account in our assessments under the Stability Pact. What we are going to do is set up the right system that will use available public money to leverage additional capital that will never otherwise be mobilised. Every public euro mobilised can generate additional investment that would not have happened otherwise, and it can create jobs. We will need to look carefully at projects. Destinations for the fresh investment drive should be attractive, free of regulatory burdens and linked to economic reality, not political expedience. Let me be clear about one thing: the money we are putting forward today comes on top of what already exists. It comes on top of the EUR 630 billion that is about to be unlocked from the structural and investment funds at national and regional level. It comes on top of what the European Investment Bank has already been able to do so far. After the capital increase of EUR 10 billion, the European Investment Bank was shipping EUR 180 billion to the real economy. It comes on top of all the existing programmes which are already investing in infrastructure, innovation and European small and medium-sized enterprises. Perhaps most importantly, it comes on top of what Member States can do to help themselves, for Member States must also support the investment environment through better use of public money and a greater commitment to structural reforms. Let me explain my vision for where this money should go. I have a vision of schoolchildren in Thessaloniki walking into a brand new classroom decked out with computers. I have a vision of European hospitals saving lives with state-of-the-art medical equipment. I have a vision of a French commuter being able to charge his electric car along the motorway in the same way we fill up with petrol today. Households and companies want to benefit from technological progress and are crying out for action to become more energy-efficient. Our energy sector needs to interconnect networks and markets, integrate renewable sources of energy, and diversify our sources of supply. Our transport sector has to modernise its infrastructure, reduce congestion and improve trade connections. Our environment needs better waste, recycling and water treatment facilities. We need far-reaching and faster broadband and smarter data centres across Europe, and we need to invest in our education and innovation systems that are often underfunded and less equipped than those of our key competitors. Investing in people – that is what the social market economy is about. The needs we are facing are vast. This is the challenge of a generation. Europe will have to face it head-on. How is this going to work? Money will not fall from the sky. We do not have a money-printing machine. We will have to attract money and make it work for us. Today we are setting up the new architecture which will make this possible. The key is to provide a risk-bearing capacity that can unlock additional investment. Our plan is built on three main pillars. First, we are creating a new European Fund for Strategic Investments, guaranteed with public money from the EU budget and the European Investment Bank. The Fund will be able to mobilise EUR 315 billion over the next few years, and yet some say this is not enough. I have to remind you that this is the greatest effort in recent EU history to mobilise the EU budget to trigger additional investment – and without changing the rules. I know some of you are worried about the impact on the research and infrastructure allocations. You fear that redirecting money from the Horizon 2020 and Connecting Europe budget lines will mean that money is lost. But this is not the case. Every euro from this programme paid into the Fund creates EUR 15 for those very same research and infrastructure projects. We are not just moving money around; we are maximising its input. If Member States step up to the plate and contribute to the Fund, then the knock-on effect of this significant amount will be even bigger. Herr Präsident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Die zweite Komponente unseres Programms ist folgende: Wir schaffen eine glaubwürdige Projektpipeline, flankiert von einem Programm für technische Hilfe, um die Investitionen in ausgereifte, wachstumsfördernde Projekte von europäischer Bedeutung zu lenken. Es ist nicht der Job von Politikern, Projekte auszuwählen. Wir sollten bescheidener sein. Es ist die Aufgabe der Fachleute, die über die notwendige Erfahrung und das einschlägige Know how verfügen, dies zu tun. Dem Fonds wird ein Investitionsausschuss aus Experten zur Seite stehen, der jedes Projekt aus wirtschaftlicher und gesellschaftlicher Perspektive bewertet und prüft, welchen Mehrwert es für die Europäische Union hat. Die dritte Komponente unseres Programms ist ein ehrgeiziger Fahrplan, mit dem wir Europa für Investoren attraktiver machen wollen. Dazu werden wir – dies ist existenziell wichtig – Bürokratie abbauen und regulatorische Engpässe beseitigen. Es geht nämlich nicht nur um die finanzielle Ebene. Es geht auch und vor allem um die richtigen Rahmenbedingungen auf der Regulierungsebene. Die Europäische Investitionsbank hat in den letzten Jahren exzellente Arbeit geleistet, und ich bin froh, sie als zentralen Akteur und Partner in diese neuen Investitionsprogramme einbinden zu können. Das Triple-A der Bank, die übrigens nicht risikoscheu ist, ist eine europäische Trumpfkarte, die wir jetzt noch besser für Europa einsetzen werden. Ohne die Europäische Investitionsbank wäre es nicht zu diesem Investitionsprogramm gekommen. Ich möchte mich bei dem Präsidenten der Bank, Werner Hoyer, sehr herzlich bedanken für eine vorzügliche Zusammenarbeit in den letzten Wochen, ich müsste eigentlich sagen Monaten. Die Kommission ist erst seit drei Wochen im Amt. Wir sind in der Lage, heute das Investitionsprogramm vorzustellen. Aber Werner Hoyer und ich haben uns schon im Juli – schon vor meiner Wahl zum Kommissionspräsidenten – intensiv in dieser Sache ausgetauscht, und ich bin ihm zu großem Dank verpflichtet und im Übrigen auch froh, dass er mit der Erlaubnis des Herrn Präsidenten dieser Sitzung des Plenums beiwohnen kann. Wir haben, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, noch einige wichtige Schritte vor uns, die wir aber sofort angehen müssen, denn wir stehen erst am Anfang. Deshalb möchte ich heute einen Appell an alle richten, die Europa wieder auf einen Pfad kräftigen Wachstums zurückführen wollen. Die Mitgliedstaaten sollten dem Fonds beitreten und damit seine Leistungsfähigkeit weiter verstärken. Auch die Mitgliedstaaten haben Pflichten zu erfüllen, wenn es um die Wiederankurbelung der Investitionen in der Europäischen Union geht. Jeder für diesen Fonds bereitgestellte Euro aus öffentlichen Mitteln kann 15 Euro an Investitionen mobilisieren. Im Gegenzug verspreche ich Ihnen, dass diese Kapitalbeiträge an den Fonds bei der Überprüfung der öffentlichen Haushalte auf der Grundlage des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts nicht eingerechnet werden. Wieso sollten Mitgliedstaaten einzahlen, wenn sie nicht mit Sicherheit vorausberechnen können, welche Rückflüsse es in ihr Land gibt? Das ist ganz einfach: Mehr Wachstum in Spanien ist gut für mehr Wachstum in Frankreich. Mehr Wachstum in Frankreich ist gut für mehr Wachstum in Italien. Mehr Wachstum in Südeuropa ist gut für das Wachstum in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Man sollte endlich zur Kenntnis nehmen, dass wir eine Schicksalsgemeinschaft sind, und das impliziert Solidarität mit allen und allen gegenüber. Bei dem anvisierten Investitionsvolumen von 315 Milliarden Euro handelt es sich nicht um eine Obergrenze. Wenn sich der Fonds bewährt – und das wird er, da bin ich mir sicher –, dann können wir sogar darüber hinausgehen. Wir brauchen sowohl im Europäischen Parlament als auch im Europäischen Rat die breitestmögliche Unterstützung für dieses Investitionsprogramm, seinen Inhalt, seinen Aufbau, seine Ziele. Wir brauchen in Europa eine Koalition der Investitionswilligen. Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, je compte notamment sur l'engagement de cette Assemblée pour accélérer l'adoption de la législation nécessaire à la mise en place du fonds. J'inviterai mes collègues au Conseil européen à prendre le même engagement. Nous devons rendre le fonds opérationnel d'ici au mois de juin de l'année prochaine afin qu'il puisse commencer à produire des résultats.  Le Parlement européen, lui, est un partenaire essentiel pour aider l'Europe à renouer avec la croissance. Nous, la Commission, nous serons responsables devant vous. Des représentants de haut niveau de ces nouveaux fonds devront régulièrement vous rendre compte des activités du fonds. Je veillerai également à ce que les vice-présidents et les membres de la Commission chargés des différents domaines d'activité du fonds ainsi que des représentants de la Banque européenne d'investissement vous fassent régulièrement rapport, ainsi qu'à vos commissions compétentes. Toutefois, permettez-moi d'être très clair. Nous avons besoin d'un aval et d'un soutien politiques. Nous n'avons pas besoin d'une politisation du plan. Pas de jeu politique avec les projets, pas de liste nationale de vœux. Il s'agit d'un important test de crédibilité qui doit être convaincant pour les investisseurs privés et les marchés financiers mondiaux. Là encore, je compte sur le professionnalisme, l'expérience et l'expertise de notre Banque européenne d'investissement.  Le plan n'est pas un guichet automatique, et le fonds ne sera pas une banque. Nous avons besoin d'un mécanisme souple. Nous avons besoin d'un mécanisme qui soit simple d'utilisation pour les investisseurs et les autorités publiques, d'un mécanisme qui puisse évoluer et se développer au fil du temps, qui ne soit pas limité par la logique de cloisonnement, de pré-affectation thématique, sectorielle ou géographique, d'un mécanisme crédible qui s'appuie sur des structures établies garantissant la responsabilité, d'un mécanisme qui drainera vers les pays qui ont le plus souffert de la crise l'essentiel des investissements envisagés.  Ce que nous proposons ici ne peut se faire qu'à l'échelon de l'Union européenne. Moins d'un mois après l'entrée en fonction de ma Commission, nous prenons nos responsabilités et nous agissons. J'invite à présent les autres à faire de même et à montrer qu'ils sont, eux aussi, prêts à jouer le jeu. Je vous le dis dès aujourd'hui, si notre plan fonctionne, et il fonctionnera, il sera reconduit pour les années 2018, 2019 et 2020. Mr President, this is an investment offensive that optimises our economic policy. We are focusing on long-term, large-scale European investment to create jobs. We are also targeting small and medium-sized enterprises – Europeʼs job creators – to give a boost to the real economy. We are turning a corner, completing fiscal responsibility and structural reform with innovative investment plans and instruments. The ground-breaking investment plan, mobilising all levels of government, is the missing part of the puzzle, the third point in the virtuous triangle. The omne trium perfectum made whole. We will stand tall on three pillars: money, projects and tools to create the right business environment. We are offering hope to millions of Europeans, disillusioned after years of stagnation. Yes, Europe can still become the epicentre of a major investment drive. Yes, Europe can grow again, and yes, the European social model will persevere. Now that we are going in the right direction there will be no turning back.

Herzlichen Dank für die Ehre, heute in diesem Parlament sprechen zu dürfen und das Programm, das die Kommission vorgelegt hat, zu kommentieren. Ich sage gleich zu, das aus vollem Herzen zu unterstützen. I will propose to the governing bodies of the Bank to support the plan presented by President Juncker just a few minutes ago and to take the necessary decisions in the organs of the Bank in the next weeks and month. That, of course, will then lead to the presentation in the Council of the Finance and Economic Ministers in December and to the presentation in the European Council in December as well. We are firmly committed to tackling Europe’s investment gap head-on. At the beginning of the year, the Bank made a study on investment gaps in Europe and contributed to the awareness that, for seven years now, Europe has been behind the 2007 investment figures by at least 15% and sometimes 20%, and this is persisting. Beyond that, for almost 15 years Europe has been suffering from an innovation gap in comparison to our main competitors. Our main competitors are not within the Union, they are outside, and in comparison to some of the most advanced of them, we have been trailing for 15 years by almost 1.5% of GDP per year behind their expenditure on innovation, research and development. Therefore, it is necessary to take action, and therefore I proposed to Ecofin to first make a study of whether the allegation that investment opportunities do not exist is really true. We had a taskforce which concluded its work only a few days ago. It shows clearly that, although there might be quite a bit of wishful thinking in these lists as well, projects do exist, as do project ideas and project needs, so the question remains: why are these gaps not being filled by the private sector and by all those who can contribute to filling them? What are the hurdles to investment? They can be on the risk side - we are going to address it. They can be on the regulatory side, they can be on the legislative side, and I am very happy to hear that the Commission President is resolved to tackle these issues as well, and, of course, the question of confidence, which is decisive for any investment decision in Europe and beyond. We therefore have to put things in sequence: identification of the investment gap, identification of the reasons for these investment gaps not being filled, and then the question of the instruments we are going to use. We can look back at a history of the last seven years in the crisis. Since 2007, the EU Bank has provided more than EUR 500 billion for investment across Europe, and by the end of next year we will have delivered EUR 180 billion of new investment, following a capital increase recommended by the European Council in 2012. I was not sure in 2012, when I promised to the European Council, that we would make 18 times as much out of these EUR 10 billion, but now I can tell you that probably, when I come back next year in early December, we will have overshot this target of EUR 180 billion additional investment in Europe by far.  So what is the issue today? Before the crisis, projects were financed directly through public budgets, or the public sector would assume risks to catalyse private support. Capacity for public spending for such projects is now reduced, leading to underinvestment and jeopardising long-term competitiveness. However, in contrast to the darkest days of the sovereign debt crisis, liquidity is no longer an issue, and money is available for the safest projects. Nonetheless, some segments of the market are risk-averse – partly due to new capital and lending standards – and in many countries, SME access to finance remains a concern. By the way, this is a case where one can show that one-size-fits-all does not hold, because the access to finance for SMEs is quite differentiated in the Member States of the European Union, and we have to address it in a differentiated manner. It is essential to tackle these market failures that continue to prevent investment in higher-risk infrastructure projects. These will be addressed as part of the investment plan by the new fund which the President of the Commission has just introduced. I will propose to ECOFIN and to the European Council that the EIB contributes EUR 5 billion to the new initiative. That will come together with the EUR 16 billion coming from the EU budget, to be confirmed, of course, by Parliament and the Council. The new proposal allows the EIB to increase support for risky and more capital-intensive projects. It will be set up in the coming weeks and start to deliver in 2015 using structures already in place. This is the advantage. I am aware that you will have to take key decisions in this context, as will the Council, so it will take time until all the new structures are in place. The EU bank is ready to bridge that time gap so that we can start delivering in early 2015. To be clear: this new engagement will not impact EIB engagement outside the European Union, where the EIB is a valued source of finance and expertise, supporting projects around the world. Ten per cent of our business goes outside the European Union, and we are a very necessary and valuable partner supporting the European Union in its foreign, development, humanitarian, energy and climate policies and other areas. We believe that the proposed initiative can make a real difference to unlocking additional investment in Europe. The European Investment Bank is aware that this is not the silver bullet, but it represents the EIB’s concrete contribution to addressing Europe’s most pressing investment needs that will ensure that, once again, we can make a difference.

We have made a promise – Jean-Claude Juncker at his election and we in the election campaign – to bring citizens at the centre of the debate here in the European Parliament. That is why I would like to emphasise the idea of Jean-Claude Juncker that today we are not talking about abstract issues, but about the unemployed in Europe, we are talking about entrepreneurs who want to invest, we are talking about the people of Europe – about very practical problems. I would like to pay tribute to the Commission for the fact that the proposal for this investment pact is available within three weeks. I would also like to say thank you for the fact that the Commission is fully present again today. This shows the unity of the institution. I would also like to say explicitly that the presentation of the investment package after yesterday's decision is taking place here in the European Parliament today is a positive, a good signal. For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a number of points have been central to the debate in recent weeks. The first key point was that mobilizing private capital is better than making new debts. This basic idea has guided us over the last few weeks and months, and I am grateful for having been taken up. Better spending – better spending the money we have – must drive us around. The EIB's experience of activating private capital is extremely helpful. The EIB knows, Mr Hoyer, that there are one or two questions about the method we are now using. For example, the question of substitutes. Are projects already funded now being put into this package? That would not help, we have to be careful. And, of course, we also know that we do not want to replace private capital, that is, private investment, in top-security areas, but rather to generate new investment. That is why there are still a number of questions to be resolved there. We know that there are still a number of questions that remain unanswered in the Commission. The project decision must be in the hands of experts, and the PPE-DE supports this. But the criteria for which projects we are now tackling, the framework conditions, which we must discuss and clarify politically. As far as the Council is concerned, I would like to say that, in order to achieve this idea of mobilising private capital, I should appeal to the Council to finally make a contribution and to put an end to the deadlock in the budget discussions. We need a stable budget for 2015 in order for the plan to be implemented. These are the points that we are seeing that still need to be dealt with and that we must address now. Ladies and gentlemen! The second important point for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that money alone does not solve the problems. Jean-Claude Juncker has made this clear. Investors are coming back to Europe. If you look at the investment rates in Europe today, you can see that in Portugal, investment is being made in Ireland. We were in Latvia last week with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, where investment is also being made! Why is there an investment there today? Because structural reforms have been carried out in these countries in recent years, because they have had the courage to adapt to globalisation and to change as a society. That is why we in Europe still need the courage to implement these structural reforms when it comes to state aid law, banks, capital rules, competition law and the internal market. In the field of energy, we do not have an internal market, which is why we are not investing. We do not have an internal market in the digital sector, so we are not investing. These are our tasks in Europe, but also at national level. If legal proceedings in Italy take as long as they last, one need not be surprised if no investment is made. If the labour markets are too rigid, as in France, one need not be surprised if investment is not made. And if planning procedures take months and years, as in my country, Germany, one need not be surprised if no investment is made. That is why everyone must now play their part in structural reforms. The third point that is important to the PPE-DE in order to create a future on our continent is just a brief point i would like to make today. But it is important to us: the stability of households is the basic prerequisite for us to generate growth. If market confidence in the stability of national budgets were no longer there, if the crisis were to return, that would be the greatest damage to possible investment in Europe. That is why we need credibility. Jean-Claude Juncker presented a convincing proposal today. I ask the critics who already to express this right now, in order to take an approach of constructive criticism. Unfortunately, in Europe, we often have the problem that when someone has an idea, you put a proposal on the table, the procrastinators, the problem-atgeters, those who can describe the problems, but unfortunately you have too few on the pitch who say: this is a good proposal, and I have a better idea, I want to contribute. to add to this. I ask for this constructive criticism, for this culture of confidence, of optimism, that we need now in this area. With regard to the Council, I would like to add that if we are now discussing the debate in the run-up to the European Council in December and then perhaps comments such as 'this is too little, too little is being done', then I would also ask you to take note of Europe's commitment. With our own strength, we can manage the 315 billion. If someone at national level, from the capitals, asks for more, then he is invited to make further contributions. The project is open-minded, and anyone can put more money on the table if they want to. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which The EPP is behind the proposal by Jean-Claude Juncker and the European Commission. We want this signal of departure. We want Europe to get off to a good start. Today is a good day for Europe!

You, Mr Juncker, have chosen Parliament – and we thank you – to present an investment plan: it is a sign that the air has changed. I say this to businesses, to citizens, to investors, to commentators: beyond the technicalities, notice the change of phase. Five years ago a title, today another title: investments, growth, work. You did so in advance of your commitment. Well!  We Democratic Socialists, on the other hand, had tied our support to you and your Commission to this commitment. And I want to say this without rhetoric, but with pride: this turning point that begins today is the result of our political battle. Many things in this plan convince us. Firstly, the method: the time for agreements made indoors between governments is over. Parliament will be fully involved in this respect. It's a point of no return. We are also convinced that you want to create an investment instrument. That's what we're been asking for months. The eib's proactive role is important. We are convinced by our commitment to supporting risky investments, and this requires a public financial basis. We are not interested in the judgments of rating agencies, we are interested in the lives of citizens and we will assess the goodness of the investments promoted on the basis of the jobs created. We wrote this in our draft plan, our suggestions to Juncker: we want investments that serve, not easy investments.  Mr President, I say this in sincerity, I believe that you are on the right track today, but there is still a great deal to be done. We need clear priorities, people need to know where their money is going, and for us the priority is the energy transition. Climate change threatens the survival of our societies, and in the face of such a challenge we cannot invoke any side interests. We must act and lay the foundations for truly sustainable development. This is our mission, the mission of European civilisation: not just to be Cassandra, a prophet of doom, but to lead change.  But I also want to say that you don't waste a single second. A task force has identified priority investments and resources for these investments are immediately released. We would have liked more public resources, more basic capital. However, the initial 20 billion capital is a good place to start. We must involve and encourage the Member States to contribute to this plan, and what you have made clear is important, namely that member states' contributions are not calculated within the framework of the Pact in relation to debt and deficit. This is a very important point. That is the budgetary flexibility we need. It is a historic break, because it breaks the taboo of the rigidity of the pact. We do not want to change the rules, Mrs Weber, but we want to make them flexible, because the task of politics is to apply the rules intelligently, otherwise we could send accountants for us. We were elected as politicians, not accountants. Mr President, we look forward to the communication on flexibility. Flexibility cannot be continued in half-words, clarity must be made once and for all, and we have made the ideas very clear. We also want certain public investment in support of European projects not to be taken into account in the Stability Pact.  Mr President, some people say that this is the last chance. I do not know if this is the last chance, but I know that we must take a risk by giving a chance rather than regretting not being able to seize the opportunity that presented itself. We will support this plan, we will enrich it with our proposals and, if it goes well we ask you, as you have already announced, to extend it for a further three years. Today is the beginning, not the end of the process. Moderation in pursuing justice and fairness is never a virtue. For the children of Thessaloniki or Madrid to attend a quality school, for lisbon companies to compete in the world, for our hospitals to be at the forefront, we do not need moderation, we need a qualitative leap forward, we need courage and vision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, as Mr Juncker knows, our political group likes to look forward to the future, not back to the past, and I must say, Mr Juncker, that I like your analogy of using the watering can. How do we make sure it is a watering can that stimulates growth? How do we make sure that it is not a government flood that washes away private investment? How do we make sure it is not a private irrigation system that is never turned on? What we need are detailed answers to some of our questions, and I have talked to a number of private investors in the past and asked them what stops them from investing. I was talking to a large institutional investor last week, with over GBP 600 billion of assets under management, and they told me that quite often government projects are fanciful. They do not see any real return. How do we make sure that we have projects that are attractive to private investors? Venture capitalists tell me they do not invest, that the AIFMD and other EU legislation make the EU less attractive to investment. How do we tackle those issues? A former German industrialist was talking to me the other day and he asked why it is that the non-euro area is so much better at attracting investment than the euro area. If only the euro area was better! But as you know, it is not. What is it? Is the euro the key to that question? But the key to the package is: how do we unlock this investment? How do we make sure that this is not just talking about money? How do we make sure that we actually have the reforms, as Manfred Weber was saying, to make sure that we unlock these investments? And let me give you a couple of examples. A few years ago I was talking to a British company which wanted to invest in Brindisi in Italy. They spent over 11 years trying to invest in an LNG terminal: a huge infrastructure project, but they walked away after 11 years because of bureaucracy and frustration. How do we make sure red tape like that does not stop investment in infrastructure? Or think of another example: Castellón Airport: millions of euro of public money but still, 44 months after being inaugurated, it has not opened. And we know of projects in the middle of nowhere. So the questions we have to ask are: how do we unlock this private investment without taxpayers taking on the burden of risk? How do we avoid a situation where for private investors it is heads they win and tails taxpayers lose? How do we avoid more Brindisis or more Castellóns? Answer those questions, Mr Juncker.

But that is another issue, or – OK – maybe it is the same issue. I think it is a good thing that we have this proposal here today. The plan is to start on 1 June 2015 – that is the idea – then the fund can be launched. And it is good that you are not talking about millions, dear colleagues, because for five years in a row we have discussed growth here and talked about millions and project bonds. We are now, I think, really on track by talking about the real investment gap, because the investment gap is huge in Europe: it is EUR 700 billion. Since the start of the crisis, investment stock in Europe has fallen by 14%, while in the US it has been stable during this whole period. So it is a serious and crucial question. And we have three points to make on whether this plan can work. The first is that this investment plan, Mr Juncker, cannot be considered separately. I think that if you introduce legislation by the beginning of next year, you have to introduce legislation not only on this issue but also on the complementary important files that are necessary. The first is structural reforms in the Member States. Mr Weber has given a number of examples: labour market, pension market and, for me, you can even talk about conditionality here. Let us be honest: what is the purpose of funding investment projects in a number of countries if these countries do not make their own effort to carry out structural reforms? So for me, conditionality on structural reforms can be on the table by the beginning of next year if you come with your whole package. The second thing: I think that this programme needs to have a second part, which is opening our markets, liberalising our markets, unifying our markets in digital, in energy. There are a number of examples. It is nonsense, naturally, to make an energy interconnection between Spain and France if at the same time there is regulation in France that does not allow the use of this energy coming from Spain – then this energy grid interconnection does not mean anything. The same applies to the digital market. If we still continue to have 28 supervisors in the digital market, forget your broadband. First of all, create your single supervisor in the digital market, and then these investments can be productive. That is the way forward. And a third example on capital markets – Lord Hill is there – if we continue to have no real unification of the capital markets, Lord Hill, you cannot use your assets in Britain to have an investment credit, for example, in Italy. So that is the way forward. We need not only this investment plan and package; we need, at the same time, regulation unifying this market, otherwise it will lose on a big scale. My third point is on the functioning of the Fund. Let us be honest: I think that there is no room for manoeuvre to put public money in it. There is no public money. There are only public debts but no public money for the moment. So using a guarantee scheme is the right way to do it: you do not need capital for a guarantee scheme. You can create leverage, and I think that is not the most important thing for you now. I am thinking about the other side – the Council. The EIB is on board: you are on board because you are presenting the proposal. But these 28 Member States have to be on board too, because if they come on board in this guarantee scheme, you can have a far higher guarantee scheme than the EUR 21 billion that is on the table now. I would ask Mr Gozi and the Italian Presidency to raise this question at the next Council meeting in December. Is it not an obligation, dear colleagues for every Member State to participate in such a guarantee scheme to launch investments in Europe? So that has to be the message of the Italian Presidency. And the second thing, Mr Gozi: why not bring in tax exemption? All the Member States can help to make it a huge success if, for example, for once, Member States did not impose a tax on the balance of these funds. That could create an enormous boost in the fund, because ordinary citizens could also be interested in taking out a bond in this fund, not only institutional investors. What do you receive for your money today? If you have some money in your bank, maybe nothing at all, because interest rates are so low. If this fund could have a return of 2% with no taxation by the Member States on it, then it could be a big success. And finally, let us not simply fulfil the wish list of the Member States. It is up to the European Commission to make the choice of the projects, twinned with the EIB so they are not brothers in crime but brothers in investment.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, unfortunately the famous EUR 300 billion package you promised us on 15 July is empty. It's a drop in the ocean. What did you show us?

You promise us that you will achieve leverage 15 times, one in fifteen.

Even finance ministers, who support you and join the groups that say 'long live the Junker package!', tell you that fresh money is needed, that new funds are needed. The history of the world economy teaches that, in times of stagnation or recession, without strong public resources, there can be no shift to growth. Mr . Verhofstadt said that investment in the eurozone after the crisis is 15 times below, while in the United States it is above. I don't know. Because that's where they threw money. Because that's where the bank played a growth role while you here don't change the tools. Mr Juncker, at one point you proposed to use some of the ESM's stagnant EUR 500 billion, but mr. Schäuble said no and vetoed the German veto, you forgot. Can you tell us something about this proposal?

Mr President, Mr Juncker, I must pay tribute to you because you have just, after less than a month, presented us with the beginning, in any case, of what is beginning to look like an investment plan. So you want to keep your promise, and that's to your credit. I wanted to tell you that we share your diagnosis that Europe is suffering from a lack of investment, but we need to know what we mean by investment.  We do not think that it is investments in the sense of those who, for a few days, a few hours or a few microseconds, play with money and are called \"investors\". Nor do we believe that investment covers the notion of fuelling real estate bubbles or asset bubbles, as we see constantly in Europe today. Nor do we believe that investing means putting billions to pour concrete to make a nuclear power plant in Flamanville, an airport that will not serve anyone in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, a dam in Sivens or to completely cement the Spanish coast or the Irish capital and, finally, to satisfy either a kind of political or technological pride or, simply, to make profits without creating values.  We believe, on the other hand, that the only useful investment is the financial, material and human investment that is at the service of a cause, the one that Pope Francis reminded us yesterday, that of human dignity. It is therefore about the ecological transformation of our infrastructure, the restoration of our natural resources, social cohesion, education, training and research. This is the destination that investments should have in Europe, and your plan, by its aims, seems to overlap a number of these objectives.  On the other hand, in terms of its volume, it is difficult to believe that the reallocation of EUR 21 billion already on the table, will in itself be able, by leverage, to mobilise investments to the tune of 315 billion euros. I can hear what the EIB boss told us: \"A leverage ratio of 15 seems to us to be unbelievable\". On the other hand, I would also like to point out that this is money that we are taking from existing programs; going to withdraw money from European research programmes, I think it's a bit of \"depriving Paul to spoil Pierre\", and I'm not sure that with that we're making a lot of progress on the schmilblick. Finally, by its principle, the plan aims, in particular, to ensure that the public sector covers the first investment losses, the majority of which would be provided by the private sector. Does socializing losses, privatizing profits, that remind you of anything? I would therefore like to say that this plan is a fine effort, a great attempt, and if there is a way to improve it, we will contribute to it in a constructive spirit. Dear Manfred, the Greens have always wanted to make a contribution to the building, but I would like to highlight measures that we believe are missing and which would be a useful complement to this plan.  First step, close the casino. You know, investors always make their decisions by comparison. As long as an investor can go to the casino and make money easily with the risk-free public guarantee, he will always prefer to go to the casino rather than invest in the real world. So there is still a lot of work to be done to close the casino economy.  Things have been done, but when the European Central Bank makes EUR 1 trillion available to businesses and of that 1 trillion, 50 end up in the real economy and, therefore, 950 go into bubbles, I am sorry but investors continue to prefer the casino.  The second measure is the link to another debate we have: the fight against tax evasion and evasion. Mr Juncker, 21 billion is what some multinationals would have to pay if they paid a tax rate like SMEs in Europe. So we have to mobilize that money. The fight against tax evasion and evasion is an integral part of your investment plan; it should be, in any case. Finally, we need to review our taxation. We continue to subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of tens of billions in Europe every year. We are saying that we need to redirect these subsidies towards useful investment subsidies that will enable us to make the ecological transition and free Europe from a daily bill of one billion euros for Vladimir Putin and the Arab sheiks.

The brutal truth is you do not have 315 billion euros to spend, or anything like it, and what you do have to spend means throwing good money after bad. As the OECD has now admitted, the eurozone has persistent stagnation tendencies. Mr Juncker is trying to implement a bodged solution, but the truth is that the vehicle itself is unsound. The euro is what motor traders in my country would call a lemon, and it should be scrapped. It prevents the weaker nations of the zone from using exchange rate depreciation as a mechanism for protecting economic activity in tough times. In Britain, we saved probably a million jobs by allowing the pound sterling to depreciate after the 2008 crash. In Euroland, you lost several million jobs because Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain were unable to follow suit. Of course, one can only pay tribute to the fundamental strength of the German economy. Germany has the infrastructure, the good industrial relations, the excellent technical education, economies of scale, R&amp;D budget and the world’s leading brands; but to expect the southern eurozone members to live in the same exchange rate and same interest rate regime is pure folly.

There is no point in denying that growth in Europe is unsatisfactory. There are growth forecasts that are constantly pointing downwards. There is a serious risk of movement towards stagnation, while inflation remains too low for too long. A positive shock is needed to take a different growth path, to ward off the risk of stagnation. It is necessary and possible for the whole of Europe.  The Italian Presidency of the Council has put growth and employment at the heart of its agenda and has set out three pillars: structural reforms, greater integration, both within Europe and externally, and support for investment. The recovery in investment is crucial to putting the European Union on a new path of growth. Investment supports short-term demand and strengthens supply and potential output in the medium term. As many have pointed out, the fall in investment has been dramatic and widespread in recent years. This trend must be reversed. Structural reforms are needed both at national level, in all countries, and at European level. Reforms improve the business environment, increase investment and profit prospects. Furthermore, let us not forget that reforms adopted in several countries generate positive and important spillover effects in such a highly integrated area as Europe. But the reforms are also at European level, just remember the completion of the Banking Union and recent results such as the adoption of a standard for the automatic exchange of information against tax evasion. These are reforms that change the rules, change behaviour and thus change resources. Reforms and integration generate investment opportunities, finance makes these investments possible. The dilemma that is often talked about, namely whether we need more resources or whether we need projects, is a false dilemma: we both need them. If profitable projects increase, the resources directly or indirectly needed to finance them will have to be increased. The investment task force launched by Ecofin, which includes the European Investment Bank, the Commission and the Member States, has already produced concrete results in terms of the projects to be financed. It can also be a role model for the future. The programme presented by the President of the Commission will be able to play a decisive role in boosting investment and growth and in initiating a process which will have to be strengthened over time and increasingly linked to the other levers of economic policy that Europe has or will like to equip itself with. The Ecofin Council intends to make an active contribution as early as its next meeting in a few days' time.  It is also necessary – as has already been mentioned by many – for both private and public investment to be active. It is important that public resources are mobilised to provide leverage for private investment, to provide enhanced risk-taking capacity. But let us not forget that public investment also has a direct effect on private investment, especially in conditions of weak and prolonged aggregate demand such as the current one. In conditions of weak aggregate demand such as the present one, the time horizon of firms is shortening, confidence is weakening and risk and investment appetite is weakening. We are facing market failure, there is a need for public action together with the choices of private individuals. And to facilitate private investment, we need, I repeat, reforms, reform programmes to improve the business environment and also the introduction of new financial instruments. I see this perspective as linked to the emerging idea of a capital markets Union. In addition to banking systems as the main source of private financing, other instruments need to be developed to strengthen existing ones. In all this, the role of the European Investment Bank is fundamental, also in cooperation with the national development banks, with which the already strong relationship should be strengthened in an overall network that can not only multiply resources, but also multiply the technical capacity to select projects and thus direct resources towards these projects, along the strategic investment sectors that are known to be : infrastructure, education, research and development in energy. These sectors are important in themselves, but they are important as a whole. Let us not forget that the gradual fall in investment in Europe is also the one that pushes Europe away from the technological frontier and thus reduces the prospects for long-term growth. Period. I am coming to the conclusion, and I would like to conclude with just one thought: all this must be done quickly. Expectations on the part of the citizens of the European Union are growing, but the risk of disappointment is also increasing. The project launched by the Commission today is important, it will take some time to complete and to be tested. In the meantime, things can already be done. You can use the selected projects, you can direct existing resources to those projects. This can give a sign of confidence that confidence in public action can be increased, both at national and European level, and thus already reverse the downward trend in private investment. The downward revision of the growth prospects I was referring to is often largely explained by the lack of confidence in politics on the part of European citizens. That too is the task of the institutions. I am convinced that the initiative presented today by President Juncker and the Commission is only the first very important step in a breakthrough in the management of economic policy and therefore in Europe's ability to return to producing growth and jobs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Gerolf ANNEMANS", "mepid": "124973", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank you all for your very valuable contribution. From now on, we have to concentrate on very deep cooperation in order to make this plan real. Today, Mr Juncker’s Commission is fulfilling the first promise we made when we were appointed: we are setting out an investment plan that will change the way public money is used for investment in Europe. There is ample liquidity in the market. Interest rates are very low and financial market tension has eased. At the same time, there is a real demand for credible investment projects, and yet investment is not happening. There is a severe disconnect. Uncertainties and risk aversion are stifling investment flows. Public authorities can play a vital role in both supply and demand. We need to make long-term financing available for projects that contribute towards our common priorities for Europe: energy, digital, transport, and research and innovation. To succeed, Europe must be united and innovative. We can only deliver a programme of this scale and ambition with the strong political support of this House. We count on your support for this investment plan, to sustain its high level of ambition and to send a clear message to voters that their voices have been heard. I know that attention will be concentrated today on the additional financial capacity. Important as this is, for me this is not enough in itself. As I said in my hearing, I do not want to just put numbers on a piece of paper or money on a table. Therefore, we are presenting a major reform of investment at European level. We want to make sure that real investment happens in the real economy and that we create real new opportunities in Europe. The EU investment plan is a triangle, with three parts. Firstly, we will ensure that every euro invested through this plan maximises its impact on the real economy. To achieve this, we will launch a European Fund for Strategic Investment together with the EIB. This fund will be underpinned by guarantees from the EU budget and a capital contribution from the EIB worth a total of EUR 21 billion. The new, fresh lending capacity of this new fund will be more than EUR 60 billion to the real economy. It will be directed at higher-risk investments providing first-loss guarantees – and I want to repeat this: it will be directed at higher-risk investments providing first-loss guarantees – to complement the traditional lending activity of the EIB. It will also be used to finance long-term strategic investment and to provide additional finance for SMEs and mid-sized companies. The fund, which is backed by a solid EU guarantee, will bring in more money from investors in the public and private sector, who will be reassured by a lower risk. We estimate that, by this multiplier effect, the fund will unlock public and private investment into the real economy to a value of more than EUR 300 billion. This is a robust, conservative assumption based on previous EIB and EU experiences. This is not about complex financial instruments for their own sake but about making investment happen. To those who claim that this is not ʽrealʼ money, my reply is: nonsense. This is a very real, additional public lending capacity of more than EUR 60 billion which acts as a magnet to draw in real investment in real projects and create real jobs. What it is not is an expensive cash handout which will damage our public-sector finances and have no longer-term sustainable impact. Today, we come together to deliver our part. The next step is for national governments to step in and provide additional capital to the fund, and we strongly encourage Member States to do so. The Member States’ contribution to the fund will be Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)-neutral. In addition to this, we also look to the Member States to use their EU Structural Funds better and to double the use of financial instruments such as loans and guarantees. Currently, 92% of Structural Funds go to grant schemes. This has to change. Once the money is granted, it is gone. We need to make better use of this financing so that it goes further and has a real effect on the economy. At the heart of this package there is a political choice: either we continue business as usual with traditional grants and loans and that is as far as the money goes, or we use our budget in the most efficient way to support riskier borrowing and create a larger lending capacity. This is the choice we have made. It is a new approach at European level, to change the way public money is used. As a second pillar, we want to make sure that this money reaches the real economy. Together with the EIB we are creating a transparent pipeline of trusted investment. We will be identifying viable projects at EU level and stepping up the necessary technical assistance to support project structuring and the use of more innovative financial instruments for Member States. This is what investors are asking for. There is money out there, but investors tell us they need well-structured, high-quality projects with access to clear and transparent information. The task force led by the Commission and the EIB, with Member States, is currently identifying over a thousand projects which are ready to be assessed. We want to give a European label for the most viable ones. We need sound investments for the future, not another bubble. That is why we are proposing this combination of guarantees at EU level for higher-risk investments, along with longer-term projects in line with our strategic priorities. Together they will enable us to start moving quickly and also to deliver sustainable investment for the long term. Thirdly, we want to remove barriers to investment by the private sector. We need to step up our efforts to have better regulation. We need to work with the Member States to renew Europe with structural reforms which create a more favourable investment environment and better competitiveness and create more growth and jobs. We want to create a single market in the energy, digital, capital, public procurement and services areas. This helps to remove regulatory barriers for business to invest. There are many companies out there creating digital products. They have a single market in the United States but not here. There are many people who want to invest in the energy sector, but until they have an energy union they cannot do so as easily as, say, in the food sector. The single market needs to be deepened in services and in public procurement. I will also support my fellow Commissioners in completing the single market in energy, the digital sector and transport. I will also work closely with Commissioner Jonathan Hill to deliver a capital markets union. We need a financial sector which serves our companies better – especially SMEs – and reduces their dependence on financing from the banks. For me, this single market dimension – the third side of the triangle – is the most important part of our work and the one that really changes Europe permanently. Of course, this will not happen overnight, but we can make change together if we are determined. This is our joint responsibility. Each of these three strands of the investment triangle is needed to make investment happen in Europe. Each strand reinforces the others. I am sure some will say that the money of this new investment fund is not enough. We do not need – and we do not want – to maximise the taxpayers’ burden. What matters is real investment, not just large sums of money sitting in a bank. We are going to use a relatively small amount of public money to remove the fear factor and unlock the investment funds which are already there and waiting to be used. We need just enough money to get the motor running. After that it will have a life of its own. If Member States still believe these funds are not enough, we invite them to make their own additional contributions. For the investment plan to succeed, Member States must take courageous decisions and the ECB will need to play its part. On its own, the plan is not a magic bullet to transform the European economy but – and it is a very important but – if we implement all three elements of our plan, we will change the European investment landscape permanently and structurally for the better. So let us all get to work together to get investments working in Europe again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Unfortunately, the lack of payment appropriations is a major problem that puts the EU's largest Horizon 2020 innovation programme into question. If the current trend of payment restrictions persists, 40% of commitments to programme participants will not be settled by the end of 2020.  Another issue is education and training, which must be modernised, accessible to all, flexible and geared to the needs of the labour market. On the European labour market, the Union must act as a coordinator, advisory body to support the education process and improve its quality. Therefore, additional resources in the investment package must be allocated m.in to address educational and training inequalities. Priorities in the area of education and training also include extending the Youth Guarantee to persons up to the age of 30, broader implementation of a dual education system based on international cooperation, maintaining and extending erasmus+ cooperation and, as for Horizon 2020, addressing insufficient payments, which threatens the further development of the programme.

Bridging the gap between the old and the new Member States is an imperative for deepening European integration and also represents a significant opportunity to revive economic growth and create new jobs. The further alignment of the European connection of transport infrastructure, for example, in Romania and other new Member States is not only a concrete proof of solidarity, but can be a profitable business for all involved. That is why I advocate channelling European investment to boost the less developed regions of the EU and to create transport and energy supply networks aimed at strengthening the European integration project. At the same time, I believe that effective and urgent measures are needed at Union level to encourage private investment and make the labour market more flexible, as well as to combat tax fraud and evasion.

Lima, as you know, is the last major event this year before the Paris Conference, at which we want and aim to have a global climate agreement in the post-2020 period. To begin with, I would like to remind you of the reasons why these commitments are so important. We all know that in order to prevent advancing climate change and its devastating consequences, the rise in world temperatures must remain below 2 degrees centigrade below pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, global emissions must be reduced by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to 2010. The same emissions must reach levels close to zero or lower in 2100. In order to provide ourselves with an instrument suitable for the post-2020 period, we agreed in Durban to develop a new legal instrument within the framework of the existing UN Convention.  I would now like to mention here the most important tasks that we will have to carry out at the Lima Conference, in order to make this a success and, above all, to prepare well for the Global Conference in Paris next year: to identify, of course, the main elements on which we can agree in the run-up to 2015; agree on the essential requirements regarding the initial information, the process of communicating it and subsequent examinations and analyses of the various planned contributions established at national level; appropriately address the issue of our mitigation ambitions for 2020. First of all, in Lima we must agree on the essential elements of the 2015 agreement, as I said: mitigation (which also includes the cycle of commitments), adaptation, market use, financing, technologies, capacity building and transparency. In this way, we will be able to present, by May next year, a comprehensive draft negotiating text to start negotiations on the real agreement, well in advance of the Paris Conference. The second point relates to the planned contributions established at national level, the so-called INDCs. The 2015 agreement should include legally binding mitigation commitments for all parties. However, the level of ambition and the type of commitment will vary. INDCs should therefore allow each party to choose its own type of contribution and to define its own level of ambition according to their national situations and capacities. The possibility of making different choices implies that the parties will have to provide sufficient information for their commitments to be understood and analysed to verify their compliance with the 2 degrees centigrade objective. The Lima Conference must therefore provide guidance to the parties on the initial information to accompany the INDCs and on the process of examining and analysing these data next year. As you know, the agreement on the Horizon 2030 climate and energy policy framework, reached by the European Council last month, is very significant. It was a high priority of our six months: we absolutely wanted to reach an important and ambitious agreement on the fight against climate change as the European Union, we wanted to confirm the role played by the European Union in international climate negotiations. We set ourselves the goal of reducing our emissions by 40% in 2030 compared to 1990, in line with the longer-term goal of reducing emissions by 80-95% by 2050. Perhaps we realised and perhaps european public opinion only realised the importance of this agreement a few days later, when much more media attention was given to the decision and announcement of China and the United States when they announced their INDCs. Without knowing all the details, assessing them correctly is rather difficult, but the announcement itself at this early stage and a few weeks after the European Union's announcement is in itself a very positive development in the run-up to the Paris Conference. The two main emissions producers have sent a clear signal of their willingness to engage and reach an agreement in Paris. Thirdly – and I will end, Mr President – the Lima Conference should send out a clear signal, building on the momentum given by the climate summit called by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in September, with a view to stepping up the sectors with high mitigation potential with positive consequences in terms of development, growth and innovation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 38, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first thank you for the draft resolution on the Lima Conference and for your work and support for international climate negotiations. Lima will be a milestone. Progress in Lima will be crucial to success in Paris at COP 21, where we will adopt an internationally legally-binding agreement applicable to all Parties. In that context Lima must deliver three key outcomes. Firstly, we should have a good understanding of the elements of a draft negotiating text of the 2015 agreement. Secondly, we need to agree on the requirements for the way in which all Parties are to present, early next year, their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the new agreement. These contributions will express each Party’s intended emission reduction effort, and they must be transparent, quantifiable and comparable. Lima should also provide for an international process to consider and analyse the adequacy and ambition of INDCs before Paris. That process should aim to ensure that finalised emissions reductions commitments in the 2015 agreement are collectively sufficient to keep global average temperature increase below 2oC, and individually fair. And thirdly, we need to make progress on enhancing mitigation ambition also before 2020, so we remain on track to achieve the ‘below 2o C’ objective, which is crucial given that the 2015 agreement will not enter into force until 2020. The Commission has been very active in driving European Union action to make Lima a success. My predecessor, Connie Hedegaard, has done a tremendous job reaching out to our key strategic partners through visits – to the United States, China and India – and through her engagement in plurilateral forums such as the Major Economies Forum or the Cartagena Dialogue of progressive countries. I am personally committed to furthering and strengthening these dialogues and alliances. The European Union has also actively engaged in climate-related outreach through the EEAS and the Member States’ embassies, and through putting climate on the agenda of summits and forums such as the G20. In the next thirteen months these efforts will continue and grow in importance. On 24 October the European Council agreed on the 2030 targets of 40% greenhouse gas reductions. This puts the European Union ahead of the curve and means we will be in a position to come forward with our INDC by the first quarter of 2015. However, the European Union only accounts for 10% of global emissions today. At least all the major and emerging economies must also come forward by the first quarter of 2015. The United States and China announcement earlier this month should show that the European Union call is being answered by key players and hopefully will incite others to follow suit. There is also an urgent need to step up global ambition to cut greenhouse gas emissions before 2020 – to address the gap between current emission pledges and the reductions needed to keep global warming below 2oC. We need to promote strengthened collective efforts in the UNFCCC and other relevant forums such as the Montreal Protocol, the International Maritime Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The European Union is on track to achieve emission reductions well beyond the current 20% target. We have also confirmed our conditional pledge to move to a 30% reduction, provided that other major emitting countries commit to comparable reduction targets. I look forward to working with my fellow Commissioners, including Vice-President Mogherini and Vice-President Šefčovič, to ensure climate change is a top priority for all our external dialogue in the coming important months. This brings me to the issue of climate finance. The Members of this House attach great importance to the question of scaling up climate finance to the USD 100 billion goal. I do too. Let me underline that the European Union and the Member States have taken numerous initiatives to that end. Finance to developing countries from the European Union budget and the European Development Fund has steadily increased, achieving EUR 900 million in 2013. This adds to the EUR 8.7 billion of climate finance provided by the Member States in 2013, which brings the total climate finance contribution by the European Union and its Member States to EUR 9.6 billion in 2013. Looking to the future, the multiannual financial framework, together with the European Development Fund, will provide EUR 14 billion to support climate-relevant actions in developing countries in the period 2014 to 2020. This represents a significant effort from the European Union. In relation to the Green Climate Fund, the EU Member States are major contributors. They have pledged over USD 3.8 billion to this Fund, around 40% of the total pledges so far. Finally, let me underline the important role the European Parliament plays as we move towards Paris. In Lima I intend to make sure that the delegation of the European Parliament is fully informed on the progress of the negotiations. Speaking with one voice as the European Union also means that Parliament’s support for an ambitious agreement is crucial. I would like to thank you again for your interest in this question and look forward to a lively debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Karl-Heinz FLORENZ", "mepid": "1038", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I am pleased that today, for the first time, we have had the opportunity to exchange views here in Parliament. I've been there for many years, I was in Rio for the first time in 1992. Since then, I have witnessed many gloomy climate conferences. Now, however, I am relatively hopeful that we are on a good track towards Paris. This has to do not only with the fact that the European Union has presented a good result, but also with the fact that the Americans and the Chinese announced a turnaround at the Ban Ki-moon summit in New York. They have not yet done so, as we know. But we have never experienced such a mood. I am thinking of Copenhagen, which was the darkest thing we have ever met. I think we have a good chance of being hopeful. This is partly due to the fact that the moderate and sustainable industry has long been on the path to working in this direction as well. This helps, and we also know that American industry has long understood that money can be made in low-carbon farming. But, ladies and gentlemen, in the coming months, the moment of truth will come. Just going to Lima and saying we are reducing it by 40%, that is not enough. However, all our Member States will soon have to put binding figures on the table, and the perpetrators in particular must understand that a figure must now be put on the table – as the Commissioner has just mentioned – so that we can then verify this figure in Europe as well. In the end, we have to reach the 2-degree target, if we don't get there, the numbers are of no use. So it will be difficult negotiations after Lima.

During this time, however, evidence of climate change has continued to grow. Crises are becoming more frequent. Lima must be the pre-step to retake Kyoto's great ambition, and Paris must be consolidating that ambition. There are positive signs. The European Union has made commitments. It is true that Parliament wanted more. More than the Commission and the Commission more than the Council. But we've made commitments. China and the United States are doing it.

As a planet we have made slow and halting progress since we first began to appreciate our challenge. If I may, in an aside, say, as we approach the Lima gathering: it is a particularly unfortunate moment to dispense with the services of the European Union’s Chief Scientific Adviser. Right now more than ever, we need science at the heart of the decisions we take. The Scottish Professor Anne Glover has served well in this capacity, and I had every hope that her successor would do the same. I therefore call for Mr Juncker to reverse this decision and reverse it now. The gathering in Lima will present a number of challenges, notably the question of burden-sharing. I am pleased to note that the UK will contribute GBP 720 million pounds to the Green Climate Fund. This is important. Equally important will be the funds contributed by others. It is this particular fund which will help us ensure that we meet the targets to ensure that the two-degree reduction is made. Equally important, as we head towards the Paris COP meeting, will be the setting of clear and ambitious national contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The headline agreement by EU leaders of a binding target to reduce headline emissions by 40% from 1990 levels is important, as is the statement by the British Prime Minister that this must represent a floor, not a ceiling.

And the year 2014 will also yield another record in CO2 emissions. Never before has the CO2 concentration been as high as it is today. We see the evidence of climate change almost every day. In the first decade of this century, we saw three times as many natural disasters as a few years before. In any case, this means that the sense of urgency seems to be finally increasing. I therefore welcome the decision of China and the United States to jointly tackle climate change. Although, of course, the reaction on Capitol Hill makes you believe the worst. Let us not underestimate the Chinese promise. Twenty percent zero emission energy by 2030 means an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of capacity, which is almost the entire current electricity generation in the United States. So let us not say that we do a lot in Europe and the rest of the world does not. There does indeed seem to be momentum coming back. But we must be careful, because the bottom-up approach we have taken since the Copenhagen Échec is absolutely no guarantee of success. The intended nationally determined contributions - it all sounds wonderful - should not become noncommittal intentions. And it is therefore the job of Mr Arias Cañete to fight hard for it. In addition to the Lima-Paris route, let us remain very honest: even in the most rosy Lima-Paris scenario, we will not do enough and we will not fall below that two-degree limit.

The global climate crisis must be our priority in this House, but clearly we are afraid. We fear the logic of market capitalism, which always shifts production to where it is cheapest and regulation is lowest.  I am not the only one who has come to think that the climate crisis is not about coal or carbon dioxide at all, but about pure market capitalism. In order to combat climate change, we should get out of the market economy's race towards destruction. We know what needs to be done, but we are only taking very small steps forward. The mere 'signals' are not enough about Lima, we need a proper mega leap in ambition and a sincere commitment for our environment.

I think we can see now that the world is starting to move. We are now looking at the US and China which are doing things, and I think we have to welcome that. We have to see that this is a good step towards Paris. But there are, of course, questions as to what Europe is doing. We have always claimed that we are leading the world. I think that tone has become very irritating for the rest of the world, because if you really look at what the EU is doing, it is not that impressive. I think just one clear question – and I think it is important Mr Cañete address it – is: Europe – what is Europe going to do with its coal-fired power plants until 2030? We know that in the US they are going to handle them, in China they are going to handle them, but the Council conclusions still give a feeling that Europe might give subsidies to coal-fired power plants until 2030. It would be very important, Mr Cañete, for you to make it very clear here that when we are talking about funds for the modernisation of our energy system, we are not talking about subsidies for coal-fired power plants at all. I think you have to clarify that very clearly. And if we make a link to the investment plan – because everyone is making the point that this is very important – unfortunately there are not so many Commissioners left any more, while we were discussing an investment plan. I think there is one important issue here: if you want to have clarity for investors, you also need to have clear policies, and one of the clearest policies you can provide investors with is a binding energy-efficiency target. That would really make it clear to investors what to do. I think that there, too, you can also provide investors with some clarity that the Commission will indeed come forward with those proposals. A final remark to the Council: regarding the funds, the Green Climate Fund. Is the Council able, for next year, to really make sure that, on time, Europe as a whole can provide money for that Climate Fund in a new additional way that is transparent and also predictable, so that the developing countries really know that the Council of the European Union is serious about climate change and helping developing countries in that?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 45, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Valentinas MAZURONIS", "mepid": "124768", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – The Lima Conference must become an intermediate stop in the run-up to a legally binding, ambitious international agreement in Paris in 2015.

The European Union's efforts in this area alone are not enough, and there is a risk that the safe climate threshold may be exceeded after 2020.

Our overall objective is to strengthen the commitment of the entire international community to sustainable development, because it will, I believe, be the real element through which we can build sustainable growth.

Dissenting opinions are simply silent. The consensus ends with the statement that the climate is changing, just as it has always changed. But even if the panel's opinions were correct, the second questionable assumption is that other global players will agree to make significant concessions about their economic policies. The third dubious assumption concerns the role of the European Union. We can set an example of environmental and climate concern for others, but apparently no one is going to change their policy because of this, and with the Union's shrinking participation in global emissions, the importance of unilateral action is steadily diminishing. However, the threat of loss of competitiveness is increasing. Let me remind you once again that by 2030 we will be responsible for 4% of global emissions.

Therefore, in Lima, we will have to work towards a result for the planet, not just for the European Union, because the European Union accounts for only 10% of CO2 emissions. This forces us to address the climate problem in a comprehensive way. At the same time, we cannot sit idly by for other countries to act to move forward.  The European Union must be at the heart of the negotiations to send a clear message. It must affirm the interest that everyone has in committing, without delay, to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Developing countries that fear that reducing emissions will penalize them in their growth have an interest in this because they will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change. We must therefore pay particular attention to their concerns. Developed countries also have an interest in this because reducing CO2 emissions can be achieved by further innovating and creating jobs. There are encouraging signs, although caution should be required. Internationally, we see that with the agreement between China and the United States, but we must not have a simple catalogue of good intentions.

Now there is an opening for Paris, but we know that this is far from enough to reach the 2-degree Celsius target. My question is this: what coalitions does the EU intend to forge in Lima and Paris, so that we are not at the cat table, but are a front-row player and really achieve an ambitious result? Secondly, the financing of climate protection. It is good that we have EUR 10 billion together. However, we have pledged EUR 100 billion a year. There must be a new concept, new ideas. Does the Commission have any new ideas on how we can get from 10 billion to 100 billion? Thirdly, I hear that a 'Paris Alliance' is being discussed for Paris, not a legally binding treaty or instrument, but a global deal where everyone puts something on the table. As the EU, do we still maintain a legal instrument, which also brings commitments? Fourthly, with the Ban Ki-moon Summit, we have learned that there are other actors, especially cities, municipalities, but also advanced industry.

On the one hand, not only in Europe, but worldwide, we need to reduce CO2 emissions in order to combat global warming, on the other hand, it is important for us, especially in Europe, to preserve jobs and promote economic development.  And, in fact, there are two ways in which these CO2 emissions could be reduced, which will have different effects directly on our economy. The first way is to ask the industry to reduce CO2 emissions in Europe more and more, in our own union, which will result in some industries moving out of the EU to countries such as China, where there are no caps on these CO2 emission allowances, and it could be said that CO2 emissions would decrease in Europe, but this would not happen globally, as they would continue to continue in China, perhaps even more, because there are no restrictions.

I think it is a very gratifying development that the European Council has agreed to this position. Personally, I am not entirely satisfied with what the summit decided on in terms of renewable energy and energy efficiency. But this 40% target is crucial for the international negotiations. I would like to point out to the previous speaker from the Socialist Group that we should not be arguing here today on the issue of binding targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy.

I was happy to hear support from different sides of the hemicycle for a strong European Union negotiating position in Lima and Paris. To be an effective negotiating partner, we need three things. First, we need to show leadership through our domestic policies. With the 2013 framework adopted, the European Union is in an excellent position not only to be a strong international voice but also to address the European climate and energy challenges. I have listened with great attention to all your concerns in this regard. Second, we need to deliver on our previous commitments. We will continue scaling up climate finance, as we have done so far, and I hope we will also be able to adopt the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol shortly. I have been asked a very specific question about the Green Climate Fund (GCF) by Mr Eickhout. As you know, clearly the European Union does not have a seat on the board of the GCF due to the position of Russia and the United States at the time of its establishment. It will not therefore be possible to contribute to it from the European Union budget for accountability reasons, because European Union spending from the European Union budget cannot be undertaken if the European Union is not involved in decisions made by the Green Climate Fund. However, the Commission is ready to explore co-financing projects with the GCF at country level, for example via the European Union regional investment facilities, with which we currently already blend grants in the European Union budget and loans from the Development Bank. Finally, to be an effective negotiating partner, we have to be united. The European Union is a strong unit that speaks with one voice. Only in this way can we continue to strengthen our existing alliance and to build bridges, with the perseverance Mrs Grossetête claims and without changing strategies. This is not the time to change a global strategy that we have lived with for many years. We are aiming for a globally-binding agreement, and we cannot change that strategy. It takes time. It is difficult. The United Nations procedures are slow, but we must proceed with the aim of having a binding agreement in Paris. You can count on my engagement, both in Lima and also next year, to work on all these three elements. My hope and ambition is that, by the time we have a similar debate next year, the outline of the future agreement will be clear. It must be an agreement that keeps us on track for the below 2° C target and that is applicable to all. It is something we owe to future generations. Delivering the 2015 Agreement in Paris needs commitment from all countries in order to effectively combat dangerous climate change. However, Paris will not be the end of the process, because implementation, monitoring and review will always be needed beyond Paris to verify that the international ambition of all countries will be delivered to the levels required by science.

You said it: the world is beginning to move; it must do so with perseverance more than forcefully, as Mrs Grossetête said. Jo Leinen referred to a very important point. It is true that we are far from Copenhagen, we must stay away from Copenhagen even when we move on from Lima, which is really far from Copenhagen, to Paris, which is a little closer, but only geographically. We must certainly maintain the level of our ambitions. That is why you have stressed in various countries the importance of the announcement by the United States and China: they are responsible for 43% of global emissions and have jointly announced a commitment for the first time long before the Paris Summit. It is clear that we need more information to assess the commitments and also to prepare for the right coalitions and alliances to make Paris a success. Mrs McAvan asked how much we would take account of the work that is being done for the developing countries. I would remind you – as I said in my introduction – that the contributions planned and established at national level, the so-called INDCs, must allow each party to choose its own type of contribution and to define its own level of ambition according to their national situations and capacities. Of course, as you have said, in Lima we must achieve a result not only for the European Union, but a result for the whole planet, and as on previous occasions we will take full account of your support and, above all, of the awareness-raising work that, as in the past, you have done and can do with regard to our partners at world level.

We want to work closely with you in the immediate preparation of the Lima Conference, and you will also be part of the European Union delegations at the Lima Conference.

Secondly, if it turns out that these are anthropogenic causes, it is necessary to determine whether they are greenhouse gases or dust, or deforestation or other factors.

(Applause) Cher Docteur Mukwege, Madame, soyez les bienvenus au Parlement Européen! Before I acknowledge your extraordinary commitment to welcoming a number of other guests who have made a living for freedom and human rights, please allow me, Dr Mukwege. Among you the representative of the Ukrainian Euromajdan movement, Elisaveta Shcheltyylnykova, who is with us today and whom I warmly welcome on behalf of the Euromajdan movement. (Applause) You, Mrs Shcheletylnykova, and your colleagues, your friends, have shown enormous courage and you have fought for the good future of your country at the risk of your life. They have taken to the streets to live in a free and democratic Ukraine. We assure you of our full support and solidarity for this. I would also like to welcome Dinara Yunus. You, Mrs Yunus, have come to Strasbourg today to represent her mother, Leyla Yunus, who cannot be with us because she is still in prison. Welcome, Dear Mrs Yunus! (Applause) Mrs Yunus has been nominated for the Sakharov Prize here in Parliament because, as the founder of the Institute for Peace and Democracy, she courageously defended and defended human rights in Azerbaijan. The European Parliament calls on the government in Azerbaijan to release immediately this innocent woman, whose health is deteriorating dramatically. I would like to add here that we have tried to send a parliamentary delegation to Azerbaijan to visit Mrs Yunus. We have not been able to do that so far. That is why I am protesting explicitly here against our fellow Members being denied access to Mrs Yunus by the Azerbaijani authorities to this day. This is unacceptable. That is why the fact that her daughter is here today is a symbolic act. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen! Much better than I could describe it, says about the work of Dr. Mukwege a short film, which we want to show you before I continue. (A short film about the work of Dr. Mukwege is recorded.) These impressive and also stirring scenes say a lot about you, Dr. Mukwege. A fascinating personality and at the same time a humble man who dedicated his life to the fight for peace and justice, a doctor who cares tirelessly for his patients and does everything in the most adverse circumstances to alleviate their terrible suffering. And yet we can hardly imagine the pain and misery you encounter every day of your work in the Panzi hospital you founded. On behalf of my fellow Members, I would like to express our admiration and deep respect for what you do every day. Instead of looking away and turning away, you have become a fearless man in the face of cruel violence. A man who cares for the most neglected victims of the war, women and girls who have been victims of sexual violence. They have alleviated the suffering of countless women and girls. They have offered refuge to the survivors and given them a helping hand to heal their wounded bodies and broken souls. You tirelessly denounce the systematic use of rape as a weapon in the war against the innocent and that these atrocities are not just acts of violence, but, as you said, part of a strategy. Rape is always inhumane and brutal, and we condemn it. But we must also turn words into deeds. In other words, ladies and gentlemen, the de facto impunity for rape in armed conflicts must be brought to an end. (Applause) When rape is ordered by commanders, it is a war crime. And then these war crimes must also be punished like war crimes. (Applause) Mass rapes are still taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Countless women have suffered the same fate in Syria, Iraq, Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina and other armed conflicts. Almost all of these crimes went unpunished. The European Parliament calls on the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the governments in other countries concerned, to assume their responsibilities and to do everything possible to stop the rapes immediately, to do everything possible to end impunity for rapists, and to do everything possible to give women a single voice. free access to the legal system. Dear Dr. Mukwege! With the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the European Parliament honours your admirable work, her work as a doctor and as a fighter for the dignity of women, for justice and peace in your country. I hope that together we will be able to raise awareness that rape is being systematically used as a weapon of war – a heinous crime that we must fight and eradicate together with all our strength. Yesterday, Dr Mukwege, in the European Parliament, you said a sentence which impressed me greatly: ' En m'attribuant ce prix, vous reconnaissez toutes ces femmes et toutes ces filles, dans mon pays ou dans d'autres régions du monde, leurs statuts de victimes auxquelles nous devons.

Mr President of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the peoples of the European Union, distinguished guests to your titles and qualities, it is with great humility and hope that I receive today the prestigious Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought. This year, you commemorated the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Europe thought that this was the last and that civilization would triumph. No, alas, thirty years later, human folly was back on the agenda. Since then, you have made the choice of peace and living together in a society oriented towards freedom and prosperity. In an increasingly unstable security environment where crisis centres are multiplying, especially in the direct vicinity of the European Union, I would like above all to thank the elected representatives of the European peoples for highlighting the human tragedies experienced by women victims of rape and sexual violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. In a world of inversion of values where violence is trivialized in always abominable forms, to refuse violence is to be dissenting. By drawing the world's attention to the need to protect women in times of armed conflict, you have refused indifference to one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of modern times. You reaffirmed that the resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes and the promotion of human rights and democracy are and remain priorities of the European Union's foreign policy.  With this award, you have decided to increase the visibility of the struggle waged by Congolese women for more than 15 years and to recognize their suffering, but also their dignity and the courage they embody.  (Applause) Mr President, the region where I live is one of the richest on the planet; yet the overwhelming majority of its inhabitants live in extreme poverty due to insecurity and poor governance.  Women's bodies have become a real battlefield and rape is used as a weapon of war.  The consequences are manifold and affect society as a whole. The family unit is disintegrated, the social fabric is destroyed, populations are enslaved or simply driven into exile in a largely militarized economy where the law of warlords continues to prevail in the absence of a rule of law. So we are facing a dreadfully effective war strategy. The authority of the Congolese state and its institutions remain fragile and are not yet able to protect the population or meet its basic needs.  Mr President, there are few days when the news in my region does not reveal a new human tragedy. Last week, more than 50 people were massacred with machetes in the territory of Beni in North Kivu: pregnant women are gutted and babies mutilated. In the space of a month and a half, two hundred people were brutally killed. Like any human being, I would so much like to stop mentioning these heinous crimes against my fellow human beings. But how can I be silenced when, for more than fifteen years, we see what even a surgeon's eye can't get used to seeing? How can I be silent when we know that these crimes against humanity are planned with a low economic motive? How can I be silenced when these same economic reasons have led to the use of rape as a strategy of war? Every woman raped, I identify her with my wife. (Applause) Every mother raped, I identify her with my mother and every child raped, I identify her with my children. How can we keep quiet? What is this conscious human being who would be silent when a six-month-old baby whose vagina was destroyed either by the brutal penetration of an adult, by blunt objects or by chemicals? Already, only one case of rape is serious and requires action by all. In my country, there are hundreds of thousands of women raped and thousands more children from rape, in addition to the millions of human beings who died as a result of conflict.  In the rest of the world, everyone would rise with indignation, but in Congolese society, which is losing its bearings, mass atrocities pass into the news as mere miscellaneous facts, a desolate sign of a society traumatized by too much violence, a society where there is a lack of political responsibility, and a simply denial of our common humanity. Mr President, we have taken too much time and energy to repair the consequences of violence. It is time to address the causes. Thousands of testimonies from victims show that the Congolese people crave justice, peace and yearn for change. There are a urgency to act. Solutions exist and require real political will. We are at a critical moment. The Framework Agreement for Peace, Security and Cooperation, signed in Addis Ababa in 2013, cannot remain a single piece of paper. We call on the European Union - and its Member States - as a historic partner and the main contributor of aid, to revitalise the implementation of this agreement, which we gladly call the 'agreement of hope', and to use all the levers, economic, financial, but also political and diplomatic, to contribute once and for all to the resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes. (Applause) In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the consolidation of the state and the restoration of security in the east are the priorities. Security sector reform is one of the most important institutional reforms and is at the heart of efforts to implement the Congolese state's primary responsibility to protect civilians. Justice must also be placed at the heart of the peace process, and the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes, including crimes of sexual violence, must be strengthened.  There will be no peace, economic and social development without respect for human rights, (applause) without reparation for rape survivors and victims, without remediation of the civil service, including a vetting of the security forces, and without a truth-finding mechanism to promote reconciliation. Mr President, human rights are not only one of the fundamental values of the European Union but also one of the objectives that inspire its external relations with the promotion of peace and development and the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law.  In our humble opinion and esteem, this is the real added value of the Union compared to other international partners. But realpolitik often illustrates that geostrategic and economic interests take precedence over respect for the protection of human rights. The Commission's draft European regulation for responsible mineral supply, which is to be discussed in this House, should have a binding dimension and target both finished products here in the West and raw materials in the raw state in Africa.  (Applause) We express here the hope that everyone will ensure that economic policies and respect for human rights are more coherent, and that human dignity is at the centre of economic and financial concerns. Our country is full of potential and, with more responsible and transparent trade, Congo has the capacity for endogenous development thanks to its natural resources but, above all, thanks to its human resources, which today cannot be exploited for the benefit of all in a context of \"neither peace nor war\".  Mr President, this award will only mean meaningful to women who are victims of sexual violence if you accompany us on the road to peace, justice and democracy. We therefore dedicate it to all survivors of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and around the world. We are convinced that change will come through these courageous, determined and dignified women who are our daily inspiration. We also dedicate this award to all human rights defenders who campaign day after day, often under difficult conditions and away from the spotlight, to foster a culture of peace, to help victims claim their rights and to make their institutions more accountable.  Finally, we would like to acknowledge the professionalism and dedication of all Panzi staff and all our partners who have helped us to carry out our work. I am thinking in particular of the European humanitarian agency ECHO, which has been supporting us for 10 years. Without you, we wouldn't be here today. Together, policy makers, civil society actors and citizens, men and women, we must draw a red line against the use of rape as a weapon of war and build a better future to provide our children and grandchildren with a framework for their development, and to enable all those who have suffered too much to look to the future in greater freedom. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by addressing the citizens of my country, who, in large numbers, have been willing to accompany me.  Dear compatriots, our nation, the Democratic Republic of Congo, belongs to us. Its natural and human resources, its institutions, its destiny, are all our responsibility.  It is up to us, the Congolese people, to shape our our laws, our justice and our government to serve our interests for all, not just those of some. (Applause) The Sakharov Prize we receive from the European Parliament is yours, and it is the symbol of freedom of thought: a right that has been taken away from us, a right which, because of terror and oppression, we sometimes seem to have renounced. This right is vested in us and the Peoples of Europe, through their representatives, are reaching out to us today to recover it. They want to support us in our struggle for freedom, peace, justice and progress. Today, aloud and in front of the whole world, Europe expresses its solidarity with us. She wants to walk with us in our quest to restore a dignified Congolese life. Let us unite and walk with it, so that, once and for all, peace and justice will be restored in Congo and that we can aspire to a better future. Our country is sick, but together with our friends around the world, we can and will heal it. Thank you.

I voted today in favour of the report on the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank because I believe that Regulation 2533 of 1998 undoubtedly needs to be amended in view of the extension of the ECB's powers. The granting of new supervisory tasks to this institution is a consequence of the changes that have taken place in the euro area as a result of the collapse of the global and European economies. The irresponsible behaviour of some financial institutions has led to a deepening of poverty and social exclusion in Europe. It is therefore good that the ECB will be able to control and verify the data it receives. In this area, an amendment seems appropriate to give the bank the power to collect and analyse so-called raw data not processed by the audited institutions. This will create better conditions for knowing their real situation, will allow to differentiate the importance of individual actions, and thus the responsibility and potential consequences. I also fully agree with the provisions that the extension of the obligation on credit institutions to provide data must be balanced by strengthening the requirements necessary to protect their confidentiality.

It was ‘the gap between what is said and what is’. We used to think it a characteristic of totalitarian regimes, but what a wonderful description it is of the whole lamentable euro project also. The thing was built on a fraud in the first place, as countries falsified their statistics in order to qualify, and it was then sold to the people in an act of even greater fraud, as we were told that it would add 1% to the GDP of all participating states every year in perpetuity. The worse of it is that the lies are continuing. Even now, in this Chamber we are assured, over and over again, that the debt crisis had nothing to do with the euro and that the economic crisis is unrelated to monetary union.

The European Central Bank's sanctions recommendation is important because it is an integral part of the implementation of the Banking Union.  Regulations authorize the European Central Bank to impose control over credit institutions. These are administrative fines in the event that those institutions violate the conditions directly applicable by Union law, sanctions in case of breaches of regulations or decisions of the ECB.

We should bear in mind that the governments of the world have a shared responsibility, including with regard to future generations, in order to take appropriate action in the area of climate policy.

The EU's negotiating delegation must therefore demand that it adopt stricter commitments and greenhouse gas emission reductions only if other economies responsible for Earth's greenhouse gas emissions, such as the United States or China, do the same. On the other hand, the role of renewable energy production and residential and industrial energy efficiency should be much more pronounced. The EU must refrain from taking any action to prevent the use of renewable energies. For example, we should not limit the planting of useful wood varieties that provide biomass feed material, the production of first-generation bioethanol produced from surplus yields, or support for combustion-efficient biomass boilers.

I assure you that I will be Vice-President of the Commission, so there is no need to switch the order. I give you a political reassurance on that, but I think it is good if we all stick to the Treaties in content and in form. First of all, I would like to thank you for this timely debate. I think it is a crucial debate coming at a crucial time. I have just visited, in my first week in office, Israel and Palestine, including Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank, and I can report back to you, as I did to the Foreign Affairs Council, that there is a sense of urgency in the region, on both sides – very different on one side compared to the other side, but on both sides there is a very tense situation where the lack of a political perspective is, at one and the same time, the consequence and the result and the cause of violence that risks returning. We see that in these weeks, with terrorist attacks on one side and decisions on the other side that risk endangering the perspective of a two-state solution. This sense of urgency is becoming greater and greater in the absence of a political perspective. In the past months we experienced first the suspension of the talks last spring, then the conflict in Gaza. Luckily, and thanks to a good political initiative by some actors in the region and internationally – starting with Egypt – a ceasefire was reached at the end of August followed by a donors’ conference not many weeks ago, once again in Cairo. But none of this is reopening the path to a political perspective, to direct talks or to steps that can bring back hope in the fact that what we call the ‘two-state solution’ can become a reality in the near future. We have some open points. On one side we have the dramatic open point of Gaza, where I saw a desperate situation, where I saw that the Palestinian Authority has more than difficulties in doing what we all hope it could do: start to rule Gaza, starting with the security side and control of the crossings. And on the other side we have decisions like the one on the settlements, which is actually moving in an opposite direction, rather than the one indicated by the agreed negotiations. In this framework, I think this debate today about the role that the European Union can play in this process is crucial. That is why I decided to go in my first week in office, because we are the first trade partner for Israel and we are the first donor for the Palestinian Authority. We can be the first political player in the region to facilitate a dialogue, which has to be a direct dialogue between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but which maybe, for the first time really, has the chance of becoming regional. I saw during my visit – and I have shared this with the Member States of the European Union too – the fact that maybe we have for the first time such a dramatic threat and challenge in the region, in the Middle East– namely Daesh – that poses the actors in the region with a different set of priorities. I saw an awareness both in Israel and in Palestine that the order of priorities is changing, not only in the region but also in Europe, and also on the other side of the Atlantic, also for the international community, and that we have a clear possibility there of uniting different actors which now share the same concern for the security and stability of the region. We have threats in the regional framework today, but maybe we also have an opportunity coming out of these threats. On the other side, the vacuum that is there and which risks being even more relevant, especially in Gaza, given the regional framework, could lead to even more dangerous outcomes. The situation in Gaza will either get better on the ground or there is a risk that it will open the way for a more worrying situation, in terms of who controls what in that territory and who networks with whom in the region. That is why I think it would be wise from my side today not only to listen to you in the debate, but also to try to give you some input on what kind of political elements we can have, as the European Union, to restart a peace process, to restart a political process – a political perspective. I will start with the regional framework. I believe that in 2002, the Arab Peace Initiative was probably a missed opportunity. Today that could constitute one of the elements of a renewed effort, regionally and internationally, to put actors around the table. We know that we have a Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but we also know that we have an Arab-Israeli conflict that we have to work on. Maybe this set of threats and opportunities in the region could give us an opportunity to work on the Middle East peace process on a broader scale and include, in particular, not only the Arab League  – which will have the ministerial meeting this weekend and which is certainly listening carefully to the messages coming out of here today – but also some key Arab countries: certainly Egypt, not only for the role that it has played historically and in the past months, but also because it has a certain leverage on Gaza through Rafah, and also Jordan, as it has a special role regarding the status of the holy sites in Jerusalem. I would also mention Saudi Arabia as the initiator of the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002. I can share here with you the thoughts that I shared with the Member States during the last Foreign Affairs Council on the need to have a European Union initiative, together with the Arab League and Arab States, in particular, and with the US – I am in constant contact with John Kerry, who is renewing his commitment to reopen the way for negotiations – and with the UN, also because we know that the UN Security Council could be a way to redefine the framework of an initiative. I would mention the UN Security Council with a view to having a resolution that would not split, but rather unite, the international actors to find a solution. The European Union effort is at the same time trying to put that framework together. I will not just take into account but I will take note of your debate today, because I believe that the parliamentary debates – and then if you are going to take a vote on this next month – can fit into the process of a European common approach. You know very well that the recognition of a state is not within the competences of the European Union. Technically and politically this is the responsibility of individual Member States, but I would never say to you – in the same way that I have not said this to the Ministers of the Member States when we had the Foreign Affairs Council last week – I would never say that this is not my business. This is obviously technically not my business, but politically it is, because I believe that we need – and I appreciate the drafts that I have seen of the resolutions that encourage me to do so – to share a vision and to share a common understanding of the situation and also, if we can also manage it – and I think Parliament can help us in that – to shape a common European approach of national initiatives that could go in the same direction. In this I think that this Parliament can play a very important role. That message is coming across today. I will take the opportunity to reply at the end of the debate, but it is also important for me today to listen to the orientation that is coming from the European Parliament, knowing that only if we manage to take into account all the different views and try to make a common view from these different views – coming from both different political groups and different Member States – will we have the chance to fully play our role in the region. Only if we send united messages as the European Union in the region can our potential really be used. Here also comes a good leverage that you have in terms of parliamentary diplomacy. Do not under estimate it. I will do all that I can, and I know that you know that you can count on that. But you also have some instruments, some important instruments, in your daily or weekly or monthly contacts with the counterparts there. If we manage to send a united and strong message, we probably have a chance of influencing the course of the events in the Middle East. I would like to state what our common position is already: sometimes we just refer to the two-state solution as a slogan, and I think it is useful to say what this means. Because I was surprised by the fact that, when I said when I was in Israel and Palestine that we need a Palestinian State, surprise! Well, the two-state solution means that we have to have an Israeli State that is able to live in security – and this is an issue we have to deal with – and also a Palestinian State that we do not have at the moment. So I said publicly that we can discuss the recognition of a Palestinian State. Some Member States are doing that in national parliaments; you are going to have a debate in this Parliament and I will be listening to your orientation very carefully. National governments are going to take decisions, or not, at this time or later, but the important thing is that we all work together towards the same goal with the most effective instruments, coordinating these instruments if we manage to. And that is my responsibility, to achieve these results, and these results are the creation of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with swops if agreed, with Jerusalem as capital of the two states, and this has already been agreed; this is a central common historical position. But I think it is right that we go into the details of what our historical position is, to remind ourselves what a two-state solution means, with the right of Israel not only to exist but to exist in security and safety and peace in the region, and with all the Palestinians – all the Palestinians, whether in the West Bank, in Jerusalem or in Gaza – having one state finally. I am looking forward to listening to your contributions to that and I will take note of them in this framework, that of someone who knows very well that opinions which are expressed in Parliament, even if they are not, as in this case, targeted at an imminent decision that can become operational – because it is not in the power of the European Parliament, as it is not in the power of the High Representative/Vice-President, to recognise a state – it is our common responsibility to work together to achieve the goal that I just stated: the creation of a Palestinian State within this framework and working with Israel to guarantee peace and security in the region. I believe – I said that to the Israelis and I said it also to the Palestinians, and I am saying also to the Arab countries in the region – that there is no way of having security if we do not have a Palestinian State, and there is no way of having a Palestinian State if we do not guarantee stability, security and peace to the Israelis too. That is the very same concept, the core of the efforts that the European Union has always worked on. Today it is probably more difficult than ever, but sometimes, when it is more difficult, people around the table realise that a plus of political will and internal leadership is needed and they might make an effort in that direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 423, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Elmar BROK", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been a member of the European Parliament. The majority of Palestinians and the majority of Israelis want peace, want peace on the basis of a two-state solution. But there are forces on the Palestinian side, especially Hamas, which does not want a two-state solution and is using violence in Gaza. And there are circles in The Society of Israel who do not want this either, and who also partly sit in the government and do not want a two-state solution. We currently have a situation that is once again becoming dangerous: on the one hand, Gaza must be opened up so that it can develop, and on the other hand, Israel has a right not to be fired rockets from Gaza. Both belong together. The fact that we have the matter of the Temple Mount, as well as the attack on the synagogues, shows how dangerous it is when politics and religion are mixed together and where additional radicalization is brought about. The question of settlements also speaks for itself. Our goal is a two-state solution with a secure Jewish state of Israel and a viable state of Palestine. This can only be done on the basis of mutual recognition, as the High Representative made clear at the very end of her speech. One thing requires the other, therefore one cannot recognize the one beforehand, if not everything else is given, but this connection must be seen clearly.  The idea of bringing the United States and the United Nations more involved and acting on the principle of \"we wouldn't like to be just the biggest donors we want to be a player there\" means that the European Union now has more political initiative to take here. I also believe that the responsibility of the Arab states for this peace process – some of which are proxy wars that are taking place – is of great importance and that the appropriate capacity must be achieved here to resolve this conflict, which is becoming increasingly important in these days far beyond the region. For this reason, I hope that we will be able to work out a common position on the basis of our resolution.

It is an attempt to break the deadlock in which the viability of the two-state solution is increasingly questioned to avoid a new apartheid, which some say is already here. We used to talk about a roadmap, but that has been forgotten. This is an attempt to restart the journey. To our Israeli friends, your representative called this move giving Palestinians a state on ‘a silver platter’. Some platter! But, as my own party has said in Britain, Palestinian statehood is not a gift to be given, it is a right to be recognised. Our move today is supported by former Israeli Ambassadors to France, Turkey and South Africa, the former Israeli Attorney General and the former Speaker of the Knesset. They are not anti-Israel and, I promise you, neither are we. My group absolutely joins the condemnation of the horrendous Har Nof synagogue bombing, but the conclusion we draw from this and other terrorist acts is that status quo is not guaranteeing peace and security for the Israeli people. To those who have argued for delay this week, why should parliaments in Spain, France, Sweden, Ireland, the United Kingdom and now Denmark take the initiative, but not this European Parliament? To my friends in the European People’s Party, your current offer is to say that recognition can only be the outcome of successful talks, but that is only restating what is already the case. We share your concern that this must be a contribution towards talks, and I restate our willingness to find with you a good compromise on this point. To our Palestinian friends, we recognise that you have held back on asking us to do this until now, and we recognise that international recognition is vital to maintaining hope amongst your people to sustain political support for peace. Why should the European Parliament act? Because there is impatience at the continued settlement-building and despair at the continuing death toll. Because, as we have already heard from Mrs Mogherini, EU foreign ministers are discussing this, and there are merits to a common EU approach.

For as long as I have been an MEP, the debate as to how we can in fact realise this objective has been a matter of fierce exchange in this House and elsewhere. My group, the ECR, accepts that lasting peace can only be achieved when all sides return to the negotiating table in order to bring about a two-state solution. We support this two-state solution as being the only feasible outcome for long-term peace and stability, and we are fully committed to working towards the eventual recognition of a sovereign, independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state, which may peacefully co-exist alongside Israel, based on the 1967 borders with land for peace swaps. However, I personally have deep concerns regarding whether this particular motion today, for unilateral recognition of Palestine, is premature. The dual needs of mutual recognition and concrete security arrangements on the ground, which are of paramount importance in achieving peace, would not be addressed by EU Member States granting immediate symbolic recognition to a fledgling Palestinian state. Furthermore, there are fears that this resolution might endanger peace by facilitating a hardening of the Palestinian position towards more intransigence and preventing lasting mutual recognition. This will all require much compromise in order to achieve the final agreement. As such, unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state at this stage would, in my view, arguably not assist in bringing Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas to the negotiating table, but might actually result in pushing the two sides further apart. We must recognise the Palestinian state at a time most helpful to the peace process. But firstly we must resolve the question of Gaza under Hamas, which is an EU-designated terrorist organisation. Whilst I have serious reservations as to whether this resolution is a good idea at this time, solving this issue will nevertheless remain a foreign policy priority for the ECR, and I agree with you, Madam Vice-President/High Representative: the 2002 Arab peace initiative is a very good place to start the negotiations, even today, a decade later.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 428, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Fernando MAURA BARANDIARÁN", "mepid": "125039", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, the distrust of European citizens over the institutions of the Union, considered distant, excessively bureaucratic and slow, aged, without the capacity for reaction, has been growing over the past few years.

We Europeans, who have distinguished ourselves by the defence and promotion of human dignity against the multiple violences and discriminations of just causes, who have distinguished ourselves by raising our voices when necessary, are once again out of the task. I would even say that we put interests back before the fundamental values of European thought. However, I do not resign myself.

We must be at the forefront. Ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Parliament's courageous announcement to recognise the State of Palestine must be the beginning of a new wave of international recognition that we must support. Our influence cannot continue to be shaped by sending large amounts of public resources to rebuild a region every time Israelis and Palestinians come into conflict. We must lead international pressure in the search for a solution based on the creation of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, coexisting in peace, security and prosperity. A solution that the European Parliament has been advocing for years, decades. And it is therefore our political responsibility to help that solution materialize as soon as possible.

Thank you, Madam High Representative, for expressing your openness to note the results of this debate and to take it into consideration in your further steps. I especially welcome your call for a united and strong message coming from this very Chamber, but let me just tell you that the united and strong message that you, Madam, expect from us could have come forward more easily had we had the opportunity to debate a resolution with this debate. The fact that we cannot debate a resolution seems to be a result of a slight majority at the time on Monday but I very much hope that the result of the debate will change the minds of many of those who voted to remove the resolution from the table. I understand what my colleagues on the Right are saying: that we have to do a lot for a comprehensive peace settlement, we have to help both the Palestinians and the Israeli side in regard to going back to the negotiating table and achieving a lasting result, and I understand that we are far from it. There is a lot to do. Nobody denies that and we Greens very much hope that the EU will be among the most important partners to help bring that about. But for the life of me I cannot understand how that can be hampered, how that can be objected to, by actually recommending to the Member States recognition of the Palestine State on the basis of the 1967 borders now. It is just not me that does not understand that. Let me offer you a quote: ʽRecognition of Palestine would help to preserve the two-state solution’, which is the policy of all responsible political parties in Europe. ‘It would reward and encourage moderation’ on both sides. This does not come from what my Conservative friends sometimes call the loony left; it does not come from a raving anti-Semitic extreme right. It actually it comes from Sir Vincent Fean who served as British Consul-General in Jerusalem for four years. I cannot get a higher authority on that except possibly Alon Liel, a former Director-General of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who shares these thoughts.

Because it is an act due to the Palestinian people, but it is also in the Israeli interest; above all, it is an ethical, historical and political necessity, a master wall in the house of peace. But when we debate recognition in this House and someone subordinates it to peace, we must remind ourselves that these are two quite different situations. The recognition of a state is the responsibility of the international community; the peace process between Israel and Palestine, on the other hand, concerns their peoples. We must not get confused. That is why the preventive conclusion of peace would be useful, but it cannot be an essential condition.  The negotiations must be on an equal legal as well as a political basis. But recognising a State means giving it not only rights but also specific duties, because a true state must have a legitimate and democratic government, which guarantees the security of its territory and is capable of disarming sectarian and extremist organisations. The Palestinian people cannot do this alone. He needs our presence and experience, not just our money. We're their neighbors. If we do not assume these real responsibilities, we will deceive the Palestinians, we will deceive the Israelis and ultimately we will lie to ourselves. After 66 years we cannot downgrade this opportunity to a miserable attempt to wash our consciences. Before it, the future Palestinian State has two paths, the two extreme opposites of today's Islamic world: on the one hand, the lucidly fanatical absolutism of the so-called – and unfortunately also seductive, for many – Islamic State; on the other hand, the wonderful example of the Republic of Tunisia, which has begun brilliantly on the laborious path to full democracy. As a member of our delegation during its legislative and presidential elections, I can testify to this with my own eyes. That is why I hope that this Parliament will be able to pay tribute to the great effort, the great enthusiasm of the Tunisian people.  These are the two ways ahead.

The Communist Party's position is that the fight to end the Israeli occupation and to create an independent, viable and sovereign Palestinian state on the 1967 border, with East Jerusalem as its capital, must be strengthened. We must also tear down the unacceptable wall, free the political prisoners, end the settlements and leave the settlers with the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes.

As I said in Monday's procedural discussion, the European Parliament is divided on this issue. I think we have a fundamental divergence of views. Among the proponents of the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state, the prevailing view is that this unilateral act is in fact a tool to restart the flu-like engine of peace negotiations on the conflict in the Near East. Defenders of this vision argue that Palestine would thus have a better position in the negotiations. However, this view is, in my view, flawed, because it clears the negotiation process of content.  What good is it to negotiate, if one of the points we had to agree on, namely the existence of a Palestinian state, is already decided? I do not think that we serve at all, through such immediate recognition, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, we are only dividing and antagonizing the two sides further and showing that the negotiations are unnecessary.

You were talking about the two-state solution. That does not, logically, presuppose a Palestinian state next to a Jewish state.

In fact, although you were asking for input into your considerations, I am afraid you are seeing the reality, which is that this House is split. I do appreciate what you said, which is that, while you do not have sufficient competences in this respect, you do see this as your business. I also appreciate that you said there should be an attempt at a common approach in this respect. I think that, as with any other area in the European Union, whenever there is a deadlock – deadlock in the Council, deadlock in the Parliament – the Commission, and in this case the Vice-President and the High Representative, has a unique opportunity to provide leadership. That is what we would be looking for. You spoke of a draft – or input to a – common approach. We would very much welcome it if you came in the very near future with somewhat more detailed elements of this possible common approach. We would definitely be happy to debate it, and I am sure that this common approach can be based on what you have said. There will be no peace without a Palestinian State; there will be no Palestinian State without security for Israel. I had more points to make today, but you have taken them out of my mouth, which is positive.

The situation in Israel and Palestine is deteriorating day by day and there is no indication that the Israeli Government wants peace. Contrary! It is now proposing an outright apartheid law and there are constantly more settlements being built, now at full speed in East Jerusalem, too.  So far, neither the United States nor the European Union has tried to stop this dangerous madness, and now Jerusalem is becoming a war zone. And so it is not just because of the horrific violations of the Islamic Shrine of Al-Aqsa on the Temple Mount.  The EUROPEAN Union must and can act quickly and properly.  Let us listen here to the representatives of the 730 prominent Israelis who are in Strasbourg today to call us out. They call on us to recognise Palestine. Such recognition will give hope to the Palestinians and can avert desperate violence. Recognition is an essential condition for the negotiations between Israel and Palestine to take place on fair terms and, therefore, to get off to a good start at last.  Recognition must be now! To make it conditional on peace negotiations is to give Israel a veto, which is both stupid and very immoral: to impose conditions on the occupied rather than the occupiers!

Two governments, two entities, one of which is a terrorist movement and recognized as such; how are we going to get around that reality and how can we also accept that we are granting this status today to those who refuse to recognize the State of Israel?  I am convinced, Mrs Mogherini, that there is no alternative.

The vote on a clear resolution of our Parliament recognizing the Palestinian state would be a strong act, an act for peace and justice. Israel has its state and its security must of course be guaranteed. But what is missing today is a state for the Palestinian people. The debate we have today stems from the impasses of the Oslo process and, therefore, from the need that we now do it differently and to build on international law, namely UN Security Council Resolution 242 of 29 November 1967, which recognises the territory of the Palestinian State with its capital , East Jerusalem, and Resolution 1860 of January 8, 2009, which confirms this. Only Israeli leaders do not recognize this right, whereas contrary to what has just been said, the PLO and the Palestinian Authority recognize and have recognized the State of Israel. As soon as Palestine becomes a member of the General Assembly of the United Nations, it would be treated on an equal footing, from a legal point of view, in the negotiations that the European Union, the United States and the Arab League should accompany.  Beyond our differences in this Parliament, let us produce this act, let us vote on such a resolution, let us stand on the side of the 137 states that have already recognised the Palestinian state!

There are many years of uncovering and conflict; there are many initiatives, many mediation and negotiation efforts, the last and very intense of Secretary of State Kerry; there are many acts of violence and clashes, for example, what happened in Gaza this summer; and there are many hateful terrorist attacks, such as last week's in the Jerusalem synagogue. After all these long and violent years we are faced with a situation of fed up and concern, without a horizon of a close solution. It is urgent to promote a genuine peace process, with which the parties are truly committed. Unilateral acts must be avoided to hinder this process, for example settlements— which the entire international community rejects. The objective of the negotiations must be the solution of the two States living in peace, security and prosperity. Today, here, as in other Parliaments , among others, recently the Spanish Parliament - we are debating the recognition of Palestine. On this subject, what I want in this forum is to insist that there be rigorous European coordination that demonstrates that there is a genuine European foreign policy. We should not repeat what happened, for example, at Unesco. Ladies and gentlemen, it is not for this Parliament to recognise States, obviously, but to declare that serious peace negotiations are urgently launched and that the European Union is involved in them.

First of all, as you said, it is a question of highlighting the important role of the European Union, that is, being a major player of choice in the region. Therefore, we will have to make clear our desire to recognize the State of Palestine in order to contribute to the coexistence of two states: the State of Palestine and the State of Israel. There will necessarily also be clarifications to be made on territorial boundaries, colonization, the status of the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, the capital of both states. We will also have to indicate that we are not alone in this will and this search for peace, we have with us Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United States, the Arab League , as you have also said , and, of course, we must make sure that we ask the United Nations Security Council to take this will and this research into its own hands.  Why recognize the State of Palestine? There are places where symbols matter more than others, and I believe that the European Parliament is one of those places. Our political duty is to bring about peace in the Middle East and, therefore, the coexistence of these two states.

I think we will have to go back to this document as one of the basics and a framework for a peaceful solution to the problem. We, here in the European Parliament yesterday, postponed the position on the recognition of a Palestinian state. I would say that it is more than obvious that politicians are lagging behind their own public and for voters who want faster peace in the Middle East, faster solutions, lasting security solutions, both for Israel and for its Arab neighbours, and for us. The status quo is unacceptable, leading to an escalation of violence, the courageous ness of the Israeli government and the humiliation of the Palestinians. The recognition of a Palestinian state at the moment may not be the only, perhaps not optimal move, but it will help to create the dynamics of the process that stands now. If Israel and the Palestinians want to do so, this dynamic will lead to a solution.

Against the recognition of such a state for the Palestinian people, a number of my eminent colleagues have said that perhaps we could consider returning Palestine to Jordan. But the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has long since abandoned its rights to the West Bank. In these conditions, what can be done? Can we be satisfied with the status quo? I have heard from a number of our colleagues who say that recognition of the Palestinian state will not be enough to restore peace. It is obvious, but will maintaining the status quo be enough to restore peace? I am quite surprised, moreover, because I have heard from Czech, Polish colleagues from countries which, for a very long time, have been occupied by others, and in an extraordinarily painful way often, and have had great difficulty in having their independence and sovereignty recognized but who are very hostile to the recognition of the same independence when it comes to the Palestinian people.  I will, of course, be objected to terrorism, which is quite reprehensible, but it is clear that terrorism feeds on despair. I will be objected to the lack of recognition of Israel by the Palestinians but, as I know, this recognition took place in 1993 and even Hamas recently placed itself under the banner of the government of Mr. Mahmoud Abbas.

In the last two years, however, all we have noticed is an increase in Israel's aggression, thousands of raids and massacres of civilians, a continuation of occupation of the Palestinian territories and a continuation of their settlement. There is no doubt that the law is on the side of the Palestinians, who are fighting, although not always in the most cadet ways, to gain the right to a homeland of their own, even if it has now shrunk to 22% of its original area. Many experts have tried all this time to find solutions to stop the carnage at some point; I don't know. War operations, rather than diminishing, are thickening. But the Palestinians deserve a state of their own, and that is not my observation, but a demand of 135 countries that have recognised that state.

More than not, to those who have complained here today that we should let states do their job and that the European Union should not meddle, perhaps it is good to reflect that, after so many centuries of state failures in managing the conflict in the Middle East, it would perhaps be appropriate for the European Union to be given the opportunity to seek peace where states have already demonstrated their failure.

The unconditional recognition is a signal that the outcome of negotiations can be achieved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without talks between the parties. This is contrary to the EU's fundamental view so far that bilateral negotiations are the only way to lasting peace and an independent Palestinian state. Against recognition, serious obstacles to international law also speak. Today, in fact, there is no Palestinian state. As a result, the criteria for recognition of the International Montevideo Convention are not met. The prerequisites for recognition are that a new State controls its own territory and has resolved any border disputes. That is not the situation today. Recognition of a state is not a gesture or a political endorsement in general. It is a statement of facts under international law. In this House, therefore, we must refrain from populism and from the irresponsibility of the spirit of the Swedish Government. In the name of decency, we as a Parliament cannot ignore the fact that the Palestinian territories are largely controlled by Hamas. Hamas' goal is to wipe out the state of Israel. By the EU, Hamas is branded a terrorist organisation.  The serious situation right now, when we speak, in the Middle East requires political responsibility and a Europe that acts together.

Europe must help to find a solution that meets the economic and humanitarian security needs of Israelis and Palestinians, working towards the resumption of the negotiation phase. The recognition of the Palestinian State can make a decisive contribution to peace in the Middle East. This issue is measured by the European Union's desire to become indeed an important and decisive player in the international political arena.

I was surprised when I heard that many of you were thanking me – that is part of my responsibility and my role to be here. It is also useful for me being here and listening to this debate, but I will get to our institutional and political relationship at the end, when I will maybe touch upon the way forward, as some of you have rightly mentioned the need for joint work in the future. Let me start by saying very sincerely and from my heart that this debate this afternoon shows not only that this is, as some of you mentioned, one of the most difficult issues on foreign policy in Europe – I am afraid we might have many of those – but it is definitely not the easiest one to start with. However, on the other side, let me very frankly say that this debate this afternoon mirrors the debate that is there in the region, and this is worrying to me because I think that this debate this afternoon shows that our frustration, and even our sense of desperation, is deep, and that we risk being trapped in the false illusion of us needing to take one side. We could not make a worse mistake than this. You will never convince me – and I am sure that the majority of you in this House do not want to convince me – that you can be pro-Israeli without also being pro-Palestinian and that you can be pro-Palestinian without being pro-Israeli. The best way of helping the Israeli people is to build a Palestinian state, and the best way of helping the Palestinian people is to secure Israel’s security. We have the responsibility to facilitate the dialogue between two camps, and in the two camps to strengthen those that want dialogue and want and understand that they have to live together, share a land and share an interest. If we lose lucidity, if we lose our capacity not to be trapped within the conflict ourselves, we lose our possibility to play this role – and there are not many international actors that are able to play this role, so we are bearing with us a responsibility. In this conflict there are two things that are dangerous. The first, as someone said, is that it has gone on for too many decades. When I was born this conflict had already started. We are getting used to it, and this is dangerous. The second element that is worrying and is making things very complicated is that there is too much history and too little future in the debate. Barbara Spinelli was saying that we in Europe are somehow responsible. We bear a historical responsibility as Europeans for part of the roots of this debate, and so here it comes: a debate among us that mirrors the historical debate, sometimes going back hundreds of years, concerning how to get out of this trap. I will always remember one of the best conversations I had in the region, and that was not with politician but with a novelist, who told me that we are trapped in a bubble. We need someone from the outside to burst the bubble and let us out. And this is our role. This can be our role if we keep the awareness of the responsibility that we bear. It is not only a historical responsibility but, to me, it is a responsibility for the future. So I am – and I will always be – a friend of Israel and a friend of Palestine and will always work to show that this is the only way to be friends of both and of each of them. I would really like us to manage to develop this awareness together, because this is what the Israelis and the Palestinians need in order for us to convince them and to help them, as they are not friends. It is difficult, but at least it makes it possible for them to share their land and their future. What is our role? It is not interference. I heard someone say that we should not interfere and that it is not for the European Union to do anything about this. This is either for the Member States or we should leave them alone. Our role is also to take care of our neighbourhood, our region. These are our neighbours – for many of our Member States, many other countries and for us. It is our sea – the Mediterranean; the Middle East is close, and our relations with both the Palestinians, the Israelis and many of the countries that are concerned by the conflict are so strong that this is our business. Definitely so. So it is not a matter of interference but one of playing our role in a responsible and effective way. I heard many of you referring to the fact that we have to discuss the recognition of the state and discuss the negotiations. Still I feel that many of you might share my vision, which is that neither the recognition of the state nor even the negotiations are goals in themselves. The goal is having a Palestinian state in place and having Israel living next to it. Some of you have said that I do not have an answer, and maybe we all, as an international community, still do not have a complete answer about what are the right steps to take and in what order. I think the debate this afternoon reflects this very well – this questioning ourselves. What is the right order in which to take our steps? What is clear in my mind is that we cannot just sit and wait, because sitting and waiting is not keeping the status quo. Sitting and waiting is bringing us to the point where we close the doors to further negotiations and to the peace process. It is not going anywhere if we just do not do anything. It is getting worse and worse. What are the steps? In my opinion, and from what I have heard today, I see as an element of my future work to strengthen inside the two camps the political leaders and the communities – not only the political leaderships but also the communities, because society has a role to play here – that are committed and that are capable of delivering peace and working on peace. Elmar Brok mentioned the fact that not everyone – in Israel or in Palestine – wanted two states. We have to be aware of that, because more and more people, both on the Palestinian side and on the Israeli side, are talking about a one-state solution. We have to be aware of that. It has not come out here but it is coming out there. It might not be the case that our vision for the future will stay the same for decades. It is deteriorating for us as well. So first, find better ways to support those internally in the two camps that are committed and help them show their own public opinion that this path is delivering for their own public opinion. This is the big question mark that we have to find an answer to. What is the best way to strengthen and make credible the people who on both sides still believe that peace is possible there? Second, I believe, as some of you have recalled, that we have to work with the region. This sounds familiar today; it was not as normal only a few years ago, and that is why the peace initiative in 2002 did not go far. Now this is something we all agree on; we need to work with the countries and the region. Some of you, including Ms Alliot-Marie, have invited me and others to come back here with a detailed plan or even set it out today. I think it would probably not be serious enough from my side after three weeks in office to come to this Chamber and give you my detailed plan for peace in the Middle East. You would not believe me, and you would be right. What I can share with you today is the main political elements of the efforts that the European Union is making, which are the ones that I described in the beginning and some of those that I am underlining now, and a road map – although a road map with the Middle East is not really working – but a plan, a way, steps that we can work on, and the commitment to come back here in this Chamber and update you on the steps taken, given the fact that I believe the European Union has a role to play – but not alone. Because we have to be aware of the fact that, yes, we do have a role to play without necessarily sitting and waiting for others to call us to a table. We can initiate processes but we need to work with those international actors, starting with the United States and the Arab countries and the UN and the UN Security Council, to work together to restart a process. And I would mention here a country that no one in this room mentioned, but it is there in the UN Security Council and in the Quartet: Russia. Not for the sake of negotiations; this is another trap we have to escape. Negotiations are something good, because while we have a process going on, violence is less likely to happen. But I believe that we also run the risk of calling for negotiations again for the sake of the process, and this is eroding the credibility of the process itself. We need the process to bring a result, especially on the Palestinian side – but also on the Israeli side. The criticism about the process and the talks is: yes, but what does it bring to our people? We need to make sure that the process and the talks deliver something very concrete for both parts, not in the far future but immediately. In this framework we can discuss further, and we will do it. For sure you will do it here in this Chamber. We will do it also with the Member States and we will do it also with our partners internationally, because I believe that all our diplomatic efforts need to be made together with the others. I will mention another point that was raised by someone. We have two other challenges that are really European ones. One is anti-Semitism. I know you are working on that already, but I would be ready to work with you on that because I think we have a major challenge there that puts at risk our own sense of communities in Europe. And we have a parallel risk, which is that of Islamophobia, when we tend to associate in our societies Islam and terrorism or Arab societies and terrorism. We have to decouple the religious element and the political element, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe, and I think here we have a cultural and not only a political challenge that we could face. I know very well that, as the European Parliament is for me a central body of the European institutions, it also has its autonomy and I would respect it, so my attitude today and for tomorrow and for the next five years, as we share the period of mandates, is and will always be to share, to listen, to decide together, if not officially politically, but to respect your autonomy. The decision whether to take a vote on the resolution or not is your decision; it is not my decision and can never be my decision. I will always respect your decisions; I will always respect the outcome of your decisions and try to work together hand in hand. As someone was saying, I will also try to be as innovative as possible and hope that you can help me in this. I would invite you to use your power – which is not a little one, it is a big one – to support and shape this role of the European Union in the Middle East. I believe it is up to you to work on a united, strong and useful resolution or decision. (Murmurs of disagreement) I am sorry; I know that it is boring. But I think that you can leave if you are too bored. I think this would not just be a reflection of your debate; this could be a useful political tool for the European Union. So be aware of the fact that this is going to be, as many of you have mentioned, a real contribution to the role and the work that the European Union can do in the Middle East. Do not waste it. Use it carefully, wisely, but use it in a way that can work on the results that we need.

Formal recognition must be accompanied by a European effort to support the functioning of a state in Palestine, capable of providing security to the region, including Israel. The EU must make Israel feel that it no longer tolerates the policy of oppression and occupation to which the Palestinian people have been subject since 1967 – a policy that plays the game for extremist forces such as Hamas. The EU-Israel Partnership Agreement should be suspended for as long as illegal occupation is maintained. With no end to the occupation, Palestine will not be safe ground – for Palestinians and Israelis. The European Union must counter the reactionary rhetoric of Benjamin Netanyahu's government.

At present, the main challenge is to end violence, to end acts of terrorism and to create political conditions for peace negotiations, in which recognition of Palestinian statehood is an important instrument, but not an end goal. Recognition can serve the cause of lasting peace if the logic of Hamas terror is broken. If not, we can continue to count on new acts of terrorism fuelling the vicious circle of violence and, on the other hand, hamas tactics that undermine the Palestinian government as a negotiating partner with meaningful influence and as an effective state administration.  Europe, working with the international community and leading its efforts, must use the time gained by postponing our resolution on recognition, precisely to eliminate these conditions and reduce the terrorist threat. In the absence of political conditions, recognition on the part of the EU may prove counterproductive not only from the point of view of the peace process: as a Hungarian MEP, I must point out that in some Member States, typically in Central and Eastern Europe, it can also provide ammunition to extremist, neo-Nazi political forces who support it purely on anti-Semitic motives and thus harm the perception of the Palestinian cause.

Last year’s prize went to Malala Yousafzai, who this year won the Nobel Peace Prize together with Kailash Satyarthi, who worked on the right to education and children’s rights. I believe that this means Parliament is keeping a very open and effective eye on the protection and promotion of human rights. Last week we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I welcome the unprecedented global support for the Convention. You know that the European Union has a treaty objective to promote the protection of the rights of the child. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child guides the EU at the moment throughout its actions in realising the rights of the child, as included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. You know too that it is the most ratified human rights convention worldwide. All the European Union Member States have ratified it, which means that, indirectly, the rights are binding not just for the Member States but for the action of the European Union as such. Let me refer here to a letter that I have received from some Members of this Parliament asking for a ratification of the Convention by the European Union. That would turn respect for the rights of the child from an objective to a legal obligation. Let me say at the outset that I am ready to work with Commissioner Jourová to look at and examine the possibilities of proceeding in this direction and explore them. Let me also say that I very much welcome Parliament’s initiative to adopt a resolution on this issue, and I appreciate the efforts of the Italian Presidency to have the Council adopt conclusions on the promotion and protection of children’s rights in early December. Within the European Union we have done a lot. I am sure that you are all aware of the progress that has been made on internal policies in this area. But I know very well that under my responsibility lie, in particular, the steps that we still need to take on implementation and the work that we can do outside the European Union, especially when we see how many children in the world are victims of violence, war and rights violations, how many children are mostly affected by poverty, and how many children flee from their countries for different reasons. I really believe that we have a responsibility to take in our external action. I was looking at the figures, and I was satisfied to see that today, children’s rights are a priority in 86 of the EU delegations in the world and 116 have prioritised gender-related issues. We also know very well that the two elements are sometimes are interlinked, especially in the work that we do around the world. We have been working very closely with UNICEF, especially in developing a child rights toolkit which, to mark the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention, all the EU delegations, together with UNICEF country offices, presented around the world last week. In the spirit of the same cooperation we have actively supported the UN campaign ‘Children, Not Soldiers’, jointly initiated by the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, and UNICEF. More than 108 000 children affected by armed conflict have already benefited from the EU decision in late 2012 to use the Nobel Peace Prize to assist children in conflict situations. This EU Children of Peace initiative has been turned into a multiannual assisted programme on education in emergencies with more than EUR 12 million committed since 2012. On child labour, it is encouraging to me – even if only partially – that, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the global number of children in labour has declined in the last 14 years. However, 85 million child labourers aged from 5 to 17 years old are involved in hazardous work, which is one of the worst forms of child labour. We are using our human rights dialogues to encourage countries to sign, ratify and implement – mainly implement – the ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. Let me also refer to the need that we have to make targeted efforts to protect children from female genital mutilation and early and forced marriage. Again here, I refer to what happens inside the European Union and globally, because we tend too often to think that these are problems that happen only far away from us, while we are also responsible for what happens within our European Union. In July there was an important girls’ summit in London, where the EU announced its commitment to allocate more than EUR 100 million for the next seven years to gender equality and children’s well-being. I am personally committed to sticking to that engagement by the European Union and mainly to working on the follow-up to this commitment. We will continue to work in close relation with the UN: with the UN system, with the UN special representatives and envoys, and with other organisations like the Council of Europe. But let me stress mostly the work we can do with civil society organisations, with NGOs, which I value very much as a great possibility for partnership for fruitful cooperation, in particular as we work towards one of the main challenges that we will have for 2015, which is the work on the post-2015 Development Agenda. It is important that children’s rights are completely and fully included in that Agenda and that we find active and effective ways of working on that. I will close here, because I know that the President is worried about the fact that we are running very late. I thank you very much for this initiative. I believe it is extremely important as a resolution. I will conclude by mentioning a paragraph in the resolution, if you will allow me. It is paragraph 28 that calls on the Vice-President/High Representative – again I would invite you, if possible, to refer to my title as it is referred to in the Treaties, i.e. High Representative/Vice-President; nothing personal, nothing political (I will be always be sitting on this side of the hemicycle; I am, and I will be, Vice-President of the Commission, but we have to refer to the Treaties in the right way) – anyway, it calls on me to prioritise children’s rights in all EU external action so as to ensure the effective mainstreaming of children’s rights, including in the context of human rights dialogues, trade agreements, the accession process and the European Neighbourhood Policy and in relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, in particular countries in conflict. I am fully committed to doing that and extremely happy that you asked me to commit to that, because for me, cooperation with you in this field, together with the partners I mentioned, is going to be extremely helpful. I look forward to effective and useful work on this topic in the near future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 518, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  F'isem the PPE group. – Sur President, Rappreżentant Gťoli/Viżi President, huwa ta' pjażir kbir gťalija li kważi 25 sena minn meta żiet iffirmata l-Konvenzjoni tan-Nazzjonijiet Uniti dwar id-Drittijiet tat-Tfal, qed nippreżenta din il-mozzjoni.

We should be careful about the future. Unfortunately, the reality is different, not only in Europe, where many children and young people grow up without perspective. Children are still dying of hunger, especially in underdeveloped countries, and in many regions children are being abused as soldiers. We should have all this in mind when we celebrate today the anniversary of the signing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention contains global standards for the protection of children and establishes the fundamental rights to non-violent education and parental care. The Lisbon Treaty and the EU Charter also require the protection of children's rights. Nevertheless, violence is still allowed in ten Member States in child-rearing. A slap can never be healthy. Violence against children is unacceptable. It is a crime against defenceless people and shakes their primal confidence. It is a crime against our future. Yes, we need legislation that is in line with the UN Convention and, above all, we also need accompanying public campaigns. Children need the feeling that they are welcome and that we consider them to be equal. This includes a willingness to invest in the education system.

This is one of those issues where our political affiliations, ideologies, genders and nationalities should be put aside to focus on how we can really protect and provide for the generations which will follow us. How we treat our children, and those of the most vulnerable, is how we should be judged as a society and as democracies. How well we protect those that do not always have the ability to protect themselves is also how we should be judged as legislators. This Parliament has done a lot of work in the area of children’s rights, but we need to do more. More needs to be done to protect children in the online world, and to protect them from exploitation and bring to justice those who commit the most despicable of crimes. More also needs to be done in our relationship with third countries to see how we can better harness the influence and resources of the EU to protect children in conflict zones. We must end the devastating effects of children being used as soldiers, being trafficked and being torn away from their homes, their families and their childhoods. We must also do more to battle the most basic but serious of challenges such as hunger and poverty, and to make sure children no longer needlessly die around the world from a lack of access to health care. Every child should have the right not to be trapped by their own circumstances, but for their life to be full of potential and opportunities, regardless of their gender, their background, their financial situation, disabilities, ethnicities and religions.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Vice-President, twenty-five years ago, the world made a promise to children to do everything we can to protect them, to promote their fundamental rights, their right to live, their right to survive, their right to grow and flourish, and their right to speak and have their voices heard. This year, as we approach the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is much to be welcomed and to see progress, but there is also reason to be alarmed and concerned. Thousands of children are still lagging behind, thousands of children are being violated every day. I am not talking about what is happening elsewhere, in the world facing war and violence, I am talking about what is happening in Europe, in the 28 Member States of the Union. However, in agreeing to honour the obligations of the Convention, the Governments have committed themselves to defending and guaranteeing these rights and the Vice-President, who has just left us, has made a very interesting step forward in agreeing to help us to ensure that the Union itself, as a Union, signs the Convention.  There are still two problems. First, the detention of children. Article 37 of the Convention stipulates that no child should be unlawfully or arbitrarily deprived of liberty. However, many children, minors, are detained, remanded in custody or in detention, and I am thinking in particular of migrant children. It is unacceptable that these minors should not be considered primarily as vulnerable beings. The second problem is poverty. As the Unicef report points out, 6.5 million children in Europe have fallen into poverty in the space of four years. In conclusion, children are of course our future, we all agree on this, but we must put them at the heart of our priorities and at the heart of our European project.

We must put young people at the heart of policy and encourage their involvement in the decision-making process. We must encourage young adults to vote and make their voice heard, and use their expertise to help to educate, to inform and to make, for example, the internet a safer place.

We trust that the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 framework will also help move things forward.

I trust that we can bring that perspective into the investment package that was introduced to us today. We need to address the inequality of opportunity faced by many, even in the European Union and even in the richest areas, such as London, which has the highest rate of child poverty in the UK.

No one doubts, I think, that Europe is an area of democracy, equality, justice, solidarity, principles, values, but I wonder how we can take pride, when we have not yet been able, using our legislative weapons, to provide full and comprehensive legal protection to the most vulnerable and vulnerable social group, to the continuators of our work, to the children, to those who allow them to fall victim to criminal offences. , criminal acts and social exclusion.

Children still face serious threats to survival, the lack of opportunities for quality education and adequate health and social care. They are victims of the worst forms of child labour, they suffer sexual exploitation and abuse, diseases, armed conflicts and various forms of violence. They are forced into early marriages and have to endure harmful traditional practices. Children belonging to vulnerable groups and children in particularly difficult situations face particular risks and are exposed to discrimination, marginalisation and exclusion, and girls face specific risks and therefore need special attention. As far as the European Union is concerned, therefore, human rights guidelines are needed to build a solid regional framework for work in the European Union for the promotion and protection of human rights in Europe's global external policy, in the field of human rights and in particular on children's rights. In order to achieve this, we need, first and foremost, guidelines on the promotion and protection of children's rights, European Union guidelines on children and armed conflicts, we need to integrate the protection and promotion of children's rights into all policies in the European Union's external relations and in its programmes and activities.

I want to talk about the protection of children on the internet. As you know, the Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates that the child needs special protection, special care and, in particular, appropriate legal protection.  In the real world, it is relatively easy to know when it is a child, first visually; on the other hand, in cyberspace, virtuality and anonymity do not make it as easy to identify a child or a minor. That is why it seems to me that more specialized protection mechanisms are needed.  Hence a first proposal: as cybercrime against children is on the rise, I think it is urgent to think about better codifying the status of minors on the internet. In my opinion, we should consider a more active and energetic collaboration with internet providers, so that the user accounts of minors can be identified as such all over the internet. This is not very difficult to do and would allow many adults who abuse children to be prosecuted on condition of anonymity.  Second proposition: cyberpredation covers the use of the internet for the purpose of communicating online with underage children and manipulating them for criminal purposes, not only to commit sexual abuse - there are other forms of abuse.  That is why, as Canada, the United States and Belgium have already done, it would be appropriate for the European Union to adopt a directive that applies to all Member States and allows the necessary measures to be taken to ensure that any form of cyberpredation is punishable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 530, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "   November 20 is just 25 years since the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which set the standard for the protection of children's rights, was adopted.

As a clear example, I can cite the case of the over-the-course child protection system in Norway, where two boys who are Czech citizens and live with their mother in Norway, were removed on the basis of an anonymous statement from their mother, and even though these allegations proved to be false, these boys were still not returned to their mother and were stuck in the Norwegian system. But there are many such cases.

However, 25 years after the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we are still living in a world where children's rights are trampled underfoot every day. Every year, 2.9 million children still die of hunger, and 72 million children still do not have access to education. And in the EU, too, 20% of all children still grow up in poverty. This situation has worsened dramatically, particularly during the crisis. It is therefore up to all of us to make an effort to change this unsustainable situation.

On the other hand, I would like to tell you about an experience. I recently went to the Donbass and saw the special view that the Kiev government has of protecting children.

The Congolese doctor who was awarded the Sakharov Prize this morning told us that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, unfortunately, people have already become accustomed to seeing the images of violence and all the crimes that are happening there as usual in the media. Unfortunately, we must admit here today that the same thing happens to us in Europe. Babies and children are abandoned weekly in hospitals, in the streets, as in ancient Rome in the imperial forum. They give up and leave them to their fate. Many children are also dying across the Strait, crossing the Mediterranean. And all of this is related to policies which, of course, the European Union must already deal with in a decisive way. I welcome the statements made earlier by the Vice-President of the Commission on the matter, because we also want greater coordination in not only national laws, but also in European legislation so that, whenever we are opening some legislative episode, both this European Parliament and the Commission and all European institutions take into account the rights of vulnerable children , who are defenseless and, indeed, as one colleague acknowledged, without the necessary political support. I believe that here today, in this Parliament, we are finally discussing an issue which is a priority for all, but above all for those children who are abandoned and who have no one's defence. We have solutions. We need to better integrate judicial policies and actions, help Europol to ensure greater coordinated action among all, and also to require that European Union aid, which, for example, goes to third countries, covers above all children in these countries, who do not have such aid, and that it does not reach them because it is lost along the way. As many of my colleagues have also said, it is necessary to defend the rights of children in the world of the internet, this new world, in which they are often not counted.

But there are still many problems relating to the protection of minors both in Europe and outside. We therefore need a strong relaunch of the European Union's commitment in this area, and the resolution proposed to this Parliament goes precisely in this direction, touching on issues that the Community and national institutions will have to face by exercising their competences to the full.  There are many points I would like to be able to focus on, but for reasons of time I shall confine myself to a few which I consider to be particularly important. These include the problem of unaccompanied immigrant minors. In this regard, the resolution clearly states that the duty to protect the child take precedence over any migration policy, thus making explicit a legal obligation already derived from the primary law of the Union. But it is essential that this is clearly reaffirmed because that obligation is often violated or ignored. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has also recently stressed the need for alternatives to the accommodation of the many immigrant children in detention facilities.  Appropriate measures must also be found to avoid or limit the psychological trauma suffered by the children of prisoners or by children forced to live in prison with their imprisoned mother.  Finally, the judicial systems in the Union must be adapted to the special and delicate functions of juvenile justice, which affects more than one million children in Europe every year. In this regard, as rapporteur for the draft directive on procedural guarantees for children under investigation or subject to criminal proceedings, I hope that the European Parliament will soon be called upon to vote on a measure that could serve to build a shared model of juvenile due process.

They're conceived babies before birth. In Slovakia, four NGOs proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of the Conceived Child 15 years ago in order to draw society's attention to the need to also exercise the rights of unborn children. Under the current legislation of several European countries, conceived children have the right to inherit, to be endowed, to have the right to a dignified burial. Yet they are legally denied the right to be born. It must therefore be stressed that every conceived child has an unencumovable and inseparable right to be born, as the Pope emphasised here yesterday.

Austerity policies limit access to basic care. Thousands of refugees are drowning in the sea, including an unbearable number of children. One of the most blatant abuses of child rights is the situation of child refugees. Despite Article 22 of the Convention, children do not receive adequate protection and humanitarian aid. This concerns, among other things, the right to the highest possible level of health at taint. This is particularly dramatic when severely traumatised child soldiers are not entitled to psychological treatment, as in Germany.

More than 700 million women worldwide were married as minors. More than a third of them had not turned fifteen. Nearly a quarter of teenage girls between the ages of fifteen and nineteen – which are seventy million in the world – have been victims of some form of physical violence. One hundred and twenty million girls under the age of twenty—one in ten—have had forced sex. And a third of these victims had no idea that what was wrong with them was an act of violence. Half of the world's teenage girls think it's justified for a man to beat his wife under certain conditions. That is the reality of girls, and perhaps girls should talk more, because they need even more support from the international community. They largely represent the possibilities of many countries to succeed. It will be the women and mothers of the future who will give their lives and those who will be able to educate their sons and daughters.

As a person who advocates the protection of human rights, I want to warn that the rights of many children are being violated, and in particular violation of the basic human right – the right to life – comes to the fore.  Many children are hungry, do not have a home of their own and do not have access to education, which constitutes discrimination. Children of Christians in Syria and Iraq have been kidnapped by ISIS, isis sells them in markets, rapes girls and recruits them, and in some parts of the world children are used as living shields in armed conflicts - which is inadmissible.  In what kind of people we will be, our fathers and mothers play a crucial role in raising us and learning what is good and what is not. I therefore call on the proponents of this resolution to highlight in it the important role of families in the upbringing and formation of children, as explicitly stated by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I must also express a serious reservation towards one segment of the resolution introducing the term 'sexual identity' of a child for which there is no international definition which can cause numerous problems in implementation and lead to unnecessary legal processes at the European Court of Human Rights or the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. If a child reports a discrimination case because they are not allowed to change the sex they seek based on their sexual identity, many European countries will be accused of discrimination because they do not allow their laws, quite justified, for minors to change gender. Therefore, I call once again for changes in the resolution that would exclude the part related to discrimination on the basis of the \"sexual identity\" of the child, but I also call for changes that will put emphasis on the right of the child to grow up in the auspices of the family with the mother and father.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 545, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Anna HEDH", "mepid": "28131", "text": "    Mr President, I would like to begin by congratul The Convention on the Rights of the Child is one of the most important human rights documents in existence.

In 2011, the Commission adopted a communication on an EU agenda for children's rights. Now is the time for us to take the next step: to adopt a full-fledged child rights strategy and an accompanying action plan. It should cover all EU activities both within the Union and beyond. Children and young people's well-being should be taken into account in all measures affecting them. In addition, coordination and resources will also be required.

Do we really need an information impulse every time to think that children need our protection and care, that this is our greatest good? Our youngest generation is our greatest wealth.

In our work, after all, we are preparing solutions that help fight violence against children, their sexual exploitation or forced labour. Let us remember that adults are responsible for all this, and therefore it is our primary duty to prosecute those who commit these heinous crimes.  Therefore, all the countries of the European Union, all law enforcement authorities, public prosecutors' offices in the Member States should cooperate closely with each other.

The Convention emphasises the right of the child to a decent life, to its development and to the care of both parents. Trends show that although most people still think that a complete family with both parents is the best model for raising children, more and more children are born out of wed marriage. In some developed countries, this is even 40%.  The Convention clearly puts the interests of the child at the forefront. It is not intended to interfere with the rights of parents. On the contrary, it emphasises that the family creates the best environment for the development of children and that every child has the right to the care of both parents. According to this principle, decisions on foster family care should also be guided, but not managed.  In this context, I call on the Norwegian authorities to stop restricting the rights of the two Michalak siblings who have been taken from their families despite having a mother and a wider family capable of taking care of them.

Good examples come to us, for example, from Latin America, from countries such as Chile, Argentina or Brazil, where very significant steps have been taken to promote children's rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 557, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "   Mr President, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of this convention, but a few months ago we had to mobilize for the girls abducted by Boko Haram and, a year ago, we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Malala Yousafzai. This shows that nothing is yet won. I would like to emphasize five points. Two hundred and fifty thousand child soldiers are two hundred and fifty thousand children who may never find a place in society and who will reproduce the cycles of violence in which they grew up. The European Union must do all it can for children in conflict situations with initiatives such as the Children of Peace. This brings me to my second point, access to education. Access to education must be guaranteed in conflict situations to prevent children from enlisting in armed groups, but also so that, in reconstruction, the young people who have received an education are those who carry the hopes of a country. Thirdly, I would like to point out that children's rights go hand in hand with women's rights, particularly in the area of health, because there is a strong link between women's health, newborn health and child development. Fourthly, I believe that we need to take more measure of the role of the internet. The internet makes millions of children vulnerable to abuse. Children's rights defenders, including EU Member States, must seize this tool of the internet and improve their cooperation. Finally, it is through the prism of child protection, before that of migration policy, that we must consider the situation of migrant and refugee children while protecting ourselves against criminal networks that would like to take advantage of this priority that we give to the rights of children.

It is undoubtedly the most complete declaration of the rights of the child that has ever been made. It demonstrates a global commitment to the protection of the rights of the child. Since its adoption in 1989, conditions have certainly improved, but indeed there is still a long way to go, because there are so many forgotten and invisible children. It is those children—millions of children around the world—who are vulnerable, those children involved in armed conflict, orphaned children, child soldiers. More than half of the world's victims of human trafficking are children and many deaths of children dying from drinking water difficulties in developing countries could now be prevented. Two hundred million children under the age of five cannot achieve their development because of poverty, and nearly half of people in extreme poverty are children. This data gives us the view that we have a lot of work to do , also in the European Union — because 27% of children are at risk of poverty. Moreover, sexual abuse remains unfortunately a real problem. The lives of thousands of children are at stake and, therefore, the implementation of the Convention and the support of the Union, the Commission, all the institutions and society as a whole would cause thousands of children's lives to stop suffering. That is why the request is to the European Union: to promote the rights of children decisively and to promote them on the international stage.  The European Union has signed the Millennium Declaration, which includes the Millennium Development Goals, which include reducing child mortality. It is to comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In the end, a memory for the most vulnerable children, especially girls, disabled girls, immigrant girls.

Under Article 18, parents have a prior right to raise their child. According to Article 29, they are also intended to ensure that the child's education also develops respect for his or her parents, their cultural identity and values. According to Article 35, they are intended to prevent child trafficking by all means. Today, these provisions are regularly ignored in Europe. Many Member States do not respect the rights and obligations of parents in relation to their own children. This is particularly evident in situations where parents do not agree with aggressive sex education, at which time states do not hesitate to use violence either, only to violate one of the rights of the child guaranteed by this convention. And legalizing surrogacy is just eye-opening to child trafficking. However, we will not find any of this in this resolution. The family is mentioned only twice. Once in relation to family allowances and then in point 23, which talks about bringing families together. Instead of condemning gross violations of children's rights in the European Union, the proposal attempts to make their gender and sexual identities more difficult. In doing so, the Convention defines a child as a person aged between 0 and 18 years of age and sexual identity is not defined at all in international law.

Education and the social care system are primarily responsible for helping to break out of the poverty trap. This system has been continuously downsized over the last 5 years: by lowering the school age from 18 to 16, by nationalisation of the school system, by segregation in schools now openly and directly supported by the State, and by significantly limiting unemployment benefit and converting it into public work, by making housing benefit and free meals available to the most needy children impossible.

However, we were pleased to accept your invitation to comment on the results of the G20. This is a result that we regard as very positive, because it is certainly very consistent with our approach to economic matters, which we have given, we have tried to give and we have proposed during the six months that we are chairing the Council of the European Union. The issue of growth in Brisbane has been taken up by everyone, and I have to say that as Italy we have certainly not suffered from a lack of company. The desire to overcome the unnecessary dualism of austerity/growth was clear and it was above all clear that there was a desire to do more, much more and much better in favour of growth and investment. We need to change the game and we need to focus much more on growth and jobs. This was a summary of the message that came out of the G20.  The central message, which is also found in the summit conclusions, is that the world economy, and in particular the European economy and the Japanese economy, are still a long way from the growth rates they are expected to achieve. The global economy remains vulnerable to possible shocks, and the third point – on which the progress we have made, even recently – has also been underlined– is the need to strengthen the resilience, resilience and resilience of the banking system. From this point of view, the banking union and the stress tests that we have carried out and are carrying out within the European Union have certainly been identified as a very positive step forward. What are the global and possible responses that emerged from the summit? It is certainly necessary to propose a set of growth strategies based on public and private investment, based on stronger promotion of competition and a commitment to increase trade and employment.  Very important is the commitment that all G20 members have made to increase demand, especially through a new internal investment policy, and in general the commitment to create a new regulatory climate that is much more favourable, including new instruments, such as securitisations in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises. The recognition of the serious and serious gap between global investment and real investment is a very clear gap, and it is also this morning's debate that we had when Mr Juncker presented the investment plan. A gap that is very evident in Europe. It has been highlighted by everyone in Brisbane, and that is why the Global Infrastructure Initiative has also been launched in particular for the infrastructure sector.  That's why it's very important, as a further contribution alongside the Banking Union, alongside stress tests, as a further contribution by the European Union – a contribution that was already mentioned, because it was announced by the President of the Commission and all the European members of the G20 – the full and rapid implementation of the investment plan presented this morning by President Juncker and mentioned precisely in the G20 conclusions, which for us is a first response to a broader and new investment policy that we must pursue at European and national level. Another very important issue that is linked to the work we are doing during the six months has been the fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance, in particular the need and importance of taxing the real profits where they are generated. An important reference has been made and much work has been done in Brisbane on the 2015 erosion and profit shifting plan and so-called erosion and profit shifting base.  There has also been a commitment to increase the automatic exchange of information between countries and to complete the necessary legislative processes within the systems of the various countries in order to achieve an exchange of information. The fight against tax fraud, against evasion, even against overly aggressive tax plans, has also emerged. Moreover, this is a priority issue for the European Union, an issue to which the Italian Presidency has made a great deal of effort, and I would just remind you of the progress made on the automatic exchange of information between tax administrations. The last issue of interest to us as Europeans, and this is unfortunately not a good thing, but it does not depend on Europe or on Europeans, is the lack of progress in implementing the reforms already identified in 2010 with regard to the Monetary Fund. international level in this area. This remains one of the top priorities for the G20 and certainly the United States of America has again been required to speed up and commit itself to ratifying those reforms already identified in 2010. Of course, we are now committed to fully following up and implementing those guidelines in which we are fully involved, above all – and I will end here, Mr President – because of the emphasis on growth and the need to change the economic policy approach clearly at a time when Europe and Japan certainly need to do more and better than other partners, who have suffered equally from the crisis but are emerging from it at this time more quickly, and we also think it is more convincing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 578, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am glad of the opportunity to debrief this Parliament on the outcome of the G20 Summit in Brisbane, where President Juncker, President Van Rompuy and I myself represented the European Union. It was the ninth G20 Summit after the launch of the LEADERS process in 2008. Let me state at the onset that I am very pleased with the results of this meeting. Not only are they encouraging and ambitious results from a global governance standpoint, but they also reflect the main – if not all the – desiderata of the EU and, I believe, of this Parliament. Let me emphasis four main points. First, on the global economy. As per G20 mission and tradition, the state of the global economy was the main item on the agenda. The G20 sent a message of confidence while remaining realistic about the current economic outlook. G20 leaders called for a policy mix that strikes an appropriate balance between the need to promote demand, implement structural reforms and act with fiscal credibility. These are the three pillars of our economic policy, so we could not agree more with this recipe. In order to strengthen the recovery, the Australian Presidency focused on identifying measures that should be adopted in order to foster growth, create jobs and support investment. This delivers strong policy coherence on investment between the global G20 level, the EU level and national level, which is most helpful for the current global economy. In this connection, G20 leaders welcomed the Commission’s EUR 300 billion investment package, and the Brisbane action plan notes that the European Union announced in October a major initiative mobilising additional public and private investment over the years 2015 to 2017. This is meant as a strong signal of encouragement for our investment initiative. Leaders also recognised the value of securitisation to help finance small and medium-sized enterprises. Second, tax transparency. Work related to the international tax system was an important deliverable of the summit. Leaders emphasised the importance of taxing profits where they are generated. President Obama said that the work of tax transparency is the G20 at its best, and we agreed with this. The G20 endorsed progress made on the base erosion and profit-shifting initiative of the OECD, which tackles issues such as the importance of transparency to counter harmful tax practices and the taxation of profits generated online by internet companies. Leaders committed to completing this work by the end of 2015. We called for an automatic exchange of taxpayer-specific rulings. Thanks to the support from many other leaders, we succeeded in securing a stronger emphasis on the final communiqué on this important issue. We will keep the matter on the G20 agenda and move ahead in the EU. Third, on trade. The announcement just two days before the summit of an agreement between India and the US on the implementation of the Bali Trade Facilitation Agreement changed the tone of the discussion. As a result of this agreement, leaders could focus on the implementation of the Bali decisions and the perspective of the completion of the Doha Development Agenda. We underlined the importance of robust and effective WTOs as a response to the current and future challenges. We all agreed to discuss ways to make the system work better at the next G20 Summit in Turkey. Finally, on climate change. After a difficult discussion, and with the support of key international partners, we overcame strong efforts to limit the reference to climate change to a bare minimum, which would not be acceptable for us. This was yet another example of the EU and its G20 Member States working together and in unison to uphold and to promote an EU position. We eventually obtained a reference to the need to communicate the intended nationally-determined contributions well in advance of COP 21, and to mobilise finance for adoption and mitigation, mentioning the Green Climate Fund. These are practical steps which should facilitate reaching an agreement at the Paris Conference. You may recall that the starting point of the Australian Presidency was not to mention climate change at all in the G20 context.

I very much welcome the fact that the European Union has already actively promoted this plan in Brisbane. The world often expects positive news from both the European Union and the G20. The two initiatives, the G20 Investment Initiative and the Investment Plan for Europe, are two promising examples. Moreover, we should not forget that credibility is the cornerstone of sustainable growth and jobs. We need to continue the structural reforms that have already been undertaken and to keep them on the right track. The fairness of corporate tax policy is also an important item on the EU and G20 agendas. The Member States have already done a great deal to ensure that Europe plays a leading role in the automatic exchange of tax information. However, we also recognise that the driving force is still a G20 initiative with close OECD cooperation. The globally defined standard for reporting on the automatic exchange of tax data must continue to be promoted on a reciprocal basis, even beyond the G20. The European Parliament wants to go further in terms of transparency, coordination and convergence of corporate tax policy. As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we insist that there should be an understandable, forward-looking and rapid input on so-called extended tax incomes.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would particularly like to thank the Presidency for its comments on tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. After all, the tax practices in individual Member States that have come to light in recent weeks and have been discussed throughout Europe are only the tip of the iceberg. According to a 2012 study, EU Member States lose €1,000 a year in tax fraud and tax fraud. That is almost eight times the EU budget for the current year or, in other words, about three times what the President of the Commission presented to us this morning as an amount for the major investment programme for Europe. It is overdue to act here. The EU must lead the way in this. This is an important first step. However, it is equally important that we actually continue to act and move forward on a global scale. The issue of taxation was therefore rightly on the agenda at the G20 summit. The commitment to a fairer organisation of international tax agreements is a start. However, further steps must now be taken in a timely manner. Let me mention three of them. Firstly, the OECD initiative against profit shifting and tax cuts in the EU and at global level must be taken forward. Profits are taxed where they are generated. Multinational corporations must no longer shift profits from high-tax countries to tax havens in the form of often ridiculously low royalties. To achieve this, we need an automatic exchange of information. Secondly, we need a targeted approach to tax havens. The OECD definition does not go far enough here. A clear definition and a clear set of criteria for tax havens are needed in order to identify them and take action against them. We in the S&amp;D are therefore calling for a blacklist to be drawn up for tax havens across Europe. Thirdly, the fight against money laundering. This, too, must be strengthened. The owners behind often nested letterbox companies must be brought to light. To do this, we need public registers that are accessible to everyone. The overriding objective of all measures must be: even what has often been legal but has been recognised as illegitimate must also be completely and permanently prevented at both European and global level. In other words, tax practices that are illegitimate must also be illegal in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 581, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Anna FOTYGA", "mepid": "28353", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, I would like to thank you for your comments.

After today's announcement, of course we expect this to be significant and that is why we are extremely pleased when we are even more pleased about the need to invest in large projects, but we are even more pleased by the fact that medium and small enterprises are recognized as growth generators. It is also important for us to talk about climate change, about their problems, to talk about the green economy, that is, the Green Climate Fund and what the green industry means today and tomorrow in the world.  Of course, it is important to have a private and public partnership that is also recognized as a growth generator at this summit and of course what colleagues have already mentioned, which is extremely important tax transparency, because there is huge money going around here in the world economy, unfortunately many times that money is not taxed where it should and does not serve in the function of growing the economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 583, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "João FERREIRA", "mepid": "96706", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – The results of the G20 meeting denote, first of all, the degree of depth of a crisis that is far from being overcome.

In the case of Europe, the amount of the aid was EUR 1 million. This is an ambitious project which, if properly implemented, has the potential to achieve the desired objective, namely to create more than one million new jobs within the next three years without burdening Europe with debt. It is, of course, a plan that needs clarification and even detail, because the details matter and because the devil sometimes hides in the details: the European Commission must tell us how the EUR 315 billion is generated. The multiplier is highly ambitious, reaching 15 by leveraging the funds. An even more important question is what will happen to the countries in crisis. President Juncker said today that countries in crisis have priority. The first country to suffer the most serious consequences from the crisis is Greece. What procedure will be followed to ensure that these countries benefit first from the programmes coming from the new Fund? We need to keep and make use of the Commission's initiative because it is very important and because it is a direct response to the G20 commitment. We must also be immediately given clarifications on how the Commission and the European Investment Bank will move in relation to new and innovative financial instruments. What's that going to be?

When such a powerful community comes together, I also expect great solutions, and I do not expect Mr Juncker's sleight of hand with an investment package without fresh money and just a pushback of money, but I expect structural solutions in the financial sector. The first would be that, since it became clear during the 2008 crisis, we have finally made a separation of commercial and investment banks, so that no longer ludicrous bank managers can go to the financial casino with the money of savers and investors, but have the obligation to invest this money only more, and investment banks are separated from it separately. This would bring stability to finance. Secondly, the area of over-the-counter trading must finally be put on a leash, so that we no longer deal with two-thirds of all stock exchange transactions in the area of dark pools, in the area of over-the-counter trading, leaving managers and banks free to trade and there to be ever larger, uncontrollable, non-transparent structures.

Brisbane was a G20 Summit with a significant number of deliverables. We have strong coherence on global economic policies, which should help to foster recovery in Europe too. Several speakers also raised the question of security in a context of the situation in Ukraine, and while this has not been a part of the official G20 agenda, it was discussed very much indeed on the side-lines of the G20 Summit, and President Juncker also had a serious conversation with the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Putin, as regards Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

Mr Mach and Mr Simon referred in particular to the need to combat tax evasion and avoidance. Of course we must do this, we must do it at G20 level, we must do so in the new European legislature, where it will be essential to eliminate tax havens and combat tax evasion and avoidance, to do so globally and to take the necessary measures within the European Union as well. That was the meaning of our commitment during the Presidency. I would remind you once again of the important agreement on the exchange of information between tax administrations and cooperation between administrations, which was reached in October and which will be formally adopted in December. Mr Martin referred to the need to promote the trade agenda both multilaterally and bilaterally. On the fringes of the G20, the United States, together with European leaders, reaffirmed the importance of making all possible and necessary efforts for an ambitious conclusion of TTIP, and we have also confirmed this to the Council. During our presidency, we have worked to make very significant progress, practically reaching the goal of the trade agreement with Canada, and we have also made progress with regard to Singapore and Japan. These are the issues which you, Mr Simon, have mentioned and which I fully agree with. Mr President, I would like to make a very important Jakovčić referred to the figure that was right to remember, because that is the reference point from which any proposal not of economic theory but of concrete economic and social policy must start, that is, 200 million unemployed globally. We need answers, we need significant commitments to promote participation in the labour market. It is very important that a lot of space has also been devoted at G20 level to this issue. Entrepreneurship must certainly be promoted, initiatives must be taken in favour of the most disadvantaged unemployed, starting with the disabled. And this emphasis on the most vulnerable by G20 leaders seems to me to be something that we need to work and on which the European Parliament will also be able to do a lot in this European legislature, just as we must promote structural reforms from the labour market to promote employment. Finally, Mr Gutiérrez Prieto, Mr Balas and Mr Danti referred to the need, which we share as presidency, for a change in global economic policy. And it seems to us that at the G20 there have been a number of messages from various quarters about the European Union and the need to speed up the change in economic policy approach that has taken place at Eu ropean Union level. This seems to us to be an important step.  It is true, I agree with what you have said, we need new fiscal stimulus, we need to use all the flexibility possible in the Stability and Growth Pact. This is what our leaders wrote in the strategic agenda for the Union in times of change in June. This is where we must start and that we were pleased to find in the plan presented by President Juncker this morning and in the words of President Juncker and Vice-President Katainen, who have clearly said that national contributions to the investment plan will be neutral from the point of view of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Here's a smart application of the rules we have. It is clear that public expenditure in favour of investments pursuing common European objectives cannot be regarded as current expenditure. We see it, we saw it this morning, there is a nice application of this in Juncker's plan. We hope – and we also did so at the General Affairs Council on cohesion policy – that this intelligent application of the rules that we have will also extend to other investment instruments that we have from national and regional eco-financing within cohesion policy, which are another national contribution to the growth objectives and should also be assessed as neutral for the purposes of the Stability and Growth Pact. Finally, you mentioned the term solidarity: we too believe that we need much more solidarity in the European Union. The term solidarity is found 21 times in the European Treaties. There are 21 articles about solidarity. We have not seen in recent years consistent and convinced implementation of this issue of solidarity in various areas by the outgoing European Commission, and we hope that this will be a commitment that the three institutions together will carry out in the new parliamentary term. Mr President, I would like to make a very important Etheridge invoked God with regard to economic policy and I understand that we can be inspired by the Supreme Pontiff who has addressed this House, but I do not believe that there is a need to invoke God. It is enough to be a man and a politician of good will to make the most of the enormous potential that the European Union has to respond to the need for more growth and more jobs that our citizens rightly ask of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 599, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

I agree with you that the Digital Single Market requires our immediate attention. For this we need the Telecoms Single Market as a solid basis for the future. I know this Parliament agrees with the ambitious plan to achieve a truly connected Digital Single Market, as can be seen in your resolution and your support for the Telecoms Single Market package. But I am worried about the direction that the Telecoms Single Market negotiations have taken in the Council, where Member States are divided. The Telecoms Single Market is an essential building block of the Digital Single Market. Without it, we cannot achieve the rest. The European Council asked for it in October 2013, and tomorrow in the Telecoms Council, Member States need to be ambitious and take a decisive step towards achieving it. What kind of Digital Single Market would we build without decent solutions on roaming, net neutrality and, more importantly, on spectrum? The net neutrality concept has to be solid and should be clearly defined. Concerning spectrum, more cooperation in spectrum allocation is not a technical issue. It is about getting high quality – and decently priced –connectivity and new services. Our citizens want the best the internet can offer. They want an internet that is safe and accessible to everybody. This is not a reality in Europe today. There is even more work to do to achieve a truly connected digital single market, a market where every consumer is able to enjoy digital content and services – wherever they are in the EU – including government services. It means every company should be able to share and sell its wares to a market of 500 million, using seamless online channels. Today, a small business trying to spread across the EU faces 28 rules for consumer protection, data protection, contract law, tax rates. Consumers trying to buy online face endless barriers. And it just costs too much, both for consumers and businesses. I want to see more efficient parcel delivery across Member States and to tackle e-commerce. I want to make sure we can do online what is possible offline. This is why I have proposed a set of initiatives to my fellow Commissioners and committed to focus on six main areas of work that I will steer and coordinate in my role as Vice-President. A first area of our work will be about building trust and confidence in the online world. As I said during my European Parliament hearing last month, both these issues matter a great deal to me. They are vital if a Digital Single Market is to exist in Europe and function properly. This means moving further on consumer rights, ensuring that the Consumer Rights Directive is fully implemented but also simplifying and modernising the rules for online purchases and digital products. It also means concluding negotiations on data protection rules and cyber-security. Another work area relates to removing restrictions and preventing new ones from appearing. One particular area to address will involve putting a stop to the blocking of online consumers based on their location or residence. This will be about reforming and modernising copyright rules and getting rid of unjustified curbs on transfer and access to digital assets. Again, as I said during my hearing, I am committed to getting rid of geo-blocking. This goes against the core principles of Europe’s single market. Our other areas of work will aim to guarantee online access, connectivity and investment, build the digital economy and make the Digital Single Market matter to businesses and their opportunities. In your resolution, you address non-discrimination when using search engines. I agree that we need to address this issue: search engines are a key part of the development of the Digital Single Market. We should discuss a broad range of measures starting with transparency, self-preference and vertical services in this area. There are also competition tools to address this issue. The Commission will remain vigilant when it comes to competition law infringements that hamper the Digital Single Market. Commissioner Vestager will decide how to proceed with the ongoing investigation into Google’s business practices, once she has heard those who most directly affected by such practices are. I also want to promote e-society, ensure that our citizens have the skills needed to get ahead in the digital age and stimulate digital innovation and research to keep Europe a world ICT leader. I know you also have more ideas. Thank you for setting them out. We will examine them very closely. Our timetable is ambitious. In 2015 the Commission will present its strategy and prepare corresponding measures based on a clear assessment of the most urgent obstacles to be removed. We will not overcome these obstacles by words or by weak rules. Better regulation means efficient rules, minimum burdens for business and consumers, effective competition and high-quality services across pan-European markets. There are different ways to achieve that – harmonisation, mutual recognition, ‘country of origin’. These are the principles that the single market was built on. The same must apply online. I made this principle clear in my hearing and I will fight for it. That is what we need to achieve. We have the political steer from the European Council, from President Juncker and from this Parliament. Now we need action, and the determination to deliver a fully functional Digital Single Market. The benefits of a Digital Single Market are EUR 260 billion a year, potentially more. Imagine ending those barriers, making this a benefit to Europe, not the cost of non-Europe.  This is the jolt that our economy needs and the opportunity our citizens want. It is not something we should turn our backs on. It is what we can build with a Digital Single Market. We have a great opportunity, and we should make the best of it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 603, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Andreas SCHWAB", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, Mr Ansip, thank you very much for your clear words with regard to the draft resolutions before us today. We are talking today about how we can achieve a genuine Digital European Single Market in the coming years. The new Commission under Jean-Claude Juncker was right to set itself this objective, as this has significant growth potential for consumers and businesses alike. Of course, the European digital single market must be open and fit into a global Internet. However, we want to ensure that the European legal framework provides fair and clear conditions for all suppliers and for all consumers. That is why we must turn our eyes to various points in the coming months. Firstly, we need more coherence in Europe on individual legislative proposals, all of which are committed to this objective. Secondly, we want all citizens to be able to participate in this Digital Single Market in the same way. And thirdly, we want all users involved – consumers, consumers and suppliers – to feel safe in this market in the long term and to be able to benefit from the many innovative offerings. The attempt to achieve this coherence has meant that many committees were involved in drafting this resolution. I would therefore like to begin by thanking everyone for bringing this resolution to a close. I hope that tomorrow we will be able to find the most coherent and broad support for this text in order to be able to launch this path towards the Digital Single Market together.

You have just said that the European internal market is based on the principle of the country of origin. That is simply wrong! It is built on the greatest possible harmonisation, and we should continue to do so. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In our world, we have the experience that competition on the Internet is simply very much distorted and that many young start-ups, service providers and others have no chance of gaining real access to citizens and consumers, because there is market dominance through individual search engines. We should be really clear about that. I am astonished that Mr Schwab, who is one of the initiators of this resolution, has completely forgotten to mention it now. I think that we need to ensure that our young companies, the young people who come from university, the start-ups that have new ideas, really have a chance to present their services freely on the Internet and also to have market access. We want citizens to have the freedom to decide for themselves where they receive their information and in what context they receive it. I think we really need to get on with it. And the European Commission has been investigating, investigating and investigating for years! I think it is time for the European Commission to really come up with results in this area, so that we can ensure that the people, the young entrepreneurs, the young entrepreneurs, that our economy also get a good chance in the global market.

If we do not make it easy for organisations, businesses and customers to operate electronically, it will harm competitiveness, jobs and growth and e-commerce, particularly in terms of the savings for consumers and opportunities for business. But it is essential that we also work with partners around the world. We cannot afford a ‘fortress Europe’ approach. We must have an open internet where traffic is treated equally. But advances in Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) in particular put pressure on capacity, meaning service providers need to address technical management issues. We need infrastructure investment, and we need to promote an environment that encourages that investment. However, fundamentally-anti-competitive behaviour is not acceptable. As in all sectors, dominant players should not be allowed to abuse market positions to the detriment of others. Internet searches should not discriminate, and search results for users should be unbiased. But this is a competition law issue, and the EU Competition Commissioner plays an important legal role. It would be entirely inappropriate for the European Parliament to prejudge the legal process of any investigation. In the past, when competition laws had been breached, the Competition Commissioner has prescribed various remedies, including fines, ring fencing or perhaps even requiring companies to spin off parts of their operation. This resolution should not be read as an instruction to the Competition Commissioner on what specific actions she should take in her current investigation. The resolution, however, is not just about searches; it is about the whole digital market place. We must join the race, embrace the digital world, or our economy will be left behind. My group’s amendments focus on the benefits of e-commerce for businesses and consumers, and on real actions we can take to tear down the barriers that our digital entrepreneurs face.

Mr Commissioner, I look forward to seeing our vision and the package in the next year. Madam President, the Digital Single Market and the internet are far greater than one company. All large technology companies, including Google, must create a level playing field in internet commerce, services and search. They should not use their dominant position against competition and consumers.

Therefore, if all men are equal, the bits must also be the same. This is the principle that is called net neutrality. And I am glad, Commissioner Ansip, that you have heard that you will support this principle. But parliament, thanks to a number of amendments last April, fortunately included in the legislative package on telecommunications a correct definition of net neutrality and the obligation for providers to observe it. They will be able to offer specialized services and disseminate some content of better quality and speed, only if they do not worsen the quality and speed of diffusion of others.  But a few days ago, thanks to a leak on the edri.org website, we learned that instead the Council of the EU, under the Italian Presidency, wants to remove from the telecommunications package the obligation and the definition of net neutrality, naming it only as a vague objective to aim for. If this is confirmed, if this principle is ever watered down in Europe, sacrificing it on the altar of the free market in competition, the Internet will lose its role as a free and creative space that has contributed so much to human progress over the last twenty years.

Parliament underlines its decision that we need a net neutrality law. And we are calling for long overdue copyright reform for the digital age. On both points, however, the resolution does not say anything that Parliament and the Commission have not already decided or announced. The original reason for this resolution has long since been taken off the table. That was the threat of the old Commission's settlement of the competition procedure against Google. So why are we now dealing with this resolution? The purpose of the resolution seems to be to prepare a Europe-wide right to protect the rights of press publishers. With such a regulation, a license fee is payable for displaying small text excerpts from press articles available online. Germany has already tried in vain to finance large publishers through Google in this way. The piece of the puzzle that was missing in Germany, which led to the failure of this plan, is now to be created here. Under the pretext of neutrality of search results, a compulsion is established to display content in Google searches for which publishers receive money. This would effectively result in a Google tax from the alleged protection of the performance of publishers. The side effects are fatal. Google can afford to pay for text snippets. But small competitors and private individuals cannot. In Germany and Spain – and this happens to be the countries of origin of the initiators of this resolution – the right to protect benefits restricts the right to quote. This hinders the basis of the free exchange of knowledge on the Internet. We must not export this bad idea to Europe under any circumstances. If our aim is for the Commission to prevail against Internet giants, then we are concentrating on measures that work! We must finally put an end to tax dumping in Europe. So, instead of the rhetoric against Google, the grand coalition could finally set up the Committee of Inquiry into Luxleaks.

Again and again the same thing. We need economic growth, we need new jobs. How can we achieve this goal?  One way could be to invest more and more money in the economy. The difficulty with this approach is that our Member States are already in such debt that we cannot afford to borrow more money to try to stimulate our economy. It will simply lead us to even deeper misery. What other options do we have? The second option for us is precisely the legislative option to improve conditions so that this economic growth can arise. That is to say, we have a single market in Europe, which we all know that it does not work to the end – in fact, in any area entirely. But one area where, we know, the single market is not working to the end, is precisely the digital market. It is split up across 28 different Member States: we have different regulations, different taxes, and it is difficult for businesses to work across national borders. If we adopt the right measures with the Commission's initiative to break down these barriers to the single digital market, we will actually boost economic growth without forcing or requiring our Member States to increase deficits by borrowing money and investing.  So we can achieve economic growth in Europe by promoting the creation of a digital single market, without increasing member states' debts and keeping a solid foundation for our future.

Nevertheless, digitalisation is progressing and, at the same time, there are increasing debates about the protection of privacy and personal rights. If we, as Europeans, want to play an important, perhaps even leading, role in this digital agenda, we must effectively combine digitisation and the protection of fundamental rights. Businesses want to protect their data, their developments, and consumers need clarity about what happens to whom with their data. The European data protection package, when it comes to time, regulates data economy, tight earmarking, the shortest possible retention periods – in other words, clear rules for all those who offer products and services in Europe, wherever they are based. We also regulate that there are uniform rules in Europe, because this makes it easier for companies to work on a standard rather than 28 standards, and we create legal certainty and clarity for both sides, including consumers. Protection of fundamental rights and growth, even in the digital world, are not mutually inclusive, they are conditional.

This is actually the big problem on the internet – not what one company is doing today or what it did yesterday. My big problem with this resolution is that a few parties think that they can fix the internet better than the internet is actually working by itself. Because it is freedom that has provided us with the internet we have today; and it is freedom that is the nourishment of the internet. If we try to think that we can regulate – if there is an American-founded Google, we should create one ourselves; if there is an American-founded Facebook, we should found one ourselves; if there are Cloud services in America, we should have them for ourselves – then we do not understand what the internet is. It does not care about any national boundaries whatsoever, nor does it care that there are national boundaries keeping development down, keeping the innovations down, keeping economy down and keeping jobs away. We have a great possibility here in this House, working with Commissioner Ansip, and also working with Commissioner Vestager when it comes to competition measures. Because we are not the ones who can decide; we are not the body that is actually making the judgement. We are the body that puts the legislation forward and we do not make the judgements on different companies. Just a few years ago we thought Yahoo would prevail forever; we thought that was the system we would use for many years. Today the market is totally different – a big shift in just a few years. I believe, colleagues, that if one of you invented a browser that was better than the ones we are using today, just in a few months the customers would change: the users would change and go to the best one, because we are also acting on a market and we do not pay for using the browsers. We do not pay for it, which makes the consumers and users very easy to transform. We can take example after example: a few years ago everyone had a hotmail e-mail address and then this was changed for a gmail one, and so on. This will keep changing the market. What the drafters of the resolution are saying is that they actually know better than the internet how it should be run and that they want the internet we have today to prevail.

Personally, I think it is very good that the new Commission is being upgraded by a Commissioner for the Digital Agenda. We all know that the digital world knows no national borders, and this recognition must finally prevail in action and in legislation in Europe, especially in the Member States. It is about nothing less than the added value and competitiveness of our European economy. Those who demand more growth must place much greater emphasis on the digital market. We are working to ensure that there is more investment in Europe and, above all, a better investment climate. At the same time, of course, we need high-quality, solid investment projects. Therefore, we should not focus solely on the traditional industries, digital infrastructure must, of course, be one of the top priorities. We do not need new roads to nowhere, instead we need data highways that strengthen our innovative strength in Europe. It is about nothing more and nothing less than investing in the future. In doing so, we must make use of the fact that the digital agenda has a cross-cutting function. Those who invest well here do something for the big ones, for small and medium-sized enterprises, they do something for the founders of companies, and they also do something for the citizens, for whom digital networking is, of course, increasingly part of everyday life. We are counting on the new Competition Commissioner to address competition issues consistently and to propose solutions in a timely manner. We know that the issues of data protection and copyright must be resolved with particular care. In doing so, we must also promote international standard-setting.

The Digital Single Market is essential for economic development in the European Union. It has great potential not only in economic terms, but also in the preservation and dissemination of cultural and creative content, cultural diversity in Europe. In order for these potentials to be exploited in a positive sense, we need fair and transparent market conditions for all participants. The cultural sector in particular is characterised by its diverse structures, by large and small players on the market. The Digital Single Market offers opportunities for all. However, we must ensure that market dominance does not lead to a gatekeeper function that makes access to the digital market more difficult and prevents fair competition. That is why access to the network, but also the discoverability of content, must be non-discriminatory, open, transparent and respect for the fundamental rights of each individual. Net neutrality, fair non-discriminatory search and discoverability, but also fair conditions in copyright and respect for copyright are key points for new creative content and services to have a chance in this digital single market in the future. We therefore call on the Commission to really apply and exploit the possibilities of competition law in order to counteract excessive market concentrations and the abuse of dominant market positions, especially when vertical or horizontal convergence leads to distortions in the market.

I find it remarkable how audacging telecommunications companies and cable network operators are to supposedly support net neutrality and an open Internet, while at the same time demanding the generous authorisation of special services. The argument is always the same: they stress that they would like to push ahead with the required network expansion, but demand compensation via special services in which they then exclusively bundle offers of the open Internet, forward them prioritized and let themselves be paid dearly by providers and customers. Otherwise, the expansion of the networks would not be financed. If we allow this, we will buy fast Internet at the price of net neutrality and fundamental freedoms. As Members of Parliament, we have a duty to protect freedom of information and communication. This means that we are above all committed to an open Internet. A narrow definition of special services and their strict limitation, as decided by Parliament in April, is essential if we do not want to undermine the openness of the Internet. Neither the state nor we as parliamentarians, and least of all a private company, have to decide which legal content arrives at the end customer and which does not. Maintaining the open and free Internet is a prerequisite for ensuring social participation, diversity of opinion, innovation and fair competition. These values must be at the heart of any digital agenda. Nor must these objectives be undermined by special contractual agreements. It cannot be our job to pave the way for contractual relationships such as Comcast-Netflix or Spotify-Telekom. The least we have learned from the Google case should be that we should correct mistakes before they arise. It would be downright negligent to allow new business models to be made possible, only to later be astonished to discover that they create market distortions. But then it will be too late. The debate on net neutrality is not only about fundamental freedoms, but also about ensuring fair competition opportunities in the long term in order to take advantage of the opportunities offered by digital development.

Just 25 years ago the World Wide Web was founded; just three years ago smartphones became commercially available and affordable, and technology is changing and transforming our day-to-day lives. Sadly, the Digital Single Market still remains fragmented, and not every EU citizen has access or possesses the relevant skills in order to benefit fully from what digital technologies and the internet have to offer. In my constituency of Scotland, there are still too many areas where access to fast and reliable broadband is non-existent, thus denying EU citizens access to the potential that is there within the Digital Single Market.

I believe that from your previous experience, because of your sensitivity to digital issues and, therefore, the digital single market, we will have a person who will really be delivered and will carry out a very interesting management. But sometimes these things don't depend on personal will, they depend on many other factors. Let me tell you and this House the following. We're running out of time. We are running out of time for someone to continue to believe that in the European Union it is possible to have a single market, a single digital market. We repeat to the fullest what today, with all the goodwill, has been repeated here: the five hundred million potential consumers, what it means in terms of GDP or what the single digital market would entail in terms of European GDP, which would mean in terms of job creation, and many other data that we use time and time again to explain the extraordinary potential it has. But one thing is potential and one thing is reality. Signals are needed, evidence is needed. Because we need to build a trust that is going to slings everywhere in the European Union. There's no confidence and that's what needs to be recovered. And it is therefore necessary, indication, signals are needed, we need evidence that we are actually taking —as is up to those of us in politics, with leadership and political will —decisions that show the way, the evidence that we are actually going to create a digital single market. And I would like to refer in that context to what is pending and which has not yet come forward, to the single market in telecommunications. Who's going to explain to those five hundred million we talked about that it's not possible to have roaming fees that don't carry the burden they're putting on for citizens, businesses, professionals, etc.? Who's going to explain it to you? That is why, Vice-President, that is why, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is essential that the single market for telecommunications comes to an end and that we can enter into the trilogue and at least try to reach an agreement.

This resolution contains many important aspects and demands to revitalise the common digital single market. For example, the demand for data protection for building trust, for the creation of an EU framework for cloud computing, for the neutrality of search engines or for the provision of broadband and new copyright to all citizens, so that the potential that the Internet offers can also be exploited, and, of course, the demand for securing net neutrality. However, the resolution does not present any new perspectives, but builds on projects of the previous parliamentary term. At that time, we developed good and well-founded positions. We must continue along this path, defend and develop achievements. I am particularly concerned about net neutrality, and I am simply opposed to it being phased out through the back door. This principle must be enshrined in law, as we have decided in this House. Commissioner Oettinger was not so clear and so clear at the hearing what he meant by that. It is a question of the decision of this House. Only a neutral network that forwards all content equally and quickly is a good network. An open and free Internet is characterized by the fact that it does not prioritize services, but forwards services according to the end-to-end principle. Only a neutral network allows for innovation and prevents monopolies. This is the only way to ensure that we can exploit the enormous potential of the Internet for social and economic development.

The first of the reforms we need to adopt is one that aims to prevent discrimination and abuse of a dominant position upstream.  The second problem is digital taxation. Let's take the example of France: in 2013, Google paid only eight million taxes in this country for more than one billion turnover. We need to find solutions so that companies that capture value added online also participate in the tax. With respect to copyright reform, I want to be clear. If we want to continue to produce cultural content and promote European cultural diversity, we must protect copyright. We also need to encourage content financing and we need to better distribute digital dividends.

But there are some problems as well. Firstly, the problem in point 10 is more complicated. It does not only concern the functioning of search engines but also social media, on-line shopping sites and mobile applications. Very often, users do not know how all those solutions are interdependent. You should ensure that these kinds of services clearly identify and keep separated advertising, product promotions and other paid-for content. This should be integrated in the business models. Secondly, monopolistic advantages do not create a healthy balance in the market, but we should not look for a scapegoat to explain our weaknesses. We can put the problem of search engines, but we also need to understand the use of search engines as a vehicle for usual economic activity, also by new start-ups. We need systemic and clear competitive rules for all, but we should also accept the ways the market works. So if we want to use the word ‘rebundling’, we should require a fair and transparent process of analysis of the situation. Thirdly, why do we have problems with implementation of the Digital Single Market? Is it investment shortage, lack of a consolidated telecoms market, limited access to fast internet, lack of privacy protection as a background for trust, uncertainty of net neutrality or lack of new copyright with respect for authors? Yes, but not only. Fragmentation is a key issue. Member States are not sufficiently brave, are often opposed to a common view and avoid taking the decisions which would make it possible to have a European market without the administrative burden of 28 legal regimes.

On these three principles – standard, openness, neutrality – what has happened in these 25 years has happened. An instrument of prodigious growth, an instrument for creating new technologies, new businesses, new jobs that has changed the way we work, the way we study, the way we inform ourselves, the way we do politics. It has completely changed everything we do, on the basis of these three principles, all of which are under threat: that of the standard, that of openness, that of neutrality. That of openness: because it does not seem strange to us, but that web that we have known as open risks becoming and is increasingly becoming a space of enclosed places, of large closed compounds, where you enter and it is difficult to get out. There are services that are now becoming totalizing. There is a saying on the Internet: whoever wins takes everything. But \"whoever wins takes everything\" is not the way we want for our market. But it happens like this, so there is only one social network; one microblogging site, only one; there's only one search engine. There's only one of them. Is that what Europe will want for this market in the future? I do not think so, nor should our friends in ALDE want it.  Openness, the concept of openness that has been so important in bringing the Internet to where it is under threat today, Commissioner, is under threat from the concept of neutrality. Do not touch any of these principles. They were the basis of the success of the Internet, of everything that happened.

I look forward to working together with the Commission on delivering the ambitious promises that we have been making since the beginning of this mandate. The internet is a global and common resource. It is not for commerce alone, nor for one company or country alone. Digital policy brings about real, measurable effects that impact our citizens. Internet neutrality is one example. I want to reaffirm my commitment to net neutrality. Through enacting legislation, we have paved the way for the internet to act as a key driver of competitiveness, growth, social development and innovation. Roaming is another clear example of the way digital policies impact Europeans. I would not exaggerate at all by saying that lifting roaming charges would be an absolutely revolutionary step. We should dare to do it. I am confident that Member States’ governments will stand together with consumers to ensure an end to roaming premiums as soon as possible. The topic we are discussing today is especially important to our businesses. We need a tough market referee to ensure a fair playing field for all – search engines or otherwise – but we do not need to target companies. The EU’s job is to protect the playing field, not protect or target the players. Europe needs the ‘can do’ spirit. New ideas should be welcomed. Those who succeed should be celebrated and not punished through extra rules and taxes. New ideas and approaches are very much needed in the public sector. Europe cannot be digital if the public sector is not digital. A digital public sector can build and shape new markets, save taxpayers money and ensure public services reflect the way we actually live our lives today.

Thank you very much, Commissioner, for highlighting this.  The functioning of the market, search engines very strongly affects how citizens use, how they can use the internet. For many citizens, this is the gateway to the internet and that is why it is so important for users to know why they are getting such and not different results and to make these results as objective as possible. We are getting a lot of signals from consumers, from traders, that the market is not functioning as it should, that it lacks transparency. It is not working properly and the European Commission needs to take a closer look at this. Perhaps she should consider whether legal action should even be taken on this matter.

With the network, companies find new outlets for their productions, reaching their customers directly wherever they are in the world. But they can also use the clouds to store their data, and the list of opportunities is very long.  The investments in digital that President Juncker reiterated this morning require a firm commitment on the part of all. Of course, in order for the European digital market to express itself in the best possible way, it is not enough to remove barriers, it is necessary for operators to be able to compete on an equal footing with each other. And the network, in order to be truly free and open, must not have masters, that is, subjects who abuse their dominant position acquired precisely by exploiting the free and open nature of the same network.  What some people are doing on the network and with the network requires us to take action to protect citizens and businesses. The European Commission must do this by resolutely applying the rules of competition. But in order to maintain effective competition, we must all consider that now different actors such as search engines, content aggregators, e-commerce platforms, broadcasters and telcos now provide similar services and therefore it makes no sense for them to be subject to different rules. A real level playing field demands equal rules for everyone. The market is unique and it is the market for content.  We therefore need common rules drawn up together in a coordinated and integrated way if technological convergence is to be made any sense. An example: the editorial responsibility that currently applies under the Media Services Directive only to classical publishers should be extended to other actors. Mr President, in its judgment in the Google Spain case, the Court of Justice gave us precise indications that do not only concern the right to be forgotten. Of course, data is important, but that's not all. The judgment reminds us of the importance of applying European and national law to all companies, including those established in third countries but providing services within the territory of the Union, having an effective link with our economy. These non-European companies, and I will end here, if they take resources such as advertising in our countries and make a lot of money selling our data, they have to pay taxes and they have to be subject to the same rules as European companies. They cannot benefit from the absence of rules from the third countries in which they are based.

I would like to say a few words and present the overview of the current state. As you remember, the Commission adopted a year ago, in June 2013, a Commission Communication Action Plan for a Competitive and Sustainable Steel Industry in Europe, the so-called Steel Action Plan. This plan recognised the strategic importance of steel to the EU and emphasised that steel-making has a future in Europe, as the European steel industry has many assets in the form of modern plants, advanced products, demanding clients forcing, I hope, constant product innovation and an important domestic market, and of course a skilled workforce. It has also made significant efforts to reduce its environmental impact. The sector, however, faced and still faces major challenges: low demand, increasing energy costs, reliance on imported raw materials, strong and not always undistorted competition and challenging environmental requirements. In its Steel Action Plan, the Commission underlined the importance of addressing these challenges at both EU and national level. Shortly after the Communication on the Steel Action Plan was adopted, the Commission formally created in 2013 our High Level Expert Group on Steel, with the aim of providing a European platform for dialogue, exchange of information and best practice. In June 2014, a Commission staff working document was published which takes stock of the progress made since the adoption of the Steel Action Plan. While highlighting its implementation gaps, it provides an interim overview of the implementation of the actions by the Commission, individual Member States and industry as well, of course, as by social partners. The majority of the key challenges addressed are unlikely to be overcome in a single year, so the overview is a first snapshot, and implementation continues. In one year since the adoption of the Steel Action Plan, about half of the actions foreseen in it have been implemented. Moreover, the fact that the economic situation is slightly improving has led to higher consumption of steel in the main steel-using sectors and has therefore resulted in a better outlook for the steel sector overall. A strong commitment to follow-up underlines the importance of the Steel Action Plan for the sector. The constructive discussions in the meeting of the High Level Group have highlighted the usefulness and the need to continue the dialogue among major stakeholders in this important industrial area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 654, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I very much appreciated your speech because it confirmed the commitment of the Commission, and in particular the Commissioner for Growth, Industry and the Internal Market, to the steel industry. It will have the support of the entire Group of the European People's Party in this action, because we are convinced that the steel sector is and will be decisive in achieving the target of 20% of gross domestic product before the end of 2020 from manufacturing.  This is a key area which must, however, be supported, it must be able to face the challenges that you have highlighted, with all the problems involved.

And with regard to Terni: it all stems from a Commission decision linked to the application of the competition rules. The time has come, Commissioner, to open a debate on precisely these rules. Today they are outdated. In the face of globalisation, we need to give ourselves new and more modern rules that will enable European industries to compete in the world. The present ones are from 1957 and apply only affect our companies. That is the real crux of the matter if we are to save the steel sector in the long term.

The case to which Mr Tajani of the Terni special industries also referred demonstrates in an emblematic way the limits of the policy framework (competition, State aid, trade), the inadequacy of this policy framework to support the competitiveness of the European steel industry in the world. And so we must build a new set, a new organic framework, understanding, for example, that market shares in the case of the steel industries must be calculated on a global basis, not only on a European basis, that all the instruments provided for in the current rules of trade policies must be applied consistently, that industrial policy must be seriously implemented.  We hope that the negotiations under way in Terni will be brought to a successful conclusion, that the second furnace will be guaranteed, that there will be a future for such a strong and competitive industry.

Mr President, the global economic crisis has seriously affected the steel industry in the European Union. The stagnation of industrial production and the collapse of the construction sector in the European Union now make the future of the steel industry uncertain. This is particularly true in the European south, where thousands of redundancies are being made and the steel works are closing down. Specifically in Greece, domestic demand for products in the sector has returned to 1962 levels and redundancies are on the agenda, as was the case in the Greek steel industry. Hellenic Steel SA in Thessaloniki is in danger of being closed and wound up following the decision of the Italian parent company, which has been placed under the supervision of the Italian Government. This demonstrates, friends of Italian MEPs, the economic interdependence within the European Union and the need to establish a single platform for the countries of the European south.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 657, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Izaskun BILBAO BARANDICA", "mepid": "96922", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President. Good night, Commissioner. From the Basque Country we want to applaud this commitment to industry, because it is the main agent of the real economy and the sector most capable of offering stable and quality jobs, an antidote to unemployment and the best guarantee for our social model. Steel is, together with energy, one of the keys to this process for its horizontal presence in all industrial productions. I ask you to remember that steel is and needs knowledge, because the labor cost differential is not a good argument to compete. The future is in our technological and management capacity. In short, the progress of the steel industry is based on people and their knowledge and innovation. Steel is and needs wisdom. Our legislation must assume that we compete in a global market and cannot allow third-party social or environmental gaps to help them place their products here. Steel is and needs stability and that means energy, financing and assurance on an equal footing for all. The competitiveness that some countries gain with innovation, effort and knowledge disappears because there is no equality in access to basic resources. A real medium- and long-term plan for infrastructure investments is also essential. Steel is and ultimately needs consistency. The 'LuxLeaks' earthquake must banish domestic tax competition, which harms public resources available in Europe. The European Finances must use their margins of action in order to stimulate innovation. This is much fairer and more profitable for everyone.

This debate also stems from the oral question we have presented on the industrial and employment prospects of the iron and steel sector in the European Union and we consider an initiative by Parliament, the Italian Presidency and the Commission to combat the loss of jobs and strategic production such as steel in the Member States to be urgently needed. I think it should be stressed that in Italy the situation really is that of dismantling a strategic production axis. We are talking about plants such as piombino, such as taranto, such as terni, which I would like to focus on in particular this evening. Because it is a dispute that we are following with particular concern, because it is an emblematic dispute of the contradictions we face. Firstly, the contradiction between the right to work and the principle of competition. We believe that the right to work must come before a principle of competition, of competition rules which, as has been said, must be radically reviewed, which are obsolete, which are an obstacle to the maintenance of productive assets as well as jobs, rules which, moreover, do not prevent very serious forms of social dumping.  ThyssenKrupp chooses solidarity contracts in Germany and license in Italy, dismantling a production plant with historical roots. So we are asking – and I am only really going to take a few seconds away from you – for a new and different European steel plan. We strongly demand that the most important products, the more specialized ones such as that of the AST in Terni, which, moreover, being an integrated cycle plant with a low environmental impact, also have a high production specialization.

I must say, however, that I was a bit surprised that you did not at all mention the present situation on international steel markets, because I believe that has a major impact on the situation in Europe. The United States, as you know, is presently taking anti-dumping measures. Is there a need to take similar measures in Europe too? Maybe you can answer that in your response. This Parliament is pondering – not for the first time – how we could help the steel industry to hold on to the future that it should have. Here I agree with you, Commissioner: steel must have a future in Europe. There is no way of ignoring the advice that the famous baseball philosopher ‘Yogi’ Berra gave to everybody: when you come to a fork in the road, take it! And the fork in the road that we have to decide upon is whether we want to develop the future of our steel industry following an innovation-based competitiveness strategy, or whether we want a dumping-oriented, never-catch-up strategy. The European steel lobby is, unfortunately, focusing its own efforts not on pursuing an innovation agenda but on resorting to a strategy composed of calls for subsidies, calls for protectionism and calls for social and environmental dumping strategies. I have a leaflet here distributed by Eurofair. In seven points it outlines what the industry is asking for from Parliament. All seven points have just one message: give up any meaningful climate and energy transition policy in Europe and we might be thankful. Not a single word about innovation.

Another significant increase is the one scored by Asia and Oceania with a +6%.  Of course, Europe is lagging behind. The trend is confirmed by the interest of multinationals outside the European Union for Ilva and Lucchini di Piombino.

At the same time, we are guaranteeing environmental plans for the reclamation of all European steel sites without neglecting, in particular, the Italian steel sites, which are devastated. We Italians should also ensure that ThyssenKrupp does not try to divest AST steel in favour of German and Finnish steel. Italian colleagues, the AST issue represents a battle of the war that is being waged for the economic sovereignty of our country and for the future of our children.

This commission statement is just another statement full of good intentions and wishful thinking. Strengthening competitiveness and promoting innovation is an interesting formula, but one that will not be followed by any concrete effect and will not solve the evils that affect the industry.  The European steel industry still employed more than one million people in the early 1970s, and in 2014 it employed only 360,000 people. In France, steel production in the 1980s reached 24 million tonnes; in 2013, it was down by only 13 million, a drop of almost 40%. The European Union is playing the arsonist fireman who tries to put out, with a half-full sewing dice, the fire that she herself lit, that is the truth. Even as analyses and studies predict that global steel demand is expected to increase by 2.3 billion tonnes by 2025, the European steel industry has collapsed. Our production sites close one after the other, leaving millions of workers every year, as in my region, Lorraine, this week, where politicians came to see the crime scene. The cause of this cataclysm: ultra-liberal economic policy, the disappearance of national borders and the free and undistorted competition demanded by Brussels. Thanks to you, China and India can rub their hands. How, in fact, could France compete with these low-cost countries?

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. As the Commissioner referred to, we discussed the steel report earlier this year. I was a rapporteur for that dossier at the time, and I think it is important now to emphasise some long-term priorities for industry initiatives.  Improving the business environment and creating competitive industry frameworks is the key to boosting Steel demand in Europe. In order to achieve this objective, two areas need to change: lower energy prices and falling regulatory costs, otherwise competitiveness will remain a mere dream.  Firstly, as far as the reduction in energy prices is concerned, energy costs in the steel sector account for a significant part of the cost of production. In order to reduce energy prices, it is essential to achieve a single European energy market as soon as possible, to build missing infrastructures, to remove bottlenecks in cross-border capacities and to ensure competitive energy sources. The implementation of these measures is a priority for the Council and the Member States.  Secondly, reducing regulatory costs for industry. Europe must continue to play a leading role in the areas of sustainability, the green economy and climate protection. However, the risk of carbon leakage and the competitiveness of the steel industry must be avoided.  In reforming the EU ETS, we cannot allow the best performing companies in the steel industry to suffer.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. Without these measures, the disappointing steel employment trend of recent years and the continued decline in the number of jobs in many European countries, including Hungary, would continue. I believe that European measures to protect jobs are still not enough, but I hope that the EUR 300 billion Juncker plan can also become part of the solution in this area. The re-industrialisation of the European economy can only be achieved as a result of coordinated measures. Thank you for the floor, Mr. President.

So if this is, please, give concrete shape to the consequent commitments, among other things in the continuity of the steel plan, which was a strategic plan, a good intuition, a good job and which, in my opinion, must be carried out not by inertia, by continuity, so as to allow things to go forward, but with conviction, even updating it, completing it.  We talked about competition profiles, we talked about research profiles, we talked about trade policies. Many things can be done and we ask you to do them. But Europe has a special duty. This Commission, this Parliament, has a special duty in the case of Terni, because you are well aware that the application of our rules was one of the factors that certainly contributed to that critical situation. So we ask you: how can we not monitor the situation that has arisen there?  We all remember that the European Commission, when it authorised ThyssenKrupp's reacquisition of the Terni site, had the reassurance that all the rules would be respected there and that a site would be built where there would be very strong production, the specific production capacities of stainless steel and export capacity would also be guaranteed. But that has not happened, and then there must be monitoring. ThyssenKrupp has not fulfilled its commitments to the European Commission under those competition rules. We must be vigilant, we must call on the duty of that respect, on qualified production continuity and on respect for employment.

We have additional burdens due to high environmental standards as well as certificate trading and relatively high wages by international comparison.

But how do we specifically reindustrialise Europe? We're certainly losing the steelmaking game. India, China, Japan become major producers with raw materials from Australia and Brazil.  By the sea they built steelworks, but by the sea they built shipyards. Europe was one of the largest, if not the largest, actually the largest ship manufacturer at one time. Today we produce about 2% of shipwrecks in the world. To be competent in the world, we need to respond seriously to the process of globalization and protect our industry in some way.  One of the steel markets is certainly the shipbuilding industry, which today buys steel outside the European Union. So here we really go around in circles in a way, and I wonder if the reindustrialism of Europe also means a return to what we know. We know how to build sophisticated and expensive ships. We don't have to encourage just those, so to speak, standard ships that transport more air than other.  Today we have sophisticated shipbuilding in Europe and let's try to stimulate such shipbuilding in some way, because then we have innovations, because then we have research, because we have additional development here, because we have additional jobs here, because we have additional competitiveness there and that is certainly what is definitely something for Europe that is a way out of this situation.

I worked for 20 years in the steel industry in the UK. During that time I saw it change from when we had state-of-the-art service centres that were absolutely fantastic. They were well ahead of their time – it was the 1990s – and were superb. We were using mainly European steel. I was in the stainless sector. Over the period of my career in that industry, I saw it change. The stainless steel that we were using was coming from Taiwan and the Far East and the service centres – mostly the ones with technical details – moved to Germany. What has happened is very straightforward. We have a situation in the UK where a company I know of is collecting scrap metal. It drives round in a truck and picks up the scrap metal, takes it to its furnaces and makes ingots. It then takes them back out and sells them. The same trucks go round the area and collect the scrap metal and put it on a container to China. It comes back on a container from China, comes on a truck into our area and is sold for half the price. The reason is very simple. It is not lack of skill or technical ability. It is entirely to do with the constriction of regulation and carbon emission controls which are being applied and which are stopping our people from trading fairly. There is a very simple answer. Steel and stainless steel goes really well into a form of energy production – and it is not windmills, folks. What it is – and I will whisper it – is nuclear: nuclear power stations, a new generation of them, across the UK making cheap, effective clean energy with British and European steel producing them.

Well, we are here again and we are talking about a great subject which, as Mr Toia and Mr Tajani have mentioned, certainly concerns my country, Italy, a great deal. The first point I would like to make concerns – as some of my fellow Members have also mentioned – the worrying fact of China's increase in steel production. Over the past ten years, steel produced in China has increased from 23 % of the world total to as much as 50 %. At the same time, in my country, Italy, which has historically been linked to the steel industry, there has been a 24 % fall in steel production. There are reasons, precise reasons for which we must be vigilant, especially at the moment, trying to balance, as has been said, the reasons for large industry with the reasons for the right ecological concern. But with the concern that ecological concern should not turn into an ecological obsession and therefore produce anti-industrial attitudes, because the anti-industrial attitudes we know have the only great effect of reducing work on our continent. As far as the Italian case is concerned, in particular the case of Terni, it had a first major setback ten years ago when the production of magnetic sheet moved to Germany. In ten years this has led to a serious reduction in the strength of that production site. Today we have another major industrial problem, which has rightly been mentioned, because during 2014 the reacquisition of AST was done with reassurance about the technological and industrial centrality of that site. To become today, as one would like to do, cold rolling from hot rolling would lead to a reduction in the industrial centrality of that site, and therefore a contradiction with the promise made. That is why the call is right for you to be able to work with my colleague The Commissioner for Competition, Mrs Vestager, to ensure that this emergency for the European steel industry is monitored from an industrial point of view.

One is emissions rights management, because we must continue to lead the fight against climate change, but we have to fight for competitive prices for the industry in order to deliver a stable future to the sector.

Steel, like much of the industry, is energy intensive, and the electricity price has reached unsustainable levels in many Member States. It is vital, along with climate change policy and security of supply, to offer energy prices, competitive electricity prices to industry that are not insatiable. In this sense, in my country in recent days we have seen the result of a new mechanism for fixing electricity prices for the energy-intensive industry. One of these companies, Alcoa, has announced that the result of this new system may entail the closure of its plants in Spain, Asturias and Galicia. And we cannot assume that there are industries that have to leave Europe because of mis regulations that are poorly designed. We ourselves expel much of the industry from Europe. I therefore take this debate to say that I will not leave alcoa workers alone, in Avilés, Lugo and A Coruña, and that we will give the battle for the revision of this new system of fixing electricity prices for the intensive industry.

Look, for example, at France and Germany with their huge car industry in Peugeot, Renault and Volkswagen – they do not care specifically about European laws, it is about protecting their own industry and economy. They support their own industry and their own countries 100%. I fully understand them, because if you are going to compete with the big international companies, it is a prerequisite to take much better care of your own country's economy. Companies in, for example, England, Holland and Finland have found themselves in situations where factories have had to be shut down due to EU legislation. It has had to pay an unreasonable share in energy costs to finance renewable energy. I do not think this is fair. I am not opposed to renewable energy, but it must be fair. The consequence of this is, of course, that production is preferable to be located in other countries with a different cost picture. As a result, a lot of workers lose their jobs. Since 2007, 60 000 workers in the EU have lost their jobs due to unfair competition. What will that figure look like in the future if we continue like this?  Protecting workers is not really a problem on this issue, but the fact that we have to protect workers is a consequence of European legislation in this House.

Today the centre of the world is elsewhere, in places where other nations are redeeming themselves, where energy costs less, minerals are cheaper, labour costs less. Products manufactured in Europe incorporate many additional costs not only for the above-mentioned imports but also for the sacrosanct costs of European standards on the environment, emissions, social protection and workers' rights.  Elsewhere, these costs do not exist, because they are outsourced throughout the planet, to the whole of mankind, to the dignity of individual people. It is the globalised free market that allows this. We will be able to save those steelworks in Europe which are less dependent on imports of raw materials, because they are able to process recycled scrap on the spot, or which are special because they produce special steels. But we cannot close all the steel works on the continent and become dependent on a material, an asset, which is still indispensable. We must therefore have the courage to impose not only on the Member States but also on those who export steel to Europe a new form of social and environmental taxation, which is not an anachronistic form of duty but which is ethically and thermodynamically coherent and at least allows us to play on an equal footing. European taxation, therefore, incorporating energy consumption, emissions, environmental and health externalities for mineral extraction and transport into the final prices, and the deficit in the social and trade union rights of workers outside Europe. So those products that will be manufactured outside Europe and imported with lower ethical and thermodynamic standards than Those in Europe will have higher costs, those with better standards will cost less and this will push us forward.

European steelmakers have closed more than 42 million tonnes of capacity since 2008, representing 40,000 direct job losses and more than 100,000 indirect jobs and subcontractors at a rate of ten employees per million tonnes. We are not overcapacity. Of our current 170 million tonnes of capacity, our trade surplus is only five million. In other words, if economic activity starts up again — it seems to me that we share the same objective — then we will become a net importer. We must therefore react, and quickly, because this sector, which is so structuring in a majority of European countries, is more than ever in a structural crisis which manifests itself in chronic underinvestment in equipment as well as in the training of employees.  This is the purpose of the report that I will have the honour of defending on the sustainable development of the European base metals industry, including steel. European producers must be on an equal footing with their non-European competitors, who are often subject to less ambitious social and environmental standards. But there is no question of encouraging a levelling down that would involve the unraveling of our social rights or the denial of our health and climate objectives. Should we call him back? We have only one health and one planet. On the contrary, we must initiate a virtuous circle and, at this stage, I see only border adjustment as a way to put our producers back in the game while encouraging others to raise their standards. That will be one of the areas that I will try to make credible.

This statement by the Commission on the EU steel industry will not change the current dire situation and will, at most, add up to the declarations of intent of other institutions and bodies. For this text is in fact only a list of wishful thinking that will never be followed by effective measures and for good reason... For decades, the European steel industry has seen its steel production collapse, its production sites close one after the other, leading to massive layoffs. This is the concrete result of significant structural changes in the steel sector. For example, European production of crude steel from the casting continued to decline (-13.4% between 2006 and 2011). This drop is directly related to the decline in demand from the automotive sector or the construction sector. Faced with direct competition from low-cost countries (led by China and India), 280,000 people lost their jobs in the European metallurgical industry between 2008 and 2013.  By establishing the ultraliberal economic model and free and undistorted competition, and by removing national borders, the European Union is fully responsible for the collapse of the European and French steel industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 694, "date": "2014-11-26.json", "name": "Florian PHILIPPOT", "mepid": "110977", "text": "  In writing. What a sad irony to consider today, in the face of the disaster in the steel sector, the objectives set out by the EU's forerunner, the Coal and Steel Community! Europe destroyed even the foundations of the industry that it had received as its mission to promote its creation. Yet global demand for steel around the world continues to grow. It is therefore the ultra-liberal ideology that blindly rejects all protectionism and any border that alone can explain the total collapse of the steel industry. The measures proposed by the Commission, as well as those taken at national level by President Hollande, whose emptiness I was able to personally measure in Lorraine in Florange last Monday, are only a wooden leg laid by those who decided to amputate. To return to the path of growth and employment, we must radically change policy, renouncing a single currency that is undermining the economy and protecting us from unfair competition from emerging countries whose social and environmental standards are far from ours.

Siderurgy is not only of symbolic importance to those who think of the birth of the EU as a coal and steel community, but also of as much importance as a support sector for most industries, including high-tech industries.  Looking for ways to reinvigorate steel in Europe, we are not just thinking about the 360,000 jobs, of which 20 000 in Romania, which this industry provides today, but we are thinking about the competitiveness of the European economy, which would suffer if Europe forgets about this industrial sector.
