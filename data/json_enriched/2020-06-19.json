It plays a unique role for the health of our planet, our diversity and our climate. It is also essential for the indigenous people that call it home and depend on it for their livelihoods and their traditional culture.  The challenges that affect the Amazon Basin are complex, multi-faceted and require close regional cooperation among the countries that share it. The environmental dimension of these challenges is closely interconnected with fundamental socio-economic factors, as well as issues such as widespread poverty, corruption, human rights abuses, stability and security.  Territories of indigenous people and local communities in the Amazon overlap to a very large degree with the world’s best-preserved biodiversity and ecosystems. The indigenous people and local communities have therefore to be part of the solution. Tackling deforestation in the Amazon is essential not only to fight global biodiversity loss and climate change, but also to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication. In line with the ambitions set out in the European Green Deal and the new EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU is fully committed to tackling deforestation. We are determined to take a leading role internationally and to use diplomacy, trade policy and development cooperation tools. At the global level, the EU will push for an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework to ensure that by 2050 all of the world’s ecosystems, including forests, are restored, resilient and adequately protected.  The global framework should include specific targets for halting the loss of primary forests and for preserving ecosystems’ health, in line with the proposals in the EU biodiversity strategy. We will continue to support action against deforestation and forest degradation as a part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including through continued commitment to raise the ambition of forest competence, of nationally determined contributions and continued support to the international initiative on reducing emissions for deforestation and forest degradation.  With regard to EU policies, the Commission is working on a series of actions to fight deforestation as a part of the follow-up to our communication on stepping-up EU action to protect and restore the world’s forests adopted in July 2019. As part of the follow up to last year’s communication, the Commission will present in 2021 a legislative proposal and other measures to avoid or minimise the placing of products associated with deforestation on the EU market and to promote forest-friendly imports and value chains. We are currently conducting the related impact assessment.  Instruments could include voluntary commitment of the industry, mandatory labelling, due diligence, certification schemes, approaches similar to the EU system against illegal fishing, bilateral agreements or other measures.  We very much welcome the European Parliament’s engagement on deforestation and look forward to Ms Burkhardt’s draft legislative initiative report, which once adopted, we will evaluate carefully. To tackle the issue of deforestation, we also need to engage more with the private sector, especially with the EU, to get stronger commitments from their side on sustainable sourcing.  As announced in the biodiversity strategy, the Commission will also put forward a new initiative in 2021 on sustainable corporate governance. This initiative will address human rights, environmental duty of care and due diligence across sectors. Other action taken by the Commission includes the creation of a multi-stakeholder platform on deforestation, which will meet for the first time in October and of an EU observatory that will use the earth observation and trade data to facilitate information on global deforestation.  The EU is determined to work in partnership with, and support efforts by partner countries in the Amazon to tackle deforestation. Human rights, including those of indigenous people, and local communities in the Amazon, as well as environmental protection are at the core of the values underpinning the EU relations with third countries, including the countries of the Amazon basin.  Therefore, these issues are systematically raised within our established mechanisms for political dialogue and cooperation. Our dialogue is not limited to central government. We are also actively engaging with a broad range of stakeholders including sub-national local governance, judiciary authorities, civil society and progressive business associations. Our dialogue is key to success.  Free trade agreements with countries in the region are another way to engage and promote cooperation on international commitments on climate and the environment in particular, in the context of their trade and sustainable development chapters.  The EU is addressing the root causes of deforestation through our significant development assistance to forests, land use, sustainable livelihoods and indigenous people in the Amazon basin, with a total of ongoing projects amounting to EUR 166 million.  Protecting biodiversity and fighting deforestation requires protected areas and good governance. It also goes hand in hand with improving the livelihoods of local populations and respecting the rights of indigenous people. This integrated sustainable development approach is at the centre of our development cooperation policy. The Commission supports the implementation of the ILO Convention 169 on the indigenous and tribal people as well as the implementation of the UN voluntary guidelines on governance of tenure of land and forests. Finally, our human rights instruments have been mobilised on rights of indigenous people and of environmental defenders, unfortunately too often at stake in the Amazon region. I look forward to working closely with you on this important issue.

Last summer we all watched as the Amazon burned, and despite our lofty words and our concerns, nothing has changed. And that’s why we’re back here today talking about land—grabbing and deforestation. We cannot take our eyes off this subject.  We’re very alarmed about the continued loss of forests in the Amazon to commercial agriculture, logging and mining. We are alarmed at the proposed law to legalise land—grabbing by the Brazilian government, which would further incentivise taking of public lands into private ownership and the destruction of more forest area. And I think we need to get into our heads the scale of this. You’re talking about an area of over 60 million hectares.  We are working on a new climate law in this house with commitments on climate neutrality by 2050. We’re leading as we should. We’re ambitious and we want to lead the way. But we can’t do it on our own. COVID-19 will see the world’s emissions of carbon dioxide fall by 7% this year. Yet in Brazil, we will see them rise by 10% because, and mainly due to, deforestation.  Ratification of the EU Mercosur trade deal is still on the agenda. We continue to be concerned about the opening up of European markets to more beef and soya and its consequences for deforestation. Despite being told by the Commission that the deal will encourage Brazil and the Mercosur bloc to meet climate obligations, we remain sceptical. But people in glass houses should not throw too many stones. We are part of the problem. Our own meat production demands protein for animal feed and it comes from Brazil and other places. Yet we have restricted the ability of our own grain growers to supply the market because of the rules we have imposed but have no control over what comes into Europe.  My last remark is as follows: I hope that the EU Farm to Fork strategy, the biodiversity strategy, and more importantly the review of EU trade policy just launched, will look closely at the complexity of our supply chains and the absolute contradiction between our agriculture, environment, trade and climate policy.

But, if we want to achieve our goals, and we know what our goals are, then the Amazon is key in that fight. It’s the largest carbon sink on the planet, and the dramatic thing is, it is changing. If we do not act decisively, the Amazon could be a net carbon emitter by 2030. Can you imagine what the effect of that could be? So, the situation is really serious, and we have to act decisively on it and ensure that it is not hopeless. Last year, as mentioned, we already discussed the wildfires in the Amazon. Well, let me tell you that, since then, the situation is getting worse every month and the fire season hasn’t even started. As mentioned earlier, 80% of deforestation is linked to agriculture and to consumption in Europe, so we do have a task ahead.  We have an extremely vigilant task: the Bolsonaro Government is using the COVID—19 crisis to push through further deregulation on environmental policy. We already know that the government blocked 30% of the National Environment Agency’s budget for fire prevention. We also know that the Bolsonaro administration has fired most of the directors of the Environmental Institute controlling illegal logging. We know that they fired the head of Brazil’s space agency, which collects data on forests. And today, using the COVID crisis to recognise land grabbing is simply unacceptable. Exactly one year ago, the European Commission signed an agreement with the Mercosur countries on free trade with the inclusion of a so—called binding sustainable chapter. And, as you mentioned, the Commission always argues that that chapter is our safeguard for the preservation of the Amazon. Can we still believe that? That a year after the signing off, the situation is getting worse and worse. So this Parliament needs to ask for real safeguards on the preservation of the Amazon and that will be key in the discussion on the free trade agreement. Let me be clear: no free trade without good climate action. If the world wants to be a partner in trade with us, it needs to be a partner in climate action. And that is for us, the S&amp;D, key for the discussions in the future and the policy of the future, let me be extremely clear on that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2020-06-19.json", "name": "Jordi CAÑAS", "mepid": "126644", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, the Amazon is under threat. Land grabbing, logging and burning of forest to develop livestock or agricultural activities, illegal obtaining of property titles, along with mining, are responsible for their increasing deforestation and degradation. But in the face of this, what is the best strategy to reverse this situation that threatens climate, biodiversity, but also the sustainable development of Amazonian countries and the right of their citizens to enjoy a dignified life? With permanent reproaches and rebukes tinged with neocolonial paternalism, or, on the contrary, implementing a strategy designed with respect, resources, commitment, cooperation and agreements? Because, ladies and gentlemen, for our climate strategy to have a real global impact, we need partners to join it, and we can only do that on the basis of binding agreements. A vigilant attitude from this Parliament is needed on the political actions of those governments in the region that are going in the wrong direction, but we must also recognise the efforts of the Amazonian countries, which have signed the Paris Agreement, the Leticia Pact or the Escazu Agreement and which have developed national initiatives to combat this situation between tremendous economic and social difficulties. We must also support civil society, indigenous peoples, environmental advocates, i.e. countries. Because countries aren't just their governments. They, like us, pass, but problems continue, and only with real advocacy tools can we contribute to our shared goal. And the most powerful instrument we have is trade and partnership agreements. These are key to collaborating with our partners in climate strategy, such as the Agreement on European Union and Mercosur, an agreement that incorporates a specific chapter dedicated to sustainable development and environmental protection, and which reflects compliance with the Paris Agreement as a binding element.

Tropical forests are the first to be affected by deforestation, both anthropogenic and natural. While your Commission is debating this subject, we see a decline in agrarian land in Europe. In France, they now account for only 54% of the territory, while artificial soils are increasing, now accounting for 10% of the metropolis. Who's to blame? To you and to your agricultural model. If you should criticize the Brazilian government's assessment of the situation, it cannot distract you from your own responsibilities. How can you be outraged by the practices of third countries when European imports promote imported deforestation? Europe is the leading continent in terms of imported deforestation. The European Union has a direct influence on the importation of soy, palm oil, cocoa and rubber products. As for land grabbing, its causes are clear: agricultural globalization. For the past 20 years, soybeans have been one of the main drivers of deforestation, particularly in the Amazon. Between 70% and 90% of the world's soybean production is used to feed livestock. It is then purchased by the food industry and the retail industry. This intensive model is one of the pillars of your treaties, the latest, the famous and shameful treaty of Mercosur. How can you worry about deforestation in Brazil when you know that the Mercosur Treaty encourages this practice? It's disgraceful! It is for this reason that the Dutch Parliament voted against this Treaty, and I welcome it. As a reminder, the European Union wants to import more than 300,000 tonnes of meat from South America with greatly reduced tariffs. And again, your European vision harms both producers and the environment. You are therefore fatally a link in the chain of deforestation, it must be acknowledged. How can you be moved by this situation when many of you are slavishly signing the free trade treaties that cause this deforestation? Let us get out of the many free trade treaties that the European Union has ratified, defend another model geared towards localism, stop importing products of daily life cheaper than the product of the farm next door, stop this excessive liberalisation and return to a truly ethical model.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2020-06-19.json", "name": "Anna CAVAZZINI", "mepid": "86793", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, first of all, I want to express my solidarity with the people in the Amazon region and especially in Brazil suffering from the outbreak of COVID—19 and losing family members and friends.

This is what Brazilian Environment Minister, Ricardo Salles, was caught saying on video.  Deforestation in the Amazon keeps increasing and this is a direct consequence of government decisions. Control agencies dismantled, penalty payments for illegal logging stopped and, if this were not enough, the Bolsonaro administration is supporting a law which would legalise land grabbing in the Amazon. This law could be passed by Congress at any moment. I support everyone on the ground fighting these destructive policies and call on my colleagues in the Brazilian Congress to stop this course of action, especially the law on land grabbing. But, of course, we in Europe also have a role to play. Supermarkets in the UK threatened to boycott agricultural products from Brazil if the land grabbing law is passed. In the space of a week, 350 000 people in Germany have signed a petition to ask German supermarkets to do the same and we urgently need deforestation—free supply chains and to end our dependency on the soil.

The European continent is shaken by protests, millions of Europeans have lost their jobs, vandals are looting shops, destroying and rewriting European history, and at this point the European Parliament is debating the amazon forests.  Dear colleagues, a brief geographical reminder – the Amazon River does not pass through any Member State where your constituents live and the people who support this institution with their taxes. It is difficult to find a more accurate unit-measure of unsuitability and worthlessness. A stranger would be just a debate about the lack of water on Mars, but I dare not suggest it to you, lest I see it on the next agenda.  Moreover, this chamber talks about ecology and cleanliness of the air when it votes and will vote for thousands of trucks to drive empty across Europe and pollute the air of Europeans. What kind of fat-ass, what a binge. This chamber may decide to keep the European air clean, but under pressure from the EPP, the S&D, the RENEW, because of the party-powered mothers voting - narrowing their ears and voting - for it to be dirty air, and now they are sitting down to teach other countries on other continents how to keep their air. Very strange, dear. If this house votes on air pollution, it should be silent on the Amazon and the like. And one more thing, dear colleagues. Again, we heard even here in the debris, in the jungles of the Amazon, again we heard about colonialism, paternalism, the privilege of white Europeans, that we should apologize for having historical guilt. Dear colleagues, if you think that by apologizing, kneeling, humiliating, self-esteem, self-esteem, you will win more votes, you are deeply wrong. If you think that by justifying riots and barbarism, you will receive support, no, you are wrong. When they're done with the shops, when they're done with the perfumes, they'il come for you, it reminds you of the story. That's how every revolution that raises the red flag, sickle and hammer begins. First he beats, then he grabs the shops, and then he comes for the private property.

Mr President, not so long ago the world was outraged by the sight of images of the burning Amazon. Because of the corona crisis, she seems to have faded a bit into the background, but the crisis in the rainforest continues. In fact, she's gotten a lot worse.  The Amazon is of enormous importance for biodiversity and crucial for the climate and for the people and animals that live there. Nevertheless, the Amazon, with the cooperation of the European Union, is rapidly being destroyed and cut down. And with unacceptable human rights violations on the bargain, to fill our fuel tanks, but above all to satisfy our appetite for cheap fodder and cheap meat. Every year, Europe imports around one and a half million tonnes of soya and 140 000 tonnes of beef from Brazil. This will be made even greater if Europe follows through on the Mercosur trade agreement! If we want to save the Amazon and really stop the global biodiversity loss, we have to act accordingly. Commissioner, you cannot succeed with your biodiversity strategy if your colleagues at the same time continue to pursue European trade policy and agricultural policy. If you say yes to a firm climate and biodiversity policy and sustainable food production, are you prepared to say no to destructive trade treaties such as Mercosur, the import of soy for animal feed, spending billions on environmental and climate-damaging subsidies for the livestock industry, including the promotion of meat? Because eating less meat is not only good for the Amazon, but also for the welfare of animals. And speaking of animal welfare, this Parliament has the opportunity to do something about it at this very moment.

Commissioner, you are right to say that stopping the deforestation of the Amazon is in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy. Let us remember, however, that Europe, if it is to become competitive in implementing the Green Deal, must require similar standards from its trading partners. This is about meeting the climate and sustainability criteria, where we can still use the carbon border adjustment mechanism in the negotiations, alongside the trade agreement. But it is also about meeting the equivalent criteria for animal welfare or food safety that a French, German or Polish farmer must Polish.

Deep in the north of the Brazilian Amazon lives the indigenous community of the Ituna-Itato. Its territory, the Terra Indégena Ituna-Itata, is under protection. In theory, because in fact, more and more loggers, gold miners, ranchers, soybeans are entering these protected areas, making the area the most damaged indigenous area in Brazil in 2019.  Various laws already enacted or planned by the Bolsonaro government to weaken environmental authorities, facilitate land ownership and amnesty for land grabs leave little to fear. This is a social disaster, but it is also a huge ecological disaster, as the Amazon is destroying one of the most species-rich and important fighters against climate change.  But this is not just a Brazilian affair. Europe also has a responsibility, because 10% of the world's destruction of forests is accounted for by us and our consumption in the European Union, such as soya, palm oil, meat and rubber. Many companies are aware of the problem and are trying to produce more sustainably, but those that continue to cut down forests benefit greatly.  We must not just watch, we must find answers to that. This week, I submitted my draft report for an EU legal framework to curb and reverse global deforestation. I therefore call for companies that want to bring risk-taking assets to the European market soon and financial institutions that support them to pay much more attention to where their products come from and under what circumstances they were produced. This requires binding due diligence. In doing so, we oblige companies that their products have not contributed to the destruction of forests, damage to ecosystems or violation of human rights.  The Ituna-Itata community would also benefit. After all, agricultural products that were grown on the European market from their territory would no longer be allowed to end up on the European market, where rainforest was once and whose agricultural use they did not expressly consent to. The Ituna-Itata cannot rely on their government to give them legal certainty and to assist them in litigation in order to combat land grabs and destruction of nature.  This is the case for many of those affected in countries with weak legal systems or in countries where this is not politically desirable – as in Brazil. That is why they must have access to European courts. Where European companies fail to comply with their due diligence obligations, they must be held liable, because a law without liability is toothless. The Brazilian forest, the Ituna-Itata seem a long way off, but their protection also depends on the products that are on our supermarket shelf. It is up to us to change the rules and make products free of deforestation and human rights violations the norm in Europe.

The Brazilian Amazon is on the brink of catastrophe before the fire season has even begun. It follows and we see the planet suffering and burning again. Brazil is taking amazing strides in environmental protection, and this relaxation includes a proposed new law to give title to farmers who illegally occupy indigenous lands.  The numbers don't lie.

That's the equivalent of two football pitches every minute. It is the highest level of devastation in a month of May since the Brazilian Government introduced a satellite monitoring system that measures this particular devastation.  Deforestation of the rainforest in Brazil increased by almost 30 percent between August 2018 and July 2019. A total of 9 762 square kilometres of rainforest were devastated to make way for agricultural land over a 12-month period, an area equivalent to the size of Cyprus. So it is going at a furious pace, how the forest disappears.  In addition, in the first four months of 2020, the cut increased by 55 per cent compared to the same period last year. A total of 1,202 square kilometres of forest were devastated between January and April. It is an area over two and a half times the size of the city of Gothenburg in Sweden. It is the largest devastated area at this time of year since measurements began in August 2015.  This devastation is continuing because of the need for more agricultural land, of being able to grow more palm oil that we consumers in Europe use. We are making a strong contribution to this devastation. The green deal from the EU, where we now want to change, for example, the type of fuel – there will be more environmental fuel for our vehicles – includes a large element of palm oil. Therefore, the need will increase further. The EU wants aircraft to use more environmentally friendly fuels. This will mean an additional increased need for palm oil. We are devastated by the rain forest at an ever-increasing rate because of the decisions we make here, which ordinary people on the street barely understand the background to.  In Sweden, we like to take a beating because our public transport is environmentally friendly, for example, because there we drive with environmental fuel in our buses. It is not environmentally friendly at all. It contributes to the devastation of the rainforest of the Amazon. So while we beat ourselves to the chest and claim that we are environmentally friendly and talented in Sweden who run our public buses on environmentally friendly fuel, the rainforest in the Amazon and the indigenous people are literally evicted from their former places of residence. It's a cynical scenario. Europe urgently needs to review its strategy, because it is completely misguided as it is at the moment.

As the European Union, we have the single market and we must use our strength to show the way.

Because this that seems so new to us—the Trumps, the Bolsonaros, the Orbán—is actually the latest disguise of ultra-liberal short-term economicism. It is further proof of the dangerous assumption by the conservatives of the far-right agenda and of that idea of an unlimited right to exploitation of natural resources, which each nationalist considers his own because they are within their borders, as if the environment and the consequences of environmental practices could be plotted as political maps. I have heard excellent examples of this environmental nationalism here today.  The Amazon could be regarded, surely without falling into rhetorical abuse, as an environmental resource of all humanity—surely like the Arctic and as few more spaces of that scale—but it is also and above all a resource of its own current inhabitants, many of them indigenous and many of them also those who will have to live in Brazil in the future , and both are being expropriating their rights through deforestation and land occupation by the Government of Bolsonaro. The European Union therefore acts on environmental criteria and also to restore democratic quality, and environmental quality, to these citizens of Brazil's future.

Genocide, ethnocide and ecocide were the words used by 600 indigenous leaders earlier this year to describe the environmental and human tragedy resulting from the criminal governance of Jair Bolsonaro. Attacks against environmentalists and indigenous peoples and homicides have increased in a frightening way, spurred by the feeling of total impunity and taking advantage of the lower attention generated by the pandemic.

It has also shown a clear understanding that the multi—faceted challenges that affect the Amazon basin, its immense natural resources and its populations need to be tackled in a holistic manner and in the context of sustainable development objective working in partnership with the countries in the region. You, Ms McGuinness, have rightly said that we need to look at the complexity of our supply chain. This is very true and challenging, but I can reassure you that this is exactly what we are doing. I work very closely with all my colleagues concerned to bring together environmental, agricultural, trade, health and climate aspects of deforestation. Let me reassure you that the Commission is not only providing significant technical and financial assistance to countries in the region to tackle these challenges, and that we talk to and listen carefully to the indigenous people who are directly impacted and at risk, as you, Ms Burkhardt and also Ms Matias, have mentioned. We are also working on domestic policies to reduce the EU’s own footprint on forests abroad, in addition, in close cooperation with the European External Action Service and the diplomatic services of EU Member States. We are using all available diplomatic channels to engage on this important topic. The Commission is already taking action to support efforts across the globe to tackle the root causes of deforestation and to protect the rights of indigenous people and local communities, which are threatened by land grabbing and deforestation. In this respect I look forward to the outcome of your future deliberations on the legislative initiative report by Ms Burkhardt, on the legal framework to halt and reverse EU—driven global deforestation after years of damages that cannot be repaired. And ahead of landmark international meetings, such as COP26 in Glasgow and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 in Kunming, it’s clear that we are at a critical junction to succeed. We need to scale up efforts towards preserving critical ecosystems such as forests, not only as a solution to climate change and biodiversity challenge, but also achieve sustainability and resilience. In reply to many of you who mentioned the government in Brazil, we call on national authorities, including Brazilian authorities, to take decisive action to address deforestation and to cooperate regionally and internationally to this end. We stand ready to provide technical assistance in order to ensure that deforestation decreases rapidly, substantially and permanently should there be a clear willingness for cooperation on this issue. Let me agree also with Mr Ştefănuță, who reminded us that the problem of deforestation does not only exist abroad but also close to us in Europe. I can only say to you that I am following closely developments in Europe and I am determined to take strong action also at home. Since many of you have mentioned free trade agreements, let me recall that all our modern free trade agreements contain ambitious, even if imperfect, provisions to promote trade and sustainable development. The fact that we conclude negotiations for an association agreement with the Mercosur countries does not mean that we agree with all the policies of those governments in all areas, clearly not. But it is a way of having reciprocal binding commitments to the Paris Agreement as foreseen by the EU—Mercosur agreement. It is a way of having dialogue and working with Brazil and the other partners in the region to push and encourage each other to live up to the commitments we have made together in the Paris Agreement and to work together on the environmental issues. Mercosur countries, including Brazil, have included commitments on deforestation in their Paris Agreement pledges reinforced by private sector initiatives, such as that of Brazilian meatpackers not to source meat from farms in recently deforested areas and the Amazon soya moratorium, an independent Brazilian multi stakeholder initiative.  Honourable Members, to conclude, yes, there is still a lot of work to do and we will continue our work on the legislative proposal that we will present next year and I look forward to working closely with you on this important issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 37, "date": "2020-06-19.json", "name": "Christine ANDERSON", "mepid": "197475", "text": "  Writing. – Land grabs and deforestation, two offences against Mother Nature, perpetrated by a small number of profit-oriented people who do not care about the consequences of their actions for the rest of society.
