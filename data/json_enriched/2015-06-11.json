The international coalition that is fighting ISIS from the air is clearly making some progress and has been successful in destroying certain strategic and economic targets, to the detriment and degradation of ISIS/Daesh. The ground offensive, however, clearly has a lot further to go. Relying on an ill-prepared, unwilling Iraqi force and Iranian-backed Shia militias can only achieve so much and, in some cases, is proving to be counterproductive in the campaign for Sunni hearts and minds in Iraq. The fall of Palmyra is of huge concern as we witness one of the world’s greatest ancient ruins – a testament to the great civilisations that have flourished in the Middle East throughout the millennia – being subject to the whims of a band of barbarian philistines. Tragic as this is, however, it is nothing compared to the loss of life, the sexual violence, enslavement and monstrous brutality that ISIS/Daesh is perpetrating across the region, and we will do all that we can today to remember that as part of the debate. As we think of the human cost of the crisis in the Middle East, it is apt also today in this Chamber to discuss the case of Mazen Darwish, who is a victim of the totalitarian-run state that Assad has left to administer. It serves in some sense to remind us where much of the story began.

My problem with this discussion is not so much what is said, I think we share what is said. My biggest problem is about what is not said and what is not said is that these lives that are lost, the places that are destroyed, only exist because there are weapons, because there is war. And we still refuse in this Parliament to take on such basic things as saying that there are responsibilities of countries that sell arms to groups that make terrorism, to groups that destroy lives, to groups that destroy cultural heritage and humanity.  So I would very much like that in the vote that we will have to stop just regretting, having crocodile tears, but move forward for very concrete proposals, particularly with regard to putting a moratorium on the sale of arms for terrorist groups and those that are actually destroying the cultural heritage of humanity, to put a moratorium on the purchase of oil when we speak , for example, oil that is produced in territories that are occupied by the self-proclaimed Islamic State. That would be concrete measures, concrete words to stop talking about lamentations and crocodile tears, as I said, which we always share here.  European countries have a lot of responsibility, unfortunately, in this matter and so do the European institutions. So what I ask of colleagues and colleagues who are in this debate today is that they can support the amendments we are making. These are very simple changes and have to do, as I said, with the condemnation of direct or indirect support, in financial terms, in terms of weapons, in terms of training, of the direct or indirect support that is made to terrorist groups that are destroying this cultural heritage of humanity in Syria, which are destroying so many lives. But there is another issue that is fundamental and I end with it, Mr. President, which has to do with the call that the United Nations has systematically made to us in relation to the World Food Programme, the lack of resources to feed Syrian refugees. We need to increase these resources and I would also like this amendment that we tabled here today to be adopted, because if not what we are going to continue to do is debates like this but no concrete action that can change people's lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-06-11.json", "name": "Michèle ALLIOT-MARIE", "mepid": "1179", "text": "   Author.

I very strongly endorse the comments from all corners of the House in respect of Mazen Darwish, who we certainly do want to see released as quickly as possible. Our focus is on ISIS itself and Palmyra prison, and on the need for us as a European Union, and as the West, not to drift towards the Assad regime by accident in the fight against ISIS. That fight is valid in itself, of course, but we must ensure that we are even-handed, as the Assad regime, in the eyes of the people of Syria, is not the lesser of two evils.

Although terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq have been seriously weakened in many respects over the past weeks, the challenges ahead remain huge, as illustrated by the fall of Ramadi and Tadmor/Palmyra at the hands of Daesh. As was the case in all cities that have fallen to Daesh, the inhabitants of Tadmor have been and are still exposed to arbitrary killings and violence. The ancient site of Palmyra, right next to Tadmor, is also a symbol of Syria’s rich cultural heritage and identity. It has been a crossroad of civilisation throughout history. The threat of deliberate destruction that Daesh is exerting in archaeological and cultural sites such as Palmyra may amount to a war crime, according to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The EU has taken all the appropriate steps in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2199 to prevent the illegal trade in cultural property that contributes directly to the financing of terrorist groups. But the occupation of Palmyra/Tadmor by terrorists is only one of the latest military developments in Syria. It is first and foremost a strong reminder of the urgency to achieve a lasting political solution to the crisis. To contribute to that effort, we must remember that firstly, while Daesh is a single organisation and that a regional approach is needed to tackle it, the circumstances in Syria and Iraq are different. Secondly, from the EU perspective, an inclusive political transition in Syria and inclusive political governance in Iraq are crucial to sustainable peace and stability: the fight against Daesh and other terrorist groups must be conducted in parallel with the search for lasting political solutions. Thirdly, military, political, counter-terrorism and stabilisation efforts need to go hand in hand to be effective both in Syria and Iraq. This approach is at the heart of the EU regional strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat, which was adopted in March 2015 and is currently being pursued and implemented. This is also the position presented by High Representative Mogherini on behalf of the EU at last week’s meeting of the Small Group of the Global Coalition to counter Daesh. The fight against Daesh and other terrorist groups is not only a military endeavour. It must be conducted in parallel with efforts to address the root causes of the political crisis in Syria and Iraq. An inclusive political transition in Syria and inclusive political governance in Iraq are crucial. This is the key policy objective of the EU regional strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the ISIL/Daesh threat, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 March. The fight against Daesh and other terrorist groups will require sustained engagement and efficient coordination, and more than ever the EU is determined to continue to use all relevant means to contribute to this effort alongside other regional and international partners. On Syria, our position is clear: it is the Assad regime’s brutal war against its own people, massive human rights violations and systematic obstruction against democratic reforms that have contributed to the flourishing of Daesh in Syria. As a consequence of its policies and actions, the Assad regime cannot be a partner in the fight against Daesh. The EU continues to fully support the efforts of UN Special Envoy de Mistura to achieve a reduction in violence that may create an environment conducive to a political process. The EU has participated in the Geneva Consultations on the political and security developments since the adoption of the Geneva Communiqué of 2012, and we hope that this will help reignite an inclusive political process on the basis of this Communiqué. Efforts to reignite a political process must be inclusive, involving women and civil society, and must be accompanied by confidence-building measures such as the end of indiscriminate bombing and arbitrary arrest or detention, as reported by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry. The EU reiterates its call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and activists, including human rights defender and free speech advocate Mazen Darwish, who has been arbitrarily detained since 16 February 2012. We condemned this arrest and called for his immediate release. If Mazen were tried today, his alleged crime would fall under the provision of existing amnesties, but the legal process appears to have been deliberately stalled and Mazen has never been tried. There are undeniable reports of thousands of cases of arbitrary detention throughout Syria. It is a vital report and documents such crimes to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable. Our ultimate objective is to help build a democratic and pluralist Syria where all minorities and vulnerable groups have a place. The magnitude of the Syrian crisis is testing the capacities of the entire international aid system. The needs are overwhelming, and an extraordinary effort is needed to mobilise significant funding, ensure access to the people in need, and aid efficiency. We are also determined to continue supporting the Syrians and the neighbours of Syria affected by the crisis. Humanitarian aid and longer-term assistance are, and will remain, important pillars of the EU’s response to the crisis in Syria and in the neighbouring countries. At the Kuwait III Conference of 31 March, the Commission and Member States pledged close to EUR 1.1 billion – double the EU pledge at the 2014 conference. Of this, EUR 500 million in humanitarian aid, early recovery and long-term stabilisation assistance come from the EU budget. So humanitarian and non-humanitarian aid is delivered both inside Syria and in neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey to refugees and host communities. Those countries have played a considerable part in the international communitiesʼ humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, hosting well over 3.5 million refugees. The political and humanitarian crisis in Syria remains, therefore, at the heart of our internal debate on migration in the Mediterranean and an important part of our dialogue with all our regional partners in this region. This highlights our will to sustain the level of our humanitarian and non-humanitarian engagement in response to the crisis in Syria and its regional consequences.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 32, "date": "2015-06-11.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Western military, logistical, propaganda, and diplomatic support for anti-government insurgents in Syria, accompanied by preparations for a Libyan-type intervention, dramatized the situation. This support has made a major contribution to the formation of the fighters of the so-called Islamic State in a form with which not only the governments of Damascus and Baghdad, but also the statesmen of Western powers, do not know the advice. Clearly, the time has come to change strategic objectives, to redefine adversaries and allies. The European Union is getting dragged into too many conflicts.

In the past months, the sad and emblematic case of a pregnant ten-year-old girl in Paraguay has attracted much attention worldwide. It has highlighted the vulnerability of children and adolescents to violence and sexual abuse in Paraguay and many other countries in Latin America, where child pregnancy is a serious problem. The EU is following the case and the protection of children’s rights in Latin America more generally. There have been recent cases in other countries in the region as well as in other parts of the world. The European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission are in close contact with international organisations in Paraguay, including UN Women, the UN Population Fund and UNICEF. We Europeans join their voices in calling for increased efforts to protect children against all forms of violence, including sexual violence, within and outside of the domestic sphere. The EEAS and the Commission also agree on the need for the authorities to step up prevention and increase awareness so that citizens know where to report abuse. The perpetrators must be brought to justice and the victims must receive adequate medical care and support. The EU continuously emphasises respect for children’s rights through cooperation and political dialogue. Human rights, including children’s rights, were part of the discussions that took place last November in the IX EU-Paraguay Joint Cooperation Committee. We know that Paraguay is confronted by economic and social challenges, poverty and inequality, making children particularly vulnerable. That is why we are supporting the government’s efforts to tackle poverty by supporting education and social protection. The EU is also financing human rights activities that support women, children and indigenous peoples. Under the ‘Non-state actors and local authorities in development’ programme, an EU-funded project aims to protect adolescents’ sexual and reproductive rights by raising awareness among young people, teachers and parents. The EU Member States are also active. In line with the May 2015 Council Conclusions on Gender in Development and with the Policy Coherence for Development principles, the EEAS and the Commission will continue working on sexual and reproductive health and rights and seek to advance understanding of the components and elements related to sexual and reproductive health and rights in the EU’s development policy. Children’s and women’s rights are EU human rights priorities in Paraguay. The EU financially supports actions aiming to protect adolescents’ sexual reproductive rights through strengthening awareness among young people, teachers and parents, as already mentioned. We hope that the work we are doing with Paraguay will contribute to the protection of the rights of children so that no child will have to suffer violence and sexual abuse.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 61, "date": "2015-06-11.json", "name": "Sophia IN 'T VELD", "mepid": "28266", "text": "   – Madam President, I am sorry but I feel that we did not get an answer from the Council.

The government of Paraguay must give priority to humanitarian and health concerns over religion, especially when a child is involved. Physical and sexual exploitation of women is a serious human rights violation. Further denying women an abortion, particularly in a case where their mental and physical health is at risk, extends the suffering of a victim in a cruel and unnecessary manner.

The girl's mother demanded an immediate abortion, which authorities did not approve. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case in Paraguay. According to the latest United Nations data, 21% of pregnant women in Paraguay are minors. Around 600 girls aged 14 and younger become pregnant each year, mostly as a result of rape. In 2014, 42 young girls died during pregnancy or as a result of an illegal abortion. The United Nations Committee therefore called on Paraguay in March 2015 to amend the legislation on abortion, as the right to health and life is no longer guaranteed and there is a massive violation of human rights. It is an untenable state of affairs, a violation of human rights, an individual disaster for every girl who is forced by law to carry a child.

Especially for the Dalits, those who live at the bottom of the social ladder, it was particularly difficult to get relief supplies.

Moreover, where such disasters happen in areas such as the Haiti and Nepal, we're losing words to describe the situation.  Even before the first earthquake, Nepal was not sufficiently urbanized, the country was plagued by poverty. After several earthquakes in the last few weeks, Nepal's 8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, which unfortunately is on the way. True, the residents themselves are involved, but these are the actions of people who are desperate and in need of help.  In particular, the resurging of health facilities and services in the country, especially in remote areas, is necessary, including by providing medical tents and equipment to replace medical facilities that have been damaged and destroyed.  I believe that it is the duty of the Nepalese Government and the international community to ensure that children who have been separated from their parents are reunited with their parents as soon as possible. Children need to be at the heart of humanitarian intervention. They must be given special attention because they are in a particularly sensitive situation.  Aid workers have noted cases of malnutrition and threats of child abuse and trafficking. We stress the importance of bringing children back to school benches, but this will not be possible without the considerable and coherent efforts of Nepal and the international community.  For us, the problems with customs procedures for humanitarian supplies are unacceptable. We call for the abolition of all so-called aid taxes that local police on the Nepalese border have paid for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Help should quickly reach the places where it is needed and not serve as a means of doing business.

There are 1.7 million vulnerable children who have been affected, many of them having lost their parents. Many children have been displaced, and it is at this time that they are most at risk of being trafficked or taken by unrelated adults.

There is a close bond of friendship that ties the European Union and its Member States to Nepal. The European Union and its Member States have already expressed the deep sympathy and solidarity of the European Union for the human losses and injuries, and the physical devastation of homes, infrastructure and heritage sites. A disaster of this size calls for more than words. The EU and its Member States were quick to act and show tangible solidarity with the Nepalese people. Immediately after the earthquake and following the appeal by the Nepalese Government, there was a clear expression of EU solidarity. The Commission provided EUR 3 million in humanitarian aid to support, in particular, emergency shelter, healthcare, and logistics and coordination. This amount was doubled to EUR 6 million following the visit by the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, who travelled to Nepal together with Valerie Amos, the UN Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to express EU solidarity. The European Unionʼs Civil Protection Mechanism was also activated to support the rapid deployment of relief material and experts from EU Member States. The EU also provided consular support to EU citizens in Nepal. In addition, the Commission fast-tracked the disbursement of EUR 16.6 million from existing development funds. This frontloaded cash allows the Nepalese authorities to address the most pressing needs. We are also envisaging, under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, support in bringing necessary supplies to the remotest districts, which are very difficult to access after the earthquake. This support would also address the need for temporary learning spaces, as many schools have been destroyed. Concerning your question on the partial reinstatement of custom duties, I would like to inform you about the actual situation.

When we talk about the reinstatement of customs duties, we need to know that, as per the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Nepal and the UN, which was signed several years ago now, humanitarian relief items are exempt from customs duties. Initial confusion about this in the first few days after the earthquake was overcome and the government applied this approach more coherently following Commissioner Stylianides’ visit, streamlining procedures. At the end of May, however, the Government replaced a general waiver by a list of relief items that remain exempt from customs duties. The UN system, which the EU supports, has been actively gathering information from aid agencies on the application of this approach. This will serve as evidence for the meeting the UN will have with the authorities so as to resolve the issue. If these efforts at local level are not successful, the Commission stands ready to advocate, with the government, building on the contact that has already been established in the response to the earthquake. The EU is now actively participating in the ongoing post-disaster needs assessment, which should be ready by mid-June and which will serve as a basis for the recovery strategy. The EU will participate in the Donor Conference on reconstruction to take place in Kathmandu on 25 June. (The President again called for quiet in the Chamber) Nepal also needs political stability to push forward its economic development and now its reconstruction. We hope that the long-overdue constitution could be adopted as a key step forward in Nepal’s peace process. This should then be followed by establishing more decentralised, strong and accountable institutions. The long-overdue local elections should take place to restore legitimacy at local level. Nepal also needs to address a number of human rights challenges, in particular the need to guarantee inclusivity to all and deliver justice to the conflict victims. Many Members asked about human rights. Gender, non-discrimination and children’s rights are key priorities of the EU human rights strategy in Nepal. The EU has been a long-standing supporter of civil society in addressing discrimination and violence against women and promoting better social economic conditions for women, as well as promoting the rights of children. The Government of Nepal has taken measures to prevent the trafficking of children. For instance, since the earthquake, the government has been more watchful of any possible trafficking and has been trying to raise public awareness against it. Some of the districts most affected by the earthquake are the source districts from which trafficking of girls has taken place. (The President called for silence in the Chamber) The EU supports a number of human rights organisations working on women’s and children’s rights which are active in the fight against human trafficking. The EU has been funding programmes to combat case-based discrimination and the untouchability issue, including supporting Dalit-led organisations and empowering other vulnerable groups such as women and children in slums. As one of the major donors, the EU will continue to monitor the distribution of aid, as well as responding to human rights issues such as impunity and discrimination. Nepal has survived a terrible tragedy. Time will be needed for full recovery. Therefore, the EU and other international partners will continue to support Nepal and its people in these endeavours. I thank you very much for your interest in the situation in Nepal.

Up to 1.7 million children were affected by the earthquake, 320,000 of whom lost everything – homes, warm clothes, access to education, but many of them lost even more, their families. It is orphans who are at increased risk of abuse, neglect, disease or human trafficking. I applaud the efforts of the government and humanitarian organisations to provide these children with care as quickly as possible, as well as their temporary placement in monasteries, churches and makeshift camps, but the information about their disappearance from these places is more than worrying.

In view of these developments the EU must review its outdated security strategy, strengthen support for Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries, respond to a challenge of massive disinformation, propaganda and hybrid threats, consolidate its policies and resilience, and send a clear message to Russia that from now on no more incentives will be proposed without Russia respecting its commitments first. Another important message Parliament is sending to the Russian leadership is that the occupation of Crimea will not be forgotten.

I considered the report's finding that Putin is currently testing the tolerances of the EU and the democratic international community in the Mediterranean as a particularly politically important point of view. I believe that these Putin's efforts, which pose an immediate threat to individual EU Member States, make it a direct EU or EP task and responsibility to respond effectively to the Russian challenge.

I did not agree with the European Parliament's resolution on the strategic military situation in the Black Sea region. The resolution deals with the Black Sea region, but is not objective, but one-sidedly anti-Russian and measures double standards. The fact that the West has also intervened in Ukraine for many years with great financial commitment is not mentioned. It is complained that Russia has obtained a second Kaliningrad with Crimea, a second part of the territory with direct external borders with NATO. The fact that the EU and NATO want to establish themselves direct borders with Russia through accession considerations with regard to Georgia and Ukraine seems to be forgotten. It also complains that Russia is expanding bases in the Black Sea region and maintaining a fleet there. But NATO countries also have a military presence there, which is not taken into account. From this one-sided world view, the resolution logically calls for the sanctions against Russia to be maintained and strengthened.

In my view, what was given to the FAI – an unusual payment – was nonetheless small change by comparison to the great injustice that was meted out to Ireland on that occasion, because of the fact that we did not get through to the World Cup qualifiers. On that occasion the issue was addressed. The rules of the qualifiers were changed by Mr Blatter and, indeed, Mr Blatter broke a confidentiality clause. So in terms of the payment given to the FAI: yes, it was unusual, but that was put back into the purchasing of a stadium and, ultimately, into Irish football.

The genuine values of sport, such as friendship, healthy rivalry and competition, a sense of the limit, respect for the rules and the opponent, which should inform the entire football movement, seem to have been completely shelved.  The choices of FIFA's governing bodies, and sometimes also those of the various national federations, do not seem to be informed of those principles of financial fair play, good governance and transparency, all too often only proclaimed.

I support the resolution on the corruption scandal in Fifa. I think it is right that we should also speak out loud about this problem in the European Parliament. This corruption scandal among the highest-ranking officials of the International Football Association has done damage not only to football, but to the sport as a whole. Football is becoming a bigger business year after year, turning millions, billions into it, which is the ideal basis for corruption. Those individuals who have engaged in these neo-ned-rich businesses and, as a result, illegally enriched themselves must be brought to justice. They have to pay for the damage they've done to football.

That is why it was an important and necessary step for Joseph Blatter to announce his resignation. The ongoing investigations into senior FIFA officials make it clear that a corrupt system will never be tolerated. I therefore welcome the investigations by the United States and the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office, so that in the future the undisturbed fun of sport will once again be in the foreground.

The now former FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, led the organization in what appeared to be one of the most successful in history on the surface, but there was disintegration within.
