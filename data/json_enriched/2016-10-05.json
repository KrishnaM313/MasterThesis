I shall try to be short and structured. There are three points on the agenda of the upcoming European Council: migration, trade and Russia. First on migration. The European Council will start and have the discussion within the framework which was given and agreed back in Bratislava. It is given by an agreement that, first of all, we should never allow the return of uncontrolled flows and should bring down the numbers of irregular migrants; secondly, we should ensure full control of external borders; and thirdly – extremely important – should reach consensus on a long-term migration policy.  In more detail, I believe that there are two tracks. One is our constant attention to the developments on the ground, where I would like to mention Bulgaria: I am happy to say, and I am confident, that Member States will be able to assist Bulgaria in its efforts to protect external borders. Secondly, and more importantly, I believe the core of the debate will be about where we stand with our work and what progress has been made when it comes to the building blocks that we have agreed on in order to manage the challenge of migration.  First of all, when it comes to the protection of external borders, I recall that it is tomorrow that the European Border and Coast Guard will enter into force. It will be inaugurated in Bulgaria, and I would like to say that the Slovak Presidency considers it to be its most important work in the remaining months to make the European Border Coast Guard operational. This House and the Council have agreed to the agreement speedily and very quickly, so legally it is in place as of tomorrow, but everyone knows that in order for the European Border Coast Guard to be deployed we need its operational capability. But in order to successfully manage the challenge of migration, we need to look beyond our borders, which means that we have to come back to the agreement that we came to in June in the European Council to engage more actively with the partners outside of the European Union. I recall that we have agreed on migration compacts, and the European Council will certainly review in detail where we stand with this very important building block. Lastly, on the external dimension: there will be an opportunity to review the implementation of the EU-Turkey statement.  On the second point – trade – I see a two-track approach to this debate. First, we need to have a broad political discussion about the future of our trade policy. On the one hand, I think everyone in this House would agree that trade without any doubt is a major source of growth. At the same time, I believe that, if we have a global ambition as a European Union, we need to use trade in order to exert our influence globally. This is an indispensable instrument in our hands. At the same time – and this must be part of a political debate – we need to reflect on how the broad public perceives the trade policy, which we are trying – as I said – to use in our own interests. This will be the political dimension of the discussion about trade, but at the same time, equally important will be the discussion about the respective trade relations that we have and aspects connected to it. I mention here China and, of course, we are aware that we are approaching the deadline of mid—December, by when we have to take a decision on whether to recognise China as a market economy, while at the same time we have clearly—defined interests, bearing in mind the anti-subsidy and anti-dumping dimensions of relations with China. At the same time, it is very important to review where we stand on TTIP, and I hope that we will finally have a very good outcome when it comes to the finalisation of our efforts to conclude an agreement with Canada. Of course, there is the issue of trade defence instruments: this is absolutely part of our efforts when we want to arrange trade in the way I have described.  Lastly, there will be a strategic overall political debate about Russia. That is what I wanted to say at the beginning, and I am ready to respond to your questions if there is interest on your side.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the State of the Union address I presented to you a few weeks ago, we have proposed, as a Commission, a programme of concrete actions that we would like to see adopted by the co-legislators later this year. We must absolutely have the ambition to reshape the European Union and, in order to do so, we will have to adopt the legislation that is throes.  Two days after the State of the Union address, I, like but one of the other colleagues in the European Council, went to Bratislava where we could see that the Heads of State or Government gathered there welcomed the State of the Union address. I draw your attention to the fact that this is the first time that the members of the European Council have welcomed a speech by the President of the Commission. Previously, they didn't even take note. Progress cannot be stopped.  (Reaction from Mr Verhofstadt) I would like the European Council to welcome all the speeches I make before you, especially when they are received with such benevolence, as was the case with the last one.  In Bratislava, we adopted a roadmap that bears the name of this beautiful Slovak city, but this statement from Bratislava remained below my expectations because it was insufficiently concrete. We, as the Commission, had proposed a timetable that would have obliged both to respect it. However, the Bratislava Declaration is a good platform for us to move forward. The Slovak Presidency, its Prime Minister, has excelled in bringing together the views of each other, which should be welcomed. It is our duty, following the inter-institutional agreement, to agree on a programme of work between the three institutions before the end of the year. I would like us to do it quickly. But this inter-institutional agreement, this idea of the three institutions joining forces to agree on a programme, is a real step forward. I would like the European Council, which will meet in Brussels later this month, to be able to agree on concrete results. We do not need poems, we do not need a solemn declaration, we will have to adopt a program that will allow us to move forward. This is especially true for all the proposals that the Commission has put forward in relation to the European Digital Union. We have presented some 30 initiatives and I would like the Council and Parliament to be able to adopt them before the beginning of the summer, because the proposals we have put on the table seem to me to be the most possible of what can be done. This is true for the telecommunications market, for copyright reform and for the organization of radio spectrum.  These decisions are absolutely necessary for us to make progress on a digital Europe. It will be a difficult debate and I would like the European Council to decide, for itself, whether we leave it to the various ministers to regulate the radio spectrum. I am afraid we will not be able to do that. Let me give you the example of Germany: in this country, at least eighteen ministers are responsible for organising the radio network. Therefore, the chiefs themselves will have to make the decisions that I think are important. With regard to migration, the European Council or the quasi-European Council in Bratislava has decided that we will have to apply the decisions taken to migration and other areas of action in the European Union. As the Hungarian people have spoken in the same direction, I do not see insurmountable difficulties in implementing the decisions we have already taken.  With regard to the post-Dublin regime, which the Council and Parliament are discussing, we will have to see to what extent we will be able to create an intersection between each other's points of view. I have referred to - but I do not, the expression \"flexible solidarity\". I would like us to find an agreement that stands out for its solidarity dimension. Bulgaria - since today it will be inaugurated the mechanisms of control of the external borders and the coasts - can count on us. We have informed the Bulgarian government that we are going to make 108 million euros available to help this country. We will have to send an additional 130 civil servants there and we must ensure that Bulgaria can buy 50 vehicles that will allow Bulgarians to better control their borders. The arrangement with Turkey is working. A year ago, in October 2015, 10,000 refugees arrived in Greece every day. Today, that number of refugees has fallen to 85, which clearly proves... (Mr Lamberts' reaction) - Italy, Mr Lamberts, has no common border with Turkey, if I may use this little geographical indication - we have an agreement with Turkey that works, which is not to say that everything works in Turkey, of course. Wir haben das Wort gegeben, dass wir uns in Sachen Flàchtlinge auch mit der Ursachenbek-mpfung besch-ftigen messen. Deshalb lege ich groeen Wert darauf, dass die Investitionsoffensive fer Afrika so bald wie meglich Gestalt annimmt. Es wird meglich sein, durch diesen EFSI, der sich in Richtung Afrika bewegen wird, 44 Md. EUR an Investitionen vor Ort in Afrika zu mobilisieren. Wenn dann die Mitgliedstaaten dementsprechend ihren Beitrag leisten, konnten wir 88 Milliarden in Afrika investieren. Anstatt Menschen aufs Meer zu schicken, ist es ratsamer, den Menschen durch 'konomisch zu rechtfertigende Investitionen zu helfen. We have an issue as far as trade is concerned. I am not a blind free trader, but I know that trade is essential. EUR 1 trillion more trade with the outside world leads to the creation of 14,000 jobs. I give you an example: we have concluded a trade agreement with South Korea. The total amount of the exchanges with South Korea is EUR 15 billion. Thanks to this agreement with South Korea, we created in Europe 210,000 jobs. So trade is not neutral, trade is a job-creator, and we have to make sure that the agreement with Canada will enter into force after a certain number of months.  We will have a summit with Canada later this month; I am in ongoing discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister today and tomorrow. I think that we will reach a final agreement, which will take on board - in a specific declaration - the concerns of all the Member States. I was grateful to the President of the Council when he mentioned trade-defence instruments, because trade-defense instruments are of enormous importance. We have to make sure that the proposals that the Commission tabled - back in 2013, the Barroso Commission - will be adopted by the Council of Ministers. The fact is that in the Council of Ministers you have 12 Member States in favor of enhancing, strengthening the trade-defence instruments, and you have a group of 12 Member States who do not like the idea. They have to find an agreement among themselves, because you cannot explain to the public opinion - and mainly to those who are working - that we are opening the way for trade agreements with other nations without reinforcing the instruments we have to defend our industry, and mainly our steel industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent work and for his excellent work. Three weeks ago, Jean-Claude Juncker gave his State of the Union speech, and it shaped it. It has put the pragmatic approach that Europe must deliver on the agenda. This was then carried out in Bratislava, and I would like to congratulate and thank Jean-Claude Juncker for this leader. Europe delivers! In recent days, I was most pleased with a news report that Marianne Thyssen announced that 1.4 million young people in Europe have found a job since 2014 thanks to the job guarantee – a permanent job. 1.4 million since 2014, youth unemployment has been reduced to 19 percent. So Europe delivers – we should also be talking about successes. The forthcoming Council will deal with many issues. I would like to emphasise that my group is in favour of a rapid ratification of CETA, as described by the President of the Commission, and that we are also at his side in flexible solidarity and must now break this Gordian knot. Today, however, I want to focus on two main areas: the first is Brexit. Theresa May will be there for the first time. We, as the European Union, had made a great offer to Cameron. That has been rejected, and now we need clarity. We learned at the Tory party conference that the motion must be made next spring. That is a good thing, because the matter can then be resolved by 2019, before the European elections. However, I would also like to make it clear that, for us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the four fundamental freedoms of Europe are not up for debate in these talks. It is not acceptable for lorries to cross borders, but for citizens to be stopped at these borders. (Applause) Nigel Farage's strategy – he is no longer even here, thank God, I would almost say – has meant that Britain is no longer the second-strongest economy in the European Union, but the third-strongest economy, because the British pound has lost more than 10% of its value and the credit rating agencies have downgraded The UK by two levels. Nigel Farage is very expensive for the British, you have to keep that in mind. What concerns me most is the arrogance that we are unfortunately also experiencing from parts of the British Government. I would like to point out that in Bratislava 27 Heads of State or Government have agreed to move forward in Europe's defence policy and to do more. A week later, the Council of Defence Ministers took place, and the British Minister for Defence stands up and says: as long as we British are members, we will block any initiative to strengthen this cooperation! Ladies and gentlemen, this is arrogant behaviour on the part of the British Government. If we want to go outside, please do not block the further deepening of the European Union.  We probably don't have a government since George III that has less of a plan for how to deal with the situation, so I hope that Theresa May will soon come round the corner with very concrete proposals.  The second thing I want to address is Syria. We are stunned by a human tragedy. The barbarism: 300 000 people now trapped in Aleppo, tens of thousands of children living there under bomb terror. Since the siege of Sarajevo, we have not seen so many human hostages crammed together in one city at once, and the result is more and more refugees. Who is responsible? We know this: Assad, the mass murderer of his own people, and of course Putin, who is bombing, the Russian military is deploying there. I would like to ask the question: where are the mass demonstrations of the peace movement in Europe today, in the face of this madness that Putin is causing there? If the Americans were to bomb there, the roads across Europe would be full. That is why I would ask you to put your finger clearly in the wound that Putin is the biggest problem and that Russia is responsible for this development. (Applause) The European Council must take this up and criticise it, it must focus on humanity, it must provide ideas on how we can help the people on the ground. But politically it is clear that the appeasement has failed. Appeasement towards Russia has failed. Putin is bombing civilians today with bunker-breaking weapons, and everyone in the House and everyone in the European Council must understand that Putin cannot be a partner as long as he believes that weapons can make policy. We must try to stop this madness. Finally, it is important to remember who the henchmen in Europe are for Putin. Nigel Farage \"Putin is a statesman he admires most,\" and Marine Le Pen said\" \"Putin can save Christian civilization.\" These were the statements of the right-wing populists in Europe. With Marine Le Pen, I can still understand it, because it is financed by Putin – that is why one has to say positive things about his own donors in the meantime. But true patriots, true representatives of European nations, true representatives of European patriots are not putin's henchmen, as you are.  That is why the request to the European Council to take humanitarian initiatives is, and I would even go so far as to call into question the European Council's dealings with Putin at the moment. I do not believe that a North Stream II project currently fits in with the time that we cannot do business with Russia at a time when Russia is bombing civilians in Aleppo. I believe that we, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, stand by the approach of practicing humanity, and we want to stand up to Putin's henchmen in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of the Party of European People's Party (S&amp;D). Meanwhile, while Bratislava remained silent, the British Prime Minister, Mrs May, announced that notification of the British withdrawal would perhaps take place in March, first it should be in September, then in December, perhaps in January, now perhaps in March, always perhaps. In the meantime, the most serious thing is that it announces that the UK will unilaterally repudiate all legislation derived from European legislation, with very serious damage to non-BRITISH citizens living in the UK.  If good morning is seen from the morning, Mrs May could not have started worse in her dealings with her European partners. But we have to do our own thing, what we have to do. We must give a signal of change. I sincerely welcome Mr Juncker's report on the state of the Union in this House. We need signals about people's lives. At the economic level, we need to open a season of expansive politics. National budgets for 2017 are ambitious, otherwise Europe sinks into recession again. Let us have a genuine industrial policy, because Europe cannot serve multinationals such as caterpillar, which is stateless, blackmailing workers and firing them after distributing dividends to shareholders, as is currently the case in Belgium and France with Alstom. Fight against tax evasion and fraud, which are the main enemies, not of us Socialists, but of the whole of the European Union.  As far as immigration is concerned, when you play with fears, you end up being overwhelmed by them, as the news from Hungary shows. Like a sorcerer's apprentice, Orban's referendum as an attempted plebiscite has become his disavow. Orban's defeat tells us to move forward with the European asylum and immigration system and, as Mr Juncker said, to put back on the agenda and to move forward on the partnership agreement with Africa, on trade and subsidies. As far as trade is concerned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I agree that trade is a driving force for growth, but we must avoid dumping. International trade is fine, but without dumping. We cannot reduce the standards of living, working, social, environmental and health standards of European citizens. This is a prerequisite for us. Progress has been made on CETA, we have and remain highly doubtful about TTIP and we confirm our no to granting Market Economy status to China. With regard to Syria, I believe that it is a crime against humanity. Hospitals and schools cannot be bombed and doctors, young people, girls, children and innocent women killed without any motivation. It is absolutely essential to achieve an immediate cease-fire and to allow immediate and unconditional access to humanitarian aid.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, let me start actually by responding to a couple of points that Gianni Pitella made. Gianni said that the British Government had decided to repeal all EU legislation. Actually what they have decided to do is to transpose, in simple terms, EU legislation to make it stable in UK law. When the UK leaves the EU then you can actually start unpicking the law that has been transposed from the EU into the UK. I would ask you to be factually correct in these debates, especially if we are going to have an atmosphere of good cooperation to get a deal that is good for the EU and the UK at the end.  Secondly, I have to say I do agree with you that Bratislava was a wasted opportunity because if the Bratislava Summit was supposed to show the EU united and reconnecting with the people, then surely it was nothing short of an own goal: EU leaders meeting in a fortress, taking a lunch on a private yacht, followed by the Italian Prime Minister pulling out of a press conference, frustrated that other leaders had failed to agree anything of substance. Perhaps the only difference between this summit and the others that have come before was that this time you could not really blame the UK for the failure to achieve any kind of agreement.  When I saw reports of something not going very far, going round in circles for fear of being grounded, I wondered if they were talking about the summit itself, but it turns out they were talking about the yacht on which the leaders had their lunch. So if we are to truly fix what is broken, if we are to truly offer answers where the public has questions, if we are to truly show strength where there is currently weakness, then the next summit must achieve real results. The leaders of EU countries must show that they can lead because at the moment all the leaders can see is EU leaders pursuing yesterday’s European project rather than addressing today’s concerns.  We all need answers to the big questions: solving the migrant and refugee crisis, encouraging businesses to create more jobs, tackling internal and external security threats. Yet what emerges from this Chamber? Politicians shouting ‘no’ to austerity, politicians proposing free interrail passes, politicians protesting against trade with the US, full of slogans but bereft of action. We need to show our citizens in all our countries that we understand their concerns.  So when our citizens ask for fair but controlled immigration, let us be tough on those that attempt to jump the queue over others applying through legal migration channels, but compassionate to those who deserve our shelter, returning those who are not fleeing persecution or war.  When citizens of all the countries worry about an increasingly arrogant Russia, let us use fewer carrots and more sticks, speaking out on behalf of those Member States that share a border with an increasingly intimidating neighbour, showing Russia that their actions do not come without consequences. As Manfred Weber said, we believe we should be tough and that sanctions should not be lifted until the Minsk Agreement is implemented.  When the citizens of all our countries worry about a lack of jobs, let us remove the red tape holding back entrepreneurs from creating those jobs. Let us sign a trade agreement that offers businesses in all our countries new opportunities. Let us send a clear signal that we are open to trade with Canada and then other countries.  With every summit, with every meeting, we edge closer and closer to the next elections. At best, the EU has a record that shows it ploughed on with more of the same; at worst, that it pushed on with policies that failed. But it is a situation that needs fixing. It is a situation that the ECR Group of MEPs from 18 countries believes can be fixed, if only we were to take a new direction. The results of referenda in Denmark, Netherlands, and the UK show all of us that it cannot be business as usual but neither does it mean that there is not business to be done. Where past summits have failed to meet expectations, let us hope the next summit offers all of us solutions.

I am pretty sure that we shall have a good defender of the European Union in the House of Lords from now on.  Václav Havel, who was at that moment the Czech President, warned in a speech in this House, I think it was in 1994, that Europe could ‘fall into the hands of a cast of fools, fanatics, populists, demagogues, determined to promote the worst European traditions.’  Havel would have turned 80 today, but I think that his warning is more relevant than ever and I would say to you, President, and also to the President of the Commission, that the challenges of the next European Council are proof of that.  I have, in fact, the same priorities as Manfred Weber has already put on the table. I think you have to talk about the tragedy in Syria. I cannot imagine that you return to your capitals after this European Council without decisive action on what is happening in Aleppo and it will not be sufficient, only to say ‘we are going to liberate EUR 25 million in humanitarian aid’, because you know very well today that it is even impossible to transfer this aid to the poor people in Aleppo. You will need to do other things, more difficult decisions to take, on eventual sanctions against Putin and Assad and on eventually installing a no-fly zone above Aleppo. Otherwise, this tragedy will continue and that is, I think, the first priority we have for this European Council. I can only imagine a situation where you go back and say ‘yes, that is for Ms Mogherini and we have nothing to say about this.’  My second priority is, and that is another point that Manfred Weber did not mention but I will mention it, is finally fixing the cracks in our financial foundations. It is now eight years that we have been discussing this and that we have not definitely cleaned up the financial mess in Europe. That means two things: a fully-fledged Banking Union. We do not have that for the moment. Secondly, economic governance, which is far better than a stability pact – let us be honest – that is never applied, from Greece to Portugal. It is no better in the north of Europe. We have problems with Greek banks, Irish banks, Spanish banks, Portuguese banks, Italian banks, Cypriot banks, Belgian banks, Dutch banks and now it is Deutsche Bank that is on the brink, creating further uncertainty and prolonging, in fact, the credit crunch in Europe. I remind you that the US, immediately after the financial crisis, put USD 400 billion in their system. They cleaned up the banking sector and every penny has been paid back since they did that. What we are doing in Europe is still debating, in fact, a Banking Union, we are still debating an economic governance system, and my plea to the Presidency of the European Council is that finally, in the European Council, work be done, that the Five Presidents report be approved. It is a fundamental mistake, Mr President, to think that we can get rid of it. That is the second priority, in my opinion, for this European Council. The third priority for the European Council is, I think, dealing in fact with the UK decision to leave the Union. I think it is impossible that you say nothing about it, and I think that you have to respond to the announcement by Prime Minister May. In my opinion, you have to say four simple things: first, no pre-negotiations – we can only start negotiations after the triggering of Article 50; secondly, negotiations need to be finished before the next European election – I cannot imagine that Mr Farage coming back to this Hemicycle; thirdly, the new EU relationship with the UK needs to be a close one, not only in our interest, but also in the interest – I should say – of the 48% of British citizens that have voted to remain, and let us not forget that; finally, whatever the new relationship will be, it can never infringe on our four fundamental freedoms.  My conclusion is clear: Europe and European values will never be up for negotiation.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for his work and for his work Mr Juncker, Two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, I had the impression that the State of the Union address was addressed to the Council rather than to us as parliamentarians. I believe that you have also indirectly confirmed this today. They wanted to get the Council to finally understand that it must invoke common foundations of solidarity, return to them and stop cooking their own soup within the Council, within the European Union. I do not believe that this has been achieved. It will not only be reflected in the question of the extent to which the European Union agrees to deepen military cooperation – which, in my view, is the wrong way to go – but it will be particularly evident at the beginning of next year, when it comes to the fact that, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, the question is whether the European Union, and especially the Member States, are prepared to return to a social union – not to return, but to finally build it up, to finally accept that without it there will be no European Union. That is the one point I would like to raise. This also means that, if the Council now wants to discuss the issues of migration, for example, we must also discuss how Member States are trying to evade these same responsibilities for respecting their own values and to reinterpret them for themselves. I am thinking here only of the referendum in Hungary and the announcement that Orban still wants to implement the failed referendum. In order to do this, we also need clear statements from the Council. We also need clear statements on how we deal with women's rights in Poland. It cannot be the case – but it is quite clear – that a majority in the Polish Sejm will stand in favour of a total ban on abortion and will decide so. And when, for example, Archbishop Hoser of the Episcopate's Bioethics Commission declares that abortion is equal to eugenics, it shows in which direction this is heading. The European Union is also in demand here. This is about our values as human beings, as women as a whole, and they apply to everyone and not just to certain Member States of the European Union. On trade, I would like to know whether the Council is also talking about what Mr Gabriel, for example, indicated at the SPD Congress, namely that we want to renegotiate that this will also happen with CETA. Or what kind of conditional approval of the SPD? After all, Mr Gabriel is not only SPD chairman, but also deputy chancellor and economy minister in Germany. So what is happening now? On Russia, I still think the sanctions are wrong, and I am therefore not going to be in a row with Putin. I declare that the bombing of Aleppo is a crime, including on the part of Russia, but there are other people responsible. And I say to you again: please do not fall for the tactic of declaring Russia the realm of evil again. This has never brought us anything. It has never been a good thing for us to try again, practically through sanctions, about exclusion, about this type of policy, to mobilise the Cold War and, ultimately, to re-enter an arms race. That is the fear we face. We have to act on this, and the European Union has a special responsibility not to take over the game in the American election campaign right now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, like most of us, I have never participated in a European Council, so I can only imagine what the one that will be held in Brussels at the beginning of autumn 2016 might look like. I imagine 28 heads of state or government deeply shaken by the announcements of mass layoffs at Commerzbank, ING, Caterpillar, Alstom, especially in view of this new study which tells us that the full-time equivalent employment rate in Europe is capped at 75% in the countries with the best rates in Europe, falling to 68% in Germany or 53% in Greece. I imagine them concerned about the nagging rise in inequality in our societies. I imagine them worried after another record year for atmospheric temperatures and, above all, after a month of September that is the warmest in the history of mankind - at least, since the beginning of the temperature records. I imagine them horrified by the massacres perpetrated in Aleppo by Assad's army and Putin's army, but also by the death toll in the Mediterranean, which is likely to make this year the deadliest on this front. As I said, we cannot say that the EU-Turkey agreement works. I can imagine them delighted to learn that, even though one referendum before the summer showed the progress of national populist ideas in Europe, another, after the summer, showed that there are still resilient in our societies. But for how much longer? Perhaps they realize that the worst is never safe, as long as we know how to pull ourselves together in time. So I can imagine the turn that their debate might take: they might think that, if the trade treaty with Canada can benefit some of our multinationals, it could well be at the cost of the net loss of 200,000 European jobs, increased pressure on our farmers, who can already no longer afford it, and a further increase in the power of multinationals at the expense of democracy. Knowing that an increase in international trade flows goes hand in hand with an increase in our ecological footprint, they could conclude that, decidedly, this treaty is not the right thing to do. They might decide that instead, the urgency is to fulfil our still very imperfect internal market, a market where fiscal and social competition would give way to cooperation and upward convergence. They could work together to make investment in the energy transition the driving force behind European integration, because they know that it is good for the climate, for our strategic independence, for our balance of payments, for our industrial competitiveness and, of course, for jobs. But they might also realize that there is an urgent need to rethink together the organization of work, our taxation and our social security in a world where the digital revolution is increasingly freeing humanity from work, and this is to ensure that the benefits of this industrial revolution are not confiscated by a few and now leave no one at the edge of the road. They could come to the conclusion, Mr Korok, that containment is not the answer to migration challenges, but that a rich Europe is capable of being a land of welcome and refuge not only by preserving its values, but in reality to be faithful to them. Colleagues, this may be the fruit of my imagination, but I am convinced that, far from being a dream, all this is possible provided, of course, that I want it.

The solution cannot ignore three abilities: courage, balance and speed. We expect the next summit to at least come to that. It will also have to respond to the challenges of trade policy. What is happening with TTIP, CETA and even more so with the ESFA in China makes us realise that this is no longer the time for decisions taken by a few just in the interests of specific national and economic powers. A trade policy must be a common good and can be so if it benefits everyone, if it takes on the needs of all. We have often wondered where the Council's strategic capacity is on these matters, which is failing to overcome its internal divisions on strengthening trade defence instruments and protecting 'made in'. Where is the Commission's ability to assert the experience and negotiating strength of a Europe that is certainly not among the last economies and is certainly among the most advanced models of a market economy.  Today there is a danger of putting our legislation, our companies and our workers at risk because of the inability to manage dynamics at global level that are certainly not new or sudden, all due to the fact that work has often been done even without the necessary transparency.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hear here some of the transatlantic treaty in the media, such as the weather vanes that feel the wind turning, since the people have understood the reality of this transatlantic treaty. At the same time, this does not prevent you from quietly passing his little brother, the treaty between the European Union and Canada, discreetly in October.  This agreement, which, like its big brother, for that matter, will put in place an exceptional private justice so that multinationals can attack states. This is obviously shameful, indefensible and totally contrary to our principles. Even though our breeders are already in agony, you will also increase the pressure on them by putting them in competition with Canadian breeders producing 30-40% cheaper. On the migrant crisis, your own statistics office, pardon Eurostat, announces that only 30% of them come from Syria. Do you draw a conclusion? No, absolutely not. The irresponsible policy that you are pursuing brings us ever more economic migrants, and you have found nothing better than to distribute blue cards that you will offer to asylum seekers in Turkey, which will obviously create a new call for irrepressible air. At a time when people are telling you, by all means, that they do not wish to take in migrants, you are imposing them against their will - but that, I was going to say, you are used to it.  Finally, you have done everything you can to bring down the government of Syria by fighting a terrible civil war in this country. You are discarding today by accusing Russia, which is fighting the Islamic State, of all evils, but, I say very clearly, this does not hide your overwhelming responsibility and that of Mr Weber's American neoconservative masters who, from Iraq, have thrown this part of the world into absolutely appalling chaos. Mr Juncker, you are totally disconnected from reality. Totally! You tell us that you are planning 88 billion investments in Africa, when the European Union is impoverished at breakneck speed. You are talking about job creation, but you just forget to talk about the job losses that are obviously much more significant today. You explain to us that the Hungarian referendum is a victory for the European Union, because there would have been a turnout of less than 50% when 95% of Hungarians, or perhaps 98%, made it clear that they did not want migrants.  I would remind you, Mr Juncker, however, that, if I follow your analysis, then the Hungarians decided not to join the European Union, since the referendum on EU membership had received less participation than the one on migrants.  As for Mr Weber - I am not even talking about his statements, I am not talking about the monomaniacal attacks on Mr Farage or against myself, we are used to it, we are not even paying attention to it, in this case - I will mention his desperate lies to explain to us that Britain is going badly, whereas all the economic indicators of Great Britain show that, in this post-Brexit Period , it is doing much better than before the referendum and much better than all of our own countries, in this case.  So it is because you are disconnected from this reality that people are fleeing you. They turn their backs on you, they want to drop the moorings. This is the case for the Greeks, it is the case of the Danes, the Poles, the Hungarians, the Dutch, the Italians who, tomorrow, will vote in a referendum on the Constitution, which will also be a referendum for or against the European Union, and it will be the case, I hope, as soon as possible, of course, for the French.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "  NI).

Can the European Union apply the quota to the distribution of migrants in all the countries of Europe, so that Greece ceases to be a place of accumulation of impoverished and poor people? Does the European Union have the possibility of forcing Turkey to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and stop blackmailing it? Does the European Union have the capacity and the will to implement a trade policy that will set aside multinational companies and support European industries, agricultural and agricultural products? Will it accept the TTIR agreement which is disastrous for Europe's interests? And finally, does it have the political courage to review its relations with Russia and to revise the policy it has been implementing so far and which has led to a deadlock in relations between the two countries, to the detriment of the interests of both countries?

There are no plans for what will happen in 100 years' time, but it does not help what the last speakers have done: eternal mockery of how bad the situation is and still deepening the problem. I am extremely grateful to the President of the Commission for once again making specific points today. Politics has something to do with the fact that politics also solves concrete problems. And it is now a matter of whether we in Parliament – we have made 27 000 different proposals again today – just like the Commission or how the Council is trying to focus on a few key points and prove to the people through political action that we can get them resolved. For example, on the refugee issue, we can talk about what is not yet possible. But you can also say. This with the Turkey agreement is already a great success. Not tens of thousands but 86, that is progress. That does not mean that everything is done. And question 2: how can we then achieve solidarity in Europe, which means that everyone must also take in some refugees, some migrants? Perhaps it is also true, as the President of the Commission said, that flexibility should be built in so that everyone can go along with it. It is important, however, that everyone participates in this project. Or on the question of growth: there is no point in tinkering with industry here, but concrete conditions must be created for growth to be created. Or you have to say 'yes' to trade relations and contracts. You can't just chuckle at what's going wrong. We have to say in concrete terms that we are doing this now – with CETA and also in other negotiations. I found the reference, Mr Juncker, extremely helpful as to what has been created in terms of jobs through the South Korean trade agreement. This is the reality when it is done, and when it is not just stupid. For me, this also includes the question of how we deal with real violations of human rights or the killing of people in the world. I am deeply infuriated that there is no outcry in this shop about what is happening in Syria. I am very grateful to Manfred Weber and the other colleagues for mentioning it by their name. We make a minute of remembrance here for every time we do it. Hundreds of thousands are being slaughtered, and we are not saying that this will not continue, nor are we showing the Russians the red card.

We have been fighting for two years, Mr President, for this paradigm shift. This is central to the agenda of our specific programme.

This includes not being satisfied, Mr Weber, with 19% youth unemployment. And that includes refugee policy. It's all easy to describe.

The first is on migrants. Today, it is clear that the people of European countries do not accept the quota policy. And Hungary, regardless of how we assess the outcome of the referendum, will not accept migrants, as will some other European Union countries. Will the European Parliament and the European Council find the courage to recognise that quota policy has suffered an absolute fiasco? Is there enough determination to understand that the only effective means of dealing with and the problems that come with migration is external border and internal border controls? Secondly, on the Treaty on America and the European Union. Neither the President's name nor the terms of the election campaign can be an excuse to close their eyes to a treaty that will open up the export of unsafe food, chemical and other products to their countries to the people of Europe. The calls to speed up negotiations, in which the aspirations of the parties are so far diametrically opposed and for which no country is compromised, is another irresponsible example of the policy that we have today galore. And thirdly, for the future. Dialogue and dialogue alone are a prerequisite for the continued existence of the European Union. I am not just talking about this treaty here. Dialogue, not confrontation, is necessary both after Hungary and after the British referendums. That dialogue is no less necessary when America and Russia terminate negotiations on a possible peace process in Syria.

Let me start by reacting to the words of Mrs Le Pen, who said that Poland is turning away from the European Union. If more than 80% of Poles are invariably, continuously and firmly in favour of the European Union, it means that Mrs Le Pen (already absent) has detached herself from reality. Every summit of the European Union, at a time of ebb and flow of faith in the meaning of being together, a crisis of confidence and a return of fear for the future, is both an opportunity to rebuild trust and a risk of exposing and deepening divisions. So this is a very serious test of european leaders' responsibility not only for the message to a country that is typical: \"How much have I won, how bravely have I fought for national interests?\" but also: \"What common European prescription have I found for common problems that outgrow the capabilities of a single country?\" And it's about specifics, not about more political announcements.  The agenda of this forthcoming summit perfectly illustrates both the opportunity and the temptation to reveal differences in areas such as migration, trade and relations with Russia. Of course, the most difficult area for finding a European compromise is migration, because here are the greatest havoc, here the most xenophobia and populism govern, manage people's fears and emotions. What is needed here is the most concrete thing that builds a common European sense of security. There are things in the workshop that are not controversial: aid to Bulgaria or agreements with third countries, but for example, this automatic system of reallocation of refugees is probably not the way to find a common European solution.

Competition with China, with the United States - where the transatlantic agreement encounters difficulties, with Russia - where the Union's intervention in Ukraine has repercussions and sanctions weigh on the backs of the peoples of the Union. On the refugee issue, the European Union is not just weak. She consciously refuses to confront the victims of her interventions, the refugees.  With the Joint Military Headquarters it is escalating its interventions in favour of the major interests, multiplying the refugees and trapping them in Greece, reinforcing nationalism, racism and fascists. The situation carries the risk of a general conflict, the victims of which will not be those who incite competition, but the people. Conclusion: it was a great mistake to hope that with the current, more flexible, political situation the situation will change.

These migrants now come mainly from West Africa, which is generally at peace, and no longer from countries at war, such as Somalia or Sudan, so controlling migration flows requires that the problem be dealt with upstream at European level. It starts with a common foreign policy: a policy of partnership with the countries of departure and transit, if they are at peace, and a policy of peacemaking, if they are in civil war.

When we talk about migration and when we talk about how we want to prevent migration in the future, it is, of course, primarily a question of helping the countries affected to improve the living conditions of their citizens. This includes the many funds that we have, and that includes – perhaps you take this opportunity – for the Heads of Government to talk about having to fill these funds, and not just the EU coffers and a very few.  The Afghanistan Conference is currently meeting in Brussels. This is a concrete example of how to try to help a country so that people no longer have to run away. And it is also true that the EU Commission has agreed with the country that it must take back refugees. But I do not think that the two things can be combined. You can't say we're giving you money to make people better off, but if you don't take back our refugees, we're not giving you the money to make them worse off and want to get even more. We have to be very careful that there is no link.  My second point, and very briefly on Russia, is that you have initiated strategic discussions on our relationship with Russia, and we really need them very much! That is roughly the opposite of what Mr Weber has done here this morning. I agree with his analysis: of course it is impossible, and of course I am also angry about what is happening in Aleppo and about other things – you could list a lot.

On that very day the sea was calm and more than 6 000 people arrived in Italy and in the following hours 4 655 people were recovered at sea, more than 10 000 in two days. We have exceeded last year's level and Italy is the only one in contrast because, while in all the other countries we see a reduction in arrivals, in Italy there is an increase, we have exceeded 150 000 arrivals.  I would have liked to have heard what Martin Kobler said in this House, because Martin Kobler pointed out that trafficking in human beings is a crime and as such must be combated, that legality must be re-established. We need strong and unified action. We cannot have a Europe that simply talk about quotas for refugees to be relocated, we cannot have a Europe that simply increases resources for rescue missions at sea.

President Juncker's speech at the last meeting was important, the Bratislava process got under way and we must support this accordingly. I also think that the statements that are here today are important, for example in the economic development with the Digital Single Market; I do not need to explain this further. However, the fight against the causes of flight and the issue of the new Africa policy, support for the Africa Fund and many changes there is also extremely important, as is the fact that we are able to reach agreements with neighbouring countries that are on the sea, such as Turkey, that we get reasonable conditions for refugees, but not leave them at sea. However, my main point, which I would like to mention, is the question of foreign and security policy. I regret the fact that the British Foreign Secretary said at the meeting of defence ministers that they are stopping everything, that they are more in favour of NATO than the SECRETARY-General of NATO, who welcomed European development, that progress is being made here. And I believe that when it comes to the questions of a headquarters, a permanent structured corporation, the issues that have to do with the European Defence Agency and all these issues are important: we are throwing out too much money because the nation states are not cooperating sensibly in these areas. That is why we need the European dimension, which is now under way and which is to be achieved by Rome. The events surrounding Syria show it: we are the world champions in soft power, but we are not sitting at the negotiating table when it comes to war and peace, because we have nothing to contribute to. That is why we need to improve in this area. And sorry, I must also say that I have always preached: we must be tough on Russia on the Ukraine issue, but we need Russia to build peace in other areas such as Syria. This was a misjudgment of me. On this issue, too, Russia is doing pure power politics at the expense of the people – pure power politics, no matter what the price!

This will disappear any barrier to the action and profitability of multinational companies.  Labour legislation, environmental protection standards, consumer safety and public health standards will be drastically squeezed downwards. Democracy itself will be circumvented, since multinationals will be able through ISDS to challenge the decisions of sovereign states by claiming reparations whenever their profits are to be adversely affected. In other words, we will lead to absolute market dominance. We, as GUE, have stood up to TTYR and will stand up to CETA because we are consistently fighting for the strengthening of workers' rights and the social state and against the interests of multinationals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 76, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Hilde VAUTMANS", "mepid": "130100", "text": "   I am pleased that there will finally be a full debate on Russia in the European Council and that we will not simply go back to extending sanctions and plunge ourselves into a cold war with Russia.

Mr President, since we are discussing refugees and migrants, I will raise an issue with the Commission, which concerns it and which is a huge outstanding issue relating to Turkey, since there is an express demand from Erdoğan for the liberalisation of procedures for the visas of Turkish nationals. This decision, however, belongs 100% to the European Union itself, it does not belong to Erdoğan. So we have 72 criteria. In a question I put to the Commission and from the reply I received, it is obvious that the Commission is already making rebates in its assessment. While the 72 criteria are indivisible and concern the whole of the European Union, we are beginning to recognise 'partial fulfilment of criteria', 'emerging progress' and so on. I will conclude with this debate: this morning, coming here in the car of the European Parliament, my driver, when he realised that I was from Cyprus, asked me a question which I ask everyone: how is it possible that Turkey holds a third of Cyprus with Turkish troops and has reached the point of the pre-accession talks in which it is today?", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Maria GRAPINI", "mepid": "124785", "text": "   – Mr President, Mr Juncker's speech on the state of the Union was appreciated in my country, but it must not remain just a speech.

It is clear to me that the European Union as such cannot survive a situation of uncontrolled mass immigration into Europe. It is equally clear to me that the European Union cannot survive in a situation where we take leave of our fundamental values, refusing international protection to people fleeing atrocities such as in Aleppo, on the grounds that they are migrants and not refugees, which is a false ground. So these are the two guiding principles I would like to apply to our migration policy.  If we want to have controlled migration, and if we want to stick to our fundamental values, which is providing shelter to people fleeing from war and persecution which, I might add, is a fundamental Christian value to those who seem to use Christian values to keep out refugees, then we desperately need a comprehensive approach to the migration issue. We cannot pick and choose. We need to do everything, everywhere, at the same time, which means to do better at protecting our international borders, to do better at redistributing migrants who have arrived according to agreements we have reached, to make sure we also apply resettlement in those areas where refugees are now, and cannot be sustainably housed, to have agreements with third countries so that we provide for development there and that we provide for the right conditions so that economic migrants or people who seek an economic future in Europe but have no right to international protection can be returned to those countries. This is a comprehensive approach and we cannot pick and choose, one or the other. Those who say flexible solidarity means you can pick and choose are wrong. We need to do it all. We do not need to do everything in the same measure everywhere, but everything will have to be done by all of us. I insist on this also because I was in Lampedusa a couple of days ago. And here today I want to salute the incredible efforts of the Italian Navy, of the people of all the international organisations involved, of the Italian coastguard, who daily save hundreds, if not thousands, of people from drowning. And still we have not prevented people from drowning in the Mediterranean, in incredible numbers in the southern Mediterranean, and also here only a sustainable policy will help us solve this problem. Fences and walls will not solve the problem. Those who believe that fences and walls will solve the problem are simply fleeing from reality. Just imagine that Africa and the next generation will have anywhere between 3 and 6 billion people. If we do not help Africa develop itself, if we did not make sure that girls can go to school, and that women do not feel they have to have nine children to survive, if we do not provide for that, no high fence, no barbed wire, no walls will stop people from coming to Europe. Either we help them develop themselves or we will be subject to mass immigration into Europe. That, my colleagues, is something we need to do jointly, and we need to start doing it now.  Finally, I want to pay tribute to Václav Havel. I have strong memories of a speech he made in Prague, and I was present there, where he recalled his memories of fighting for freedom, fighting against walls, fighting against fences, fighting against barbed wire. He said in that speech that he grew up and lived in a society where East and West were moral categories, where East and West defined a difference in values, and he was so happy that now he was President of a country and a society where East and West were reduced to mere geographical qualifications. Please let us stay true to the ideas and idealism of Václav Havel, and please let us make sure that, in our European Union, East and West remain purely geographical denominations.

(The President asked Members to take their seats) The Bratislava Summit was mentioned quite often in this debate this morning, and I would like to thank all those who said that Bratislava was a useful event. However, I am not ignoring the views of those who obviously believed or expected more to come out from Bratislava. If I may say, we are not among those who are saying that Bratislava was an extraordinary or exceptional success. We see it realistically and we want to measure it against the two objectives that we have set ourselves when the meeting was convened in Bratislava. Number one: there were clear expectations that we would have a serious, open and frank debate after Brexit, but also they wanted to start a debate about the future of the European Union. We have agreed in Bratislava that the reflection process will start, and it will culminate next March when we will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Rome Treaties, so that is one concrete result of Bratislava. Secondly, in Bratislava, several areas and steps were defined where we agreed that we need to make clear progress in order to show tangible results. I agree with Jean-Claude Juncker, who wished to have a more binding timetable for Bratislava, and let me say that the Presidency will work on the follow-up to this. I am speaking in this House just to recall that this is not only work for the Council or for Parliament or for the Commission. There is common work that we have to do, namely that towards the end of this year, the Commission, Parliament and the Council should agree on a common list or joint declaration of legislative priorities. So this is also the follow-up after Bratislava and this is a good basis for us to work.  May I also say that if Bratislava was not about one thing it was definitely not a demonstration of intergovernmentalism. How otherwise could Heads of State in Bratislava have welcomed the State of the Union speech of the President of the Commission? Jean-Claude was right that it was maybe for the first time that Heads of State had explicitly welcomed a speech that he has delivered, just two days before Bratislava.  Second point. Of course many of you referred to the tragic events unfolding in Syria. Russia is on the agenda of the European Council. I would like to recall that the rationale for including Russia on the agenda was a bit different – it was in the context of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine – but I agree that the events in Syria are prompting us to have a broader debate, a strategic debate, about future relations with Russia.  Lastly, honourable Member in 't Veld asked a question on whether we as a Presidency are ready to work with you on the Asylum Package. I would not see the Council as being a bottleneck on this particular issue. I would like to say that what the Commission has proposed is a far-reaching reform of the asylum system, including Dublin. Member States will feel the impact of this and we simply need more time to explore what can be done. The Presidency wants to organise this work speedily.

It is likely that the statements calling for a gradual return to the previous relationship will be heard again, so it is worth renewing the facts of recent months. In September, parliamentary elections were held, after which the non-systemic opposition was finally eliminated from the Russian political system. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that the Kremlin was seeking to consolidate security structures and restore the ministry of security, the MGB, which was active in the USSR. At the end of the month, a dutch-led investigation into the MH17 tragedy confirmed that a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine had been shot down by a Russian-led missile complex, BUK, which was later returned to Russia. Although the specific identities of the officials who committed this crime and issued the order have not yet been disclosed, questions about Russia's responsibility in this tragedy should no longer arise.

The Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is a legal instrument of the utmost importance and ratified by all the Member States of the European Union. The Convention establishes a system of cooperation between States Parties to resolve cases of international child abduction. Very often these problems occur when a couple has separated. If the parents come from different countries, they may be tempted to take advantage of the lack of cooperation between these states in order to obtain custody of the child.  The aim of the Convention is to provide solutions to these situations at international level by determining that the courts of the child's country of residence have jurisdiction and that the law of the child is applicable.

The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abuse is a very important instrument that provides for a system for cooperation in finding solutions to cases of international child abuse. The Convention was ratified a long time ago by all EU Member States. Problems are most often the case in the case of separation between parents who come from different countries. There is a danger that one of the parents may wish to take advantage of the lack of cooperation between those two countries and thus acquire the exclusive custody of the children. In such cases, the biggest problem is the national bias of the legal systems in individual countries, and the judgments often end in such a way that each national court entrusts the child with the custody of a parent who is a national of that country. The Convention, however, lays down jurisdiction on the courts and law of the state in which the child is domiciled, as well as a system for ensuring the immediate return of the child who is wrongfully deprived.

The Convention aims to resolve such situations on an international scale by establishing that cases are tried by the competent courts and in accordance with the applicable legislation of the minor's State of residence. The Convention also establishes a system ensuring the immediate return of abducted minors.

As with peru's accession to the Hague Convention, I have no reservations about kazakhstan's accession to that Convention, and I therefore fully support the proposed decision. The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abuse is a very important instrument that provides for a system for cooperation in finding solutions to cases of international child abuse. The Convention was ratified a long time ago by all EU Member States. Problems are most often the case in the case of separation between parents who come from different countries. There is a danger that one of the parents may wish to take advantage of the lack of cooperation between those two countries and thus acquire the exclusive custody of the children.

The decision does not apply to some Member States: Denmark, which has an exemption clause on the EU's civil justice policy, and the Netherlands, which has already recognised Kazakhstan's decision before it becomes an exclusive EU jurisdiction. I challenge this limitation of sovereignty. Nevertheless, I vote for this recognition of adherence to the convention for the benefit of the protection of children across borders. ", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 404, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Joëlle MÉLIN", "mepid": "124765", "text": "  In writing.

This situation occurs most of the time when a couple separates. If one of the spouses is from another country, sometimes the courts of the two countries concerned declare themselves competent but come to contrary conclusions, particularly with regard to the custody of the child.  The convention aims to remedy such situations: it establishes the jurisdictions and law of the state where the child resides as competent, and organizes his immediate return.

As child abduction prevention is an important part of the EU's policy to promote the rights of the child, the Hague Convention on civil-legal aspects of international child abduction has been adopted to this end since 25 October 1980. At international level, the European Union is actively working to improve its application and encourages third countries to approach it. Therefore, in 2011 the Commission adopted eight proposals for Council decisions with a view to accepting the eight countries' access to this Hague Convention. Korea only passed the instrument of access to the Convention in 2012.

The purpose of the Hague Convention is to protect children from abductions, which occur in particular in cases where divorce between their parents originating in different States occurs. If one of the parents decides to abduct the child to his or her home state and that state is not part of the cooperation in dealing with international child abductions, he can so easily get custody of the child.

And it states that \"in order to ensure the effectiveness of cooperation and exchange of information between the European Public Prosecutor's Office and Eurojust, the two bodies should operate in the same place\". We are facing another attempt to advance on areas that go to the heart of the sovereignty of states, in this case to justice. The vision set here is to centralise, structure and strengthen entities such as Eurojust, which escape democratic and judicial control, overcoming guarantees as to the rights and freedoms provided for in national legislative and constitutional frameworks. This goes beyond free and sovereign cooperation between national states, and progress is made with the creation of supranational control mechanisms, initiatives inseparable from a security drift that increasingly puts fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees at risk.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 908, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Luke Ming FLANAGAN", "mepid": "124985", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I voted against.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 909, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Monika BEŇOVÁ", "mepid": "23868", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 The Council is in charge of the european public prosecutor's office's readiness and progress is very slow in this process, although some progress is noticeable here.

In July 2013, the Commission presented a regulation based on article 86 TFEU on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office or EPPO. The EPPO was proposed to fill the institutional gap that currently exists, as only national authorities can prosecute EU fraud but they cannot do this across national borders, which is a serious defect considering the internal market and the free movement of money. Also, considering that the EPPO is being adopted under the consent procedure, which means that the Parliament will have to  say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the text that the Member States agree on, it is vital that a resolution is passed giving the institution’s position on it. Thankfully, the resolution highlights the need for the EPPO to be efficient and independent, and its scope and competences should be based on the directive on the fight against fraud to the Union’s financial interests by means of criminal law (PIF Directive). It is estimated by the European Commission that fraud against the EU’s financial interests costs around EUR 3 billion every year.

The Council dissected the original proposal to create an independent centralised European public prosecutor's office with a pyramid structure. Instead, he proposes a complex European prosecutor's office bound by the omnipresence of the national link endangering its independence.  Moreover, I have serious doubts about the added value of this European public prosecutor's office as the Council proposes to us today. The Council has added additional limits and there is still some question as to what fraud case the European Public Prosecutor's Office will be responsible for.

Eurojust's vision is to be an important partner and hub of expertise at judicial level for effective measures against cross-border organised crime in the European Union. Eurojust was established with the aim of fostering and improving coordination and cooperation between national judicial authorities in the prosecution of serious cross-border crime in the European Union. Each of the 28 Member States sends one high-ranking representative to The Hague-based Eurojust. I think a high-quality solution is that representatives are experienced state attorneys, judges or police officers with equal competences.

In addition, they address challenges and practical problems arising from differences between the legal systems of individual Member States.

The proposal therefore calls on the Council to waive the rule which deprives the Public Prosecutor's Office of the possibility of intervening in certain cases where PIF offences are committed. The proposal calls for a clear gap between the powers of that body and the powers of national courts, avoiding conflicts of jurisdiction, in what is a negative effect of the so-called 'national link'.

It would investigate and prosecute perpetrators of fraud related to EU funds. The existence and shape of the European Public Prosecutor's Office raises a number of questions. Until now, only national authorities have been authorised to investigate and prosecute perpetrators in this area. Firstly, it appears that the prevention of fraud to the detriment of the Union's financial interests could be achieved by the Member States within the current framework of coordination and cooperation. The rules on the European Public Prosecutor's Office must be assessed from the point of view of the principle of subsidiarity. Nor should the European Union seek to create new universal criminal law rules. Secondly, the analysis of the PIF Directive also raises concerns. It should be emphasised that 90 per cent of VAT fraud is suffered by Member States.

Europe is a social market economy with a view to achieving sustainable economic and inclusive growth, so it is necessary to create a comprehensive industrial policy that protects EU workers, in order to avoid new production shifts. To this end, support for projects in the regions most affected by deindustrialisation needs to be accelerated, all funds, in particular the ESF and EGF, should be mobilised.

Deindustrialisation affected big and small companies alike.

She is not able to be here and therefore as usual she has asked the Presidency to speak on her behalf, and it is a great honour for me to participate in this important debate about Syria.  Unfortunately, I have to start by recognising the fact that what we see in Syria right now is the biggest humanitarian catastrophe of the century, and it is getting worse by the day. Our exchange serves as an important input to the discussion among the EU Foreign Ministers at the next Foreign Affairs Council in mid-October. In spite of the international community’s efforts to restore a nationwide ceasefire and press the parties in the conflict to come back to the negotiation table in Geneva, the violence has escalated once again during the last two weeks. We have all seen the dreadful pictures of entire families caught in debris in Aleppo under waves of bombardments. We all condemned the despicable attacks on the humanitarian aid convoy on 19 September and the deaths of the eight workers of the Syrian Red Crescent, who lost their lives while trying to save others. Last month in New York, at the UN General Assembly, a number of attempts were made to get the US—Russia deal on the cessation of hostilities back on track. The High Representative/Vice—president has been actively involved in this effort through meetings with the Syrian Opposition, US and Russian Ministers as well as with the main regional players in the conflict. Two International Syria Support Group ministerial meetings were organised, which tried to salvage the cessation of hostilities and reduce the violence in the country. Neither meeting led to a positive outcome. In fact the Syrian parties are now further away from a negotiated solution for a political transition than before. Let me reassure you that we are incessantly at work to contribute to the ending of the conflict and of the suffering of the Syrian people. The political answers in the case of the Syrian conflict are never straightforward or black and white. As we are working towards a renewed strategy for Syria, let me recall the three policy tracks established by the International Syria Support Group and the EU’s contribution to each: the humanitarian track, the ceasefire and the political track. Firstly, the humanitarian track remains a core mission for the European Union. We are – and always will be – the main donor of humanitarian aid for Syria. The Commission reactivated the ECHO office in Damascus earlier this year. No matter what happens, our first duty is to provide support and hope to the Syrian people, be it to the refugees in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, in Europe or inside Syria, and especially in the besieged and hard-to-reach areas. We need to continue to do all we can to push for unhindered humanitarian aid deliveries throughout Syria and an end to the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure. We continue to work with the United Nations and with Syrian organisations in this field, including inside Syria, to deliver the aid needed. Therefore High Representative Mogherini and Commissioner Stylianides launched an EU initiative on Aleppo over the weekend, based on two main elements: first, let in humanitarian aid. We are working to facilitate the urgent delivery of basic lifesaving assistance to civilians in eastern Aleppo. If the UN ceasefire of at least two days is agreed, an inter—agency aid convoy will be ready to reach East Aleppo from West Aleppo to let out the wounded and the sick. We are working to ensure medical evacuations from East Aleppo, with the focus on women, children and elderly people. This will be done in close cooperation with UN agencies and other international agencies. In the last few days, the High Representative has discussed this proposal with a number of international players, including the United States, Russia and Iran. The Commission has also made EUR 25 million available in an emergency fund for addressing priority needs, including health, water, food supplies and services. The EU will not be directly involved in operations on the ground but will provide pre-funding and assist in the facilitation operation, reaching out to partners on the ground, as well as to regional players in support of the initiative. But addressing the current emergency is not enough. The Syrians in Syria need access to services, education for their children and hospitals for the injured. They need jobs and functioning local economies if we want to build a strong society, if we want to avoid more refugees fleeing Syria and if we want to avoid the radicalisation of the next generation of Syrians. In the absence of a top—down political solution, we need to start building peace from the bottom up by helping local communities and civilian administration to start functioning and provide services to the local population in areas where this is possible. This is in line with the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of May 2016 that commit us to investing in civil society and support for local resilience inside Syria. Secondly, on the ceasefire, the EU as such is not a military player in the conflict. The greater responsibility lies with those who are supplying military assets and personnel. They have the leverage to push for an end to hostilities if they choose to, so we must continue to reach out to these regional actors. None of them will want Syria to fall apart, but Syria will fall apart if the war continues. We need to convince all actors that a political solution is the only option ahead of us. No side will win this war on the field. Military offensives cannot bring victory nor impose peace, but only prolong the bloodshed. It took 16 years for the Lebanese people to put an end to their civil war. We cannot afford such a scenario in Syria. This leads me to the final and most important track: the political track. In these times of despair for the Syrians, we must not lose hope in a political process and must never stop working for it. As the UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has recently explained in the UN Security Council, losing hope equals abandoning the Syrian people to death and devastation. Many are working and many are now looking to Europe for answers. High Representative Mogherini and her officials are engaged in a constant dialogue with the United States, Russia and the countries of the region. We are thinking out of the box about what can create the conditions for the Syrians to start talking seriously about their future within the parameters that have been set by previous attempts in Geneva and by the UN Security Council. We are aware of the different concerns and interests of the parties in the conflict and their own political objectives in Syria. However, none of them can justify the indiscriminate targeting of civilians and the atrocities committed. In Boston ten days ago, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, and High Representative Mogherini, called on Russia to take steps to restore the credibility of our effort, including by halting the regime’s bombardment of its own people. The High Representative is also in direct contact with the Syrian political opposition.

Madam President, Aleppo is experiencing a huge humanitarian tragedy. All the principles of international law are flouted. Civilians, hospitals and humanitarian personnel are the targets of Syrian and Russian shelling. The United States has announced that it can no longer cooperate with Russia on the Syrian issue because Putin has not kept his own commitments. But I ask the following question: when did the Russian leader meet his commitments? In Crimea, has he fulfilled his commitments? I think it is the same in Russia.  It should be stressed that Russia is directly responsible for the escalation of violence in the Syrian conflict. The country has never engaged in Syria to fight terrorism. Putin simply wanted to support his friend Assad.  I would like to welcome the proposal by Mrs Mogherini and Commissioner Stylianides to set up an emergency humanitarian initiative for Aleppo. I regret that neither of them is here with us today. Every way needs to be done to facilitate the delivery of emergency aid to civilians and to ensure medical evacuations. I know that the Union is very involved in this humanitarian aspect. However, we must also invest in other areas, including at the diplomatic level.  The role of the European Union in resolving the Syrian conflict is far too timid, while this war has a significant impact on Europe. But to really play a role in resolving the conflict, we must no longer be under any illusions about Russia. We have to work with the United States, just as the United States has to work with us. It has to be reciprocal. You can't commit yourself.  Thank you very much for your attention, including the communist group that still supports Putin.

This happens a few kilometres from here, off the Cypriot coast and not far from the Greek islands, and then there are some who are surprised that refugees are arriving, refugees are arriving. But if there is a war, if there are millions of dead! There are bombings on schools, on hospitals, on women, on children, on doctors. But what do those people have to do? They come to us and someone says we didn't welcome them. There is a humanitarian tragedy to which an answer must be given. This can be defined as a crime of humanity. And those who commit this crime, and we do not discount anyone, will forever bear responsibility for it in the face of history. This House has a duty to strongly condemn the infamy of attacks on civilians.

In those five and a half years, in this very House, I have advocated the merits of various policies, including a no-fly zone to curtail the capabilities of Assad’s air force, to reluctantly working with the Russians and the Assad regime to defeat ISIS and other extremist groups like Al—Nusra, now rebranded as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Like so many other proposed solutions, these are all now largely unworkable and obsolete in the current context. We have over 1 000 armed groups and militias operating across the country. ISIS continues to hold huge swathes of territory and external interests are taking an ever—greater role in the conflict, and we are now descending into multiple proxy wars.  Russia’s decision to transport S 300 surface-to-air missiles is clearly targeted at further limiting the options of the US-led coalition to act against Assad’s air force and increases the chances of unintentional escalation. Following the recent breakdown of the latest Kerry—Lavrov ceasefire talks and the subsequent diplomatic fallout between America and Russia, any hope now of trying to focus combined military efforts against ISIS and Jabhat seems lost. Russia is now more openly and brazenly than ever allying itself with Assad’s brutal regime and is acting as a joint belligerent in the siege of Aleppo, in addition to the support from Iran. This offensive has the potential to become a turning point in the entire conflict. It could also prove to be one of the most deadly and atrocious. Already we hear of hospitals and aid convoys being hit and the continued atrocious use of barrel and bunker-busting bombs against civilians. Many politicians and voters still question the merits of intervention, and it is vital that we continue to make the case that there is not only a humanitarian imperative to act against authoritarian dictators killing innocent civilians with impunity, but that not acting also poses risks to our own societies. The conflict in Syria has seen millions of people flee for their lives, many of whom have found their way to Europe, as Mr Pittella pointed out. We have seen the huge debate that this has fuelled in Europe and how mainstream parties of government are increasingly being pressured by populist and right-wing parties to bring an end to Mrs Merkel’s – in my view, ill-advised – open door policy. For the first time I see the notion of European solidarity seriously challenged, and I witnessed first-hand how this issue of uncontrolled migration played out during the EU referendum campaign in my country into a Brexit outcome. It is neither right nor possible to ignore what is happening in Syria. We must not allow the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan to completely tarnish the merits of intervention. After five and a half years of indecisiveness in the West, to limit our options, perhaps a de facto partition of Syria is now the only hope for peace in that country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1251, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I know that after three minutes you will have your hammer and so on, as though this is not important about Syria and the tragedy in Syria. I find it like a kindergarten, the way we are debating such a tragedy there, and I have already used seven seconds now. But I disagree with the Council; I disagree with its analysis. What the Council is saying is: let’s continue with what we did in the past and the problems will be solved, and we are going to help the moderate forces in Aleppo. Well, we are not doing anything for the moderate forces in Aleppo. That is the reality. We are not even capable of sending them aid, as we have tried to do several times, because we have failed in Syria and we failed in Aleppo. We failed first of all because the Americans took a wrong decision years ago by putting a red line on the use of chemical weapons, and once Assad used his chemical weapons we did nothing at all. We stopped our measures against the Assad regime, but we have given the message to the Assad regime that if you don’t use chemical weapons, you can do what you want. Go forward to kill your people: we shall not disturb you. The second thing is the absence of Europe – let’s be honest, we were absent in this whole conflict, and it is the Americans and the Russians who are negotiating above our heads. So, nevertheless, things are crystal clear. There is a problem here: the problem is that we have a key resolution of the UN Security Council: Resolution 2254. That is the key resolution, saying: stop the bombing of civilians, allow humanitarian access, limit the military campaign to fight whom? Daesh and al-Nusra. That is the Security Council resolution. And what the Russians are doing is the exact opposite: they are bombing the civilians. They are stopping – in fact, blocking – humanitarian access, and they are not fighting Daesh and not fighting al-Nusra: they are fighting against the moderate forces in Aleppo. That is what is happening. The only way to come out of this stalemate is to have a new strategy, and for the Council, together with Ms Mogherini, and together with our American allies, to change their strategy. And the strategy can only be, in my opinion, three things. First of all, we need a no-fly zone over Aleppo. We need a no-fly zone over Aleppo, and actually if we don’t do it in the coming days and the coming weeks, it’s over, because the Russians yesterday delivered an anti-air missile system that will make from Aleppo not a no-fly zone but a free bombing zone for their airforce and for the airforce of the Assad regime. That is what is happening. We have only a few days, a few weeks to change the course of Aleppo. Secondly, we also need, as we have discussed this morning, Mr Weber, in my opinion, a credible sanction plan for the non-compliance of Russia and of the Assad regime with the UN Security Council Resolution. Finally, the last lesson to learn: let’s start to make our own defence community and to develop our own capabilities, because that is the only way for the coming years to secure our neighbourhood.

What's going on with the Syrian people, and what I see, is a group of men who seem to be playing Risk, that war game that the boys play on the board, each choosing their soldiers, their pawns, but no one mentions the essence of this debate that it is the Syrian people and what is living in Syria. So you are all very entertained playing your games, doing your arm of iron and not really responding to the humanitarian problem in Syria.  I must tell you that the worst example this Parliament can set is exactly what we are having in this debate: it is to equip a conflict, to equip victims to play your war games. We don't need that! We need to be on the side of the Syrian people. No, Mr Verhofstadt, you do - I know you are not listening to me because you must be a woman and not playing the war games that you play with your friends - but I must say, Mr Verhofstadt, what you have said is absolutely unacceptable. We need to support the efforts of the United Nations, a political dialogue, yes, with all actors, excluding terrorists. And as for moderate forces, perhaps we could stop indiscriminately arming so-called \"moderate forces\" and stop creating terrorist groups, because al-Nusra, before it was a terrorist group, was also a moderate force that should be supported.

And I believe that the reports and the images from Aleppo have actually put us in a situation where we have to question the laisser fair and our own ignorance. Aleppo – this is the place that Putin and Assad are turning into hell on earth. I found it very bizarre that Russian media have spoken of Aleppo becoming Syria's Stalingrad, in a situation where Russian troops are turning Aleppo into Syria's Stalingrad. What I have felt over the last few days was not only this cursed impotence, but it was also anger at myself and at ourselves, because I believe that we have not been deceived by Russia and Putin, but that we have been deceived in full consciousness. We wanted to believe that we could go down the road with Putin in peace negotiations. We wanted to believe that we could create an international strategy with Putin against ISIS. Did the West really want to deceive itself? I believe: yes, and I believe that this is at the latest with the attack on the United Nations aid convoy, that this is over at the latest with this situation, that we are allowed to deceive ourselves in this way. I believe that it really must now be a matter of making it clear to Vladimir Putin that this escalation, for which he is responsible, stands in the way of any return to normal relations between the European Union and Russia. The catalogue of demands presented by the Russian side – after it was decided in the United States that this can no longer continue – at the height of its own bombing of Aleppo must not be accepted at all. The European Union – and this must be discussed at the summit – must not begin to engage in a logic in which Ukraine and Aleppo are offset. And the US and Europe must not waste any thought on the fact that Russia could be compensated for sanctions. If we were to get involved in the logic of this catalogue, we would reward the aggressor and establish a dangerous principle that must not exist at all. The European Union must be prepared to use its economic weight consistently in these disputes. We must not talk about reducing garrities, but we must talk about the need for further sanctions and that these sanctions are not only needed against Russia, but that our newly established relations with Iran, our relations with the Saudis, but also our relations with Turkey must be discussed from this point of view. European Union diplomacy can only be successful in these situations that we are experiencing with Russia and others in escalation if we are prepared to let this diplomacy cost us something.

The political one, paradoxically, could come not to Geneva, let alone to New York, Damascus, Washington or Brussels, but surprisingly to Istanbul. There, in fact, Putin and Erdogan will meet on 10 October to clearly put their respective demands on the table. On the one hand, there will be a russian and Iranian need to support the ally Assad, so as not to lose the last cornerstones of the Mediterranean, and, on the other, the Turkish will to break the territorial continuity of the Kurds and possibly put them in check with a no-fly zone.  Against the background, the ambiguity of us action, paralysed by the imminent change in the White House, unable to mitigate the agendas of the Gulf allies, to isolate the extremists once and for all, but above all to reconcile the increasingly incoherent alliance with the Turks, with the promise of support for the Kurds, real protagonists of the war against Daesh, precisely those brave Kurds as always used and abandoned by the superpowers engaged in the great Middle Eastern game. The truce and failed attempts at US-Russia coordination have further pushed this strategic rapprochement between Ankara and Moscow.

At the first opportunity, the American coalition bombed a Syrian army post and the next day accused the Russians, without actually having evidence that they had bombed a humanitarian aid convoy. The reality is that Putin has come to the conclusion that there is no concrete prospect for Russia to reach an agreement with Obama on Syria and therefore Russia's action has resumed with those serious consequences that we have rightly highlighted. It turns out from intelligence sources that ISIS would prepare chemical attacks in Syria, and particularly in east Aleppo, against the populations, but no one in this house is saying that.

I think we are dealing with several wars: this is the war of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In order to end this war together, it has been agreed to conduct an 18-month peace process to pacify western Syria, including with the Assad regime in the Geneva negotiations. For years, we have had a veto by Russia against taking action in Syria. We have also decided as the West not to go to Syria – in hindsight, that may have been a mistake. But we are in the situation today that obviously this process of peace-making within Syria with the regime has been destroyed by Russia, because it has conducted this peace process only in order to gain time, to totally win a war – at whatever cost. And that puts a coalition in the fight against ISIS at risk. That is actually the bad background. We are at a kind of turning point. We have always worked – many of us, myself included – to be clear in Ukraine to Russia, but to work with it in a selective cooperation to solve other problems in the world. But now we see in Syria that it develops the same pure will to power as in Ukraine – pure will to power, at whatever cost. This is a change in the situation. These last ten days are a dramatic change in the international situation, which will have a major impact, also in the economic sense.  We must impose sanctions on Russia on technical products and in many other areas, as was the case during the Cold War, so that Russia can no longer develop arms, and at the same time we must be in a position to help the people there. I think it is right that the Commission is trying to prepare humanitarian measures. That is not ridiculous, that is our opportunity! We must not let people rot because we see some people as particularly bad. We have to try to do that. But the one thing is clear, let me conclude by saying that we are the world champions in soft power and the losers in hard power. And soft power only works if you can show hard power.  We are not at the table of negotiations when it comes to war and peace, and i therefore hope that the British will not stop us – as they did at the Conference of Defence Ministers – and that the European Union will finally be able to find the strength to defend our interests in such wars and for peace. , the happiness of people in the regions can fight.

He has recently stated on Aleppo: ‘Imagine the destruction, people with no limbs – blown off, children in terrible pain with no relief, infected, suffering, dying, with nowhere to go and no end in sight. Imagine a slaughterhouse. This is worse. Even a slaughterhouse is more humane’. Tough words, but the most appropriate description of the carnage in Aleppo. Aleppo reminds us of Coventry, Dresden, and Grozny, the last episode where Russia practised the complete destruction of a human community. As we speak, Assad and Russian forces are continuing and intensifying indiscriminate bombing. The brutal character of the war in Syria, in particular in Aleppo, and the use of the most ruthless practices, including the use of chemical weapons, incendiary and bunker bombs, cannot remain unnoticed, and I would say to my colleagues of other political groups: colleagues, silence can be seen today as complicity. We have to act. There is deliberate targeting of civilians, humanitarian workers and hospitals. The water supply has been cut off. These attacks are not only unacceptable, they are crimes in the spirit and the character of international law and of international humanitarian law, and we should treat them as such. So, what to do? There are three issues. I welcome very much the action taken by the European Union and the humanitarian support to Aleppo. The second: I urge the High Representative to work with the UN to win a ceasefire and to allow the convoy of humanitarian aid to get into Aleppo; and thirdly: consider taking immediate sanctions against the governments committing and aiding to commit despicable crimes.

Especially now that US—Russian contacts are at an all—time low, we, the EU, must step up. While hospitals, schools and UN humanitarian convoys are bombed and starved, EU leadership to come to a negotiated peace is still lacking.

We are, as has already been said, faced with a real humanitarian catastrophe, where even hospitals are not being respected. The necessary political solution to the conflict is not moving forward. Even the Russian-American concertation, which had achieved some ephemeral truce a few months ago, does not. Ladies and gentlemen, it is already more than five years of conflict and war. There are many deaths, destruction, suffering, many displaced persons and refugees. We are also in a conflict as fierce as it is complex, because in the war in Syria, in addition to the presence of Dáesh and other terrorist groups, several lines of confrontation intersect; for example, Shiites against Sunnis, Iran against Saudi Arabia, secularists against Islamic radicals, and much more. In this complex situation, with such profound divergences, the margin left to international diplomacy is scarce. The Damascus regime and its allies now seem to be opting for the military solution, as Kerry denounced yesterday in Brussels. The United Nations must redouble its efforts to find a political solution and first and fore all a ceasefire. Permanent members of the Council have a special responsibility, in particular Russia, which has played a key military role for twelve months. Mr Representative of the Council, I encourage you and Mrs Mogherini to continue their humanitarian aid efforts. There is also a need to continue intensive dialogue with the international actors most involved in the conflict, including regional ones, and to assist the United Nations in its peace efforts. These days, at the Security Council, France and Spain are drafting a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, with an international supervisory mechanism. The ceasefire is the largest of the emergencies for Aleppo, so tormented by the bombings of recent weeks.

It is Syria today, and we can speculate on what it is going to be tomorrow. All that is an instrument, an instrument for the recovery of Russia and of Putin. It is an instrument of domestic politics. It is an instrument for increasing influence, and it is an instrument for dividing the European Union and separating us from our allies. This is what it is about. Mr Korčok, if you have a debate in the European Council, two out of the three main issues are related. Migration, where we are heavily affected. Of course what we are seeing today is again intentional. This is intentional because this will produce further migration, which will of course primarily affect Europe. The second issue is the strategy on Russia. What we will also expect is that in this framework, we will see at least the basic points of a strategy on Syria. It is badly needed.

None of the crimes of civilians is excusable, wherever it comes from, but who could seriously say that the bombing of some would be less destructive than those of others? To stop these crimes, we must first make a good diagnosis. What has been happening in Syria since 2011? The truth is that Syria is a major front of Sunni jihad. It is radical Sunni Islam that is destroying this country, and it is doing so not only with the support of the Sunni monarchies of the Gulf, but also because of our own foreign policy mistakes. We repeat, in fact, in Syria the mistake made in Libya. We do not want to see that allowing Sunni jihad to destroy this authoritarian regime is to let it destroy the nation-state and that, without the nation-state, there is nothing but chaos.  The great paradox of the Western world is that its policy supports in the Middle East the enemy it claims to fight in Europe and which strikes it with terrorism.

Erasing Aleppo from the surface of the earth and the indiscriminate aerial bombing of thousands of civilians is absolutely intolerable. There is no doubt about Russia’s core responsibility for these criminal actions. Therefore, the question of lifting any European sanctions against Russia should be off the table. Just the opposite, these crimes warrant more measures at the EU level, targeted at individuals and entities enabling the crimes against the Syrian people.  I am sure that Russian intelligence chiefs, whom some colleagues wanted to take off the EU sanctions list a few months ago, are among them. Like it or not, sanctions are one of the very few instruments the EU has in this situation. We do not have either the military capability, or the political will, to seriously project power which would help to stabilise Syria. Our leverages are economic and legal, so we should use them. Make no mistake, the reason for Russia’s intervention in Syria is obvious.  Europe has become a target of a weapon of mass migration.

There were many diverging positions, but I dare say that this House agrees today on at least two important points that we have heard during our discussion on Syria. First, this House is sending a strong message of condemnation of all the atrocities we are witnessing on the ground in Syria. I dare say that there is no difference between this House and the Member States and institutions. Secondly, we could have a very long discussion, and we would certainly need more time on that, but what matters at this moment, as we speak, is what Federica Mogherini has initiated and that is the initiative on Aleppo. People on the ground are desperately waiting for humanitarian assistance and Federica is working very hard to make it possible in that theatre for the convoy to be able to reach the people of East Aleppo.  The third point that I would like to take with me from this debate is a recognition – an admission if you like – that we are reaching the point where we indeed need a deeper debate about the strategy that we have been witnessing on Syria. I would say that the next opportunity for this deeper discussion about strategy will be at the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council, where I am sure that Federica and the Foreign Ministers will engage in a very deep discussion on this overall strategy. Fourthly, I agree with all those who said that this crisis is prompting us to take further steps towards increasing our capability to go beyond what the European Union is mainly doing in international affairs, namely to be a soft power, a power which is unfortunately quite limited and is focused mainly on humanitarian assistance.  Let me say that steps in this direction are underway. I recall that in Bratislava – and we had a discussion this morning about the upcoming European Council – and I quote from the roadmap, ‘The December European Council should decide on a concrete implementation plan on security and defence and how to make better use of the options in the Treaties, especially as regards capabilities’. So, once again, we know that if we want to have more influence in international affairs, we need to work on capabilities. This process was launched in Bratislava and I assure, on behalf of the Council, that we will work intensively in order to implement what was adopted.

The signature of the peace agreement sent a message of hope after 52 years of armed conflict that has caused 8 million victims, including 260 000 deaths. In times of uncertainty and turmoil, in many regions of the world – including our neighbourhood – it reinforces our conviction that dialogue and diplomacy constitute the best means for resolving conflicts. However, last Sunday, 2 October – contrary to forecasts – the Colombian population rejected the final peace agreements in a referendum by a very small margin. I think we would all have welcomed a different result, but we respect the sovereign choice of the Colombian people. The ‘No’ side in the referendum has defended that the government renegotiate the final agreement with the FARC to get a better deal. We can all agree with President Santos’s statement after the results were made public, and I quote: ‘all Colombians seek peace with no exception. Despite the setback, the path towards peace does not end here’. As you are aware, the peace agreement negotiated in Havana is a complex agreement. It aims, not only to end a 52-year armed conflict, but also addresses its root causes, supporting rural development and attacking the problem of illicit drugs. It also includes provisions on transitional justice and the political participation of the FARC, which are the two aspects most contested by the leaders of the ‘no’ campaign in the referendum held on 2 October. This is a delicate moment for Columbia, as the country must now decide on the way forward. It is of great importance that, after the referendum, both the  Colombian government and the FARC have confirmed their commitment to the ceasefire. A solution can only come from politics and from negotiations. For this reason, President Santos’s decision to send the negotiators back to Havana is a step in the right direction. The EU hopes that all sides – the government, the opposition and the FARC – can unite in a renewed effort and continue on the path towards achieving lasting peace. Columbia is one of the EU’s closest partners in Latin America. Our good relations and cooperation is getting deeper and deeper in many areas. We remain fully committed to this partnership. The European Union will keep on supporting all efforts towards a sustainable solution and to secure a permanent end to violence. We will continue to cooperate to bring peace and prosperity to all Colombians. Our commitment to the peace process in Colombia goes beyond symbolism. In the last weeks, we have announced two very concrete measures to support peace in Colombia. First, the European Council has suspended the FARC from our terrorist list. This is a decision that the Council has taken because of the signature of the peace agreement by the group. It concerns the choice made by the FARC to bring the negotiations to a positive end, not the outcome of the referendum. After the vote, FARC have not been moved away from the peace agreement they signed. On the contrary, they have confirmed their interest to find a peaceful solution. For this reason, the result of the referendum does not affect the suspension. Secondly, we have announced an overall package of nearly EUR 585 million to support Colombia’s post-conflict and peace-building efforts. This sum includes an EU trust fund for Colombia, in which 11 Member States have committed contributions. This trust fund is meant to support the implementation of the agreement. So in the current situation we are not moving forward with the launch of the trust fund. The EU’s engagement in supporting peace-building in Colombia will continue. The EU has sound experience in peace-building in the country, with flagship initiatives such as peace laboratories, over the past 15 years. Lastly, I would like to stress that I share the concern of this Parliament in ensuring the effective protection of human rights. It continues to be a priority for the EU, and we will keep on cooperating with the Colombian government in this respect. This includes a strong focus on human rights defenders. Too often they have been the target of threats and violence. The same goes for minorities, such as the indigenous and the descendant communities and the most vulnerable groups, which have been greatly affected by the conflict, including women and children. I would like to conclude by reiterating that the EU is determined to stand by Columbia in its long-term effort in pursuit of durable and lasting peace as well as a brighter future for all Colombians. I am sure that we can continue to count on the European Parliament’s invaluable and active support for peace-building in Colombia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1331, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA", "mepid": "28397", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Mr Minister, Colombia and your Government will find the solution they deserve so much and Europe must help them.

And disappointed that on Sunday afternoon the result of the \"no\" gave us a great disappointment. But I want to say clearly that peace has not failed in Colombia. A \"no\" has triumphed in Colombia, but certainly there is also a will for peace in \"no\". That is why I believe that the European Union needs to reiterate three clear messages. First, Colombia needs to recompose its domestic reality, its political diversity, and it must commit to continuing negotiations with the FARC. The FARC has to maintain the ceasefire, and so does the government, the bilateral ceasefire, and they have to renegotiate the agreement, probably in terms of what has been the expression of citizenship, which has shown discrepancies with some conditions of that agreement. And thirdly, Europe. Europe must remain behind this agreement.

The result of the referendum, therefore, is hugely disappointing, but we must not allow it to be seen as a knockout blow. It is important that the international community now work to support President Santos in finding a way through and that there be no resumption of violence. Conflicts are always unique, each existing in response to their own context of time, location and history. In drawing comparisons and correlations, we should always do so with caution. But I cannot help but look to Northern Ireland at this moment, or more precisely, the Good Friday Belfast Agreement. We see in that deal the price of peace. Yes, it means accepting amnesties, elements of criminal immunity, and inviting into the political fold those previously seen to be beyond the pale politically, but nearly 20 years on, we do not talk of that price, but of the great success.

In that condition, I appreciate the attitude of colombians on that day. I'm sorry for the difficulties Hurricane Matthew caused the voters of the coast. Without them, there might have been another result, albeit just as tight. The scrutiny disappointed and saddened me. But I soon regained my spirits because the process has many assets: years of dialogue that have woven trust, months without attacks or violence, a seamless international alliance, and an entire society that certainly wants and needs peace. I support President Santos' offer of dialogue and encourage supporters of 'no' to join him in making the agreement more inclusive. I hope that the FARC will make the end of their armed activity final and that dialogue with the ELN will continue with the same objective. The key is to ensure that peace is perceived as an achievement of all Colombians.  That is why, from Europe, we must maintain political, financial, diplomatic and human support for this hope. We owe it to the Colombians, and especially the victims, who asked us not to abandon them.  It is worth it because Marly, Paula or Fernando, who know from their pain and wounds what war costs, believe that the agreement proposes a reasonable price for peace. That is why there has been more support for the process in the areas most punished by violence. Because it offers shared answers to the country's great problems, such as land reform, respect for truth and justice, and methods to repair the victims who will improve with more support. There is a strategy against drug trafficking and demining and new avenues for political participation by those who have decided to exchange arms for peace and word. Bases for a new, socially fairer, more politically freer and more democratic Colombia.  I conclude by congratulating Vice-President Mogherini and her special envoy, Eamon Gilmore, on their work in Colombia, and the Ambassador of the European Union for their role in the process and their assistance in this mission.

Let me share with you my observations and a few conclusions. Last Sunday we witnessed Colombian democracy in action. We should fully respect the will of the Colombian people expressed during the plebiscite. The result of the plebiscite does not question in any way the will of the Colombian people to have peace and reconciliation in that country, which has been facing armed conflict, killings, kidnappings, displacements and all kinds of violence for 52 years. The perception in Europe that the ‘no’ camp voted in favour of war is totally wrong. The Colombian nation wants peace and voted for peace.  The peace process in Colombia is irreversible. Bilateral ceasefire commitments made by the Colombian Government and FARC have been kept. The European Union will continue its support for the peace process in Colombia. President Santos and his government deserve our support in their efforts to reach a de facto peace in Colombia without prejudging the content of the peace agreement, providing that the Colombian people endorse and approve it through the plebiscite.  The result of the plebiscite clearly indicates that the final peace agreement has to be renegotiated and at least two issues are to be addressed, namely participation of FARC in the political process and impunity for FARC. The current peace agreement guarantees ten seats for FARC in the Colombian Congress and five seats in the Senate, without the need to be elected, plus justice reviews for FARC members. Now it is evident that a new phase of dialogue must be opened that should be inclusive and transparent.  My last remark has regard to the delisting of FARC from the EU list of terrorist organisations. Following the signing of the peace agreement, the Council unanimously decided to temporarily delist FARC for six months, and sanctions against the FARC leadership have been dropped. The decision regarding delisting is conditional and is to be terminated immediately if FARC does not deliver on its promises of no violence and full disarmament. I suggest that the issue of the delisting of FARC be high on the agenda of High Representative Mogherini.

The EU has been a close political and development partner of the Congolese people over many years. We cannot allow the DRC to sink again into a crisis which would, without doubt, spill beyond national borders and across the Great Lakes region.  I would like to begin by reiterating some of the key positions already expressed by High Representative Mogherini and by the EU in recent statements. I must start by addressing the recent violence in the DRC. The level of violence in recent days has been a shock to all of us. The EU has already made it very clear that we attribute individual responsibility to all actors involved in violence, and that of course includes members of institutions in charge of security and justice. Impunity cannot be tolerated. In this respect, I would like to underline the importance we attach to the duty of MONUSCO to document human rights violations and to report on them in line with Security Council Resolution 2277. I would like, on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini, but also on my own account, to praise the vital work being done by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC. What the DRC needs is calm, not violence. Calm is needed to focus on finding a solution to the current political crisis, which means to focus on finding a consensus leading to credible and inclusive presidential elections as quickly as possible.  For this to be possible, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is essential. Our message is simple: only an inclusive dialogue resulting in an agreement involving the widest range of political actors will pave the way towards peaceful and credible elections in accordance with the DRC Constitution and Security Council Resolution 2277. The EU and other key partners involved in supporting the ongoing national dialogue, among them the African Union, the IOF, the United Nations and the United States, will continue to use the tools at our disposal to make the process work. This includes, of course, diplomatic action and outreach to key partners such as Angola and South Africa, as well as action in the UN Security Council.  It is especially regrettable that the political crisis in DRC is distracting us from the stabilisation and development of DRC and that the Congolese people continue to suffer, especially from the barbarous activities of armed groups operating in the north and east of the country. The current political impasse has to be addressed if we are to get back to the work of supporting state-building, reforming the security institutions of the country, tackling the problem of conflict minerals, contributing to healthcare and building roads. In addition, progress on regional integration across Central Africa will continue to be held back for as long as the DRC remains unstable.  Let me end with an assessment of the ongoing political dialogue launched on 1 September. The dialogue has resulted in some positive steps forward, but the challenge now is to achieve greater inclusivity in participation and greater substance in discussions. The clock is ticking, and both government and opposition have a responsibility to work together in the national interest. No one is excused from this obligation.  We call on the opposition, which have not joined the dialogue process yet. However, the government also has a critical responsibility to ensure that political freedoms are respected and that justice is not used to sideline political actors. Above all, a public commitment by all actors to respect the constitution – in particular, as far as the limit on presidential mandates is concerned – would contribute considerably to easing tensions. We will continue to review the use of all the tools at our disposal to support the dialogue, insisting on its inclusivity and its focus. We will exert pressure to improve the political climate in the country, and in particular to ensure that absolute respect is guaranteed for human rights and fundamental freedoms at this critical time for consolidating DRC’s democratic progress. I look forward to hearing your views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1371, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Joachim ZELLER", "mepid": "96762", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the It was only in June that we discussed the situation in Congo.

This has caused a large-scale refugee crisis.  Now we have an intensification of the political crisis. What Minister Korok has called for, calm in this country, is not given to the people there. There is one person responsible for this, and that is President Kabila, who would normally have to leave office after two terms, because that is what the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo provides for. Elections for a new president should have taken place in September. None of this happens. It is a mockery at all that this country calls itself the state name \"Democratic Republic\". Rarely in the history of this country has the situation there been called democratic, and rarely have people had a say in shaping the fate of this country. The opposition is being persecuted, there are already deaths. Opposition offices have been burned and set on fire. Many have been arrested, and with a ploy that voter registration was no longer possible in time, the President is now trying to artificially extend his term of office. This is unacceptable.

This huge country, now key to the region, key to the continent and key to Europe, is directed by its president directly into the abyss. Kabila has decided to cling to power by going over the Constitution, and although that may lead her people into a devastating abyss. I think there's still time to avoid it. It is necessary to recover the path of dialogue, but of inclusive dialogue. The first inescapable issue is setting a certain date for the presidential election. And on that the European Union must dump all its weight, which is a lot. We have in our power the political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. But we must also think of Article 96, that is, the imposition of sanctions against those responsible and also the redirection of our aid. That's in our hand, we can't blame others.  Member States, Mr President, must also take action at the bilateral level against prominent members of the authorities of the country holding dual nationality.

I received a letter from Mrs Mogherini in response to our concerns about the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and our suggestion for targeted sanctions. Her answer was a commitment, as we know the High Representative. And you know how that goes: through social media, her words reached the other side of the world in no time. Those words create hope.  But I sometimes wonder who opens all our letters, whether or not it reads and classifies, alphabetically or chronologically. There must be palaces full of our admonition letters. Forgive my cynicism, but President Kabila yesterday confirmed with the demise of the elections in congo's interests. For congo's sake, no further details. We did get it from the Chairman of the Electoral Commission: he can not give a date for the presidential elections at the earliest end of 2017.  In other words, no elections before the end of 2018. Protests against this are nipped in the bud. Blood was flowing through the streets of Kinshasa. However, there are many Congolese who are good with their country. Dr. Mukwege, for example, could be seen on Flemish television a few days ago. The gynaecologist and human rights activist who once again made victims of horrific violence human in eastern Congo and was awarded the Sakharov Prize by this Parliament in 2014. He doesn't hide his contempt for what Kabila does, and he names the problems as they are. The constitution is reduced to a piece of paper. The third violence him off.  They're voices like dr. Mukwege's who needs Congo. I believe that citizen movements that subscribe to and embrace the constitution and democracy can restore chaos. But not without international support. It is therefore more than a time for the European Union to exchange its enthusiastic speeches and letters for action.  As far as I am concerned, this could include, for example, a travel ban, the freezing of the accounts of all those responsible for the violent repression. The United States was in favour of us again and decided to take such measures.

Mr President, the citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) deserve better. At a time when everything invites the leaders of this country to fight corruption and to equip themselves with the means so that the state can assume its regal functions, the president thinks above all about his retention in power.  Initially scheduled for the end of November, the elections will finally be postponed for two years. Many leaders of other countries, tempted to do the same, have already argued that a census must be carried out first before they can begin the electoral process. In the DRC, it is the same. The pretext that the electoral file should be redesigned first is therefore not very original. The Belgian Foreign Minister reminded Radio la Première again this morning, saying that even if there were to be an overhaul, it could be done reasonably in a few months. This also seems to be the view of the opposition in Congo, which intends to sully the talks on this issue.  Congolese citizens who are committed to democracy and, in general, passionate about politics, are strongly opposed to these acts. They are condemned to suffer the action, if not the inaction, of their leaders more concerned with their personal ambition than with the fate of their people.  And yet, it all started well. The path of transition had allowed us to reconnect with democratic principles and the rule of law. Elections had been held, with the help of the international community, and in particular that of the European Union. Unfortunately, there is no panacea that can solve this problem in the immediate future. The pressure has to come from within. It is up to the Congolese people to move the lines. We can, of course, encourage the responsible currents, but the directions must be taken by the Congolese themselves.

It would be good to ask who funds armed groups and to defend the interests of whom. Joseph Kabila's term of office expires in December, and elections were due to take place in November. Kabila announced that the election would be postponed sine die on the grounds that the electoral file was not up to date and that 10 million young Congolese would be deprived of their right to vote.  For months, civil society and the opposition have been organizing and are victims of a ferocious repression. The events of late September are a sad symbol of this.

In this country, as in others in Africa, leaders cling to power, and the only question is: how can we help the peoples of these countries to freely express their choice?

I have not fully understood the perspective the Council now paints in our relations with congo. We have all understood that Kabila wants to stay in power longer, that he follows the example of countries around him. Think of the current terrible situation in Burundi and the fear that everyone has that it will spill over to other countries.  I would therefore like to know what kind of action we have in the direction of Mr Kabila. I heard Mr Demesmaeker talk about sanctions, smart sanctions: the freezing of funds, the withdrawal of travel opportunities for Mr Kabila's entourage. That seems to me to be an incredibly sensible move. I would also like to see the Council's response to it.  I would also like to stress once again that we must complete our legislation to combat trade in conflict minerals as soon as possible. We are in trialogue with you and the European Commission.

This is a country that I know well, as President of the European Institute for Cooperation. I was the president of the largest NGO, and I was placed with The now deceased Vice-President Z'ahidi Ngoma, a friend who fought for the democratic transition and represented the democratic opposition during the democratic transition in 2004. He gave life for his country. So let's talk about democracy, and I'd like to remind you of a story that I know well, of which I myself was an actor.  In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the so-called \"rebel\" operation actually masked an invasion organized by the United States, which used Laurent-Desiré Kabila. As he advanced, Clinton's envoys signed mining contracts, like Biden's men currently in Ukraine. Let's talk about democracy! Laurent-Desiré Kabila, stopped by France and Angola, is closing in on France because he believed it was the interests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. You, the Belgians, and I can give clarifications if necessary, with the permission of the Americans, you have decided to assassinate him. Then Joseph Kabila succeeded him. He was your man but, concerned about the sovereignty of his country and its independence, he no longer suits you.  The DRC needs stability, not your interventionism oriented according to varying interests. Any further instability in this area is tantamount to re-condemning millions of civilians to death. All of sub-Saharan Africa will sink if the region falls into chaos again.  What Africa needs is sovereignty and self-centered development. It needs legitimate governments to take care of The Peoples of Africa and its development. Yes to the sovereign democracy of a broad democratic coalition with Joseph Kabila for the future of this region where Western interventionism has killed 4 to 5 million Africans in the Great Lakes region.

This so-called dialogue put in place by Mr Kabila's majority is not working. Moreover, the Catholic Church, which is an important player in this dialogue, has decided to leave it, as long as it does not have the guarantee of an inclusive framework that allows a compromise acceptable to all to be found. And this compromise must include the following elements: a totally impartial CENI, a credible timetable, important means to hold elections, the fight against impunity and, finally, the release of political prisoners today - not a release as Mr Kabila announced, but an unconditional release of these political prisoners, which also allows them to conduct an election campaign. Indeed, freeing political prisoners by telling them that, if they campaign, they will end up in prison again, I do not think it is an environment conducive to open elections.

Respect for women’s rights and gender equality is part of European integration. However, as you know, the EU has no competences on abortion policy and cannot interfere in Member States’ policies in this area. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the definition of health policies and the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care is primarily the responsibility of individual Member States.  Having said that, I would very much hope that Poland will not stop progressing towards gender equality but rather continue to build on the genuine achievements of the past years. Poland has, for example, introduced an electoral gender quota system. It has also made great reforms improving work-life balance, such as the extension of the duration of basic maternity leave to 20 weeks, the introduction of paternity leave, parental leave arrangements and an increase in the accessibility of preschool education. Even though the electoral gender quota has increased the number of women on electoral lists it has not translated into a considerable increase of women’s actual participation in politics, yet.  The gender gap in employment rates continues to undermine the potential of many economies in Europe. In Poland it is particularly high among older women leaving the labour market earlier than men, and among young mothers because of still insufficient access to childcare. In the 2016 country specific recommendations Poland was encouraged to step up efforts to increase female labour market participation.  So, let me conclude by restating our genuine commitment to women’s rights and gender equality and my hope that we can continue to work with the Polish authorities to achieve further progress in the area. I am looking forward to today’s discussion, and at the end of this discussion I will enjoy the privilege to add also a few words from my personal side.

Strong, united, intransiuous. This black march touched the world. He also touched on the European Parliament because it was not just an opposition to the cruel abortion bill, which piS gave the green light to by adopting it in the Sejm. They want to withdraw from this out of fear today, because this march is a struggle for freedom, for dignity, for the right to choose, for life in a modern European country. We are Polish to this and the current government will not change that. This march is our strong 'no' to PiS's attempts to appropriate further spheres of life, especially those concerning our privacy and our families. I turn to the rulers in Poland. You have hearts of stone. Women are not the commodity to pay off your electoral obligations. You have no right to force a woman to make a decision other than what she feels, because it will settle in her own conscience, especially when pregnancy threatens her life or is caused by rape. For the decision to remove the pregnancy, you wanted to put women in jail. But did you want to put women in jail? There is no permission for this. There is no consent and never will be. If laws were introduced that would strike at women's constitutional rights, no one could challenge them with a paralyzed Constitutional Court. Despite the rejection of them today by a committee in the Sejm, the problem is not solved. Respect the compromise that is currently in place, if only because there is no room for substantive discussion in a country whose government is hitting an independent judiciary and media freedom. We don't need another ideological war – a war in which you have further entangled doctors. It is the responsibility of the doctor to follow medical science and knowledge.

It's not the final decision, but it's a first win we had, which is very important. That is why we, together with the Polish delegation in my group and all our colleagues in the group, were dressed in black on Monday. We have worn black, joining millions of Polish women and men who have courageously stood up for their fundamental rights. This is proof that solidarity knows no borders, it knows how to achieve concrete results. It is an important day for women and for the defence of human rights. My group has always fought to promote a progressive vision of the fundamental rights and values of the European Union. Women's rights are the responsibility of the whole human race. Combating all forms of violation of these rights is an obligation of all. The strengthening of women's power of action means the progress of all humanity. Respect for fundamental rights and equality between men and women is enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and cannot be the subject of negotiation or negotiation. Membership of the European Union means ensuring that certain inalienable principles are fully respected in all Member States. This is under threat in Poland and we are therefore in favour of polish citizens and not, as they say, against them. We do not want to interfere at all, other than when the rights and prerogatives of Polish citizens are threatened.  Now, the proposal has not yet been concluded. We will be watching very closely and we hope that the Polish Parliament will define this proposal in the final negative.

I believe that our discussion is pointless, because you want to discuss a law that is not there and to speak on issues where the European Parliament has no powers. But if you already want to hear about the situation of women in Poland, I would be happy to supplement the Commissioner's knowledge and remind you that Poland, as one of the first countries, recognised women's svoters' rights, that it was in Poland, according to the data – Commissioner – Eurostat, that we have the smallest difference between salaries between men and women in terms of average pay, that it was the research of the Fundamental Rights Agency in 2014 that proved that the number of acts of violence against women in Poland, including rape, is one of the lowest in Europe. It was Poland that developed a very good system for the protection of working pregnant women. It is Polish law and justice government has prepared and implemented a good family support programme. It's worth talking about. Poland is a country that, after 1989, has a prime minister who is a woman for the third time after 1989. And Prime Minister Szydło was here in the European Parliament and she was referring to the issues that you are raising today.  Unfortunately, you probably did not listen attentively, because I cannot – unlike you – assume that you have such a bad will. You are looking for a replacement topic. You want to deal with issues that are not within the competence of the EU institutions. Yet we should look at the migration crisis, the security crisis, the economic crisis, but you want women's rights. Why have we not debated or debated the situation of women in Germany in the European Parliament? Do you remember what happened on New Year's Eve in many German cities and what happened during the last Oktoberfest? Maybe your left-wing sensibility will see the situation of women in Germany, where their rights are being violated? But no, you want to deal with Poland, because Poland is unfortunate, that it has such an opposition that loves to talk badly about its homeland. Let me emphasise once again: none of the EU Treaties confers competence on the Union on philosophical issues, on the contrary, the interference of the EU institutions in these matters is inadmissible, as the EU Court of Justice has also confirmed. Nor is there any justification for interfering with these issues, Commissioner, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yesterday, Prime Minister Beata Szydło once again confirmed that Polish government – maybe this crazy Polish opposition will finally hear, uneasy ears – is not working to change the law in this regard. It turns out that you are outraged that citizens in Poland have submitted a citizens' project to the Polish Parliament on the issue of the protection of life, i.e. the EU Parliament would like to take away the right of Polish citizens to a citizens' initiative. You will not shout the truth. So you want to discuss a law that is not there and on which the European Parliament has nothing to say.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I am pleased that we are having this debate here today. I think it is very important that we, as representatives of the European Community of Values, support women in Poland, but also everywhere else, in the fight for their rights and against a ban on abortion. I would like to make one thing very clear here: an attack on women's rights is always also an attack on liberal democracy and an open society. A key part of this is respect for human rights and women's rights.  As soon as we start attacking this in any way, we endanger the value society in which we live and of which we are very proud. And are nitforth our society in which we live and the progressive position of women in it – at least outwardly? Are we not using every conceivable way to teach other cultures about our values and put them on a pedestal? When I look at the increasing number of people in Europe who have recently described themselves as feminists when it comes to condemning people and practices from other cultures or religions, I discover a certain hypocrisy. Because where are these people now when it comes to defending women's rights when it comes to abortion? Within Europe, we often take this very seriously with women's rights and, unfortunately, with human rights. Whether it's Orban's refugee policy or Poland's access to women's rights, we apply double standards. One thing must be clear: the female body has always been a political battleground and will probably remain so for a long time to come. Gender plays a central role in politics. Women are being used to fight disputes between the state and society: this is demonstrated by the excessive debate on the burkini ban this summer.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr History shows that women's right to their bodies can never be taken for granted. History also shows that this has never been a strictly national issue. Solidarity has always been cross-border, just as here tonight. More than 40 years ago, Swedish and French women had to go to Poland to be able to decide over their own body and whether they wanted a pregnancy or not. Today Polish women can get to Sweden, you are welcome. The new law is a terrible blow to women's rights and women's bodies. But the current law, the one in force now, is also a violation of women's rights. Let's establish it tonight. There are too many, men above all, in this house who choose to systematically turn their eyes away when it comes to women's human rights. But I'll put it this way: There are few things that are as fundamental as being in charge of one's own body. And that right, it is so central to those of us who believe in equality.  One of our Polish colleagues just said to me: 'I will wear black until this disgusting bill has been scrapped'. To her and my Polish friends who are also here tonight, I would just like to say 'you are not alone'. When the Spanish Conservative Government threatened to ban abortion again in Spain, we – women and men who believe in basic equality – took to the streets of almost every city in Europe. We will do it again, and we will not rest, because the attack on your rights, on your bodies, is an attack on the rights of all of us.

We demand equality and respect for women’s dignity. I salute these women because what these women need is not a law oppressing their right to their own bodies. What these women need is equality.

In Poland, we have the opportunity to get acquainted with the basic facts in this area. The Polish press is just now reminding us of quite shocking facts and information. I will give just one such fact, because there is little time: abortion is subject to meticulous statistical research and includes the so-called civilizational West. It doesn't include buddhists or Islamists, because there's just no right to abortion, and it's not registered there. At the moment we have public press releases in Poland about the number of abortions performed. In all Western countries, a total of 50 million legally registered abortions are carried out each year. Let's think about that figure, I'm shocked by it myself. After all, much fewer people died worldwide throughout The Second World War, and the war lasted six years. This is, after all, more than the size of Polish, that is probably more than the size of the whole of Spain. Isn't this the collective suicide of Western civilization?  So is it any wonder that this depopulated land is now inhabited by Islamists? After all, we forget god's basic command.

Demonstrations are underway in Poland under the slogan \"Let's save women!\" This should be supported. However, it is also necessary to think of a reasonable compromise, because society is divided almost equally.  I recall that Article 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights states: \"Equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas ....  The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing specific benefits for persons of the under-represented sex.' This principle must therefore be applied here, because among unborn children the female sex is less numerous. So I propose to assume that abortion is allowed, but little girls must not be killed.  This would almost halve the number of abortions, while at the same time protecting women, as you are concerned. European ethics make it essential for us to protect women and children in the first place. Let's do it finally! The saved girls will be grateful to us. Like the famous blind singer, Mr. Bocelli thanked his mother. However, men's rights must not be forgotten. After all, half of the genetic material belongs to the father. It is therefore necessary that the father's consent must also be required to kill the child. After all, if the birth of a child depended solely on the mother, maintenance would be unjustified, for example. The father and mother have the same rights to the child before birth and must have the same rights after birth, because the child does not belong to the mother – it also belongs to the father.

And I understand the Polish colleagues in the European Parliament who have asked us for a gesture of solidarity, and that is why I am ying.  When I tabled a bill in the Czech Parliament in 2003 to protect unborn life and to tighten access to abortion, I was inspired by the law that is in place today in Poland. Poland has a law that allows abortion only in the event of a threat to a woman's life or rape, as well as the number of abortions, 2000 per year, corresponds to this. What does not correspond to this is that poland is failing to increase the number of births.  Colleagues, we can't just protect lives with bans. To encourage young people to have children, mothers, not to be afraid to give birth, we need to create favourable conditions and be able to appreciate motherhood. Today's society values material values, people fear poverty and social insecurity.  Personally, I am against abortion and I think that everything needs to be done to ensure that women do not have to make abortion choices so that they can look forward to their children. These measures, of course, include a number of social measures, affordable housing, affordable care for young children, the offer of work opportunities, but the first condition will always be responsible behaviour, which should also be helped by the education of responsible parenting and the social recognition of the value of motherhood. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish Poland that we do not have to repeat such debates here in Parliament. It is up to the Polish Parliament and the Government to decide on ethical issues in Poland.

They intended to end decades of women's struggle for the right to decide on their bodies, for freedom. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets throughout the Union as a show of solidarity. It was not just an attack on the dignity of Spanish women; it also meant opening the door to those who do not want Europe to be a space of respect and dignity. Two years later we return to the starting point. Today it's Polish women. Who's it going to be tomorrow? Can we accept that in 21st-century Europe our daughters will have fewer rights than our mothers? The law that is being brought to this debate today is a violation of international rights. It prohibits abortion of women who are victims of rape. Health workers who assist these women may be imprisoned. This situation will also lead to economic inequality, because those women with means and money will be able to go out to abort outside Poland and those who do not have them will be forced into clandestine abortions in Poland with the risk of their lives. This situation does not allow our resignation: on the contrary, it forces us to raise our voices, to prevent it from continuing to decide on our lives and on our destiny. From here, my absolute support for the women of Poland. Know that you are not alone, that your freedom is our struggle and that today's black horizon can become, with our efforts, a color of hope.

Mr Gericke, you say you are happy with the choices you made in life but you had a choice. I think every woman, every man should have that choice, including in Poland.  Madam Commissioner, I heard you say – and I only partially agree with you – that abortion is not an EU matter. It is true that abortion laws are made by national governments and national parliaments, but that is not to say that the European Union has not to say anything. Abortion and sexual and reproductive health rights are part of public health policies in the Member States. We have competence in the area of public health policy. It is limited but it is there. I would call on this House to make sure that, in the next public health strategy, sexual and reproductive rights, including abortion, are included. This is also underlined by the fact that there is case law in the area of abortion. The Strasbourg Court has said very clearly that a total ban on abortion is a violation of human rights. We do have instruments, colleagues. This is not only about a debate on subsidiarity. This is on principles, this is on values, and those values apply also to Polish citizens and that is why we are having this debate.

The Polish Parliament has decided to evacuate the progressive initiative and to examine the regressive initiative in relation to abortion.

I will talk about the current law: it is this one, even if it is restrictive, it does not allow legal abortion for three reasons. The first reason is conscientious objection in Poland. While you must, Commissioner, ensure that the State organises this conscientious objection by guaranteeing the alternative, in Poland the alternative does not exist because doctors no longer want to perform legal abortion because of this conscientious objection, which is not properly applied. I therefore ask you, Commissioner, instead of saying that it is not within your competence, to take your competence and to have this conscientious objection properly activated at the Polish level. The second reality is that the lack of antenatal consultation - which is now permitted for abortion in Poland - means that when the malformation can be diagnosed, it is too late, because these antenatal consultations are not organised. Commissioner, you are in charge of this and you have to do it. The third reason is the lack of (inaudible) and education. I am sorry, it is a European competence, you do not activate this competence.

I would just like to remind you that the right to such a free choice, which you spoke of, was carried out in Poland in 1942. You can see on Wikipedia what those times were. We in Poland had times of free choice, very long. I remember the days when in Poland it was said that removing a pregnancy is like removing a tooth. And democratic Poland after 1989 broke with this practice, because it was a totalitarian practice, a totalitarian practice based on disrespect for life.  In Poland today we have no problem violating women's rights. And this debate has clearly shown that. In Poland, as everywhere in the world, there is a serious moral and legal problem, namely the dramatic issue of abortion. And you are saying here that this case is not dramatic, that it does not arise from anything. On the other hand, In my opinion, this problem stems from a conflict between two principles that you and we recognise, namely the autonomy of the human person regardless of his or her gender and the right to life regardless of age. Unfortunately, in this case, these two principles are in conflict, and we all know that solving this problem is very difficult, and we also know that pro-life and pro-choice movements exist throughout Europe and throughout the Western world. Discussions on this subject are also ongoing in Poland. Just the majority of Polish society takes a position behind life.

No. What this means is that the EU has not only the right, but also the duty to safeguard its core values – democracy, human rights and tolerance – and, if we fail to do that, we fail on our core substance.

I think, as a person who has Polish ances, as a person who, I think, quite understands the Polish language and understands Poles in many things, including a certain sensitivity and vigilance to situations where they want, like the Czechs, like all other peoples in Europe, to decide the essential things themselves. I understand the Poles that this vigilance comes from the fact that we have experienced a time in an undemocratic society, a time and a regime that did not recognise the freedom and dignity of the individual. I personally remember it when the revolution was in 1989, I was 25 years old.  What I don't understand is a bill that I hope won't be dragged into final approval because I don't think it's the abortion law, but that it's a law against people, that it's a law against human dignity, against a person's freedom, against a woman's freedom to decide on her body and her life.  It is a particularly powerful moment for me and a symbolic moment that I say here today on the day that Czech President Václav Havel would celebrate his 80th birthday, because he was the one who always championed individual freedom and the dignity of man. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have said here before that I completely respect and respect the competence problem in the sense that the European Union does not have the competence to order any state legislation concerning reproductive rights, but at the same time I am in that dilemma, because I value human freedom and dignity above all else.  And I dare remind myself of the very strong moments we had here together, when Pope Francis was here before Christmas in 2014, I was fresh from office, and he made a lot of strong appeals to us as politicians. Among other things, he said, \"You have forgotten the dignity of the individual for all institutions, procedures, jurisdictional disputes.\" And I am reminded of this here today in the sense and in the context that there have been words that the debate is unnecessary, that we should not even be talking about it here, because here we have a problem with subsidiarity. Nevertheless, I think that we should talk about these things here, and that it is very important when each of us walks out in front of the trenches and tells for himself how he perceives it, because the problem that we are talking about here today is also very subtle, very intimate, and I believe that rightly so is called a matter of conscience.  At the same time, I would like to point out that I believe that the vast majority of women who have to have an abortion do not do so out of their free choice, that they do so under the pressure of reality, and that we should not deny them that decision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1454, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  in writing. – Women in Poland and all Europe are astounded by the current debate on abortion rights held in Poland.

Women's self-determination has only been taken for granted for a very short time and in a very small part of the world.  Europe is no exception. The current situation, in which women are at least partially allowed to decide on their reproduction, is a fragile condition. Women's and women's rights are not set in stone, but can be attacked and attacked at any time, including in Europe.  The best way to reduce the number of abortions is to prevent unwanted pregnancies. They are prevented by sexual education, cheap and easily accessible contraceptives, and by the fact that society also accepts and supports single mothers. Restricting contraceptives and abortion hurts the poor the most. The rich can have an abortion abroad, the poor have to resort to illegal abortions or give birth to a child, even if the birth of a child plunges the family and the child into intolerable living conditions.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Cañete, Minister, yesterday we experienced an historic moment in this very House where, by a large majority, we gave the green light to the effective entry into force of the Paris Agreement before COP22 in Marrakech. After Kyoto it has been a long process and objectively today we have a global agreement, legally binding, to really combat climate change at international level. But after yesterday's success, our minds are already in Marrakech, which will be the place to move from words to actions, that is, to the implementation measures necessary to achieve the objectives set in Paris. We will go to Marrakech with the same determination and leadership ambition that we had in Paris. In detail, the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow will be the mandate for our delegation and agreements and negotiations will be opened on the main elements.  Firstly, a strengthened framework for transparency, details for a global budget, some additional guidelines on INDCs, an understanding of loss and damage differentiation, as well as talking about climate finance, inclusive multi-level governance as well as a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance.  It will also be necessary to start discussions on the form of the 2018 facilitation dialogue, which will be an important opportunity to bridge the existing mitigation gap, in the light of the current INDCs, and in which the EU can play a proactive role in terms of the level of collective ambition and progress in implementing the commitments made.  The resolution highlights the good progress of the European Union in meeting the 2020 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in achieving the targets set for renewable energy and the efforts that need to be increased in order to achieve the 2050 targets. I would like to highlight an important passage in the resolution: we regret that the international air and sea transport sector is not mentioned in the agreement, even though it is the second largest sector in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Parliament therefore stresses the need to implement a number of strategies to reduce emissions in this sector. We know that this is a difficult subject, but Parliament will continue to be the spokesman for this need. Ultimately, climate diplomacy efforts will be needed to ensure that the negotiations are positive and produce real progress towards our common goal.

But now the work continues. We must implement Paris and take the next steps in Marrakech. For our group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is always very important that we jointly focus on ambitious climate protection and the safeguarding and creation of jobs. Yesterday, too, an important step was taken in the negotiations in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on emissions trading.

I would like to point out that another major conference is currently taking place in Montreal, where the world meets and also talks about climate protection. I fear, however, that there will not be something as good and ambitious as in Paris. IcaO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, is meeting in Montreal, and we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety said in our resolution, which I hope the plenary will adopt tomorrow by a large majority, that what is on the table is disappointing. And this also has an impact on European climate protection policy: aviation is included in emissions trading, and it will actually be the case again from next year that intercontinental flights will be included. We say that we only want to change this if an ambitious result is really decided in Montreal. We need more balance here. Climate protection can only work if all shoulders support. It is not acceptable for us to have a proposal where steelworkers are shaking for their jobs, because at the same time other sectors, such as air transport, are taking a slender foot.

I wonder whether we should waste many years on these tasks. In my opinion, 2018 or 2020 is far too late to consider a review. This should start now after Marrakech. I also see that our long-term objective needs to be adjusted once again. I don't think we can stop at 80 percent. For 1.5 degrees, we need a 95 per cent reduction and, Commissioner, when do you intend to work out the long-term plan? I also ask the Council what the Member States intend to do in Marrakesh to ensure that success is achieved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1462, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Jadwiga WIŚNIEWSKA", "mepid": "124877", "text": "  Author. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Dear Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. Almost a year ago, an event of great historical significance occurred in Paris. The vast majority of countries around the world have agreed to take joint action to reduce the impact of man-made greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Today, this agreement is almost ready for entry into force, as it will reach the thresholds foreseen with ratification by the European Union. I will admit that I myself am surprised at the pace at which countries, which have so far been unsusceptable for their ambitious climate policy, that is, China or the United States, India, have ratified. However, as far as the United States is concerned, the impact of the upcoming presidential elections on the status of this agreement is uncertain in this case. However, it is worth remembering the reasons why this happened: firstly, you probably remember well that at some point the word 'decarbonisation' has become the subject of hard negotiations. Many countries objected to the presence of this word because, seeing the need to reduce emissions, they considered that they could do so without completely abandoning the use of coal, which is an accessible and cheap raw material, and modern technologies significantly reduce its emissivity. The Union had to step down and did well, otherwise there would be no agreement. Secondly, the agreement places reducing emissions and increasing the potential for removals on an equal footing.

As has been said over and over again, the European Union has played a leading role in this process and it is now imperative that it remain in the front group, in defining and coordinating measures for its effective implementation, demanding transparency and ambition. And it is precisely this will that we will have to demonstrate next month in Marrakesh at COP 22.  I believe that the global Paris agreement represents a more level playing field at international level to promote the fight against climate change. The definition of a stable and ambitious legal framework is now essential to mobilise civil society and the private sector for investments in innovative technologies that enable us to have a more sustainable society. There will now be an opportunity for growth and job creation in the green and blue economy that we cannot afford to waste. In European climate policy there are industrial sectors, some of which are subject to carbon leakage, which could be undermined if we focus on them all the effort to reduce emissions. Commissioner, we cannot afford to forget, in this effort that must be everyone's, the transport sector, the second most important sector in terms of emissions and the one whose emissions are still at free growth. Air and sea transport was left out of the Paris Agreement. ICAO and IMO have been remissive and only make significant progress in this area. I would like to express, Commissioner, my deep concern about the agreement under preparation at ICAO on this matter. An agreement that will apply late, only from 2020, which is part of a very high reference level of CO2 emissions and which is anticipated on a purely voluntary basis, without imposing an effective reduction in emissions in the near future, is certainly not the agreement I would like. I also believe that the emission neutralisation measures being negotiated are unclear and their quality and control very dubious. This agreement seems to me, ladies and gentlemen, far from meeting the Paris objectives to which we are committed. I hope, Commissioner, that this agreement will not set the tone and level of ambition for the other transport sectors, in particular maritime transport, and that, in materialising under the conditions I have mentioned, it will not be sold to us as a success.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1464, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Estefanía TORRES MARTÍNEZ", "mepid": "131749", "text": "  Author. – Madam President, today we have before us a new opportunity to make the necessary transition to a more equitable and sustainable model of life a reality. But let us not deceive ourselves, because the Paris Agreement is wholly insufficient to achieve the long-term objective set: not to exceed two degrees of temperature rise. If we do not reduce pollution levels, the annual temperature increase will soon exceed three and a half degrees.  The world's poorest people, many farmers, fish farmers and shepherds, are being hardest hit by high temperatures. It is urgent that States address this issue in their climate action plans. How? For example, it is striking that this agreement does not mention industrial agriculture, one of the main responsible for climate change.  Hunger causes 40,000 deaths a day; however, 60% of the food we produce ends up wasted. We dedicate 30% of the entire production area to producing food that ends up in the trash. This involves the production of 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent; that is, food waste is the third largest cause of the world's largest greenhouse gas producers, only below the United States and China. Nothing says about this.  We must influence the right to food and promote agro-ecological production with short circuits: this will sustainably and equitably feed the world and also mitigate climate change.  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is not solved by agreements on sums and subtractions. The challenge is great and in it smallholder farmers have to stop being the most vulnerable to become the most valuable in history. To do this, we need to reorient agricultural investment towards the needs of these smallholder farmers.

Rather, I would like to return to what I believe has been a success in Paris, namely the fact that we have gone from the \"climate problem\" to the \"climate solutions\". Commissioner, my question is: how are we going to continue to energize the Lima-Paris Action Plan, which will now take on a new form? I am very afraid that we will lose this dynamic, which was created and in which France and Mrs Royal have put a lot of energy into it. Is the European Commission ready to commit funds and the expertise of its officials to help really carry out this initiative? I have three concrete ideas. As we go to Morocco, the first is the \"Energy for Africa\" initiative. I am trying to promote this idea with Mr. Borloo and others here in the house. We welcomed the proposal we call 'Juncker 2', namely a plan to reduce risks to Africa. Could you elaborate a little more on how Mr Borloo's 'Energy for Africa' initiative relates to the Juncker Guarantee Fund? The second is energy efficiency. Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco need improvements in energy efficiency. We are the world champions in terms of ecodesign and the A, B, C and D labels. So what are we doing to help Maghreb countries? The third thing is renewables. For me, Spain, Portugal and Morocco could be the first region beyond the continents where we would move to 100% renewables.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Paris Agreement will enter into force at the same time as COP22 is launched, and that is certainly a good sign. It is necessary to look at the glass half full of this tool to keep high the hope that we can still change a process that is much greater than us, hoping to see at least a slowdown in climate change. But in the half-empty glass of time for reassuring messages and simple hopes there is neither. In this part of the glass, there continues to be a political nebula made up of binding commitments, but for which there are no sanctions. In this part of the glass, echoes the lack of commitment that industrialised countries have shown in funding the Green Fund. In this part of the glass, the sum of the reduction commitments, as stated by the individual contracting parties, is still not sufficient to contain the temperature increase within two degrees, let alone stay within a degree and a half, at the end of the century. In the glass half empty, there is still a lack of serious political will to tackle the stone coert, namely agriculture and animal husbandry, in particular, as Mrs Torres Martínez mentioned, a problem that is as real as it is ignored. According to a very recent UNEP report, food production is second only after the use of fossil fuels in terms of emission liability. And attention, as my fellow Member has said, refers to food production based on waste and the destruction of resources typical of advanced economies, and certainly not to agriculture, which should feed those suffering from hunger. In the half-full glass, on the other hand, there is a risk of an international bond market. This is good news for financial speculators, but much less good for the fate of the planet.

This Friday my colleague, Environment Minister Sólymos will deposit, together with Commissioner Arias Cañete, the EU ratification instrument to the United Nations in New York. Again, let me thank you for your cooperation, which allowed us to react immediately to the unprecedented international momentum, which was mentioned yesterday by the UN Secretary-General. The EU ratification will enable the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and make it possible that the first meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement will be convened in November in Marrakesh. And now specifically on Marrakesh. The outcome of the Paris Conference, including the Agreement, the COP decision and intended nationally determined budget contributions, needs to be implemented in all its elements. Marrakesh will be the first opportunity to start the work on the details of the Paris Agreement and to prepare for its implementation. The EU and its Member States are ready to engage in this work, which will include in particular the following elements: Firstly, the development of common modalities for the transparency and accountability guidelines under the Paris Agreement. This work is critical. The enhanced transparency framework is the key element of the Paris Agreement, helping build mutual trust and underpinning effective implementation. The enhanced transparency process will help parties in preparing, communicating and accounting for successive nationally determined contributions. It will also be critical in providing robust data to support the global stocktake and for the assessment of progress towards the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Secondly, the definition of modalities and inputs of the global stocktake (GST): The GST will provide the key political momentum and drive the parties’ domestic and cooperative action. It should drive more ambitious action by parties in their successive efforts, and its outcome will in turn inform parties in updating and enhancing their actions and support, as well as international cooperation. The Paris Agreement already determines some of the key aspects of the GST design, but specification on its inputs and modalities must help deliver its purpose and fulfil its role in the ambitious cycle. Thirdly, further action by all parties individually and collectively will be required to re-orient finance flows and make them consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. The EU and its Member States are taking initiatives both domestically and internationally to support the shift of investments. We are contributing significantly to this transformation. In 2014, we provided EUR 14.5 billion and the 2015 figures will become available before Marrakesh. The EU and its Member States remain committed to scaling up the mobilisation of climate finance as part of the global effort to assist developing countries to implement their low carbon sustainable development and in particular their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Domestic implementation, climate policies and measures to achieve intended NDCs and their full integration in national policies are of crucial importance. Finally, I would like to briefly highlight at this point the ongoing legislative work on the implementation of the EU 2030 climate and energy framework, namely on the proposal to reform the ETS sector and the proposals on non-ETS. These measures will enable the target to reduce EU greenhouse gases emissions domestically by at least 40 % in 2030 compared to 1990 emissons to be achieved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1468, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first I would like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), and indeed the whole Parliament, for their strong support to ratify quickly the Paris Agreement on behalf of the European Union.  Yesterday’s plenary vote in this very Chamber was a historic moment and a further demonstration of European resolve and determination to combat climate change. We can celebrate today the triggering of the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. In view of the COP22, the European Union has a number of key priorities for advancing the Paris Agreement, as mentioned by the Parliament in its oral question and the debate today. We need to be able to show clear progress on the implementation of all elements of the Paris outcome. In particular, we must show that countries are putting in place ambitious climate policies and that they are getting ready to implement the nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement. Within the European Union, the recent decision to channel 40% of the European Fund for Strategic Investments towards climate-relevant projects in the infrastructure and innovation window shows how we are aligning our instruments to deliver the Paris commitments. We must also mobilise support for the implementation of the nationally determined contributions. The Commission, through its international development and cooperation action, is already pressing on the ground in the most affected countries and supports national governments in their efforts on mitigation and adaptation.  The European Union’s new external investment plan is designed to leverage strategic investments in our partner countries, not only to support climate action but also to facilitate the delivery of the sustainable development goals. The global climate action agenda will also play a vital role in helping governments, business and other stakeholders to be inspired by the action around the world. When it comes to the negotiating agenda, Marrakesh needs to make tangible progress on developing the detailed rule book of the Paris Agreement, including the five-yearly global stocktakes. We will need to assess where we are, what more needs to be done, and what the opportunities are for future action. At the European Union level, our proposals on the 2030 legislative framework make clear provision for a review from 2024 onwards in order to take account of the results of the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement and evolving national circumstances. The 2018 Facilitative Dialogue will be a key political moment in the international climate negotiations. We will take stock of the collective efforts of the parties in progress towards the long—term emission reduction goal of the Paris Agreement. The dialogue will follow the special report to be published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on emissions pathways compatible with limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees centigrade. The Commission supports the active participation of the European Union in shaping the dialogue as the first important opportunity to take stock of the collective efforts of the parties.  Progress on climate finance is also critical. The European Union is working with other developed country parties to deliver in Marrakesh a concrete roadmap to mobilise the USD 100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation. The roadmap should provide greater transparency and bring stability to the collective efforts of developed countries. The European Union remains committed to supporting partner countries in their efforts on climate action and remains the biggest donor region, our highest level ever in 2015. Finally, it is crucial that prior to Marrakesh we recall the need to make progress, as many Members have pointed out, in other international fora. As you know, the ICAO Assembly is taking place right now in Montreal with a view to agreeing a global market—based mechanism in order to achieve the stabilisation of aviation emissions at 2020 levels. Later this month, I will also be present in Kigali with the aim of reaching an ambitious agreement on the global phase—down of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. We have achieved remarkable progress this year on global climate action. Less than 12 months ago, we adopted the Paris Agreement and its entry into force was triggered yesterday, but we still have much work to do to implement our commitments on the ground. I count on your continued support both here and in Marrakesh, so that together we can make COP22 a real success.

It was great yesterday to see the ratification process being signed here by our President, Mr Schulz, in the presence of Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations.

At long last, we are in the position to actually transfer agreements, commitments into action. The European Union will play a very important part, and in this we need to show especially diplomatic leadership, because we can do all we like here in the European Union, we could have targets to reduce carbon emissions to zero, but unless the world does the same, it is not going to have an impact. We can help, especially in ensuring all countries fulfil their commitments. We can also help in making the technology that we will utilise in relation to renewable energies, energy efficiencies, ETS, you name it, available to third countries.  I think we can look forward with optimism, but also we have to be conscious of the fact that we have three targets here in Europe. Firstly, to meet our targets in relation to climate change; secondly, to reindustrialise Europe – we had a motion for a resolution on that today – and thirdly, to maintain our competitiveness.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Only yesterday we all sat in this House and rejoiced that we have finally ratified the International Paris Agreement. I am pleased that we succeeded in this and that it is in place for the forthcoming climate conference in Marrakech. But we should not pat ourselves on the shoulder too much, but we should also understand and realise that this is the beginning.  It is now that europe and the rest of the world must roll up their sleeves. It is now that we must show that we are capable and prepared to actually work towards the solutions required if we are to achieve the objective of limiting global warming to a maximum of 2 degrees and preferably towards 1.5 degrees. It takes more than fine words to implement this; concrete policies are now needed. If we are to show the seriousness of the fact that climate change is not an obstacle but a lever for a sustainable society and a more resource-efficient green economy, it goes without saying that europe must lead that development.  Europe, like all regions of the world, will need to do much more if we are to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. One of the most important tools is the ETS, which we have at our disposal.

It is the culmination of the leadership that the European Union has maintained at successive conferences of the parties and we must congratulate ourselves on that. The European Union undertook to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1999 and by 40% by 2030. The first objective is on track to be met and I have no doubt that we will also achieve the goal we have set ourselves for 2030. For many years, we have stressed the need for an international agreement, so that emissions-responsible countries all contribute to the fight against climate change under conditions that are at least comparable. Not all countries are equally responsible, nor do they have the same social, environmental, energy and industrial challenges. It is therefore logical that solidarity mechanisms are in place to finance investment, research and development. At the same time, a mechanism would be needed to monitor the commitments that countries are making and to be able to exert some pressure if the efforts are not sufficient. The Agreement should have positive consequences for reindustrializing the European Union.

Madam President, first of all I would really like to pay fair praise and all of us to give these congratulations to our dear colleague Giovanni La Via and to commissioner Cañete for the excellent effort and hard work to enable the European Parliament and the European Union to arrive to annul the Paris agreement. An important, historic one that has highlighted the role of the European Union. It has proved once again that the European Union remains strong and the leading force that can tilt the scale in favour of humanity, in favour of a more social Europe, in favour of European citizens, in favour of future generations.  It is for this reason that we say that this agreement is a milestone and we must now implement it and the act of implementation is where it will judge both the European Commission and us in the European Parliament. I believe that in order for this agreement to be implemented and delivered, incentives must be given to the two main pillars that we as the European Parliament have defined: energy saving and renewable energy sources, which are the basic conditions for the European Energy Union, and because I heard earlier that we must incentivise third countries in Africa, I say that in the Mediterranean itself , since the Mediterranean has the comparative advantage of sunshine. My own country, Cyprus, has more than 300 days of sunshine, and may well develop renewable energy sources if it really has the support of European Union programmes. We ourselves can do this and I see no reason why we should look anywhere else.  The other important thing I wanted to stress is that there must also be mobilisation of civil society citizens themselves, for sustainable development, for sustainable development, but also for the fight against energy poverty. By serving and implementing these objectives, we are certainly also fighting energy poverty, they will certainly benefit consumers, and in conclusion, this effort cannot be financed from sources other than the basic principle of all of us being 'polluter pays' and I do not think the financial transaction tax will be related to the financing of any attempt to prevent climate change.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 1480, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "   – Chair, Sur Kummissarju, fil-fatt huwa ta' sodisfazzjon għalija li nkun qiegħda nindirizza proprju din il-plenarja hawnhekk illejla għaliex proprju llejla Malta għadha kif irratifikat il-Ftehim ta' Pariġi u nafu li r-rattifika tal-Ftehim ta' Pariġi mill-Unjoni Ewropea hija su大大ess.

What we have to do now is to translate this commitment into action; to implement what has been included in the agreement, but also to go beyond what has already been agreed. One such area would be carbon pricing, an issue rather left out of the Paris Agreement, but which could bear crucial importance in emissions reduction. As opposed to emissions trading schemes – which in the past have often proved less effective because of the inflation in the tradable permits handed out – carbon taxes would represent a more effective way to reduce emissions: they would transform the cost of pollution from a negative externality into actual costs, favouring a change in polluting behaviour. Additionally, revenues from such costs could, in the end, be used for the financing of new renewable energy infrastructures, thus starting a new virtuous cycle.

Madam President, I have stressed before that, despite the triumphalisms of the European Union and France, last year's COP21 decision in Paris did not create a clear framework for dealing with the devastating effects of the phenomenon of climate change, because it did not address two major problems that we will have to face in the future. The first major problem is that of the production model which does not change in substance. The large industrial states and their companies finally manage to get rich in the name of so-called ecology and continue to serve the same model of development. The second major issue is that of climate migration.  This is a huge political weakness of the Paris agreement, the lack of any reference to the status of a climate refugee or migrant. For the period 2008-2013 alone, the number is estimated at 166 million. Moreover, research that has been done shows that only when a natural disaster finds a group of people unprepared, do they migrate.

Success in Marrakesh means demonstrating that implementation of Paris is moving full steam ahead globally on all the elements of the Paris Package. The agenda for Marrakesh is very rich; unlike in Paris, where there was only one big deliverable, we have a variety of outcomes and the challenge will be to weave them together to tell a convincing story. For us, this story has to be one of real step—change after Paris, the world moving full steam ahead in the implementation of Paris. Marrakesh has to demonstrate that commitments are being implemented all over the world and enable more immediate action.  We can see two very broad areas. First, formal deliverables under the negotiating process. In particular, we have important conclusions to reach on loss and damage, with the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism, which is fundamental for islands, and on capacity building. And, of course, we need to make progress in building the Paris Framework. The second broad area is enhancing action and transparency before 2020, because it is essential that we clearly demonstrate that countries are swiftly putting in place ambitious climate policies, that they are gearing up to implement their NDCs and integrate their NDCs into national development planning in full coherence with SDGs? And we have an opportunity for progress on climate finance with a ministerial event which I hope can be pragmatic and action-oriented.  We will continue the multilateral process for monitoring, reporting and verification, because this raises the profile of all countries’ efforts and is a valuable experience for the future. I would also like to see a politically visible high level event on global climate action agenda that will inspire future action. It is very clear that there is much work still to do. However, as we look to implementing our commitments on the ground and progression in all areas on the Paris Agreement. We in the European Union, already between this year and next year, will deliver all the needed legislation to implement our Paris commitments. We already have the emission trading system, and therefore certain decisions, and we will come forward in December with an ambitious package for electricity market design, energy efficiency directives and energy performance of buildings and a renewables directive, and at the beginning of the year we will come with CO2 standards for cars and light vans.  The European Union not only has ambitious targets, it is enforcing all the policies and is already working with Parliament to deliver our commitments. We are doing our homework and we must help other countries to build capacity to deliver their homework, because for us it is easier, but for developing countries we have to build capacity for everything, for implementing the policies to be able to have monitoring systems, and that is why the Capacity Building Mechanism will be fundamental in Paris. I count on the support of this Parliament and I can assure you of my intention as always to keep Members of the European Parliament very closely informed of developments in the negotiations. These negotiations will be different to the one in Paris but the European Union, with a high ambition coalition, will work steadily so that we make real progress in COP22 in Marrakesh.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1488, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am glad that, after yesterday’s successful completion of ratification of the Paris agreement on behalf of the European Union, today’s debate was already focused on its implementation.

The Register is the key instrument to shed light on lobbying activities.  The current Register was jointly set up by Parliament and the Commission in 2011. Today it includes slightly over 10 000 organisations and self—employed individuals. It has even surpassed the register they operate in the United States in terms of the number of people and organisations who have registered. All registrants have agreed to adopt a common Code of Conduct, based on a set of ethical rules and principles, governing interactions with EU political leaders and officials.  The current Register remains, however, a voluntary system. If we want to fully meet citizens’ expectations for openness and accountability, we need to go further, and the three law—making institutions must act together to make sure that the rules of the Register are respected by all lobbyists so that everybody can see who tries to influence the EU law—making process and who they represent. You will see that our proposal has taken on board ideas put forward by you, by the Council and by the European Ombudsman. The public consultation we organised led to more than 1 700 replies, the majority of which came from individual citizens who expect us to live up to the highest transparency standards.  On 2 May, Vice-President Sylvie Guillaume and I chaired a public debate in Parliament, bringing together stakeholders from all over the EU. Let me briefly highlight the main elements of our proposal. Firstly, you need to be in the Register before you can have meetings with decision-makers in the three institutions. The Commission already applies this rule. Not on the transparency register – no meeting. This applies to all meetings of lobbyists with Commissioners, their Cabinet members, the Secretary—General and the DGs of the Commission services. Over 4 000 organisations and individuals have registered since this rule came into effect. So we now propose to apply it to meetings also of MEPs as well as the Secretary—General, Directors—General and Secretaries—general of political groups in the European Parliament. Registration will also be a condition for speaking at committee hearings and for holding events on Parliament premises.  In the Council we propose to apply the rule to meetings with the Council Secretary—General, Directors—General, the Ambassador of the current or incoming Presidency of the Council, as well as their deputies. Permanent representations are of course subject to national rules on ethics, but we offer them to join the system voluntarily. Last May, we made listing in the Transparency Register a precondition to sit on our expert groups. This important step forward is also reflected now in our proposal. Secondly, we propose to clarify which activities and entities are covered by the Register. We propose to keep a broad definition of lobbying activities covered by the Register and to set out the exceptions in a clearer way. Public authorities, including at sub—national level, and their associations who directly represent a democratic mandate are clearly excluded, for the reasons that this House and the Committee of the Regions have both underscored.  Thirdly, we propose changes to improve the quality of the data held in the Register and to strengthen monitoring and effective enforcement of the rules. Our proposal not only simplifies the data requirements for lobbyists, but also introduces systematic ex-ante checks on new registrations. We propose to streamline procedures with a view to finding quick, effective solutions if compliance with the Code of Conduct is at risk. If that is not effective, a formal investigation will be opened which can eventually lead to sanctions. Those who do not play by the rules risk being temporarily suspended from interactions with the institutions or removed altogether from the Register. Finally, our proposal creates stronger management structures for the Register and increases the resources at its disposal, subject to a commitment by all three institutions. A well-functioning Register needs adequate resources, a point repeatedly stressed by this Parliament and by stakeholders. We propose a stronger management structure with a management board on top of the Secretariat. An agreement between the three institutions would ensure adequate resource allocation to the Secretariat, as well as a right means to ensure effective redress for registrars in disputed cases.

For this Parliament, transparency has been the top priority since the first day of our work. It is a fact of life that huge interests are at stake when laws are proposed. European citizens have the right to know which interest representatives are involved in, in each phase of European decision—making. While our duty is to listen to all those whose interests will be affected by decisions we take, the right of citizens is to know whom we listen to.  This interinstitutional agreement proposed by the Commission is the way to answer their concerns. The establishment of a mandatory transparency register framework would be a major step forward in enhancing transparency of our decision—making and the democratic accountability of the European institutions. You might remember that the European Parliament was the first European institution to address the phenomenon of an increasing number of interest groups at European level, as well as potential consequences of this evolution for the legislative process. Today, I am convinced that the Commission proposal for a mandatory transparency register framework covering the three institutions will take us forward but the European Parliament and, in particular, its Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which is responsible for interinstitutional agreements, is fully aware that the mandatory register is only one of the key tools for having more transparency in the EU institutions.  We are happy the Commission has come to Parliament with a proposal that received strong support in public consultation. So let me conclude by stressing that only by working together across all areas of European responsibilities will the European institutions win back the trust of our citizens.

I would like to say here that, clearly, the proposals that have been made are going in the right direction, in particular, with the integration, at least partially, of the Council into the scheme or with the exclusion of local and regional authorities which represent public interests. However, there are several elements that need to be addressed. They will surely be discussed in the very near future. On the first point, I would like to say that this is the narrow definition of lobbying, which will have to meet three conditions: interaction, the promotion of interests and a willingness to influence the decision-making process. Therefore, we will have to have clear ideas about who and how these three criteria are audited. The second point is the need for two additional decisions to be made to this institutional agreement that will come into discussion. One to manage the administrative structure and the other, as I understand it, to deal with the budgetary aspects. When did the Commission plan to present them?  The third point, and not least, is the obligation on Members of the European Parliament to meet only registered lobbies. Even if this measure is not required in the publication of appointments, some members will certainly ask whether it is in line with their freedom of mandate, which is a principle in the treaties, and which an inter-institutional agreement cannot sweep away. Again, this is a slippery subject on which we will have the opportunity to discuss. What I take away from the objectives, however, is that we need a system that is readable, easy to access for all citizens, and that does not fuel distrust any more than it does now. It should also be noted that this transparency also applies to other types of issues: conflict of interest rules or codes of conduct.

It's really remarkable. The proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on the registration of pressure groups is a step forward that we salo add. It is timely and relevant for the European Commission, our Executive, to respond to Europe's transparency needs right now, and the ALDE Group certainly appreciates that transparency has a leading place on the Commission's agenda. Improving data collection should be a palpable advantage in working on information, and efforts to clarify definitions and the spectrum of covered activities and agencies should also facilitate the quality and efficiency of this record. We would like to thank you for increasing resources—we want resources to be increased—so that controls on the activity of the lobbies we are looking for can be effective. Without sufficient means we could, in fact, have a formal but not material requirement. I mean, if unfounded or incomplete statements can sneak in, we would be getting worse and perverting the purpose of the registration. If we make a decision such as the full achievement of this record, we must be able to get it to materialize and not be left in mere words. I would therefore like to stress that giving sufficient economic and staff cover is absolutely essential for this policy of transparency to be coherent and effective. However, let us face it, the European institutions do not enjoy much credibility in these times. Outrageous news of revolving doors in the Commission does not exactly help to believe in the project. And we cannot forget the most important thing: this reform will need the Council to shoulder off and to work together. So far, we've waited for a move on your part that hasn't arrived. The representatives of the Member States must also assume their share of responsibility. In this situation of common benefit we are interested in acting with an integrated policy and being efficient. We have not seen a real Council movement, but we would like to see a loyal collaboration in it soon.

I think the plaque has been inspiring, because the proposal for the interinstitutional agreement that we are discussing is a good basis.  But of course there is always room for improvement. I would like to mention five points: vulnerable EU institutions, such as agencies, must be able to join the agreement and become a full party; activities of lobbyists carried out at the specific request of the institutions, their members or officials must also be included, otherwise a huge loophole will arise; complainants should be able to object to the rejection of their complaint, just as lobbyists can oppose exclusion from registration; the Management Board must report periodically to Parliament and the Commission on its activities, and that reporting should be public; fraudulent conduct by lobbyists should lead to investigations by OLAF.

In doing so, this Parliament, and I am looking in particular at our Vice-President for Transparency, Mrs Guillaume, has a special responsibility.

I believe that we are now really one step further. It is a step in the right direction that this proposal for an interinstitutional agreement is now before us. Citizens expect us to promote confidence in the European institutions by also increasing transparency and integrity. And this proposal goes in precisely this direction. It will undoubtedly lead, if it is implemented in this way, to more lobbying organisations and to greater transparency. If we start with the positive things, it can be said that with your proposal you are basically taking Parliament under the same obligation as you yourself as the Commission. That's something I haven't been able to get through here with. That means – and I say this quite openly and honestly : we who are sitting here in our seats would probably agree relatively quickly. But there are some here who are not here, and those who have great problems with taking on commitments there. And I want to make this very clear: the fact that the report, which was supposed to come before your proposal, has not yet been voted on is not because it does not have a majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but because it has been taken off the agenda by the group leaders – the Conservatives, the Liberals, but ultimately also the Social Democrats – even though there was a majority in the committee to represent a very similar principle, namely that you have only proposed a very similar principle to which you have proposed. Of course, there must be spaces there to meet people who are not registered lobbyists. For a proper balance must be made between the legal principle of freedom of mandate and the legal principle of transparency. I think that you have succeeded in this balance in principle. That is why we, as a Parliament, are now in charge. I would also like to make it quite clear that it would not be acceptable – because your proposal is now before us and because we are also acting on the Rules of Procedure – to put my report on the table now, or even to postpone it for eternity. The report proposes measures for transparency and integrity in many other areas, such as revolving door effects. That is why this report must be put to the vote here. If it continues to be pushed forward here by the large groups, it will in turn be a breach of trust in the citizens. I would also like to mention Mrs Bresso in particular, who is in the crucial situation of producing majorities among the Social Democrats so that we can vote on the report. Because with your vote we could vote on the report. It is also the Social Democrats, with Christian Democrats and Liberals, who are blocking progress here. My appeal is that if you come back into the democratic processes, we will also find majorities, and the majority will also decide here in the House.

Public institutions, in our view, must be glass palaces, where citizens control the work of their representatives, who are therefore not delegated blankly. That is also why, having read the Commission's proposal, which merely photographs and legalises a current situation, which is not the best given what is happening, for example, with conflicts of interest, I make no secret of the fact that I have felt a sense of frustration and disappointment. I say this in no uncertain terms: I think we are wasting an opportunity! It is these missed opportunities that drive citizens away from the institutions and make the European project something extruded in their eyes.  The register must be contained in an act having legal force, with erga omnes effectiveness, and not in a simple interinstitutional agreement. This is a fundamental point that I would like to highlight, because only by an act with the force of law would lobbyists be obliged to provide truthful and correct information, whereas in this way it is left to their good will.  Law firms, embassies of third countries, permanent representations of the Member States and officials of all levels and levels of the three institutions, including the Council and the preparatory bodies, must be included within the scope of the activities covered by the register. We would also need a mandatory legislative footprint and strict penalties for those who provide incorrect and misleading information. We want a radical paradigm shift: everything must be made public and what happens behind the scenes should be an exception.  Today we do not know what is happening within the European Council or within the Eurogroup and who actually takes the decisions that kill the European project and the citizens. It is a proposal without ambition, in my opinion, made specifically so as not to disturb the real manoeuvrers of the European Union.

I believe that the Commission's proposal for an interinstitutional agreement is an interesting step in this direction because it proposes an interesting instrument, even if it is a first step, which allows us to start working towards a common position, because otherwise it is very easy to circumvent the instrument.

If I follow your statements, they want to regain the confidence of the citizens through the cooperation of the EU institutions and through greater openness. However, the substance of their proposal for negotiations is reduced to including the Council only in the existing system. There is no doubt that registering lobbyists is an important pillar of transparency – we also urgently need improvements and, yes, the approach. But that is not enough. They are falling by the wayside somewhere on the road to genuine sustainable transparency.  The core of the problem of trust is also the question of how the EU institution itself act or who holds the filler in the legislative work with whom and when. You do not take this aspect into account. They shall allow the institution to make arrangements in-house at its own discretion and independently of each other.

Let me begin by saying outright that, of course it goes without saying, that the EPP supports transparency. But transparency is actually a much more complex issue than it appears at first sight. I think at the heart of it is the problem of the relationship with transparency and trust. It is not clear cut; it is not automatic; it is not a direct, either causal or correlative, relationship. Indeed, the complexity is such that there is a lot of argument to suggest that the greater the transparency, the lower the trust, because why should people trust if they already have everything written down? Indeed, there are many people – I do not know if it is a majority or a minority – who say, if this much can be made transparent there must be something else that is hidden. It is, therefore, an ongoing, probably an infinitely repeatable process which can never be reached. And therefore I would say that if we are talking about transparency there has to be a finite quality to it, which I do not actually see at this particular time. So, the culture of trust is something that has to be more important, should supersede in some ways transparency itself, in order to generate the necessary trust in the institutions. Now I would go on to say that actually, from what I see, the central difficulty is the remoteness of all the institutions of the European Union from the citizens. Here, and the Vice-President we will know what I am about to say, what is happening to the European citizens’ initiative, which is a way of building trust, separately from transparency? I would also add here the problem of security. Too much openness makes people vulnerable to the various security services, who are very busy indeed in Brussels, in Strasbourg and who knows where else. Lobbying register, yes, I think that is absolutely right. It is not a silver bullet. I think there is no silver bullet, but at the centre of the problem is legitimacy.

He is right; transparency on its own will not restore trust in the European Union. But, if I may say, what would help is national leaders not blaming the EU for everything, national leaders not publishing posters with the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Parliament and many, many refugees, and then saying that the presidents of these institutions are responsible for the refugee crisis. No matter of transparency we will put on the table will solve that issue.  Having said that, I do believe – and I get this feeling strongly from discussing with you tonight – that we have taken a step in the right direction. Yes, we are not satisfied on all scores. Yes, we can we can do better in many areas – and I present to you my willingness to work with you to take this even further – if you can agree with this, but I do also believe that it is high time that the three institutions each also take their responsibility in this. Frankly, if Parliament and Council would follow the example the Juncker Commission has taken since the beginning, we would already have made a couple of steps forward. This is also indicated, I think, in the draft Giegold report.  Let me stress once again that we have the possibility now to improve the situation of transparency. It will not be perfect overnight, I know, but at the same time, if we use this interinstitutional agreement, the negotiation on the agreement, as an opportunity to see where we can improve our transparency, I strongly believe we can be more accountable to our citizens. We can prove to them that we are willing to put our cards on the table in terms of lobbying activities directed at lawmakers.  Let me end on a point which I would like to underscore, also made by Mr Giegold. This is not about us wanting to prescribe to every single elected Member of the European Parliament that she or he should register every single individual meeting. It is about meeting with lobbyists, people who come to you because they represent a certain interest and they want something to be done with it, so that people can see and can check which person represents which interest and what they are trying to achieve with that.

Ethics and transparency must be key values in relations between elected officials, citizens and lobby groups.  The proposal made is positive but does not go far enough. I bitterly regret that chiefs of staff, directors and unit heads are not included in the proposal when they have a great deal of responsibility for the European decision-making process. It is also essential to give ourselves the means to monitor and verify the information in the register and to agree on penalties in case of fraud. Strict rules must be applied to ensure transparency and ethics in day-to-day work within institutions. And those who break these rules have nothing to do in our walls!", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1515, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Christel SCHALDEMOSE", "mepid": "37312", "text": "   Rapporteur. Madam President! Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! This evening we are going to debate the Report of the Committee on the Environment on the implementation of the regulation on food contact material. This may sound a bit technical, but basically it is about how we ensure that the materials that are in direct contact with our food are also safe.  Current EU legislation is a framework law that regulates our materials for our food packaging, etc. The framework legislation provides for the possibility of establishing common EU rules for each of the 17 types of material listed in the act. However, only four of the 17 types of material are currently harmonised at EU level. The rest is up to the Member States to deal with. This poses problems for consumers, for businesses and for the authorities. In fact, this means that the internal market is not a single market but a market with 28 different sets of rules. Some countries have high standards and fine controls, and others have low standards and no controls. The consequence is that our consumers are left behind and that companies compete on completely diverse terms. For example, consumers cannot be sure that they will be protected from hazardous chemistry, either from the coating in the tomato can or from fluoride in the pizza tray. In fact, we know from the research that unacceptably high levels of harmful chemistry occur in many materials we use for our food. We know this from the baking paper, the paper bag to the flour, the pizza tray and microwave popcorn etc. It is worrying when, at the same time, we know from several studies that precisely chemistry in food packaging causes concrete health problems. For example, we know that having excessive amounts of fluoride in your urine increases the risk of involuntarily having an abortion. That is just one example.  Consumers must be protected much better and companies must be given more a level playing field to produce food contact materials. That is why we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy propose that the European Commission should come up with a proposal for a revision of the current legislation on food contact materials. In particular, we want the European Commission to give priority to the submission of common EU rules for the following materials: paper, cardboard, glue, coating and ink. We also propose that the European Commission should develop uniform testing methods for each material, so that Member States use the same methods to assess safety. Food safety must mean the same thing throughout the EU.  We also want to strengthen EPSA both in terms of money and tougher requirements. We know that chemicals react together, which is why EPSA must of course also check for the so-called cocktail effect. We also want EPSA to include the effect of a low but constant exposure to a substance. It may be that the quantities are low, but if we are exposed to a substance every day, the total amount becomes large. We also believe that it is important for EPSA to take this into account.  We also want specific testing methods for the safety of nanomaterials to be developed, and at the same time we want food contact material with nanomaterials to be labelled.  We also want something else. We find it incredible that we ensure better coordination between the food contact rules and our REACH legislation. It must simply not occur that substances which under REACH are categorised as dangerous are uncritically used in food contact materials. We will have done something about that.  In general, we are also proposing both more and better controls on the production of food contact materials by companies. There are some Member States which have no idea which companies in their country are importing or producing food contact materials. If they do not know about the companies, they cannot control them either.  We also believe that declarations of conformity should not just be a rubber stamp, but a real evidence of safety. In this way, we can ensure that both authorities and businesses have more confidence in each other.  Finally, I should like to say that it is also important to us that we ensure that food materials are covered by the criteria for endocrine disruptors that the European Commission is setting. They must also apply here.  I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the political groups very well for their very good cooperation on the report. It is a committee that is almost close to being completely united on this. We really want a review of the rules and we want common rules on food contact material to protect consumers and ensure a level playing field for businesses. It is not just us in this House, it is also European consumers and European businesses who want the same thing. So we hope that the European Commission will listen to us carefully today and come up very quickly with a proposal for a revision of the legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1516, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Christel SCHALDEMOSE", "mepid": "37312", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first I would like to thank and congratulate Ms Schaldemose and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) for their excellent work in producing this report on the implementation of the Food Contact Materials Regulation. The Commission very much welcomes this timely initiative. It underlines the importance of this topic, particularly in relation to consumer safety.  Food contact materials play an essential role in food supply and distribution, and also of course for consumers. Food packaging preserves or improves the quality of food and determines how it can be processed, transported, sold and consumed. However, some substances may migrate into or onto the food, compromising its safety and quality. Legal certainty on food contact materials is also needed to foster the single market and promote innovation. In the EU we have a broad and flexible framework regulation with fundamental requirements on safety. The powers to adopt specific EU legislation have mainly been used to develop specific rules for plastic materials. The Commission notes the conclusions set out in the implementation report. We note the concerns raised about those materials for which no specific measures have been developed at EU level and that are specifically legislated for only at national level. As you may know, the Commission’s Joint Research Centre has been working on a study looking at this particular area. The study has collected a vast amount of complex information on national measures, as well as on the industry situation, to provide a clear picture of the overall situation. The report, which will be published soon, will highlight the complex and often divergent nature of the current regulatory situation for food contact materials in the EU. The Commission is committed to addressing this important area of risk management of food contact materials in the EU and this key area for the functioning of the internal market, whilst always keeping the safety of consumers at the forefront.

I am convinced that together we are sending a clear signal to the Commission that there is still a lot of work to be done here. Materials that come into contact with food must meet numerous requirements: they are designed to protect against contamination and to maintain the quality of the food for as long as possible. They shall not, under normal and foreseeable conditions of use, release any constituents into foods which are likely to endanger human health or cause an unacceptable change in the composition of the foodstuffs. These requirements also apply to product groups that have not yet been further harmonised, such as .B paper, cardboard, varnishes, coatings and others. Unfortunately, there are repeated migration of chemicals into food, which poses a threat to human health. In addition, different national approaches hinder the internal market. We therefore agree that we need further harmonisation here.  The report is based on a broad compromise that the rapporteur has reached with all the political groups. This is also reflected in the result of the vote with 61 votes in favour and 3 against in committee. However, there was and still is a red line for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: the call for a horizontal, general ban on individual substances, such as mineral oil or biophenol. That goes too far for us, which was important for us during the vote in committee, and we have therefore asked for a split vote here.  Our position is: we need further comprehensible and actionable individual measures. These individual measures are conditional on studies as to whether the use of certain substances should be restricted.

This is a migration of unreacted or unreacted monomers or other additives used in the production process, especially during plastics processing. Since 2002, the European Commission has recorded notifications of as many as 2000 notifications of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food that did not fully comply with legal requirements and safety criteria and posed, or potentially posed, a risk to human health.

We are talking about extremely harmful substances, such as so-called endocrine disruptors, on which there has been a heated debate with the Commission for months on their very definition. Bisphenols, present in bottle plastic, are also disruptors, just to give an example, and counted as the cause of endometriosis and serious problems with the reproductive system.  From the point of view of general rules, the sector has legislated well, but there is no harmonisation of the specific laws of the Member States. Many States, including Italy, have their own specific legislation, notified to the European Union, but there are frequent problems with mutual recognition.  A further aggravation arises from the risk assessment. It happens that the European Food Safety Authority itself, EFSA, which theoretically guarantees our health, does partial work and does not take into account the so-called cocktail effect, nor multiple exposures to different chemicals.  We therefore call on the Commission to harmonise the specific sectors and to avoid the proliferation of rules that can cause market distortions, at the same time ensuring a uniform level of food safety, that EFSA carries out its task of ensuring the food safety of European citizens well and carries out risk assessments worthy of the name, and finally that the Commission 100 % avoids the presence of endocrine disruptors among these substances and finally protects the health of European citizens more than the interests of lobbies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1522, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Sylvie GODDYN", "mepid": "21331", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

However, it is worrying that so far special measures have only been adopted for four of the 17 substances listed in the Annex to the Regulation.

It happens from time to time that I order a pizza, perhaps after a lengthy plenary debate in the evening at quarter past eleven, and this pizza is usually delivered in cardboard boxes. Can I be sure now that there is no health-threatening element in this cardboard box that might pass on to the pizza? That is the question here. The answer is likely or most likely: No. Or rather, the answer depends on which country I live in. Are we in this area that we are now talking about, that is to say, an internal market or not? After all, if only four of the 17 materials laid down in the regulation are regulated throughout Europe, then we are not an internal market, and that cannot be the case. I therefore very much welcome the report presented by Mrs Schaldemose. For me, their message is clear: only a harmonised standard of health is a high standard for people's health in the internal market. This applies in particular to substances such as the so-called endocrine disruptors. This is especially true for an endocrine disruptor called bisphenol. Unlike the party line or the group line, I am very much in favour of banning bisphenol completely in Europe. What is bad for babies is also bad for me. So there is a very simple logic behind this. Consumer confidence is also being played on here. In general, therefore, we in Europe need to achieve uniform standards for all 17 materials and their testing procedures. When assessing the risks, however, not only the individual substances, but also their interaction with other substances, must be assessed. That is very important. In summary, therefore, only common rules guarantee a high level of health protection. And I must be able to rely – and when I say 'I'm speaking on behalf of all consumers' – that the packaging of the food does not make me sick in the long term.

It has long been known that not only the composition of food products, but also what it is packaged in, affects our health and quality of life. In the packaging, the researchers discovered about 170 types of chemicals, such as biosphenol A, phthalates, styrene, triclosan, formaldehyde, or PFC (perfluorocarbohydrate), which freely migrate to food and then significantly affect our hormonal balance, cause obesity, diabetes, neurological and inflammatory disorders and cancer development. In addition, no one – neither the packaging nor the food manufacturer – is obliged to indicate the chemical composition of the packaging and, moreover, potential cellular or hormonal changes caused by these chemicals are not included in the routine toxicological analysis, which raises serious doubts as to the correctness of the current chemical regulatory procedures. That is why it is so important to pass a law as soon as possible that will mobilise packaging manufacturers to withdraw harmful substances from the packaging process as soon as possible, as well as food itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1539, "date": "2016-10-05.json", "name": "Monica MACOVEI", "mepid": "96824", "text": "  in writing. – Materials not regulated by specific Union measures endanger public health, the environment and decrease people's confidence in us.

This can be achieved to the extent that the increase in EFSA funding would materialise in the results of R&amp;D and innovation, scientific research and RISK assessment, identification and classification of all substances present in the SCALE (including their impact on human health). Obviously, ensuring consistency between THE regulations on THE MAs, biocidal products, harmful substances and waste, as well as clarifying the role played by the various institutions and bodies involved in this area are essential aspects. However, we must be aware that not only is it that all Member States have a responsible assumption of the implementation of the relevant legislation and the intensification of compliance checks, but also the exchange of best practices with a view to applying relevant and effective authorisation procedures for the 13 non-harmonised MAs is particularly necessary in this context.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}]
