Our progress in defining new, bold and ambitious targets and goals in this parliamentary term is inspiring. We can be proud of having approved the first climate law in the world and of what we are doing to achieve climate neutrality in 30 years. We are doing what we were elected to do: to shape a better, brighter and cleaner future for us all, in particular for future generations. I am proud to be taking part in this challenge and, hopefully, in this accomplishment.  But the planet is now waiting for us to do our part. We are already facing extreme weather events, devastating fires, severe droughts, floods and devastating storms. We need, quickly and effectively, to adapt our territory, our cities, our economies and our infrastructure. We need to invest in sustainable and nature-based solutions, protect the economy from climate problems, and improve the resilience of critical infrastructure, adding climate factors to risk management practices, stepping up prevention and preparedness efforts, and making use of technological advancements.  But many are already suffering: Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Greeks, Cypriots, Bulgarians and Romanians. Our fellow Europeans living in these countries are already facing severe risks of desertification across over half of their territory. For example, in Spain, 75% of the country is at risk of desertification, and one-fifth of the territory is at a high risk of irreversibly becoming desert. If we are, rightly, financing climate mitigation and transition mechanisms for countries lagging in their energy transition from coal to renewable energy sources, why are we forgetting the countries that are already suffering from climate change, the ones among us who are already burdened by a non-recoverable debt that is maturing in their biodiversity? How does this make sense? We need to advance with adaptation funding, a sort of fair climate adaptation mechanism, to help these cities and regions.  I’m sure I don’t need to explain how it is that everyone will lose if we don’t act now to adapt and reduce these climate change effects. Our food supply chains, our industries and our economies will be disrupted. We must fix the climate and the environment if we are to live better and have better jobs.  Rest assured, you will not find the EPP arguing in the trenches for the economy and being hostile towards the environment, nor fighting for the climate by shouting for the destruction of the economy or an end to the social market economy. We need both. We need the economy and the environment, and we need them to work together.  Senhor Presidente, caras e caros Colegas, as temperaturas médias globais europeias repetidamente quebraram recordes nos últimos anos. Em particular os 5 últimos anos foram os mais quentes já registados com ondas de calor, secas e incêndios florestais em toda a Europa, com centenas de mortos. E estes impactos são transfronteiriços, afetam a nossa saúde, destroem a nossa agricultura, limitam o comércio e obrigam a migrações e reduzem a nossa segurança. Precisamos, por isso, que a nova estratégia para a adaptação às alterações climáticas contenha respostas concretas relativas à desertificação e à degradação dos solos. Precisamos de novas construções e infraestruturas que sejam resistentes e eficientes. Precisamos de aproveitar melhor o potencial das florestas, que não só retiram o carbono da atmosfera como amenizam a temperatura e retêm a humidade. Precisamos de melhorar os sistemas de alerta rápido contra desastres, tirando partido do potencial das novas tecnologias e dos dados. Precisamos de investir na gestão eficiente da água, que se torna escassa.

Honourable Members, the last five years were the hottest on record, with more frequent heatwaves, droughts and wildfires across Europe. Temporary drops in greenhouse gas emissions like those caused by the 2008 financial crisis and the current economic disruptions due to the COVID—19 pandemic have little effect on the evolution of the planetary climate, and emissions can bounce back quickly.  The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5° Celsius issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrates that even in a best case scenario of sustained emission limitations, there will be large stress on agri—food systems, infrastructure, ecosystems and human health.  The Union was an early actor on adaptation, with the adoption in 2013 of a Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change. This aimed to enhance the preparedness and capacity of all governance levels to respond to the impacts of climate change and make Europe more climate resilient. The new strategy will draw on its evaluation that was finalised in 2018 and, of course, will also take account of the European Green Deal ambitions.  Efforts to measure resilience to climate change need to continue and to be upgraded and linked to a more ambitious monitoring and evaluation system.  The 2013 strategy relied on the scoreboard to assess preparedness. The revised strategy could use a dashboard to assess resilience and subsequently monitor its strength over time, with regular progress reports on specific targets. At the same time, strengthening effective monitoring and evaluation tools for adaptation policies and measures in partner countries will continue to be of central interest for the Union’s international action and support. The Commission’s proposal for a European climate law provides a framework for progress in pursuit of the global adaptation goal established in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement. The adaptation strategy will be designed to support the achievement of the objectives of the proposal. The governance will include a citizens’ dimension through the recently—launched climate pact. The revised strategy will be accompanied by an impact assessment and will draw on the latest available research results. Adaptation action in general, and the strategy in particular, will benefit from the increased climate—related spending target in the next Union seven—year budget, while the European Investment Bank has committed in its recently—adopted climate roadmap to support its implementation. Stakeholders will be empowered to tackle climate impacts like desertification and land degradation.  Climate change adaptation and disaster risk management will be a key priority for the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund in the 2021—2027 period, with a place—based approach to improving the resilience of EU regions and cities.  Today, the speed of adaptation actions varies across the Union, with all Member States having adopted national adaptation strategies or plans. In the EU Member States, most vulnerability assessments are being made, and adaptations identified, in respect of agriculture, health, biodiversity, forestry, energy, oceans and seas. The European Environment Agency concludes that even if the Union and some countries have started to monitor the implementation of adaptation activities, it’s not possible to determine with any certainty whether decisive progress in increased resilience at Union level has been achieved by 2020.  While building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change is a challenge for all regions of the world, it’s the poorest and most vulnerable who are least able to adapt, both with the Union and globally, for example because of limited resources, protracted crises or violence.  Globally, the Union and its Member States remain the largest contributor of international public climate finance for adaptation purposes to developing countries, in particular least—developed countries and small island developing states. The Union and its Member States are committed to scaling up their financial assistance in the future.  Water resources, forests and agricultural crops fulfil many critical productive and regulation functions upon which our societies depend, such as clean drinking water, carbon sequestration, abundant food, wood and forest products, outdoor recreation opportunities and habitat. Ensuring water, forests and agriculture can withstand a changing climate is critical to reaching essential goals, including preserving ecosystem services and not least the carbon sequestration potential of forests. The Commission will take this issue up in all fora, including for cities in the global Covenant of Mayors. This issue is essential and the Commission welcomes Parliament’s early engagement and clear signal for ambition.  We look forward to the upcoming parliamentary resolution on the new strategy and to engaging in fruitful discussion on implementation once the Commission adopts the new strategy.

The motion for a resolution on a climate change adaptation strategy for the European Union is a very important document for the future of the people of the european Union as a whole. I am pleased that this huge green deal, led by Mr Timmermans, has started, so in addition to these measures to minimise climate change, I have decided to adapt to the effects of climate change that we are experiencing every day. This is a really serious problem that all mankind has to face. The decisions we are making now will be crucial to preventing the effects of climate change.  The resolution raises a number of important issues. I ask the Commission to take note of them. The most important proposals m.in. the development of urban strategies, which will include harnessing the potential of all urban infrastructure, m.in. such as urban gardens or green roofs and pavements.  I know that we are all aware of how much climate change will affect our lives and our environment. I would particularly like to draw attention to cities, because today more than two thirds of Europe's population lives in urban areas, or more than 350 million people, and this percentage is constantly increasing. Rising air temperatures of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius can raise the ground temperature to more than 60 degrees. That is why it is so important to green these areas, whether in terms of roofs, roads or even glazed buildings.  It is probably at this point in Europe that investment work is underway, which is co-financed by EU funds. I therefore ask for an answer as to whether these investments took into account the effects of climate change during the design phase. If not, I call on my colleagues to pay particular attention to this, because urban infrastructure can make a significant contribution to reducing the Union's overall vulnerability to climate change.  In order to make positive changes, we need to take into account many ecologically important aspects. The investment plans of all Member States and of all areas that include climate change, including research and development, must take into account our strategy. We should not forget to develop appropriate rapid response plans for climate disasters such as heat waves, floods and droughts.  I would like to address many of the misdemeasied allegations that I have the opportunity to observe on social media. They suggest that since there is heavy rainfall, which results in flooding or flooding, it is ible to talk about drought or global warming. Dear! It is enough to ask farmers whether violent downpours irrigate crops, and we will get the answer that violent and heavy rains do not provide plants with enough water, because this one simply drains from the ground, very often destroying crops. I would therefore also like to pay particular attention to agriculture, which also faces many challenges in adapting to climate change.  I would also like to call on all European local authorities to follow european cities that have adopted local law pursuing the European Union's climate objectives. Achieving climate neutrality in terms of greenhouse gas emissions requires the active participation of both government and local authorities, as well as all sectors of the economy and society as a whole. Thus, local authorities can be an active partner for the industrial and construction sector and, through the implementation of projects at local level, actively support the implementation of the EU climate strategy.

Adaptation is required to make measures at all levels transformative enough to deal with the systemic changes our climate, environment and society are facing. Throughout history, people and societies have adapted to climate variability and extremes with varying degrees of success. Taking responsibility for climate—related risk requires decision—making in a changing world with continued uncertainty on climate impact and with limitation on how effective the adaptation will be.  Climate change impacts are more and more visible, with heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires across Europe and no snow for Christmas in Helsinki. Climate change will continue to create significant difficulties in Europe in spite of mitigation efforts. Moreover, Europe is affected by indirect climate impacts occurring in other parts of the world in multiple ways, such as through trade and supply chains, spread of infections and threats to international security. It is therefore crucial that Parliament is in the forefront of pushing for stronger EU policies and adaptation.

Unfortunately, we have already waited too long for the radical shift needed to combat climate change and reduce our emissions. Unfortunately, therefore, the crisis will get worse, and unfortunately the proposals now under discussion in the climate law, for example, are not enough to reduce emissions, quickly enough. The World Meteorological Organization showed in its latest report that there is a 20 percent chance that we will reach 1.5 degrees as early as 2024, that is, within four years. People are already dying, people are already fleeing, and people are already losing their livelihoods, not only elsewhere, far away, but indeed also here in Europe.

Today we are already in another world, 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer, a world that at best successful global cooperation will be at least 1.5 degrees warmer. When we consider that this was precisely the temperature difference between the ice age and ours, the one that allowed human civilization to flourish, we understand how gigantic the task of adaptation is.  We have no choice but to take bold adaptation measures now to deal with the inevitable climate impacts on their social, economic and environmental costs. The new adaptation strategy should be very ambitious. Social cohesion, the clear distinction between adaptation and adaptation investments, the gender dimension, climate refugees, the creation of a mechanism for loss and damage, the strengthening of the resilience of island regions are thematic areas that should guide the new strategy.  Enhanced governance of adaptation, both at European Union and Member State and local government level, as outlined in Parliament's proposal in climate legislation, should include legally binding targets.

I fully agree with Mr Balt on the issue that cities play a crucial role in this, and I know that many, many cities have very elaborate and ambitious plans, ideas and concrete projects, but it’s also up to the national authorities to provide the necessary financial means. Here I can only plead to all of you to use the opportunities provided by the MFF and the different programmes.  But it’s also on us to be engaged enough on this issue when it comes to agreeing on the different sectoral regulations, because it’s a horizontal issue and it’s not sufficient to be very committed within the climate and environmental caucus; it’s also important to be strict and ambitious across the board, if I may say so.  Here I can only once again urge you to reach out to your colleagues in the different groups, when they are negotiating their sectoral programmes, to indeed address this issue and not to wait until certain modifications in the legislation is necessary, as already mentioned by Ms Zalewska. We’re looking forward to the upcoming resolution on the new Adaptation Strategy and also expect again not only a fruitful discussion on, but a very engaged and ambitious implementation of, this strategy across the different sectoral topics.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 11, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The tightened climate measures approved by the European Council will further undermine our prosperity, on which our social benefits are based. This policy is taking the energy-intensive industries into the fore and accelerating deindustrialisation. According to a study presented by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in September 2020, these new requirements will lead to a further tightening of the European emissions trading system. The high CO2 prices have a major impact on industrial companies, which are, after all, part of this emissions trading scheme. If only companies within the European Union have to bear these costs, there is a very high risk that these companies will relocate their activities. So there is a risk of losing these companies to Germany and Europe, and greenhouse gas emissions will not be reduced, they will only be relocated. The CO2 target as a driver, the one-sided focus on electric vehicles with the war against the internal combustion engine has serious consequences for our employment.

It is important that the functioning of the European Parliament is always guaranteed, because we are a special Parliament.

The President and also the bodies have taken appropriate decisions to ensure that Parliament, as the heart of European democracy, remains open and functional. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have been working together to draw up new proposals together, in order to be better prepared for future exceptional situations of all kinds. We have managed to reach a consensus across all political groups on four new rules of procedure, which are to be put to the vote today.

Of course, we had as our main aim the collaboration between the European Public Prosecutor's Office and OLAF, but at the same time, on the basis of the European Parliament's proposals, we were able to introduce things that will facilitate and improve the work of OLAF: firstly, transparency within OLAF, access to files, but also access to bank accounts in the Member States. We have a controller, an independent structure in the supervisory committee, who will verify that procedural safeguards are correctly applied. We have procedures, higher standards of procedures for certain activities. At the same time, Member States are obliged to report on what they have done with the recommendations in the OLAF reports, so as to ensure the best possible collaboration between both Member States and institutions.

As the rapporteur has already said, this marks the end of seven years of discussion and negotiations. I think it is worth mentioning this and stressing the energy that the current and previous rapporteurs put into these negotiations. Indeed, we had very intense and, ultimately, very fruitful negotiations on this significant piece of legislation. All the institutions showed commitment and resolve, and it has finally paid off.  I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Council for their work on this initiative. In particular, I would like to recognise the role of the rapporteur, Marian-Jean Marinescu. Marian-Jean, your determination to close the deal proved pivotal. I would also like to thank the co-rapporteurs who supported you in all your efforts.  The OLAF Regulation needed to be revised inter alia to adapt to the new anti-fraud architecture, which now also includes the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). However, the Regulation that we have ended up with achieves much more. We have strengthened the European Anti—Fraud Office, further equipping it with the tools it needs to protect the Union budget. A reformed OLAF is key to ensuring that the next European budget and the recovery plan are subject to the best control mechanism. The revised OLAF Regulation ensures cooperation between OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and reinforces OLAF’s investigative capacity. OLAF and the EPPO pursue the same objective of protecting the Union budget. While they do so within their own mandate, the revised OLAF Regulation ensures that they also do so in close cooperation. This cooperation relies on three pillars. First, the EPPO can rely on the support and expertise of OLAF in carrying out its tasks. Second, OLAF can launch investigations that are complementary to those of the EPPO to facilitate recovery or adopt administrative precautionary measures. Third, they exchange information before and during investigations through a mutual reporting mechanism. The reformed OLAF also has better tools to investigate fraud against the Union budget. It may access bank account information under the same conditions that apply to national competent authorities. It will conduct on-the-spot checks, pursuant to clearer rules, and benefit from an enhanced two-way cooperation with national authorities. These improvements go hand in hand with clearer procedural guarantees and the establishment of new functions to ensure their respect, like the Controller. To conclude, the Commission welcomes the revision of the OLAF Regulation, which contributes to shaping a revamped EU anti-fraud architecture. I am looking forward to hearing the views of the political groups. May I add that I think it was very timely to have this revision adopted in the light of the now much bigger European budget, with all the possible implications this will have on where we need to protect European taxpayers’ money. Therefore, I am grateful for your commitment and, finally, all of your achievements.

Secondly, the renewed OLAF Regulation currently strengthens the institution's existing powers, while strengthening OLAF's ability to carry out an effective investigation with access, for example, to bank accounts and, thirdly, olaf must provide assurances and an update on the independence of the control body and stakeholders' access to the reports in the coming months.

Now we have made the legal background ready for their effective functioning in the future. This is truly a great accomplishment. However, at the same time, in this discussion about the effectiveness of European anti—fraud efforts, let me highlight the very simple but still crucial concern: still insufficient funding. This may sound technical, but for my constituents it’s a painfully obvious problem. According to the latest report by OLAF, financial irregularities affect 4% of payments in Hungary. This is 10 times the EU average. But whenever I cite this number to my voters, they very often ask the question: wait a minute, only 4%? Then I explain that the capacity of OLAF only allows them to monitor a small fraction of payments – 5% or 10% – but in fact it is possible that this number is much higher, we just don’t know, and the fact that we don’t know is in itself very problematic. Now imagine that this already underfunded institution now has to administer EUR 750 billion in recovery funds. How can they do that?  We have also launched the European Public Prosecutor’s Office with really ground—breaking powers but, also in EPPO’s case, inadequate staffing and funding is still a problem. Let’s be clear: protecting our financial interests has costs. That’s a fact. But this cost is an investment in the future. It’s an investment in recovering this money, and spending more on anti—fraud operation is actually saving us money. So, let’s consider this in the future and let’s fight with every method possible for higher funding for these institutions in order for them to protect our European financial interests.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 23, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Jean-François JALKH", "mepid": "124770", "text": "  on behalf of the ID Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed regulation we are discussing today aims to define how much of the pie will be left to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, after the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. At the same time, it strives to remedy the sometimes serious dysfunctions that have been observed in the operation of OLAF in recent years. The most attentive will remember that the main players in the fight against fraud in the European Union have not spared their criticism of the Office, be it the European Commission, our Parliament in its various landfills, the European Court of Auditors or the OLAF supervisory committee. While OLAF is theoretically supposed to carry out its investigations independently, the Court of Auditors did not fail to remind us, for example, that the professional promotion of its agents was carried out by the European Commission. Funny independence, really! In an excellent report, the French Parliament also concluded that the Agency could not claim to meet the rigorous criteria required of an independent administrative authority. I will thank you for the names of birds exchanged between the Agency and its oversight committee in recent years. The Agency's lack of consideration for its supervisory committee does not bode well for the serenity of future relations between OLAF and the European Data Protection Supervisor. It is promised, juror, spat: OLAF will stop making illegal wiretaps as in the case of the investigation against Commissioner Dalli, which resulted in the dismissal of its former director in Belgium. No more clandestine night searches of the offices of some MPs without their knowledge. The establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, while it clearly shows the abandonment of the sovereignty of national states, is also presented to us as a significant improvement in the rights of defence for those involved. Nothing is less certain in view of the totally disproportionate prerogatives granted to the Future Office: recognition of anonymous whistleblowers, the possibility for the Office, apart from any preliminary investigation or judicial information, to access the private telephone lines and bank accounts of agents and elected officials, actors of the Union , which revulded the highly respected Mrs Gressle, former chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Where is the rule of law? Before we lecture Poland, Hungary, the whole world, let's start by sweeping in front of our door! Some states refuse to go under the caudine forks of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. Nationals of these countries will have fewer rights, in defiance of the eu's core values.

We can only hope it's different now. This can be seen in Croatia, for example, in R&amp;D competitions. The criterion by which money is awarded is pure luck, i.e. the method of the fastest finger.

An aid package of unprecedented size in the history of the Union had to be adopted together with the multiannual budget, while the European Union took a huge step towards protecting our common values and finances. This was the adoption of conditions of the rule of law linked to payments. In order for everything to be done in the Member States of the Union in accordance with EU law and its core values, it is essential to have an effective EU investigating authority and public prosecutor's office. This is especially true when we are discussing our common finances and using our common money. Unfortunately, in recent years, we have been able to list in number an in number of cases, Hungary, Poland, or even the Czech Republic, where governments and heads of government have been incited against the Union by running through EU values, dethrecing the rule of law and stealing EU money, while holding their hands for EU money. However, this is now over. Finally, the rule of law mechanism, OLAF and the EU Public Prosecutor's Office can jointly stop unscrupulous theft. However, it is essential to coordinate the functioning of OLAF and the EU Public Prosecutor's Office. There is a need to expand OLAF's investigative powers, and it is also important to strengthen OLAF's rights in the proceedings of the person involved in the investigation, for example. Let us also strengthen the protection of procedural guarantees by establishing a post of procedural auditor. In addition to the functioning of the rule of law mechanism, OLAF and the Public Prosecutor's Office can work together effectively, so that the citizens of Europe can be calmer and safer with their own money, their finances, Europe's money. The successful cooperation between OLAF and the Public Prosecutor's Office is worth making a serious effort.

Today we are talking about the fight against fraud, in particular cooperation between the two authorities OLAF – the former anti-fraud authority – and the newly created EPPO, the Public Prosecutor's Office. The fight against fraud is essential. Why is this so important? Well, as a good European, you certainly know Dante's \"Divine Comedy.\" Dante is astonished when, during his visit to the Inferno, he finds people in the deepest circle of hell, namely – frozen into the eternal ice – fraudsters and traitors: Brutus and also Judas Iscariot.  Are fraud and betrayal so bad? Yes, because fraudsters and traitors destroy the most important element of human coexistence: trust in the good will of one's neighbour. And that is why it is essential to identify fraudsters and bring them to justice.  However, I see at least two problems in the cooperation between olaf and EPPO: the rate of fraud to the national authorities has already been less than 30%. Why do you think that this quota will actually improve when a new authority is added and when there are many more competency wrangling than before? Nor is it good that the EPPO is withdrawing staff and know-how from OLAF, thereby weakening the fight against fraud to date. In the first PIF report 31 years ago, the Commission said that cooperation between the authorities involved is a success factor. That is the most important thing.

In fact, the follow-up system for recommendations between OLAF and the Member States has been improved. For olaf investigations, the figure of the controller has been set up, which will monitor the procedures to ensure its correctness and provision has been made for the possibility for suspects to have access to the final report, all of which are steps in the direction we want.

You have supported all the Commission proposals to strengthen the effectiveness of investigations, as well as our objective to base the relationship between OLAF and the EPPO on the strongest complementarity.  In addition, you have pushed to ensure that OLAF’s strong investigative tools co—exist with stronger procedural guarantees. In fact, the revised legislation establishes a controller to handle complaints by persons concerned. It allows the person under investigation to assess the final report under certain conditions and provides for respect of higher procedural safeguards when OLAF supports the EPPO.  These amendments should increase the protection of persons subject to investigation and also increase the reliability of OLAF’s work even though the rules on admissibility of OLAF—collected evidence in subsequent criminal procedures will go unchanged. We should soon start implementing a new financial framework accompanied by an ambitious recovery plan. It’s crucial that the Union will be ready to protect European Union citizens’ money, ensuring that money is spent properly and effectively.  Having said this, also in response to Mr Freund and others, I think we have now provided the necessary financial means to the different organisations. In particular, we constantly hear that the EPPO should get more money. I think even before they start working they have the same staff numbers as OLAF, because you have to include the decentralised prosecutors and then you certainly arrive at the same number. And may I say that the original concept of the EPPO was to focus very much on the work of the decentralised prosecutors, but now we see a very strong headquarters.  Again, I think we should see how it works, how it comes into operational daily work and then, of course, we have to adapt to the needs and see what are the future needs. I was very clear in the discussions. There are opportunities like amending budgets, etc., where we can, so to say, react in case there are further needs.  But first, I think, we should now really pay attention so that the EPPO can finally start – as soon as possible, hopefully in spring – its work, and then I think we can have a further assessment about the future needs.  Please be assured that we have every interest not only to protect our money, but also to get it back in the case of fraud and criminal cases. So indeed – and I think this was said by Ms Cseh and others – this is something which should really pay off in the way that we get the money back. Both these institutions, but also others dealing with such issues, are indeed properly equipped, because they need it. We will certainly take care that at the end of the day we get the money back – and certainly more than we have to invest into the staffing and the financing of these institutions. But on the other hand, we have to see that everything is in balance and we really lead also by example.  Finally, we are talking today primarily about OLAF and that’s why I would again like to highlight that the revised OLAF Regulation is a key element of the new EU Anti—Fraud architecture that we are building to achieve that objective. This is not only about the cooperation between OLAF and EPPO. Here, of course, it’s about the investigative and prosecutorial powers of EPPO which are now there, but we should not forget there is also Europol, and its analytical capacity has to be used. The same applies to Eurojust, which definitely has a coordinating role. So the reformed OLAF is a centrepiece, if you like, of this architecture to carry out even more effective  investigations.

As Europol has pointed out, organised crime is already working to try to exploit the many opportunities offered by the Recovery Fund and the various European Structural Funds envisaged, in support of the Member States, to deal with the pandemic crisis. In this alarming context, the European Union must equip itself with effective law enforcement agencies, and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). In the fight against fraud, to the detriment of the Union's budget, it is certainly a fundamental stage in the European anti-fraud architecture. Consequently, it was equally crucial to update Regulation No 883/2013, which regulates the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), whose task is to investigate illegal behaviour such as fraud and corruption, which are often the first step in more composite criminal designs, to the detriment of the Union budget. Thanks to the efforts made in the complex negotiations, which I have had the honour of following personally, I can say with satisfaction that the new regulatory framework extending OLAF's legal basis, increasing its powers of investigation, will ensure close cooperation, exchange of information and complementarity of investigations with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, but will also represent a significant step, in the further consolidation of the rule of law, in the European Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 35, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  The next item is the report (A9-0263/2020) by Kosma Złotowski, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the issues dealt with by the Committee on Petitions in 2019 (2020/2044(INI)).

This is the only forum where the citizens of the European Union can not only present their problems and the challenges they face, but, most importantly, speak in person at committee meetings. It is always invaluable for democracy when victims can tell their own story of their plight. We all the more regret that this difficult year has deprived us of the opportunity to meet petitioners in personal.  PETI is also the most interdisciplinary of all committees. The programme of its activities is constantly laid out by the petitioners themselves, who apply to us. Among the most frequently discussed topics in 2019 were environmental issues, transport, the protection of children's rights, the difficulties of people with disabilities and the so many concerns on both sides of the Brexit channel. The number of petitions submitted compared to 2018 increased by more than 11%. More petitions have also been declared admissible. Unfortunately, more than 30% of petitions still did not refer directly to the competence or area of activity of the European Union, which means that they could not be dealt with. Citizens' lack of knowledge of the division of competences between Brussels and the Member States is a challenge to the process of discussing and responding to petitions, which we must deal with in the coming years. Cooperation with other parliamentary committees is a key element in the efficiency and effectiveness of the work taken by the Committee on Petitions. In 2019, 65 petitions were sent to other committees for opinions and 351 were sent to them for information. The contribution and expertise of colleagues from other committees are therefore necessary in order to fully respond to petitioners' questions and requests.  Among the important initiatives that have been indirectly inspired by petitioners to the European Parliament is the proposal for a directive on the abolition of seasonal time changes and the repeal of Directive 2000/84. The Committee on Petitions has prepared an opinion on the report on this issue, which has been based on numerous reports from citizens calling for this burdensome obligation to be removed. It is also important to highlight the large number of Brexit petitions submitted in 2019, which were largely concerned with protecting the rights of EU citizens before and after the UK's exit. The Committee on Petitions has done a very good job here and its actions have made citizens' rights one of Parliament's main priorities in the negotiations between Brussels and London.  Summing up the work of the Committee on Petitions in 2019, we should mention two institutions that play a very important role in the process of responding and responding to petitions. This is, of course, the European Commission, which is using our knowledge in hearings and discussions with petitioners, but the European Ombudsman is particularly thanked. The best proof that this collaboration works exemplary was the re-election of Emily O'Reilly to the post last December. It was the Committee on Petitions that was responsible for the process of analysing and hearing all candidates.  2019 has been a challenging year for the work of the Committee on Petitions due to a break in our work related to the elections and the period of the new composition of Parliament. However, I am convinced that the time we had at our disposal was very good. This is, of course, due to our President Dolores Montserrat and the commitment of all the members of the committee, but also to the professionalism of the staff of our secretariat, to whom we owe a huge thank you. I hope that Parliament will also give a positive assessment of their work and adopt the report presented on the activities of the Committee on Petitions for the previous year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 37, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Helena Dalli", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Złotowski, for this comprehensive report, which will contribute to further strengthening relations between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions (PETI). As discussed during our structured dialogue two weeks ago, we are constantly working to improve our cooperation. I strongly believe the ability to petition is a fundamental right for all citizens and a key element of parliamentary democracy. Today, more than ever against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, petitions are an effective channel for direct contact and open dialogue concerning problems affecting the daily lives of Europeans. Even before the pandemic, the use of petitions was on the increase, up by 11.23% in 2019 compared to the previous year. This was due in part to the more visible and accessible European Parliament Petitions Web Portal. Many of the petitions were in the environmental, health and social sectors. Let me assure you that the Commission takes the work of this committee very seriously. We continue our efforts to improve the speed, quality and pertinence of our contributions to your replies to petitioners’ concerns. This includes the modernisation of our IT tools for handling petitions and streamlining the underlying procedures. In addition, the Commission is increasingly represented at your meetings by Commissioners and high-ranking officials, especially when it comes to sensitive petitions. To put it in numbers, in the first year of our mandate, two Commissioners, three directors-general, four deputy directors-general, 10 directors and 22 heads of unit participated in debates in the PETI Committee. This trend will continue in the coming year. I take note of the section of your report on the issue of petitions and infringement procedures. As you know, the primary purpose of the infringement procedure is to make sure that Member States comply with EU law. It cannot be used to alter the specific legal situation of an individual or provide for individual means of redress. Therefore, we believe that individual complaints pointing to the incorrect application of EU law are often better addressed by the appropriate mechanisms at national level. This approach leaves the Commission more able to focus its resources on addressing systemic issues. I can assure you that we remain fully committed to fruitful cooperation in addressing infringement-related petitions. In this spirit, the Commission welcomes the Committee’s opinion on identifying potential systemic breaches of EU law with the petitions it receives. However, the decision on whether or not to investigate and pursue an instance of suspected non-compliance with EU law must remain within the Commission’s discretionary power. The Commission holds the burden of proof in bringing cases before the Court of Justice, and it must focus its efforts on issues that will bring the most benefit to EU citizens.

Together, we have managed to produce an objective report that has not been unnecessarily politicised, and the work of the committee in 2019 is very well reflected. Petitions are signs of an adult democracy. Any citizen, whatever his social status, can complain without fear about problems in the practical application of Union law. Petitions are, so to speak, a seismograph of the mood of the population and, at the same time, an instrument of control, which helps to strengthen the transparency and accountability of the institutions. It is difficult to be closer to the citizen than to the Committee on Petitions in the day-to-day running of Parliament. Parliament received 1 357 petitions in 2019. This shows that EU citizens and residents of the European Union have continued to exercise the right of petition, despite the break in the session for the European elections. The number of users who supported one or more petitions on Parliament's internet portal for petitions has actually increased compared to 2018 and has reached a total of 28 075, which is extremely pleasing. What can we do better? It is somewhat regrettable that petitioners are still not sufficiently informed of the reasons for the inadmissibility of a petition. This can be a learning process for both sides: for us, but also, above all, for the petitioner. The citizen can learn from this what he can do better next time.  That is why a continuous public debate on the Union's areas of activity is essential in order to raise public awareness of the right of petition to the European Parliament. There should therefore also be an active press and communication service and an active presence on the social media of the Committee on Petitions in order to increase the visibility of the committee's work. It is up to us to process the petitions as soon as possible and to respond appropriately. And this is especially true when the citizens have turned to the wrong place. It is not always clear to the citizen whether his problem concerns regional, national or EU level. In this case, the Committee on Petitions must better communicate and cooperate with the national authorities, petitions committees and ombudsmen. All in all, I would like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Petitions and my colleagues for the work they have done. I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Healthy New Year.

This gives enormous value to the Committee on Petitions, which is an instrument of citizen empowerment and is also a democratic instrument that defends the European values that inspire the Union. And it certainly also gives us the opportunity to learn more about the problems of citizens.  Therefore, we must strongly defend the value of the Committee on Petitions and do so without undermining any rights, giving fair audiences to citizens by virtue of the rules we have given ourselves, serving as a platform or amplifier for the voices of those who are not always heard, those who are not cared for, those who suffer injustices or inequalities by negligence or indifference. And we have to do it in a weighted way, adjusted to objective criteria and not to the albur of other tactical interests that all they can achieve is to harm European citizens.  This House has approved important measures, the result of citizen petitions.

These are therefore issues on which we must attach particular importance. We also see that 30% of petitions are still considered inadmissible. On the one hand, this shows that many citizens do not know in which areas the EU is working and that we need to provide information here. However, it also shows great confidence and hope in the European Parliament when the citizens turn to us with problems of all kinds. We must live up to this trust; we must not abuse this trust. The Committee on Petitions is a bridge between citizens and decision-makers. It would therefore be useful to involve the Committee on Petitions directly in the legislative process, so that the good knowledge of the petitions is not lost.  Furthermore, the Committee on Petitions does not deal exclusively with petitions, but also, in some cases, with European citizens' initiatives, and it is important that they are taken seriously. Collecting one million signatures from at least seven Member States is an important matter in which many citizens have expectations of the European Union.

As already mentioned, precisely our priorities on environmental matters and fundamental rights are the topics where we have received the most petitions. One word on petitions on fundamental rights: to our regret, the famous Article 51 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights says it is applicable only as regards EU law and, therefore, we are very satisfied that the report urges the Commission to take steps to ensure that the interpretation of the scope of Article 51 is as coherent and broad as possible, and recalls that the expectations of most petitioners in relation to the rights conferred on them by the Charter are high and go beyond the current scope of application.  Another key problem is the European citizens’ initiative. We know that there are very few successful petitions and that is why the latest one we discussed this Monday on the Minority Safepack was very important. However, regrettably, even successful petitions do not result in legislative proposals from the Commission. The report also mentions this problem. We call on the Commission to initiate a legislative proposal on the basis of any successful European citizens’ initiatives that are supported by the European Parliament.  To our regret, two large groups in Parliament have asked for a split vote on this proposal and this sentence, as it is very troublesome. If this statement does not make it into the report as voted on by the Committee on Petitions, this will be a big mistake.

This has already been said, but it should be reiterated: the right of petition is one of the fundamental rights of the citizens of the Union and is a key element in the empowerment of European citizenship and civil society , also organised, and for the political strengthening of Parliament within the framework of the European institutions.  One fact in this report should be underlined: in 2019, despite the coronavirus pandemic, the number of requests increased by more than 11% compared to the previous year, in matters as important as the environment, Brexit or the exercise of rights or disability.  This highlights the issues that matter and concern citizens, who are also calling for greater action by the European Union. The Commissioner said so: there are areas where the European Union has no competence, but when citizens call for action, they are also sending a political message about what the European Union would also have to start working on. And, in this regard, it seems to me that the Conference on the Future of Europe is the area for reflecting on what new powers the European Union should exercise.  Commissioner, you know this: before the pandemic, no one thought of Europe as the framework for action against public health crises, and now we have launched the Health Union under Article 168 of the Treaty. But we can go further.  The work of the Committee on Petitions denounces non-compliance and bad practices of the Member States, and in this regard we must also remind the Commission and the European Council of the obligation to respect the literality of Articles 15 and 17 of the Treaty on European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 46, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Jarosław DUDA", "mepid": "197510", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work. First of all, I would like to thank and congratulate Colleague Złotowski for preparing such a comprehensive report, in which he aptly highlighted all aspects of the Committee on Petitions' work and the challenges ahead. The Committee on Petitions is one of the few to have direct contact with citizens. Therefore, its smooth and efficient operation is crucial for the image of the European Parliament and for building trust in the European institutions. Over the past year, we have been able, in cooperation with our partners, not only to consider many petitions, but also to bring about legislative and political action.  The Committee on Petitions, listening to the voice of citizens, carefully examines all their expectations in this regard. Environmental and health issues have been particularly important over the past year. Preventing environmental pollution, reducing waste, preventing diseases associated with harmful substances contained in food, soil, air or drinking water are key issues for Europeans.  Another important issue is respect for the rights of persons with disabilities and the creation of conditions for full access by this group of citizens to inclusive education, counselling, employment, civil rights and cultural goods. The Committee on Petitions advocates the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and an effective European Disability Strategy for the coming years. I hope that, if the pandemic situation allows, we will host the fifth European Parliament of Persons with Disabilities next year.  Thanking the European Commission very much for its cooperation, I would like to ask that, in the future, the answers to the petitioners be prepared as soon as possible and, even more importantly, that they are not vague, but accurately respond to complaints and questions. I would like to support the rapporteur's recommendations for greater involvement of the communication services in promotional and information campaigns.  Finally, I would like to thank the whole Parliament (inable words) and the various political groups for their tireless work and commitment. Thank you so much!

Madam President, the Identity and Democracy Group has tabled an alternative resolution on human rights in Egypt. At the time of this resolution, we were sure that we would not find a common resolution; we knew that we would find a form of ignorance, if not contempt. Ignorance, first of all, in the face of the dangers that the two elections of President Sissi have allowed to fight. Colleagues, be certain, Egypt is doing much better with President Sissi at the helm. Remember the situation when Mr. Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood ruled the country. In fact, we have learned that the European Commission has funded associations such as the Collective against Islamophobia in France, so we are entitled to ask a question: when will the European Union finally become aware of the dangers associated with the organisation of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, as in some countries of our continent?  Ignorance, then, of what Egyptian society is. Illiteracy, extreme poverty, undermining work by some Islamic preachers are the real emergencies facing the Egyptian state. To suggest that President Sissi's obsession would be to repress human rights activists is, in my opinion, totally untrue. Finally, ignorance of the importance of Egypt in the fight against Islamism. To counter the influence of Qatar and Turkey on the Mediterranean world and on Muslims, we need to work with Cairo in confidence.

I am appalled that he officially refuses to condition the reception of a head of state on his respect for human rights.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent report Human rights are an important issue for the European Parliament. Who, if not us, should speak out for those people around the world who cannot defend themselves and stand up for their rights? However, I would also like to make it quite clear that today's debate is about a concrete initiative – the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights – where three activists have been imprisoned, are in pre-trial detention and are obviously being prevented from doing their work – in their important work for civil society, for the whole of Egypt. And it is up to us as parliamentarians to draw attention once again today to the fact that we are backing such initiatives. However, I would like to make it very clear on my group that we also see the importance of Egypt as a partner. The European Union sees Egypt as a partner, especially in the fight against terrorism. And I would also like to make this clear here: in addition to the justified critical points that previous speakers have said, and the sharpness of the resolution – this aspect is deliberately brought here – I would like to say that there are also positive aspects in cooperation with Egypt. The key lies in this partnership. However, a partnership must not be blind. We must not be blind in one eye and look at the other. That would not fit, nor does it fit the European Union, and that is why it is quite clear that the PPE-DE is calling here for human rights to be respected, for prisoners to be wrongly freed and for the rights of the people of Egypt to be safeguarded by those in power. However, I would just like to say that we, too, have similar problems within Europe and at our borders. I am thinking only of the discussions, of the demonstrations in Belarus, and I believe that it is our task and our obligation to be very precise here. What do I mean by that? Article 144, which is the basis of today's debate, refers to cases of violations of human rights. And I would like to say here on my group that the length of the resolutions and also the balance of the resolutions are of course important if we want to raise our voices together, if we want to send a strong signal here across the political groups. And that is what I would have liked from this resolution. Egypt has the potential to serve as a bridge to the Arab world and africa, and it is up to us to initiate a functioning civil society, a functioning coexistence of economic systems and, as European institutions, to continue to advance as we can. And I believe that we must focus very sharply on respect for human rights here – especially as parliamentarians, that is our obligation. However, we must not forget the balance here too. And I believe that it is highly necessary to focus on partnership in common interests in at least the same way as all the other efforts and all the other issues that have been raised today in a justified and very clear way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 57, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, overall, the EU has very good relationship with our southern neighbour, Egypt.

The fact that the director and several senior managers of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights have been arrested in Cairo are of significant concern.

Is Egypt being much stricter than other countries, or is there a fundamental rejection of the Egyptian state? Egypt opposes extremism that threatens us all – an extremism that threatens the Coptic community in Egypt. While Turkey continues to cause instability in the Middle East and beyond, Egypt is one of the few steadfast states that actually opposes Turkey's push for expansion. Egypt plays a crucial role in Libya, and it is Egyptian forces fighting the Syrian militias smuggled in by Turkey. Egypt, in particular, has inflicted deep wounds on Islamist extremism, which sows death and destruction worldwide. The Muslim Brotherhood has almost brought Egypt to its knees. The Egyptian state is resisting all these threats, while at the same time advancing progress in the fields of economy and education for its citizens, and it is forming alliances with like-minded countries in order to achieve a little more stability throughout the region. However, we are having endless discussions here in order to be able to criticise Egypt. A trial is not enough for us. We encourage opposition to the Egyptian Government, a government that is acting in our interests, in the interests of our security. And this unbroken criticism is straining our relations with Cairo, and that is certainly not in our interest. That is why we must think realistically and pragmatically. Egypt faces serious threats to its security from extremism, both internally and externally.

Arrests and prosecution of civil society organisations, and people expressing themselves on social media remain a cause for concern. In September 2020 at the 45th United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, the EU raised various human rights issues in Egypt, under item 4, including a call to release human rights defenders. The recent arrests of the director and staff members of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, the EIPR, underlined once more the worrying situation in this regard. We consider that the EIPR provides a critical service to the Egyptian people. We expressed our concern in a statement by the spokesperson of the European External Action Service on 21 November. We welcome as a first step, the release of the three EIPR staff members on 3 December, while reiterating our call for the release of Mr George Patrick Zaki, an EIPR researcher who has remained in detention since February 2020. We have also noted that the challenges mentioned take place against positive developments in social and economic rights, such as the protection of women amid the COVID pandemic, as highlighted in the latest UNDP UN Women report that shows Egypt is the best performer in the region. Further, on 25 November the Egyptian Government approved the implementing regulations of the 2019 NGO Law, which is an improvement from previous legislation and gives more predictability to charity organisations. The protection and promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law are guiding principles of our external action and policies. The new action plan on human rights and democracy 2020—2024, approved in November, reaffirms the EU’s strong commitment to further advancing universal values for all. These commitments also have a central place in the framework of our political engagement and cooperation with Egypt. This was also discussed during High Representative Borrell’s latest visit to Cairo on 3 September of this year, as well as that of the President of the European Council, Mr Michel, in November. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Gilmore, is also in regular contact with the relevant Egyptian counterparts. The EU has a clear interest in Egypt’s long—term stability and security. This can only be achieved if human rights are fully implemented and upheld.

We know from a report by Adrian Zenz that more than 500 000 people in Xinjiang have to work in the cotton industry. Production accounts for 20% of the world's cotton production. We, we in the European Parliament today, document the greatest enslavement and violation of human rights in the world at the moment. We, here in the European Parliament, are closing ranks today. For far too long, decision-makers have remained silent. I would like to apologise personally for that.  Today's resolution on the fate of the Uighurs is finally becoming a practice out of rhetoric. We have targeted sanctions against those responsible under the EU's Magnitsky Act. \"Protection of Uighurs in the EU and in third countries\" is stated in the resolution. We no longer want a summit between the European Union and China, at which human rights are not also discussed. At the end of the day, we call on the United Nations to conduct an independent fact-finding mission in China. But that is not the end of the road. In Tibet, Mongolia and Hong Kong, too, people have significant problems with the Chinese government and are fighting for freedom. We must look for partners such as Taiwan, who are also standing up for freedom under Chinese pressure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 80, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Miriam LEXMANN", "mepid": "204336", "text": "   author. – Madam President, let me begin by thanking my colleagues and all the staff for the excellent cooperation in drafting the urgency resolution. Its strong message is a testimony to the cross-party commitment to stand with the Uyghurs and all those whose human dignity and freedoms are being violated every day. Just in the recent years, the Chinese Communist Party has built an Orwellian state that has introduced mass surveillance, engaged in forced organ-harvesting from prisoners of conscience, forced sterilisation, forced labour, and has placed over one million Uyghurs in the concentration camps. It systematically destroyed thousands of churches, mosques and other places of worship and culture. It behaves with increasingly brute force across mainland China and Hong Kong, and threatens and bullies Taiwan and countries around the globe. Moreover, Cardinal Bo said rightly that ‘it is the oppression, the lies and corruption of the CCP that are responsible’ for the current pandemics. Dear colleagues, it is the right time to re-think our relationship with China, ensuring a value-based and consistent approach towards the Chinese Communist Party. We must understand that our values do not hinder our policies – but policies that ignore our values do. If the EU wants to have credibility as a global actor, it must ensure a consistent value-based foreign policy. That must mean seeing the Chinese Communist Party for what it is, while engaging positively with the Chinese people. That must mean standing with the Uyghurs, Hongkongers, Tibetans, and all those oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party. That must mean clear consequences for the suppression of human dignity and freedoms, such as imposing targeted sanctions. That must mean upholding corporate responsibility through due diligence in our supply chains and banning the import of all products made by forced labour. That must mean working closely with our democratic allies in addressing human rights violations across mainland China and Hong Kong, and coordinating our policies on sanctions, import bans and other measures to send a clear message: we will defend human dignity.

And like many in this House, I am deeply concerned about the increasingly suppressive regime in China and how many religious and ethnic minorities, in particular the Uyghurs and Kazakhs, face a violation of their human dignity, as well as a denial of their rights to freedom of speech, cultural expression and religious belief, as well as peaceful assembly. Chinese officials maintain that what they call ‘vocational training centres’ do not infringe on Uyghurs’ rights. They have refused to share information about their detention centres. Nevertheless, internal Chinese Government documents leaked in late 2019 have provided important details of how officials launched and maintained the detention camps, as do the RTE and BBC documentaries and satellite imagery. The Chinese authorities need to immediately, and unconditionally, release the Uyghur scholar and Sakharov Prize winner in 2019, Ilham Tohti. The global influence of China is clearly growing.

As HR/VP Borrell mentioned during the debate on the situation of the Uyghurs one year ago, the policies applied to Xinjiang appear disproportionate to the stated aim of fighting against terrorism and extremism. The conclusions of United Nations experts expressing serious concerns are, regretfully, still valid. During the past year, a number of reports have brought to light worrying allegations that Uyghurs and other minorities in China are subject to forced labour and forced labour transfer schemes, as well as forced sterilisation and forced birth control. They add to the gravity and magnitude of concerns we have already expressed. EU leaders raised these concerns in their meetings with Chinese leaders this year, at the EU-China Summit on 22 June and at the EU-China leaders’ meeting on 14 September. We also issued a comprehensive statement during the last UN Human Rights Council under item 4: debate on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention. We clearly highlighted the need for meaningful access to the region for independent experts. We will continue to call on China to uphold its national and international obligations and to respect human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, especially in Xinjiang and Tibet. Defending human rights and combating forced labour are priorities for the EU. As a key trading partner of the EU, China should ensure that business activities in its territory meet international standards on labour rights and responsible business conduct. We expect the Chinese authorities to implement those standards across all sectors of production and at all levels of supply chains. Responsible business practices by European companies working in China play a very important role. While the Commission is working on a legislative proposal on sustainable corporate governance, the EU already has mandatory standards in some sectors and actively promotes international guidelines. European companies are already encouraged to implement effective due diligence practices across their supply chains. The Commission and the European External Action Service will continue working with companies to underscore the importance of taking up international due diligence guidelines in all aspects, including human rights. The new EU global human rights sanctions regime, adopted on 7 December, enables the EU to forcefully stand up for human rights. It allows the EU to target human rights violations and abuses worldwide, irrespective of where they occur. The regime does not contain any listings yet.

This means that she uses the laws of her country, Iran, to defend her clients, the people of Iran, against a regime that does not feel bound by any of these laws.

Nasrin has now been 10 years in and out of prison in one of the countries with the cruellest prison conditions, amidst the raging COVID pandemic. Nasrin Sotoudeh really pays a high price for her love of the law and of the people of Iran. I’m full of admiration for this unbreakable woman and I think she rightfully deserved the Sakharov Prize from this Parliament.  As you all know, Nasrin is not the only one.

Ruhollah Zam was executed last week, while Ahmadreza Djalali is threatened with execution, and no justice has been done for the thousands of protesters in the streets of Iran last year.

Madam President, Nasrin Sotoudeh is back in prison. His crime? To have defended, as a lawyer, the rights of women, children, religious minorities, journalists, artists before the Iranian courts. The Iranian authorities sentenced her to 33 years in prison and 148 lashes for that reason. We, the European Parliament, awarded him the 2012 Sakharov Prize for his struggles. Nasrin is a particularly courageous woman who deserves our support, as she supported those who needed her. She did so at the cost of her freedom. We will continue to support her until the Iranian authorities release her. Nasrin Sotoudeh has always been committed to the death penalty not being imposed, so that it would not be implemented. Just five days ago, journalist Rouhollah Zam was executed by hanging. The decision of the Iranian Supreme Court had been taken only four days earlier, on the basis of dubious charges and forced confessions. Rouhollah Zam had been granted political asylum in France and was kidnapped on Iraqi territory to be brought to Iran. The execution of Rouhollah Zam is a flagrant violation of international law and human rights. There is also Ahmadreza Djalali, the Iranian-Swedish doctor who is a university professor in Brussels and Italy. He was charged with death threats against himself and his family in Sweden and Iran. Confessions were extorted under torture and he was sentenced to death. He's awaiting his imminent execution. We call for the urgent intervention of the European Union and member states with the Iranian authorities in order to free Ahmadreza Djalali. I have appointed three people, one imprisoned, one executed, another on death row.

This was particularly so in relation to preserving the nuclear agreement, which I agree with, and the result, of course, was a triumph for European diplomacy. The other side of the coin is the human rights record in Iran, which is not pretty – particularly the case of the 2012 Sakharov Prize winner Nasrin Sotoudeh. We have a duty to follow all laureates of this prize and to speak out when they are being persecuted. We did this in the case of Nasrin in 2018, and it is deeply regrettable that we must return to renew our call on the Iranian authorities to release her from her arbitrary detention. Today we call for the unconditional release of Nasrin Sotoudeh with renewed urgency. The people of Iran are struggling to battle the COVID—19 pandemic; prisoners – not just in Iran but around the world – are at an increased risk of infection. Nasrin unfortunately contracted the virus recently while she was granted temporary release. She was ordered to return to prison again against the advice of medical experts. Shameful – because this has the potential to be a fatal decision. I’m also dismayed by the continuously high use of capital punishment in Iran. This is not acceptable under any circumstances. Certainly a journalist should not be executed for expressing their views, and laureates should not be tortured and imprisoned for peacefully working to preserve human rights. I call on Iran to call a halt to this practice immediately. While we focus on the case of Nasrin, we must also think of all the other peaceful campaigners and activists, some of whom worked with her and who are facing a similar plight in Iran.

That is what we need to do very clearly: withdraw our investments, sanction them economically, target those responsible. It is not too late to release Nasrin Sotoudeh.

Once again, we have asked that she be released and reunited with her family.  The European Union is closely following human rights developments in Iran, and we are acutely aware of the deterioration that has occurred over the past year. Iran’s execution of dissident Ruhollah Zam last Saturday is of course deeply worrying. As noted in the statement issued by the spokesperson for the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European Union condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances. Iran continues to execute more than 200 individuals every year. We believe that it is imperative for the Iranian authorities to uphold the due process rights of accused individuals and to cease the practice of using televised confessions to establish and promote their guilt.  All individuals found to have been involved in serious human rights violations, including during the response to the November 2019 protests in Iran, should be held accountable. While we recognise that Iran continues to host hundreds of thousands of refugees, the human rights situation in Iran remains deeply concerning. The authorities’ repression of peaceful protest and other gatherings continues unabated. Such repression, the restriction of fundamental freedoms, and discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities are features of life for too many Iranian citizens. Iran also continues to hold a number of EU—Iranian dual nationals on doubtful grounds, following trials where the due process rights of the accused were not respected in full.  This includes Ahmadreza Djalali – whose situation many Members of this House are following – who remains at risk of imminent execution and whose life we ask be spared.  We regularly engage with the authorities to urge improvements in the human rights situation in Iran as part of our comprehensive policy towards Iran. This includes asking that the repression of human rights lawyers and defenders, peaceful protesters, ethnic and religious minorities cease, and that individuals detained as a result of their advocacy for universally recognised human rights be freed.  Iran should uphold its domestic and international commitments on human rights, including the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, to which it is party. We have been vocal in this demand, including at international forums such as the United Nations Human Rights Council and through public statements whenever justified.  As the EU, we will continue to call for the release of all arbitrarily detained EU-Iranian dual nationals and Iranian human rights defenders. We also call on Iran to ensure that no individual is detained arbitrarily, that those who are detained are not subject to any form of mistreatment. All detained individuals should also have timely access to a lawyer of their own and to adequate medical care. This is particularly relevant to the cases of the eight environmentalists who have been detained since January 2018. One of these individuals, Morad Tahbaz, continues to experience severe health problems.  We are encouraged by the attention paid to these issues by individual Members of the European Parliament, and we will continue with our efforts to work together with you in order to promote access to fundamental human rights in Iran and across the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 126, "date": "2020-12-17.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  I close the debate.
