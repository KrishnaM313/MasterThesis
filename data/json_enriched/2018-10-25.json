I think sometimes people might think we legislate and then forget, but actually this debate is about making sure that the legislation on medical devices is implemented in full, and on time. But the reason it has been tabled – and I thank the colleagues who have co-signed with me, we were all involved in this legislation – is that concerns are being raised about the timely implementation.  Let’s reflect on why we had to modernise this law. It was because there were scandals in the medical devices sector, some of a criminal nature, and some identifying problems with how the industry is regulated, the ‘fit-for-purpose’ of notified bodies being one particular issue. So the reason we ask this question is because those concerns on implementation are being raised, but our focus is on patient safety and making sure that there is a supply of devices that are scrutinised fully so that there is no interruption in the medical care and attention that our patients receive.  Can I say that I have a friend going in next week for a knee operation. They are not worried about the gadget, or the knee, because they presume it is going to be safe and effective, and that they will come out skipping, and I hope they will. They are worried just about the operation. I think when patients go into hospital and have a procedure involving a medical device they presume that the medical device is certified and fit for purpose – and we have to give them that guarantee, and that’s the purpose of our question to you this morning.  We are concerned about the Commission’s coordination. There are three different, if you like, DGs of the Commission involved in this, so how is that working, and is it effective? And also, when we were debating this legislation, Brexit wasn’t a reality. It now is, and we have to take account of the implications and consequences of Brexit on the medical device legislation and on the supply of devices that keep our patients safe.  One of the issues that has been raised with us is the expertise available both perhaps within the Commission itself, but also within Member States and within notified bodies, and of the notified bodies that currently operate. I would like the Commission to clarify how many have actually looked for re-designation, as is required under this legislation. I understand it takes 18 months to re-designate a notified body, and if many have not applied at this stage, then we need to know that they will immediately and that they will be certified in time to meet the strict requirements of this legislation.  Lastly, are Member States doing enough? Because they are the ones who are perhaps raising this issue with us as well as the industry, and what do they need to do to make sure that they get this in place in their Member State and on time? Thank you, Commissioner, for taking the question.

I know this is an extremely important issue. We all want the continuous availability of safe and innovative medical devices and, of course, for this we need a smooth transition to the new system. Let me underline, at the very beginning, that so far all relevant legal deadlines established by the regulations have been met. Work is advancing and progressing according to the plans. This was the case for the establishment of the governance structure; the launch of the designation code and procedure for notified bodies; and the delivery of the new plan for the implementation of the new medical devices database (EUDAMED). We had already prepared for the future even before the regulations were adopted. We established effective cooperation with the national competent authorities for medical devices. Together with them, we have elaborated a roadmap of activities to be undertaken during the transitional period. Work is on track to implement the roadmap, again together with the expert groups. We are in continuous dialogue with the notified bodies, industry and all other relevant stakeholders.  As was said in the speech by Ms McGuinness, there are three directorates—general cooperating and sharing responsibilities. We are putting a lot of human resources on this file. But let me assure you, we have a very common understanding of the topic and of the issues between our Commission services. Also, Member States have mobilised their resources to contribute to the implementation process and Member States are fully committed, in the form of the competent authorities for medical devices, to preparing for the future. We are aware that we need enough notified bodies by the end of the transition period. This is a key precondition for the smooth transition. The Commission has set up the entire legal and technical infrastructure to allow for the designation procedure to start as soon as possible. Again, I want to underline that we have been ready from the very first legal date, which was 27 December last year. The number of applications received so far shows that the designation procedure is overall on track.  So far, there have been no delays in assessing the applications of notified bodies. But of course we should not only look at the numbers. The top priority is patient safety. So we should remember that the lack of effective control of the notified bodies under the old system was one of the main reasons to review the medical devices framework. A large share of the responsibility now lies with the notified bodies themselves, as well as with the operators. It is also up to them to prepare and prove their fitness under the revised framework.  A few words on Brexit as it is an extremely important issue. As for all other sectors, this is also a challenge for the medical devices industry. So far, four notified bodies have been established in the UK. In its public notice of January this year, the Commission advised stakeholders to take all necessary measures because, as we all know, a certificate issued by UK notified bodies will no longer be valid as from 29 March next year.  Many other sectors, of course, face the same situation, but, as far as we know, the UK notified bodies and industry associations have been extremely active in preparing for Brexit ahead of time. Four notified bodies have already taken the initiative to adapt to the post—Brexit scenario. Again, we should not rest on our laurels, but for now, we see that they were very proactive and active. So let me conclude by saying that we are on track. There are no deviations from the requirements and deadlines established by Parliament and the Council. So for now, there is no reason to ring the alarm bell. But of course there is still a lot of work ahead of us: first to ensure the transition to the new system but also the availability of devices over the next few years. Therefore, we in the Commission, together we will monitor the implementation process in very close and very constant cooperation with the national competent authorities, the Member States of course, and all other stakeholders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Biljana BORZAN", "mepid": "112748", "text": "  On behalf of club S&amp;D. – Madam Chairman, the purpose of the Regulation on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices is to provide European patients with access to safe and efficient devices, and to regain confidence in European production in the wake of the artificial hips and breast implants scandal. The Commission published the initial proposal back in 2012, the trilogues were completed in 2016. Regulations came into force in 2017, with a transition period of three years for medical devices and five years for in vitro diagnostic devices. Esteemed colleagues, we should bear in mind that these new rules have been worked on for as many as six years. Today we are discussing problems in implementing the new rules, because it may happen that by the time the system is starting to apply, the system will not be ready and that the supply of medical devices is suspended. The biggest problem is the adaptation of the named bodies, on which the entire system of placing the device on the market is based. These authorities assess whether medical and in vitro devices meet specifications and regulations before they enter sale and use. The process of ratifying them runs much slower than it should, according to data from May this year, of the 59 existing named bodies, only 30 have initiated the recertification process, and this process takes 18 months.  Unless something changes, it is possible that in May 2020, when the transition period ends, there will be a severe shortage of certification capacities. The situation, of course, is further complicated by Brexit, as a significant number of certifications are made in the UK for the European Union market. But this is not the only problem - the Commission published only a few of the required 18 implementing acts, at the time of writing this oral question. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the EUDAMED system, which is essential for the functioning of the system, will be operational on time. Madam Commissioner, I was pleased to hear your optimistic announcements today and I sincerely hope that all that you have said and will be applied, however understand our concerns as well. I must say that I am not inclined to reopen regulations in order to extend the deadlines and transition period. We should bear in mind that work on these laws started back in 2012 and that Parliament has already agreed to extend the deadlines to trilogues. Our citizens deserve the highest quality service and therefore it is very difficult to explain why this has been going on for so long and I hope that everything that has been said by the Commission today will be put into practice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Gesine MEISSNER", "mepid": "96870", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ALDE Group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. It's almost like a family reunion after the very long and tough negotiations we've been through to get it all on its way. It was a very complicated procedure with very, very many pages – 700 pages, I believe, only in documents from the Council. So it was complicated. The trigger was , as my colleague McGuinness has just said and my other colleague also mentioned – the scandal over breast implants. It was now about patient safety. That is why I think it is a pity that the public gallery is still so empty. It would be nice if a great many people here saw what we are doing well in Europe to ensure patient safety. It was clear from the outset, when we had finished the very difficult negotiations, that the Commission is now in the process of laying the groundwork for the implementation of this regulation. What is it all about? We all know this here, but the medical devices are all sorts of things, from the patch to the scalpel, it is about the operating table, the hospital bed, the artificial hip and the knee joint as well as the pacemaker. And all this is certified in the EU on a decentralised basis through the so-called 'named bodies'. In Germany, what surprises many is even the TÜV, which is actually responsible for road traffic, but also performs these certifications. In 2013 we had 87 notified bodies in the EU, in 2018 only 59. So that was less than more, and seven of them are in the UK. That is why we are very concerned about this. These notified bodies play a very important role. You must certify medical devices. 30 to 45% of medical devices on the market are certified there, and this can be even higher due to specialisation. In the orthopaedic area, for hip or knee joints, it is as much as 70% who are certified there, which is actually a much larger proportion. We need a lot of this, and the declining number of notified bodies and the increasing number of medical devices in the EU are already pushing the existing notified bodies to their capacity limits – I repeat: fewer have become so. There are also new problems. I would like to mention four points. One is that there are real challenges from Brexit, because with Brexit - if it comes, I still hope it won't come - a few jobs will be lost in March 2019 - seven, I've already said it. And then it is to be expected that the number of notified bodies in the other Member States will increase considerably. This is, of course, something that then clearly has capacity limits. In addition, the allowances issued in the United Kingdom would lose their validity – there was a Note from the Commission – and the equipment would then either have to be re-certified in the other 27 Member States, in one of the already overburdened bodies, or they would have to be re-certified, or a post would have to be moved from the UK to the EU, which is certainly hardly feasible by March 2019. The third point is that all medical devices on the market must be certified according to the new regulation by May 2020. In our view, the process of naming the notified bodies, the audit, is not fast enough. Commissioner, you said that the Commission is fully on schedule. We are afraid that it might not be quite the case. After all, manufacturers cannot start certifying their medical devices until the notified bodies are designated in accordance with the new Medical Devices Ordinance. At present, there is not a single notified body that has really been designated. Fourthly, the date of application of the new Medical Devices Ordinance in May 2020 will also result in a higher workload for notified bodies, as more medical devices – scalpel, surgical lamp and so on – will require a certificate than before, and on the other hand, a flood of new certifications is to be expected. It is foreseeable that, with the date of application of the regulation, not all the products currently in use will have a certificate, and thus they would not be usable, and patient care would indeed be at risk. This also puts us at risk of making patient care really difficult after May 2020 and that we will no longer be able to guarantee this. Hip joints with a certificate from the UK, for example, may not be able to be completed in time for the EU 27 Be certified by March 2019, basic surgical equipment such as a scalpel or an operating lamp, which currently do not have a certificate and just need one from May 2020, may not yet be certified and therefore not available due to a lack of capacity. That is why it is - I have heard, Commissioner, what you have said. But do you not really believe – as my colleague Mrs Borzan has just said – that it might be wise to extend the application date by one or two years, so that we are on the safe side and do not risk bottlenecks in patient care?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "  on the part of the GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of the Regulation on medical devices and in vitro medical devices has many contexts. Unfortunately, both on the part of producers, notified bodies and patients, there are now more questions than answers, and I must admit that many of their concerns are entirely appropriate. It is already clear that the new legislation entails an undesirable reduction in the number of notified bodies. This will mean hampering the entry of new technologies as well as limiting the availability of older resources. E.g. in the Czech Republic, from which I come, we have only two notified bodies left and recently there were five more. Austria no longer has either. The remaining notified bodies are already drowning in work and applications, and it is not enough to handle them, let alone take new clients from countries where there is no longer a notified body, thereby slowly being pushed out of the market by medical device manufacturers from these countries. Of the implemented and delegated acts, only one has been adopted, as far as I know, and even if i accidentally miss one, at this stage it is an absolutely scandalous record. Especially when the first regulation fully enters into force as early as May 2020. Before notification can be made to the NANDO database, it is essential to publish on the website the notification procedure of each Member State. Not a single notification procedure was published there before the summer. Overall, there is a slowdown at European level and the transitional period for the Medical Devices Regulation ceases to seem sufficient. If the situation is not resolved, patients will feel the results. Not to mention that up to 40% of current European certificates are from Britain. However, according to explanatory documents from the European Commission, the EU will lose out entirely with Brexit. Moreover, it is estimated that around half of the authorised representatives in the medical devices sector are based in Britain. Some operators have already announced that they will move their headquarters to the EU, but they will certainly not all do so. For these reasons, the entry of funds into the market will slow down greatly. I therefore have three sub-questions: Firstly, the newly tightened requirements of the Medical Devices Regulation are based on evidence-based principles and evidence based on scientifically correctly interpreted facts. I would therefore like to hear some evidence from the European Commission for its current calm. Do the Representatives of the European Commission consider that the implementation of both regulations is being successfully implemented according to a timetable and therefore there will be no major problems on the market after May 2020? Can the European Commission guarantee that more medical devices will not be transiently removed from the market due to the lack of notified bodies and their capacities? Does the European Commission have any specific studies or in-depth assessments drawn up on this conclusion, and what are the specific findings? What statistics can the European Commission support these conclusions? Are these statistics publicly available? Secondly, the narrow throat for the entry of medical devices into the market is currently the capacity of notified bodies. Is it true, as we often hear here in the kuloárs, that the European Commission prefers to remove all smaller notified bodies in order to reduce their number to around 10 and focus on the few? Can you substantiate future capacity analyses? Before the summer, there were 59 notified bodies under the old legislation, so how much is optimal and sufficient to ensure the functioning of the market, according to the European Commission? Thirdly, harmonised standards and common specifications are one of the cornerstones of the Medical Devices Regulation. As regards standards and their harmonisation to the Medical Devices Regulation, a considerable delay is already planned. Some important standards, such as the biocompatibility assessment, will not be harmonised until May 2024, four years after the first Regulation takes effect. Why did this happen and what is the plan to deal with this delay? I firmly believe, Commissioner, that today you have a unique opportunity to disprove not only my doubts about your inaction or the Commission's inaction, but above all the doubts of the people who are following this point, states that fear that they will not have enough quality and registered medical devices, and patients who are desperately complaining that they do not know how the child of the legislation we have here will work after 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  Ms. Konen and Ms. Borzan, would you please put on your headphones?

Reform was therefore needed; new regulations have been passed which, 18 months later, do not solve anything, because given the cumbersome European machine, as usual, the consequences are seen, namely that only 30% of the existing notified bodies would have asked for their validation. The fact is that many were British. The deficiencies of these organizations are very worrying, both in terms of their number and the quality of the experts who make them up, but also in terms of the length of the approval processes. The health of all Europeans is at stake, as medical devices range from sparadrap to extracorporeal circulation, from glasses to hip replacements; diagnostic devices are fundamental in daily practice, but also for medium- and long-term prevention. This delay also weighs heavily on many start-ups or large innovative companies, especially in France where self-control is growing very rapidly. Commissioner, you are telling us that everything is taking place, but it is clear that there is a serious delay. This, to say the least, further aggravates the climate of mistrust after the many scandals already old. Should we fear a monopoly of a few certification giants?

In a broader sense, this is certainly also linked to the Medical Devices Ordinance. Seriously, however, I believe that what has already been put forward, Commissioner, is really very important, because there are currently around 500 000 medical devices on the market in the European Union. These products must meet the new requirements for patient safety. But they must, in any case, be available in high security for the people who need to get these products directly – even now and in the months to come. That is why the fact that we have this delay in these bodies is simply a major problem for patients in the European Union who are waiting for a product today. Against this background, I would simply like to ask you to do everything possible to increase the number of notified bodies within a framework that allows us to apply the new Medical Devices Regulation as quickly as possible. Mrs McGuinness, who has worked heavily on this dossier, has already pointed this out. There is still a lack of implementing acts that are binding for certification. I believe that you all understand that the companies that manufacture these products can, of course, only adapt to the new rules if they know with an appropriate lead time what requirements they have to meet in detail. It is now clear to me, of course, that it may well also be the case that the Member States share responsibility for this. There is no question about that. But in the end, it does little to help companies if we, as politicians, shift the blame back and forth between the levels of government. Companies need legal certainty and, as far as I know, they also want to implement the requirements of the new Medical Devices Regulation. That is why it is essential to use today's debate to work with the European Commission to find solutions to ensure that companies that produce vital products for patient safety in Europe – but also for patient health – have the opportunity to do so legally in the coming months.

And then everything crashed anyway, because there was no string to the snooch. Elsewhere, in other countries, still then on the normal as far as the West, there were sages sitting on the rope to the snooch and the rope to the snooch was always there. And we were not there. And now, too, we have had a wealth of medical articles, no one lacked them, well, the European Union has decided to regulate this, and now we will worry about whether we will work with all this, whether we are not allowed to do everything, because we have three directorates that do not know how they will cooperate with each other, so maybe we will appoint a fourth to coordinate their action, and then a fifth, which will deal with their unification.

However, new regulations on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices approved in 2016 help ensure that all medical devices are safe and function well. This applies to contact lenses, X-rays, breast implants, artificial joints, etc. To this end, the new rules improve market surveillance and traceability and introduce stricter controls on medical devices. I believe, whether medical devices, cars or other products, there is a need to ensure that we are truly supervised in the interests of our citizens. And from these new rules, we should promise greater transparency, legal certainty for producers and importers, strengthening international competitiveness, as well as new innovations in this strategic sector.  However, already during the three-year transitional period ending in May 2020, it is already showing that the application of the Regulation on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices is experiencing problems and some elements of the new system are indeed failing to prepare optimally. Much has already been said about this, e.g. the problematic launch of the eudamed database, which should integrate different electronic systems. The proper functioning of this database is very important because it aims to improve access to information for the public, as well as healthcare professionals, in order, for example, to avoid multiple reporting requirements and to also streamline or facilitate the flow of information between economic operators. I would therefore like to ask the Commission, Commissioner, whether the Commission is really convinced that this database will work, whether it has created the necessary conditions for this, and whether this database will serve the purpose I have set out. This is especially for healthcare professionals, but also, of course, for citizens who need to know if, for example, their particular implant will be compatible with the passage of a scanner at the airport.  Another problem worthy of mention is the insufficient number of notified bodies responsible for the certification of medical devices. The Commission should therefore immediately start addressing this situation in order to avoid disruption of the supply of important medical devices to the market. I also expect the Commission to improve coordination between the three Directorates-General concerned in order to receive the necessary administrative support for the new system.

It is therefore important to highlight the work done in the European Parliament on this matter, which has given rise to several proposals to improve the functioning, reliability and safety of these devices. It is certain that some Member States have reacted less enthusiastically to the definition of shared regulatory frameworks because, in fact, there is a legislative reserve in health matters. However, the committed work of the European Commission and the European Parliament in dialogue, which is always fundamental with the Member States, has made it possible to take significant steps in cooperation in areas of health quality promotion, which have, as is the case, a clearly cross-border dimension. Strengthening the regulation of in vitro diagnostic medical devices to ensure tests as important as pregnancy tests or blood tests is accurate, needs to be accurate and reliable and is an example where cooperation between Member States is important and needs to be further strengthened. The regulatory framework which entered into force on 25 May 2017, with a transition period of 3 and 5 years respectively, ensures a good quality of these devices and the consequent protection of patients. However, in this period of transposition, difficulties in implementing the system have been identified, in particular in the operationalisation of collaboration between Member States and European bodies. The issue of medical device certification in the UK is also relevant, as, after leaving the European Union, all notified bodies based in the UK will no longer be able to carry out conformity assessments in line with European legislation.

I think it’s also true to say that, if there was a scandal tomorrow on the medical devices industry, this Chamber would be full, so we need to understand that. We’ve lived through a really bad experience and the reputable industry suffered, while the rogues perhaps were not penalised sufficiently. So let me just put that down as a marker.  I want to respond in particular to the answers you’ve given us, Commissioner. I applaud your optimism. I’m quoting my notes here – we’re on track, there’s no delay, there are no alarm bells – and, as Commissioner, you need to show that confidence. But that is not what we are hearing. I’m not raising an alarm bell, but I am raising concerns that I am hearing from regulators, from patient groups and from industry about whether we can implement in full and on time. Like others. I’m not calling for any delays in implementation. I think that would be a really bad signal to our citizens because it took us a long time to get to this place. But I want to make sure that we will actually do that: implement in full and on time. So, I do need you to come back to some of those questions and give me more assurances that we are on track and that there are no delays. Some colleagues raised the issue of the reduction in the numbers of notified bodies. These are the regulators, if you like, that work with industry to make sure products are safe. Let’s remind ourselves of the facts: Before we started on this process of updating our legislation, there were 80 notified bodies across the European Union. When we sent in the auditors, we found that many were not fit for purpose and that there are only 59 of that 80 still operating. That should be an alarm bell. We hope that those 59 are all fit for purpose, that they will apply for re-designation and that it happens on time.  Commissioner, I want to speak about Brexit because I think you need to give us more detail. For example, many would believe that, because we will hopefully have a withdrawal agreement, there will be a transition or implementation period and that nothing will change around the medical devices sector until the end of that period. But, as I heard from you, that is not the case, so please clarify when the change comes. Is it at the end of March or at the end of the transition? The second question – and perhaps the more pertinent one – is that the UK is a major player in this industry and also has many notified bodies. More detail please on what those notified bodies, that are located in the United Kingdom, are doing so that they can continue their work because I fear, if they left the stage, then we do have an alarm bell and we will be ringing it.

As a house, we are definitely sticking to this goal. The scandals of faulty breast implants or hip joints have shown just how important this is. Only we at European level can set common standards, because medical devices are also traded in the European internal market and cross borders. This is also shown very clearly by the example of Brexit, our priority has always been patient safety in all the legislation, which has unfortunately dragged on for a very long time. The two texts take account of this patient safety. They increase the requirements for medical product manufacturers or monitoring associations such as TÜV or Dekra. In the new regulation, we in parliament have ensured, among other things, that manufacturers of medical products will need adequate insurance in future, so that patients are at least financially protected in the event of damage. However, it is not acceptable that, just before the date of implementation, we have to state that important implementing acts are not yet on the table and that important measures that lead to improving patient safety have not actually been implemented. I do not think that the necessary elements of the system should suddenly be prepared just before the regulation enters into force. In particular, and my fellow Members have already rightly stated this, there is the problem of the timely designation of notified bodies, the notified bodies. That is the core element of the regulation. For me, therefore, it must be made quite clear here that this must definitely be implemented. It cannot be the solution to postpone the date of application of this regulation, which we have been going through for so long, including with the Council. It is important to ensure that the application period begins in May 2020. The Commissioner's response to the notified bodies is not enough for me.

So, we're not talking about a ballad. It's about patient safety. I can understand that the Commission is facing a new challenge which needs qualified personnel, that we are also faced with the Brexit situation and that, indeed, much of these assessments and these experts came from the United Kingdom.  I therefore call for the necessary measures to be taken to implement it. We're talking—as I say—about patient safety. A regulation, moreover, which is a part of security as an objective but perhaps suffers from the necessary lack of ambition. Efficiency would even need to be considered, because ideally we had a centralised authorisation system in the European Union for this type of device, which ensured safety and efficiency.  Today we talk about security as a first step; we'll have to keep talking about efficiency.

What does this internal report say? That joint evaluations — you know that there were 78 certification bodies and now it is thought that there will be only 53 — show that there are recurring and persistent problems with the way notified organizations work and their ability to meet the designation requirements of the guidelines: lack of independence, impartiality of staff of notified agencies , insufficient evidence to justify staff qualification and assignment to specific compliance assessment functions and to achieve far from optimal compliance assessments for medical devices.  So it is your internal report that shows that certification bodies are private bodies and from the moment they are private, they are judges and parties, and at the same time they do not have the qualification at the expert level. You're the one who's saying it! So when we're going to have implants — you see, things that are inside the body — and if there are no good epidemiologists, if there are no qualified staff to evaluate clinical studies, to analyze the impact of metals at the level, for example, of bones and blood, which has happened for hip replacements, then we are going to face health scandals.  To cite just one example: during the PIP prosthetics scandal in France, the German body T-V went to check them and they did not see that the building blocks of these prostheses were not compliant. As for ASR hip replacements, they were marketed by Johnson and Johnson from 2003 to 2010. 93,000 people worldwide, including more than 100 in France, have had these prostheses. It was not the notification agencies that reported the problem: it was only because the United States banned them, and then Australia, that France ended up banning them as well. You can see that we are not up to the challenge. On pacemakers and the rest there will also be scandals because our system does not work as it is. We were told: no centralized body, because we have to encourage innovation. But innovation at the expense of patient safety is not acceptable. We must therefore consider a centralised body under the aegis of the European Commission which specifically analyses the effectiveness and safety of the devices.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Maria GRAPINI", "mepid": "124785", "text": "   – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate shows that we still have a lot to do in this area and we need to start from the safety and security of patients, as has been very much stressed here.

First, many of you said that I am optimistic and calm. I would rather put it in other words: Iʼm realistic and confident. It does not mean that we are not monitoring proactively everything that is going on, that we are not watching the process. But for now, we are in the timeline, we are on track and in the timeline, and this is the most important thing. I would also like to underline that with this regulation, European citizens – EU citizens – will receive the most reliable, the most innovative and the safest healthcare in the world. This is the aim of this legislation. This is why we doing this, for the safety of our citizens. Let me refer to a few points that you raised. First, on the number of notified bodies. For now, we have 60 of them and 34 applications, so more than half have been received by the Commission. There have been no delays so far in the assessment of notified bodies that have been submitted to us. According to our data, the first notified bodies might be available even before the end of this year, so a few months in advance of the timeline. As for the transition period for this directive (not Brexit), in order to smooth the transition, the two regulations foresee a specific exemption mechanism – of course under certain conditions, namely the extension of the validity of the old certificates and the exemption of certain devices from the new, more strict clinical investigation requirements. Those exemptions and those applications may end even in May 2024, so we have some exemptions in the regulation. Brexit: an extremely important topic. You mentioned the transition period, but of course the transition period for Brexit is much more general and much broader than only the medical devices industry. It applies to all of the industrial sectors, and of course if any transition period for general transition periods is agreed, then it will also apply for this industrial sector. But according to our information, the four UK notified bodies have already taken initiatives, as I said before, to adapt to the post-Brexit scenario. The largest UK-notified body, BSI, is in the process of new designation in the Netherlands; this is expected to be completed in November. Another – SGS – already has local offices in Finland and Belgium, which could inherit certificates transferred from the UK. The two other notified bodies – UL and LRQA – have approached the same national authorities for a possible application, according to our information. So this is what the UK-notified bodies are doing. But of course, if any additional transitional period is agreed, then perhaps we might have some more time beyond 29 March. There was also a question on the database. Work has so far been advancing, and again – not optimistically but realistically – we are in the timeframe. According to our plans, a first release of the plan for the implementation of the functional specification was accomplished by the legal deadline foreseen of 26 May this year, and the draft functional specification I expect to be ready by the end of this month (in one week). Again, here also we are in the timeframe. But I want to assure you, as I said a few sentences ago, that we are proactively monitoring the situation. I know that in some Member States there are some problems with the notified bodies, and I also practically discuss it with ministers and the governments of those countries, but for now we are on track and we are doing our best to face this challenge, but also to implement the new legal framework in a successful and timely manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  The agenda calls for the brief presentation of Ismail Ertug's report on the establishment of the infrastructure needed for the use of alternative fuels in the European Union: the time for action (2018/2023 (INI)) (A8-0279/2018).", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Ismail ERTUG", "mepid": "96842", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done.  Together we now have a major task ahead of us as the European Union, which is to build infrastructures for alternative fuels. These infrastructures, which are a key element for the mobility revolution that we all want to tackle, together with the legislation on CO2 and European battery cell production. The citizens of Europe must be able to be sure that they can reach their destination safely, even with battery-powered vehicles or hydrogen-powered vehicles – just as they are today with their petrol or diesel cars.  The European Commission originally wanted to build 800,000 charging stations across Europe by 2025. Today we have just over 100 000, and hydrogen filling stations are not even included in Directive 2014/94, the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive. I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation. I believe that we have prepared a very promising report. In it, we call for cofinancing of this infrastructure with about 10% public participation and the remaining sum to be raised by the industries involved. We are also asking for EUR 2.5 billion to build this infrastructure, and we believe that this must be made available. That is more than three times as much as the Commission has cautiously recommended with its 800 million. We also call for each Member State to fulfil its own infrastructure objectives. At this point, I would like to mention once again – and there is also a criticism of the European Commission: the national framework plans, which were just five or four years ago being raised by industry and various Member States that desperately wanted to destroy it, have proved to be a weak instrument. They have done almost nothing. We have always said – even as a Parliament with a large majority here – that we are in favour of technology neutrality. If we invoke technological neutrality, then we must also – in my opinion – promote the expansion not only of electric charging stations, but also of hydrogen charging stations and filling stations. This is essential.  It is also essential that we also improve so-called sectoral coupling. In other words, the interplay of the energy sector with the mobility sector. Member States are also required to make more climate-friendly fuels, such as electricity or green hydrogen, tax-friendly than diesel or petrol. We also call for greater decarbonisation of the shipping sector. I think we have seen this happen to all of us before, that the citizens immediately ask us, in relation to this debate on driving bans and the like, why we are so focused on the car, when these very big ships are travelling in the world rather dirty. I must agree with those who are talking to us about this and call on the Commission to finally introduce a system here too that, for example.B anchoring ships, are supplied with electricity from land and that dirty diesel engines are not allowed to enter ports.  That is shortly the paper that we have prepared here in the European Parliament.

And if anyone wanted to leave Athens to Thessaloniki, which is about five hundred kilometers, they have to be sure that they will find somewhere to recharge the car battery, otherwise they will stay and stop. You understand, then, that it is quite right to move on to new technologies, but that requires infrastructure. And in order to become infrastructure, investment must be made.

We welcome the constant support of this House to make this happen. Our action plan adopted in November last year gives a very clear picture of the investment gap as well as of the need for improved coordination both in the public and private sector in this respect. As regards the report’s call for quickly reviewing the directive, for now, the Commission is preparing to launch a formal ex-post evaluation of the directive. In that context, we will also consider the need for legislative follow-up action on issues that are important for alternative fuels infrastructure but which are not regulated under this directive. For example, recharging related services – such as location information, payment, vehicles to greet services – are very important to make recharging alternative fuel as easy as with conventional ones. We think that with reviewing the directive before the evaluation is concluded would be premature now. The directive itself foresees a possible review of the legislative framework in place by the end of 2020 at the earliest. Moreover, the directive has just been transposed into the legal systems and national laws in the Member States. The Commission has been – and we are still – closely following the implementation, and we are taking the necessary legal action through enforcement, through infringements, of course. In parallel to this evaluation process, we will continue supporting and facilitating the process of better collaboration and good practice sharing. While we see, of course, that national policy frameworks have their shortcomings, we also see on the other hand that they have acted in many Member States as a catalyst of development in this field. The Commission also agrees with the report’s conclusion – and some of you also mentioned that – that we need to mobilise additional finance, particularly from the private sector. We had a very good response to our current approach to blending grants with loans under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), especially for projects in the area of alternative fuels. The Commission is therefore in the process of establishing a blending facility under the Connecting Europe facility. It will make EU financing accessible on a flexible first-come, first-assessed basis. When the project reaches sufficient maturity, the assessment of the project will always take place according, of course, to the legal basis of their respective funding programmes, whether it is the Connecting Europe Facility, FCO, Future Invest EU. It is in our best interests to have a full pipeline of mature projects with a real market impact but of course without market distortions.  Finally, the Commission very much welcomes the positive reception of the European battery alliance that we proposed and the joint undertaking on fuel cells and hydrogen. It is clear that we need a level playing field where all alternative fuels can compete to the best effect that we want to achieve. Thank you very much.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The global economy has been in disarray. The US is dismantling the order that it itself built after World War II, and if it goes after Trump, the law of the strongest should apply in the future. But Trump is not the only factor in the global economy. We are dealing with several fundamental trends. In the past, firstly, the quality of international economic relations has changed: trade in finished products is no longer dominated, but trade in international value chains. Secondly, globalisation not only leads to greater prosperity overall, but also to losers – regionally, sectorally, and also in relation to individual groups of people. Incidentally, this fact is also one, but by no means the sole cause, of the rising nationalism in, for example, in the United States and the EU. Thirdly, the weights of the individual states are shifting considerably. China is the rising force, and there is no doubt that the global economic center is shifting to East Asia. The relative weight of the US and the EU is decreasing in a mirror image. It is becoming clear that China will replace the US as the dominant economic power in the coming decades. This will go hand in hand with China's attempt to reorganise the basic rules of the world economy according to its interests. Fourthly, the existing multilateral world order is under increasing pressure. The WTO is currently unable to structure world trade. There are also other policy changes. At the same time, other global problems are becoming acute. I will mention climate change, the increase in military conflicts, the increase in migration worldwide, poverty and malnutrition of several hundred million people. That is why economic globalisation in the 21st century must also contribute to achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. It is not enough for the EU to develop a strategy in response to Trump that merely seeks to secure rules-based world trade through bilateral agreements with as many partners as possible. We need a more complex response, in which advocating for the rules-based world economy is an important but only one element. Internally, the first thing to do is to strengthen our own internal market and to counter nationalism. The EU must support European regions and people in global structural change. Key words here are comprehensive reform and strengthening of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the use of structural policies to strengthen competitiveness and innovation – with particular attention to small and medium-sized enterprises – support for employment through training, the development of trade defence instruments or even targeted investment screening. Externally, we should focus more efforts on finding or helping to develop new powerful allies. I am referring in particular to economic relations with the African countries, but also with the successor states of the former Soviet Union, including Russia. However, our foreign economic policy must also be serious about the postulate of value-based trade. Trade not only serves to increase economic profit opportunities, but also to help improve working conditions. Here, ratification and compliance with the ILO core labour standard are minimum conditions and must help to achieve the sustainable development goals. Social, labour and environmental dumping must not be a means of achieving international competitive advantages. This not only undermines popular acceptance, but simply destroys our natural livelihoods. That is why we Social Democrats keep insisting that trade agreements contain comprehensive and enforceable sustainability chapters. The refusal of the Commission and some Member States to take this issue seriously is, in my view, an expression of inability to look for the future. A modern global economic strategy must be more than adherence to rules-based world trade. We also need answers to the power-political challenges and we must always see world trade as an instrument for enforcing sustainability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 1, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 36, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Laima Liucija ANDRIKIENĖ", "mepid": "28276", "text": "   – Madam President, first I want to congratulate our rapporteur for his work on this report.

The rules and values-based international trading order is facing the deepest crisis since the end of the Second World War. The rules at the core of the international trading system are increasingly being challenged by some – even major – global players. The Commission totally subscribes to the report’s recommendation that we should avoid resorting to protectionism. Protectionism is an easy answer to common fears, as we all know, but it has always come with often catastrophic consequences in the longer term. The Commission also concurs that itʼs vitally important to preserve the multilateral world economic order, to ensure that it remains rule- and value-based. This is why the EU is a leading advocate of the rule- and value-based international trade system – of course, with the World Trade Organization at its centre – while acknowledging that these rules need to be updated. This report also rightly underlines the importance of promoting sustainable development with our trade policy. This is what the EU does with the chapters on trade and sustainable development in our free trade agreements. These chapters are designed to make sure that trade policy goes hand in hand with high labour and environmental standards and with the promotion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and other trade and investment practices supporting sustainable development. As announced by my colleague, Commissioner Malmström, in her 15—point action plan to make the EU trade and sustainable development chapter more effective, the Commission’s aims are to ensure that countries comply with the commitments to more assertive enforcement; to facilitate the monitoring role of social partners and civil society; and to make EU resources available to support implementation of the sustainable development chapters in trade agreements. Let me now turn your attention to two countries that I think are extremely important in this respect: Cambodia and Myanmar. Both of those countries benefit from the Everything But Arms arrangement, which guarantees completely tariff—free access to the European market for all export goods except for weapons and ammunition. However, this access is not without conditions, and in the case of Myanmar, the Commission will soon send a high-level EU mission there to assess the situation on the ground. This mission has to be seen within the framework of the possible withdrawal of those preferences. With Cambodia, we are even a step further in the process. Without clear and evident improvements on the ground, the process will result in the suspension of the trade preferences that Cambodia currently enjoys. The Commission also has other concrete trade measures in place that support sustainable development: the Conflict Minerals Regulation; the Fair and Ethical Trade Award; and EU support for responsible business conduct. EU values are, furthermore, promoted through an updated regulation preventing the export of goods that could be used for capital punishment or torture. So let me conclude by saying that the Commission will, of course, take your valuable recommendations into consideration for our future work on trade policy. In line with your request, the Commission will continue to work to make sure that globalisation helps bring more sustainable, more inclusive growth while at the same time defending the rules and values that the international trading order is based on.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Agnes JONGERIUS", "mepid": "125021", "text": "  Written. – Globalisation brings new challenges, but also uncertainties.

Firstly, a social perspective - almost 70% of the citizens of the European Union say that their countries are severely and very badly affected by corruption. Then, from an economic perspective - because between 700 and 1 800 billion euros is the value of money laundered worldwide. Unfortunately, we do not have a figure at European Union level. Between 2 and 5 % of the gross global product is money laundered. And three, from a political perspective - because at European level, at the moment, there is no political will in any Member State of the European Union that the issue of recovery of illegal assets taken out of the European Union is solved. There is no such political will and it is very easy to understand, because in many Member States many politicians have built their political careers through money from illegal businesses, have reached very important positions in those states and have laundered this provenance of money, winning some choices through the democratic mechanisms that we know, and now they control governments, they control parliaments , pass laws that protect corruption in Member States of the European Union. In this context, the question that the nearly 70% of the citizens of the European Union ask us is: is the European Union fighting corruption? Does the European Union have real, effective, concrete policies to stop this phenomenon of corruption? In this report we are coming to complement steps already taken by the European Union and we are proposing some concrete things. Firstly, we propose that at European Union level there should be a risk map of the laws of the Member States of those 'escapes' from national laws - I say \"escapes\" in quotation marks for them are often well thought out - whereby money is taken out of the European Union in different countries. Secondly, we are asking for an interconnected database or databases with data collected in a standardised manner, real communication between the Member States of the European Union, so that we know in real time information from all these Member States. We have states in the European Union where there are two or three offices for the recovery of money and illegal property, but these offices do not communicate with each other. If they do not communicate with each other at Member State level, how will they communicate at European level? Thirdly, we call on the European Union to speak with one voice with third countries when it comes to recovering these illegal assets. At the moment, the European Union has only four partnerships signed: with Japan, with the United States, with Norway and with Liechtenstein. It's very, very little. We also demand that this European mechanism that we want to build, which we need to build to speak with one voice, has the European Public Prosecutor's Office at its heart. And last but not least - it is not foreseen in the report, but I think it is an important step in the future, because if we want to stop corruption, then we have to get this money back - it is that at European level we take the decision once and for all that corruption should never be prescribed in 10 and 15 and 20 years from now. , if we learn of corruption, let us recover the assets of these acts of corruption, whether we have found them in the second or third generation. Those who steal public money know that they will never escape the watchful eye of the law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Maria GRAPINI", "mepid": "124785", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pity that at such a debate we are so few, because we are going back to our states and we are claiming that there is a lot of fraud, a lot of evasion. They are now trying - I say shyly - from the level of the European Union to find a solution. The solution is very clear. On the one hand, there should be a very clear law in all national parliaments, in all states, not to fill prisons, not to build new prisons from the budget, but to recover money from fraud-seekers. For this we need to have a very well-developed information system between states, because unfortunately this information system does not work, even though we have a lot of agencies, institutions and Europol and others. On the other hand, we do not have a very clear european Union framework in relation to third countries, and then there is a haven of money in these third countries. I believe that this is where the European Commission must act with very serious proposals for regulations at European level in order to have mechanisms through which to supervise, to photograph the whole internal market in terms of tax evasion, economic crime, not to have an CVM mechanism in two states, and with that we have not solved anything.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 48, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Mr President, corruption is on the agenda in too many Member States of the European Union and, of course, must be tackled.

It is again timely. As we all know, it is our shared duty to protect the financial interests of the European Union. We need to ensure that misused funds and assets are recovered in the most efficient and most effective way, including, of course, from third countries.  I am convinced, like you, Mr Ivan, that the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) which is currently being set up, will be a game changer in our fight against criminals and fraudsters. The EPPO will not only change the way Member States cooperate inside the EU, but will also have a major impact on the way the EU and Member States cooperate with partners in third countries. The Commission agrees that this is essential to strengthen the effectiveness of international cooperation in asset recovery and supports the development of CARIN, a network of operational law enforcement and judicial contact points on asset recovery, which covers more than 150 countries and jurisdictions. There is a strong complementarity between the Commission’s anti-corruption work and that of the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO). The Commission continues the discussion with the EU Council on the choice of the appropriate legal framework for the EU accession to GRECO and we truly welcome very much the pragmatic approach of the GRECO plenary. Finally, EU level mutual legal assistance agreements can be good vehicles for judicial cooperation in criminal matters and they can also complement the existing agreements Member States have in place. At the same time, EU level mutual legal assistance agreements, as we all know, are lengthy to negotiate and to enter into force. They also require a high degree of trust in judicial systems. This means that standards in third countries, third states, as regards, for example, the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, fundamental rights, the fight against corruption, fair trial – the judiciary should first be compatible with EU standards before the EU engages in negotiations on such agreements. Eurojust also plays an important role here. It has just concluded various agreements with third countries such as Ukraine, Montenegro, and most recently Albania. This facilitates close and swift judicial cooperation in relation to third countries and ensures that the financial interests of the Union are protected and misused funds can be recovered in a proper way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  I close the debate.

But the thing is that we have a very large trade surplus in manufactured goods, like cars, machines, chemicals. In other words, Europe’s part is in a value chain where the jobs are and where the value is created, and this is how we have brought it so far. And if you don’t want to look at the statistics, look at the magnificent European companies as you see them and as you see their products every day.  So, we have a solid industrial base thanks to European innovation, thanks to European productivity and thanks to our internal market which rests on fair competition and openness.  But we can do more. We can do more to level the global playing field and to create opportunities for a fair and open internal market. There’s plenty of work ahead of us to remain competitive and to shape globalisation so that it serves our citizens and builds on a level playing field, in particular when it concerns subsidies, reciprocity in public procurement and screening of foreign direct investment.  A rule-based system which is fair, where open markets is the rule, that’s our interest. But it’s being challenged by some of our partners questioning the global rule-based system and cooperation. The Commission is working to enforce the existing rules, so that when we trade with Japan and with the US, well, we don’t only trade, we also discuss how to strengthen the World Trade Organisation’s rules on industrial subsidies.  In relation to my portfolio as Commissioner for Competition, we also have started a dialogue with China about subsidies and fair competition.  As to procurement, we already have rules in place which allow a buyer to reject an offer which is unrealistically cheap, but also here we can do more. Foreign bidders take part in public tenders all across Europe, yet European bidders, they often find ‘buy local restrictions’ when they bid in foreign countries with European goods, and this is why the Commission has proposed an international procurement instrument. Once adopted, it will ensure reciprocity and not only that, it will also strengthen our leverage in trade negotiations with third countries to open their markets for fair procurement processes.  And we also have proposed a framework to screen foreign direct investment that affects our security and public order. We continue to work with the Parliament and the Council to make progress on these proposals. But we also need to make good use of the tools that we have already. For instance, to apply modern trade defence mechanisms to maintain fair competition worldwide.  And when we think about the challenges ahead of us, in particular those that relate to digitalisation, it’s important that we factor in how competition helps us to make our industries competitive. Companies have to compete and when they do, well, they are encouraged to make the products that consumers want, to develop new business ideas and attract even more businesses. And that’s good for consumers and for companies.  When a company is a consumer champion in Europe, well it can conquer consumers in all corners of the world, provided of course that it has open and fair market access.  All companies, big as well as small, should have a fair chance to achieve this also when they are faced with large multinationals, and that is why we stop dominant companies from shutting down competition from new competitors, and this is also why we have to review mergers, at least the large ones. Well, we approve almost all mergers that are notified to us. Over the last 10 years more than 3 000 mergers were looked at but only seven were prohibited, were blocked, and in only slightly more than 5% of cases companies proposed solutions to our concerns, for example to sell a factory to a competitor to preserve competition in Europe. Many of the mergers that we have approved, well they have strengthened European companies like Peugeot and Opel, like InBev and SABMiller, like Siemens and Gamesa, world-wide known competitors.  But we should not confuse the size of the individual company with the strength of our economy. These are not necessarily the same thing. For every company that wants a merger to happen there are often many European companies that are affected customers. Steel is a good example of that. It makes the steel that goes into our dishwashers, cars, machinery, and these are businesses that boost our exports. Steel users, well they employ over 30 million people in Europe. So in our merger cases, we ensure that steel companies continue to compete, so that prices stay competitive for all the many, many businesses that need steel in their production.  And just to finalise, a few words on the state aid rules, because companies cannot get state aid simply to shut down a factory and move it to another European country. It is prohibited in a fair single market that taxpayers pay for jobs moving from one country to another. But we do approve state aid that creates jobs in Europe, if they do that without distorting competition. Just last month we authorised Slovakia to support Jaguar and bring new jobs to the disadvantaged Nitra region, jobs that may otherwise have been created outside of Europe.  The Commission also simplified the rule book for state aid that doesn’t harm competition. So, now that 97% of state aid measures go ahead without needing Commission approval, Member States decide for themselves on the basis of a common rule book.  We proposed an investEU fund to support EUR 650 billion of investment. A new research and innovation programme, Horizon Europe, with EUR 100 billion to invest. Both programmes would let national funds be combined with European funds, and we want to make that as easy as possible, because industry is at the heart of our European economy and we want an industry that’s competitive and creates jobs and wealth in Europe. But first of all, we want it to serve our citizens and that’s why we defend open and fair markets in Europe as well as in the rest of the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  thar ceann an Ghrúpa PPE. – A Uachtaráin, a Choimisinéir, comhghairdeas as d’óráid.

Therefore, it is vital that the EU prioritises the needs of the industrial sector and provides sufficient support for its growth in the coming years. I was recently appointed as EPP-ITRE rapporteur on the new investEU programme which the Commissioner referred to, which will use a budgetary guaranteed to mobilise investment into sustainable infrastructure, research and innovation, SMEs and social investment and skills. This 650 billion fund provides an excellent opportunity to promote competition in the industry sector across all the Member States. As one of the flagship programmes of the new EU budget, it will constitute a significant part of our long-term strategy for industry in Europe. With a view to building a strong, sustainable industry sector, SMEs and start-ups should be prioritised. I believe it would also be important to have advisory hubs in each Member State to inform stakeholders on access to EU funding. We must facilitate the industry sectors’ growth, not only with funds, but also with information and above all, ease of access to those funds, which has not been the case sometimes in the past. In this way, we can accelerate digitalisation and innovation, encourage an entrepreneurial culture and increase competition in the industry sector. Earlier this year my colleague Heinz Lehmann's Committee of the Regions draft opinion on a European strategy for industry pointed to the importance of cities and regions in supporting innovation in industry and in promoting industrial adaptation to the digital advances. Local and regional authorities have a lot of influence in areas such as infrastructure, export support, research and innovation, education and skills, SMEs and regulation, all of which are crucial for a globally competitive industry. Technologies are developing at an ever-increasing pace. We should see this as an opportunity, particularly in prioritising industrial growth which is environmentally friendly. Energy is key in determining the competitiveness of the European economy and in particular of industry. A sustainable supply of energy at a reasonable cost to households and businesses, in particular industrial consumers, is crucial. And finally, labour mobility across Europe is an important aspect of industry competitiveness. We need to promote the importance of digital and linguistic skills in order to support employability of workers abroad. We must also increase efforts to encourage participation of women in the labour market with a particular focus on female entrepreneurship, and I’m quite sure, Commissioner, you agree with that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Edouard MARTIN", "mepid": "124947", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D. - Mr President, thank you Commissioner for coming here to discuss a subject that is close to our hearts. You talked about markets, investments, products, competitiveness, etc., these are obviously important themes.  I would like to focus on workers and citizens, because a company, an industry, is not just a place where you produce a consumer good, it is much more than that. An industry is also what creates a link, it is what creates wealth, not just for shareholders, but for a territory, a pool of employment and that is thanks to this that we have nurseries, schools, hospitals, roads, etc. However, on the day these industries disappear, the whole society disappears and the bill is presented to society.  I will tell you about two cases: Alcoa in Spain and Vallourec in France. These are two multinationals that have benefited from subsidies with tens of billions of euros in public aid to establish themselves in areas of the world where the constraints are less. The question is what are you going to do, Commissioner, when those productions that will be made elsewhere will return to the European market. What are the constraints on these industries? Why am I saying that? Because indeed, if the view of the European Union - and I know it is not yours, but we have to go further than that - is that multilateralism creates wealth, who should we ask ourselves for? Multilateralism is above all laissez-faire: tax laissez-faire, financial laissez-faire, economic laissez-faire, is above all the law of price. It's the lowest price that wins the market. However, we know very well that the lowest price is necessarily less so-called conditions: less social, economic and environmental. It's still absurd - to say the other, that it's Trump who denounces this. So it does so in a detestable way, of course, but in reality - and if it were not so serious, we would laugh about it - it is precisely the inventors of ultraliberalism who today point to the flaws of the WTO system and rules. We can't keep playing when we don't all have the same rules. When the European Commission was about to recognize China as a market economy, we were putting the industry at risk, and everyone said it! Four million industrial jobs could be lost in a few months. And yet it was a proposal from the European Commission! What was at stake? What were the political pressures? Where is the citizen? Where's the worker? So I just have this message to send us collectively, and I know you are sensitive to that: if you want European citizens to get a little closer to the European Union, we have to change the rules of the market and the WTO. I invite you to rebound on the proposal of the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, which says \"chiche, let's go, let's put the WTO rules back on the table because otherwise it is the law of the fittest\" and you know very well that the Chinese, with hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, will kill us all economically; if the watchword is to be cheaper than cheaper, we Europeans will never be able to make the weight. It is our social model, it is our societal model that is at stake, it is more than competitiveness, innovation or winning markets, it is the European social model, the model of freedom, democracy that is at stake behind these industries. And I'm talking about it, because I come from a region that has been heavily industrialized and is now heavily deindustrialized. We make the nest of all populists, we make the nest of all nationalists, because when a factory disappears, you turn around, there is nothing left, it is the desert. And we Europeans have no answer. So I would like to see the maintenance of jobs and industries, an objective reason for the fair market, because the market will only be fair if it is social and if it is sustainable while respecting the planet and the environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 102, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Urszula KRUPA", "mepid": "28334", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for In my opinion, it is reasonable to ask whether there can be a fair market for industry at all in a situation of liberalisation and globalisation, characterised by many negative phenomena with global terrorism, the rise of social inequalities as a result of the uneven distribution of goods and services, the catastrophic extent of the environmental threat, the spread of demoralisation, the incapacitation of peoples, the destruction of religion, tradition, the dominance of consumer society over creative ones.  While the European Union has strict rules in place to prevent companies from abusing their market dominance, in practice, especially in central and eastern European countries, the internal market is dominated by huge corporations, in addition to trading cheap goods from Asia, eliminating small and medium-sized enterprises.  That is why, in my opinion, additional questions are well-known. How does the European Commission initiate and activate small and medium-sized enterprises with job protection in the Member States, especially in the event of a downturn or economic downturn? What are the Commission's fiscal tools? What are the customs barriers to prevent cheap products from outside the Union from flooding the market, leading to a recession of parts of industries? Has an action plan been developed for the development of industry in the medium- and long-term perspective, especially strategic industries such as the fuel and energy industry, so that european industry's share of the EU budget is above 20%?

I also want to share some thoughts with you. Namely, I am convinced that the world as it was, or as we knew it 10, 15 or 20 years ago, is definitely changing. We have a situation where today in North America someone is shouting America First. We have a situation where in the east China is grabbing harder and stronger and there is no doubt that the world has changed, and that we in the European Union are still, in a way, playing by some old rules or we want, in a way, to create a world where there will be more justice, honesty, equality, competitiveness and democracy.  However, we see from both left and right, both from the west and from the east of Europe, that things are changing and that this is not so. This is where I want to express my concern and share with you the thinking where, as the European Commission and the European Parliament, we should also make our alternative to what we have consistently advocated so far. And that's why I'm saying, and I've told you here once before, if this one says America First, let's start thinking about whether maybe we need Europe first, because we have to guard our jobs, we're accountable to our citizens and fellow citizens, and if we keep doing this, I come from liberals, like you, but if we continue to overly liberal policies where there will be no help for industries , where there won't be too much social sensitivity, I don't think it's going to be good. Then truly populists in Europe will find room to attack our benevolent policies. That's why I think it's very important that we talk openly about it and see how much globalization can help at the moment, but it can also help. I can't and I can't, of course, mention what's on my heart and what you know is on my heart, which is the shipbuilding industry, which has practically disappeared in many countries of the European Union. There is a chance that this will happen perhaps, unfortunately, in my country, in Croatia. Because of my own weaknesses in the shipbuilding industry in Croatia, but I want to point out one fact that happened in the European Parliament. We had a conference together with Sea Europe and many other shipyards in Europe from different countries and everyone is worried. But, Madam Commissioner, everyone is concerned with the conclusion that in ten years we will lose the shipbuilding industry in Europe if we don't make a difference.

It is good that there are rules in Europe that seek to maintain competition and therefore prohibit the merger of market leaders. But it would also be important to limit the size of companies in principle – which unfortunately is not the case – and to limit their influence and dominance in politics and the economy. But we must bear in mind – and this has already been said a few times now – that Europe is not alone. In other words, we must take account of the situation in the world. This is done on an ongoing and o'going board by our free trade agreements, by our customs agreements. That is why it is an anachronism to say that we only look at the European area when it comes to competition from companies. Let us remember that there are a whole range of products where there are only one or two or a maximum of three companies anywhere in the world that are worth it at all. Take high-speed trains as an example, we take processors from computers, or earlier also hard drives. In the end, there was a single company in the world that still built reasonable hard drives that could best be used here. Let us stick to the example with the trains. It is the case that Siemens has now been urged to take over Alstom. But even the merger of these two large companies, which are building high-speed trains, will not be enough to utilize production to make investment profitable for a new generation of such trains. You have to look at that all over the world. In other words, we simply have to go one step further here. In short, I would simply ask that competition rules look at the new situation created by – but not only – by the free trade agreements that have taken place throughout the world situation, specialisation in individual techniques.

Mr President, just a preliminary remark, I would not want it to be taken on my time. When I go to Brussels and I only stay six hours, I only have half of my allowances. I am the only citizen of Strasbourg, a member of this Parliament. I see that there are very few of my colleagues; the same principle as Brussels should also apply, that if someone stays less than six hours there, they receive only half of their allowances for the day. So I would like to - I apologize, I know I am irrelevant - but I would like there to be reciprocity. I will now intervene, I will make my intervention on three levels: the Eurozone, the non-euro area and the new market data. Within the euro area, we have to distinguish things: we have a single currency and a single market. What is the comparative advantage? We wanted a single market precisely to have a comparative advantage. The stronger becomes stronger and the weaker becomes weaker. Look at what is happening for a country like mine, France: it has a corporate tax rate twice as high as in Germany. It cannot devalue, otherwise - it is in the Eurozone - it has to make an internal devaluation. If it makes an internal devaluation to regain competitiveness, it risks the fate of Spain, which took eight years after its internal devaluation to regain the level of growth and GDP it had previously had. So you see, we are in an absolutely impossible reform game, which is very serious, within the euro area. I had proposed an investment agency to promote the industry in the south, but the reality now is that Germany is increasingly industrializing or maintaining its industry and all the other countries are reducing their industry. What does this lead to? With the debt and the financial crisis, which is going to be the end of the system, because we are nearing the end of the system, there will be a financial collapse.  So, you see, you have to understand this internal mechanism to the institutions of the European Union that leads to this financial collapse, because otherwise you go into two other logics: transfers from the euro area budget - but with these transfers, you are assisted - or, and that is what you are doing, you are developing debt. This is the first point. The second point is outside the eurozone. It is clear - and we populists were the first to denounce this problem - that reciprocity must be guaranteed.

We are in the midst of an economic rivalry between America and China. The global situation is difficult to predict, and many industrial enterprises are rightly asking how Europe can protect them from such external factors. I recognise that globalisation has contributed to the interconnectedness of the world economy, opened up new opportunities and put many people out of poverty. On the other hand, it is essential that fair rules and principles of fair trade are also respected at global level, so the Commission should consider all options to protect our industries and jobs, especially in areas where dumped and unfairly subsidised imports are taking place. At the same time, our industry is exposed to our own internal rules, which bind it to global competition. European competition rules should therefore not be set up in such a way as to put our businesses at a global disadvantage.

I find this is very inspiring because we obviously share the same starting point: that fair competition, a level playing field – this is what we want. We don’t want harmful subsidies to be sort of smuggled in via trade. We don’t want prices to be dumped on us – that’s unfair for European industries. One thing I think is important in having this discussion, and it is that Europe is the largest economy in the world. Europe is an amazing place to do business. Although growth is slow, it is still the highest GDP per capita, with 500 million Europeans. It’s the world’s largest trading bloc, the largest trader in the world of manufactured goods and services, and we rank first in both inbound and outbound international investments. We are the top trading partner for 80 countries. Just to compare, that figure is only 20 when it comes to the US. Those facts shouldn’t lead to any kind of leaning back, or being self—absorbed, or think that everything is solved – on the contrary, because I completely agree that we are in times of change. But the important thing is to see what we have achieved in the European way, in strong societies with social benefits, with a tight fabric that allows people to have jobs where they can provide for their families. I think that it’s important that we take all this achievement and put that in our fight for change, for making the market, the industry and globalisation serve citizens. This is why the strategy is so manifold, because I completely agree with what is said by Ms Smolková and Mr Blanco López: that of course we need to work strategically at this. This is why it’s not just a matter of a fair level playing field within the European Union. This is a global effort to make this happen. I also completely agree with Mr Martin, who says: well, we have to figure out how to enable change so that people feel that they are the masters. Because if we just abandon areas that used to be the home for important industries and workplaces and leave it at that, of course, everyone gets frustrated, because you don’t see your sons and your daughters having a fair chance. And this is why, with the combined efforts of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, things can be put into effect. But it is not just to change, it’s also to maintain and develop our industries. And this is why we do our best to enable Member States to work together on important projects of European interest. Take microelectronics, take the Battery Alliance being built as we speak, because this shows the strength of coming together in Europe when we do things together. Ms Krupa rightly mentioned all our small and medium—sized businesses. Because when we talk about industry, it’s important not just to think about the giants, but also to think about the many smaller businesses – who are either the customers of giants or the suppliers to giants – to enable the network of European industry to work well. This is why it has been so important in the Juncker investment plan to provide capital for small and medium—sized businesses, because this is one of the most under—debated issues, that you need capital in order to grow. You need access to financing, otherwise, how could you create the jobs. I think that’s a very important point in our discussion that we don’t focus on just the big ones or just the small ones, but see the network that they create and that they have the need for one another. So thank you very much also for mentioning that. Mr Jakovčić also rightly points to these chains that we’re in. Obviously it’s very important that Europe master the different crafts and that is why it is important when, for instance, shipbuilders come together to figure out how to make sure that we have a competitive shipbuilding industry in Europe to deliver state of the art. There are a number of specific discussions but there are also a number of discussions that are European—wide. Mr Buchner talks also about trade and I’m very happy to support the work of my colleague, Cecilia Malmström, because what she has done over the last couple of years is basically to retire the old concept of free trade and replace that with a concept of trade agreement, where you actually have tools to say, well, I will not import despicable working conditions or animal welfare that we will not accept here. We want trade also in that to be on an eye-to-eye basis and that is the modern way to proceed. Not just to say trade is just about lowering tariffs. No, trade is also about actually having reciprocity in the way things are done. That is important for us, as the Commission, to enable this environment for European industry to thrive; not just the big ones – and we have big impressive industry in Europe – but also all the smaller ones who are part and parcel of the creation of this Europe that we live in, in which – at this point where we speak – more people than ever have a job. And with all that achievement – and with your engagement and our agreement on a level playing field and fair competition – I am certain that we have what it takes to meet this challenge and to make this change happen for the benefit of citizens and not counter it, because in that I think Mr Martin has the exact point; that this is now where change should be inclusive and not over people’s head, so thank you very much for this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2018-10-25.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}]
