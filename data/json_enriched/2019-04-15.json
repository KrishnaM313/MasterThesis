At the moment, we depend on the goodwill of Parliament's administration, which only grants access if the honourable Member agrees. My Amendments Nos 142 and 143 accept this.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an essential debate for the European citizens we have this afternoon, because it is about recognising the essential role that whistleblowers play in our democracies, placing our demands for transparency and good governance above economic and financial powers and, above all, ensuring, as a fair return, of things. , the protection of those who have the courage to protect our general interest, of those who have the courage to speak to protect us. The aim is to make the European Union one of the most advanced policy spaces for whistleblower protection. This directive is the result of a long process, in particular by this Parliament, which since 2014 has highlighted in its work the importance of effective protection of whistleblowers, before expressing very clearly, on several occasions, its formal request for a directive. Since the beginning of the mandate, scandals have accumulated: LuxLeaks, Panama Papers, Football Leaks. They have shed a harsh light on the very precarious situation faced by whistleblowers. Then the directive on business secrecy arrived. There has been a great deal of concern, which we have tried to correct in the directive, but above all we have conditioned the vote on this directive on the establishment of genuine European protection for whistleblowers. I remember very well the debates that took place in 2016 in this Chamber, where we were told that this was not possible, that there was not sufficient legal basis in the treaties to enable the European Union to act. And yet, today, three years later, we are debating this issue before adopting tomorrow - I hope - a directive that will protect whistleblowers throughout the Union. The commitment of parliamentarians, as well as that of civil society and NGOs that I want to welcome here, is therefore bearing fruit. It moves the lines and encourages Europe to listen to the concerns of European citizens. This is not so common on my part, but I would like to stress this here today: I would like to congratulate Commissioner Jourova for her commitment and the European Commission for the inventiveness it has shown to finally dispel the difficulties that were against us and to find a solution to put in place a European protection for whistleblowers. So today we have this text which will provide the widest possible protection, as Parliament called for in the initiative report voted in 2017. Of course, as part of this protection, employees who are in a traditional working relationship will be covered, but also consultants, trainees, contractors, service providers and independent experts. We wanted not to leave a void in the protection we put in place. Similarly, we wanted to be able to protect those accompanying whistleblowers - facilitators, colleagues, whistleblower relatives - who may also be involved or affected by reprisals. I am also pleased that we have managed in these negotiations to preserve the original ambition, which was already in the Commission's proposal, to cover as wide a scope as possible, ranging from the protection of the Financial Interests of the European Union, to corporate tax issues, to environmental protection. I hope that the Member States will be keen to follow a common recommendation and go beyond the sectoral scope defined in the directive to ensure the widest possible horizontal transposition. The reporting mechanisms that we have put in place are strong and they are also there to change attitudes. This was an essential point, which translates into the obligation to set up internal channels within the company. But I am pleased that we have returned to the obligation, initially planned, to go through an internal report in the first place. I believe that this was one of the major problems of the original proposal of the text and, on this point, the European Parliament has fully played its role as co-legislator by making these improvements and by blowing up this obligation which would inevitably have exposed the whistleblower to reprisals. Finally, this text proposes really effective protections against reprisals: immunity from confidentiality clauses and business secrecy, immunity also with regard to the acquisition of the revealed information, protection that had to be negotiated hard with some of the Member States, and then the reversal of the burden of proof. labour disputes, which will effectively protect employees. The obligations of information and support, including psychological and financial, are strengthened so as not to leave alone those people who often find themselves very isolated in the face of gigantic multinationals. On the whole, therefore, it is a very ambitious text that we are about to adopt and which responds to the challenge posed to our democracies. I would like to thank my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, who have been heavily involved in this matter and have shown that when Parliament is united, it succeeds in producing results, it even manages to overthrow blocking minorities in the Council, which is not so common. And I would like to thank the Romanian Presidency, which, through its decisive action on this issue, through its leadership, has produced this excellent result, and also renew my thanks to Commissioner Jourova, who has shown a great spirit of compromise on this directive. I thank you all and I hope that the vote tomorrow will materialis this progress for the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 33, "date": "2019-04-15.json", "name": "Miguel VIEGAS", "mepid": "125100", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – One billion euros, Madam President, I will repeat - one billion euros - is the amount of tax evasion and evasion.

The JURI Commission helped us to propose Parliament's position according to what society needs and demands. We have managed to tackle the fragmentation of whistleblower protection in the European Union, increasing legal certainty. Today, whistleblowers continue to be silenced and often dare not communicate for fear of reprisals, but with this directive we hope to have started to succeed so that they are protected by secure reporting channels. We also protect the sources of investigative journalism. We protect the civic duty to denounce, so that it is not an act of heroism. An extra layer of safeguarding of the public interest is added, because the work of the PANA Committee of Inquiry in this Parliament would not have been possible without Panama's papers.

Yes, I agree with the rapporteur, the negotiations were not easy, but we all knew that we were working on something very, very important, and the Commission considers the agreement reached is a well-balanced compromise, both in terms of ensuring robust protection for whistle-blowers and in strengthening the enforcement of EU law. Recent scandals such as ‘dieselgate’, LuxLeaks, the Panama Papers or Cambridge Analytica, would not have come to light without the courage of whistle-blowers. By protecting whistle-blowers through these rules, we can better detect and prevent harm to the public interest such as fraud, corruption, corporate tax avoidance and damage to people’s health or the environment. This compromise ensures high standards of protection, widely available reporting channels and a broad, personal and material scope. Whistle-blowers are encouraged to use the internal channel first where the breach can be effectively addressed within the organisation they work for. The availability of easily accessible internal channels, both in the public and the private sector and in all companies with 50 or more employees, will provide this possibility to whistle-blowers. But – and I know this was an important issue for this House – whistle-blowers will also have the free choice to report directly to the competent authorities as they see fit in light of the circumstances of the case. They will be fully protected when doing so. The broad material scope guarantees that the directive will strengthen enforcement in key areas of EU law and policies. This gives effect to the Commission’s commitment to put stronger focus on enforcement to serve the general interest, as set out in its 2016 Communication on EU law: Better results through better application. Moreover, as this is a directive with common minimum standards, the Commission encourages the Member States to extend the directive’s rules to other areas and to establish comprehensive frameworks for whistle-blower protection. This possibility for Member States is now explicitly reflected in that text. As part of the compromise on the material scope we foresee a review of the implementation of the directive at the earliest possible time. That means in 2025, four years after the transposition of the directive and, in this context, to assess specifically the issue of including the social policy area in the material scope of the directive. This would allow for an in-depth assessment of how the directive would interact with the existing social acquis. Accordingly, the Commission will make the following political declaration to be annexed to the directive: ‘At the time of the review to be conducted in accordance with Article 27 of the directive, the Commission will consider the possibility of proposing to extend its scope of application to certain acts based on Articles 153 and 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union after consulting the social partners, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 154.’ (End of quote.) To conclude, by agreeing on these standards the EU is demonstrating its commitment to transparency, good governance, accountability and freedom of expression which are values and rights on which the EU is based, and this is a clear and important signal that we are sending to the citizens and stakeholders on the eve of the European elections. The Commission fully supports the compromise found by the co-legislators and looks forward to tomorrow’s vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 36, "date": "2019-04-15.json", "name": "Luke Ming FLANAGAN", "mepid": "124985", "text": "  rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control. – Madam President, whistle—blowers are extraordinary people.

The draft we presented showed that EU action on whistle-blowers is possible. It coincided with the LuxLeaks trials, which showed more clearly than ever that such protection is also needed. One of our goals was to ensure that trade secrets cannot be weaponised against whistle-blowers, as was the case with LuxLeaks whistle-blower Antoine Deltour. In 2015 he was awarded the European Citizen’s Prize, but a year later a Luxembourg court found him guilty of disclosing trade secrets – a bogus charge that was meant to intimidate. The legal hoops he had to jump through for a court to dismiss this verdict were long and taxing. Now the Commission and the Parliament have really risen to the challenge. The draft directive we are about to adopt makes explicit what we demanded in 2016: that whistle-blower protection take precedence over trade secrets.

No one questions whether a worker can report a violation of labour rights in the authority to protect working conditions. What distinguishes this worker from another worker who discovers, for example, that his company is easing away from taxes? Obviously, it's not worth everything in the name of common interest.

When will the Public Prosecutor's Office and the tax authority ask Rui Pinto for cooperation in defense of the public interest and the recovery of assets in Portugal, as other European countries have already done?

Madam President, thank you to all colleagues for their support, encouragement and repeated greetings. I thank them in return, as do, of course, the Romanian Presidency and the Commissioner.

We have repeatedly said that Romania needs to put the reform process back on track and to do so urgently. This means going forwards, not backwards, and abstaining from any steps which would reverse the progress accomplished over the past years.  The Commission, and in particular the First Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, has personally engaged with Prime Minister Dăncilă, and the respective experts have met on several occasions for constructive discussions and dialogue.  The Commission always made it clear that talking for the sake of talking will not be enough and concrete actions from the Romanian side will be needed sooner rather than later. The College discussed the situation two weeks ago. Regrettably, we have not yet been able to conclude that Romania is back on the right track. If our concerns are not met, the Commission will have to act, and to use the means at its disposal.  Today’s discussion is not about technical issues or to update you that against the backdrop of already clear backtracking identified in November, progress on the CVM (cooperation and verification mechanism) recommendations has been stalled, or to discuss that the latest Romanian legislative developments transposing a number of EU directives could raise concerns about potential incompatibility with EU law, or to mention further eroding confidence through recent executive ordinances and controversial appointment procedures. The situation around the nomination procedure for the next European Public Prosecutor’s Office chief has also not contributed.  Today’s discussion is about very real risks of further steps backwards in Romania regarding the rule of law and, more specifically, as regards the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption.  First, the possible amendments of the criminal code and the criminal procedure code: such fundamental issues need careful preparation, widespread consultation of the magistracy and stakeholders, and a very clear understanding of the consequences of change. Any the action taken should be compatible with EU law and international obligations, as well as CVM recommendations such as the fight against corruption. The Romanian authorities would be taking a risk in moving ahead without such a process and this might lead to creating a systemic, de facto impunity for high office holders who were sentenced for corruption.  Second, regarding the High Court of Cassation and Justice and a possible follow-up to a constitutional court judgment that has required changes to the composition of panels of five judges: there are serious questions about what is needed for the follow-up and these cannot be separated from the potential consequences of re-opening past cases, something which in itself could amount to a massive interference in the independence of the judiciary. The risk of massive disruption to the Romanian criminal justice system, including many corruption cases, cannot be ignored.  Third, the issue of appointments of prosecutors and, in particular, the need for a robust and independent system of appointing top prosecutors: this is not a new issue but the checks and balances have been successively watered down. The result is highly controversial procedures to appoint top prosecutors, the Prosecutor General and the chief anti-corruption prosecutor.  Fourth, the Special Prosecution Section set up to investigate magistrates: concerns about the structure had previously been raised in the CVM report by the Venice Commission and by the anti-corruption body GRECO. Yet, the government is reinforcing this structure. All these elements, all of them, raise major concerns taken separately. Together, they start to amount to a very worrying pattern. Recent months have been characterised by a very volatile situation in Romania, with a series of rushed decisions being taken on essential matters. If these concerns are not met, the Commission will have to act and to use all the means at its disposal.  The Commission therefore urges Romania to take time to consult, getting as close as possible to a consensus and drawing on advice from the Venice Commission as well as from the CVM process. It is not too late for Romania to revert to the path of reform.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 62, "date": "2019-04-15.json", "name": "Ingeborg GRÄSSLE", "mepid": "28220", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Unfortunately, the Presidency of the Council cannot be welcomed, although there are many good reasons why this Presidency of the Council should be listening to this. Commissioner, we have to deal with the fact that Romania is leading the European Union, and I am already concerned – stunned and deeply affected, because we have never seen the collapse of the rule of law in such a rapid succession. No other state in the European Union has dared to do what Romania dares to do. I hope that the Romanians want to be a singular story. It would be good if the S&amp;D were to move away early and much more decisively from this issue, which is happening in Romania. I can only advise the Commission on this: we are advising on the Article 7 procedure. We also advise stopping money because we can no longer protect the money in the face of the collapse of the rule of law. It is the responsibility of an obviously overwhelmed government, which is allowed to give up an obviously overwhelmed Presidency. The Romanian Government is the perpetrator and it creates victims, and the first victim is the independent judiciary. It thus promotes a considerable amount of corruption. We see a Socialist parliamentary leader and party leader – convicted at first instance of fraud – who bears a great deal of responsibility for this. This story needs to be addressed, including by the S&amp;D, because I think that double standards would be quite bad here. We see a Constitutional Court dealing with its case and facing considerable pressure. We see a postponement of the appeal process. We see the former Attorney General Kövesi being overrun with ever new trials and flimsy accusations and subjected to enormous pressure – again an act of revenge. She is the candidate of the two committees responsible for the new European Public Prosecutor's Office, and she is the candidate of the selection committee. Unfortunately, unfortunately, the Council has done little – nothing at all – to sanction these machinations of the Presidency. The Council therefore has a clear share of responsibility. It is prepared to reward Romania for these attacks on the rule of law. And that is something that must be absolutely rejected. The French candidate cannot therefore become the first European Public Prosecutor. His candidacy is the fig leaf behind which are unprecedented violations of the law and against the Romanian candidate of Parliament. It has long been about more than a post for the European Public Prosecutor. It is about the credibility of Europe and also about the credibility of the Commission and the first Vice-President.

I have to start by saying that I share Ms Gräßle’s irritation about the absence of the Council, not least because it is the country concerned. (Applause) But hold your applause until I have finished, because you may not be so happy any more – I also regret the absence of Mr Timmermans. No offence, Madam Commissioner, but he is the Commissioner and the Vice—President in charge. And what has he done over the last five years? Just last week, the Commission presented a kind of communication on the rule of law which was hardly worth the paper it was written on, and Mr Timmermans didn’t even bother to show up at the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to present it. No, he left it to his civil servants. Where is he today? What has he done in the last five years? Because now I’m coming to the partisan issue. I am a bit tired of having debates here – today it’s about Romania and it’s the EPP criticising, tomorrow it will be about Hungary and the Socialists will be criticising and the EPP will be, well, not silent because I know that some of you are indeed critical, I know that Ms Gräßle is very outspoken and very, very honest, and some other EPP Members as well – but these debates are always turned into a partisan issue. It is not a partisan issue. This is about the values laid down in Article 2 of the Treaties that concern us all, regardless of party political colour. I don’t understand – two-and-a-half years ago this House adopted a position, a proposal for a DRF pact, which is a general mechanism covering all the Member States, all the Governments and the Commission. And again, I’m not pointing at you Madam Commissioner, but Mr Timmermans is responsible here. Mr Timmermans said ‘oh, we don’t need that because we’ve got all the tools in the toolbox that we need’. Well, we don’t. Mr Timmermans is a Spitzenkandidat, but Mr Weber is also a Spitzenkandidat. So I would like to know from both Spitzenkandidaten, who are conspicuously absent, both as group leader and Vice—President of the Commission, what they intend to do once they are President of the Commission. Will President of the Commission Weber do what he voted for as MEP Weber, namely propose a fully—fledged DRF mechanism applying equally to all the Member States? To be perfectly clear here, my group, the ALDE Group, has firmly distanced itself from the ALDE Romania party in government because we are disappointed, not just about the changes to the penal code, but also about their failure to support equal marriage or indeed civil partnership. We are very disappointed about the attitude of the Romanian Government in the case of Ms Kövesi, and we are also very disappointed about their attempts to try and prevent the registration of new parties who want to run in the European elections.

What is the state of the rule of law? Ladies and gentlemen - the rule of law without there being rights and freedoms for citizens does not exist.  In 2009, Romania's attorney general signed a secret protocol with the intelligence services. Surprisingly - the attorney general was Kövesi.

I hate the double standard in everything that means the things that are their daily life: food that is counterfeit and come and have invaded the Romanian market, endangering their health, pharmaceuticals. Romanians are not admitted to the Schengen area although all conditions have been met since 2011. There are millions of Romanians in all airports. At all border crossingpoints European citizens are on one side and Romanians on the other. 80% of Romanians in all opinion polls say that it is inadmissible and do not recognise as legitimate the abuses that have been made in court, these abuses that must be ended once and for all. And I want you to know why i'm saying these things, because they've been able to see testimonies, testimonies, and testimonies on television every day. And Romanians are sensitive because they experienced these abuses during the communist period and do not want to accept that there are judges who are blackmailed, judges and prosecutors who are filmed in the bathroom, in the bedroom so that they can be blackmailed to be indicated and asked for a certain solution in a file.  Romanians want to be treated as equal partners, as citizens of the European Union.

It is no longer a rule of law because the ruling majority since 2016 does exactly what Mr Nica described, namely enormous pressure on judges, prosecutors, on the entire body of magistrates, even creating institutions to force them to reverse decisions taken, final decisions, to force them not to pursue acts of corruption. Everything, after all, to save the Marafoi. They have at the head of the party a man convicted of corruption twice, a man who is at the head of the House. Tell me a country in the European Union since the Second World War, which has had as its leader a party - the most important in number and which has continued to remain in this position - someone convicted twice. Who is awarded in the European Union for stealing? How can we accept this coalition of scoundrels who want to destroy a country for a March?

So that’s the reaction for you who criticised First Vice-President Timmermans for not being here today. Frans Timmermans has engaged very intensively in continuous, long-lasting dialogue with the Romanian authorities and he is the last person who should be criticised for doing something wrong or something negative against Romania.  The second comment: the Commission does not interfere in individual cases in Romania. This is the reaction to Ms Grapini. This is our principle: we do not interfere. We are looking at a systemic situation, at the situation in the legislation, and that’s why we are addressing the recent legislative changes which we see in Romania, because the cumulative potential of the individual changes might lead to the breach of the rule of law in Romania. Last comment to Ms Morvai: No, I don’t know the basis.  I very well remember my own case from 2006. I was accused of corruption in 2006, with a very dirty political case. It was purely motivated by political interests and it was a charade for the media, and I still remember that when sitting in the jail, not for a single second did I believe that any judge in my country would send me to jail after indictment in the court. I believed in independent justice in my country and by the way the case never got to the court because there was not the slightest evidence. It was just politically initiated, a dirty game for the media.  I remember it very well and it’s a paradox that Romania was the country which offered me work after this, because everything was destroyed by this. I will not go into details but it also affected horribly my family. I worked in Romania. This country gave me a chance to provide my knowledge and expertise and that’s why I should be the last person who could be accused now of doing something against Romania.  I just have to share the view that in Romania we might get into the situation of irreversible changes in the judiciary system, the systemic breach of rule of law, where the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is endangered. I was following closely what Romania is doing through the CVM exercise. I was happy about the reform going in the right direction and at the same time, I was very scared about the changes which started to go in a very wrong direction and this is where we are now.  The independent judiciary is a very important pillar of the democratic state and it is something which is being developed over decades. In all the Member States we saw a very long process which led to the well-balanced constitutional system, with a very strong independent judiciary as the main part of it, or one of the main parts. But it can be destroyed literally overnight and this is what the Commission doesn’t want to happen in Romania.  So again, the debate, the dialogue is ongoing. I agree with those of you who said that Romania and the Romanians deserve more. So we would like to help Romania. Now the debate is ongoing on a technical level, I would wish us to come back to the political level and have a positive dialogue which will lead to positive changes and the reform coming back on track in Romania.

They are also an important tool to channel private savings into the economy and increase funding for European companies. But today the markets for investment funds are mostly national. For example, 70% of investment funds are sold only in the domestic market. The share of UCITS funds – that is marketed in more than three countries – is relatively low, 37%, and for alternative investment funds the share is even lower, only around 3%. This is partly due to regulatory barriers that hinder cross—border fund distribution. As part of the capital markets union, the Commission proposed measures to reduce these barriers and improve the functioning of the single market for European investment funds. Our goal is simple. We want managers from anywhere in the EU to be able to easily sell their funds across the EU without compromising on investor protection. We propose to achieve this by reducing administrative burdens and by improving clarity for fund managers who want to market their funds across the EU. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wolf Klinz, and the shadow rapporteurs for making efforts to advance the file quickly. (Interruption due to an interpretation problem)  I would also like to congratulate you for having quickly achieved a political agreement with the Council in trilogue negotiations. The Commission supports the agreement reached. It strikes the right balance between facilitating cross—border distribution of investment funds and ensuring investor protection. I would give you one example of this careful balance. Parliament and the Member States decided to allow managers to promote actively the existing funds to potential new investors without having to comply with all the marketing rules. At the same time, the co-legislators introduced safeguards to ensure sound supervision of these practices and limit the risk of the circumvention of EU rules.

The outgoing Commission, whose work I welcome in this area, had wished to provide precise and targeted responses to the remaining barriers to cross-border investment within the Union. The agreement reached with the Council during the inter-institutional negotiations appears satisfactory and balanced. It takes into account most of the issues that had been raised by Parliament. In particular, it proposes to make the procedure for denoting funds more pragmatic, abolishing the logic of thresholds which was inherently arbitrary. Similarly, with regard to pre-marketing, under the impetus of Parliament, the mechanism has been extended to pre-existing funds and the requirements for pre-marketing documents have been streamlined. This will make the tool more efficient and responsive to its objectives. In total, we have managed to maintain the necessary safeguards to prevent these new opportunities from giving rise to possible circumventions, especially from actors from third countries. Finally, while the idea of European supervision, at the level of a European authority, sometimes seems to be disputed, I am pleased to see that the compromise that meets Parliament's will gives an increased role to the European Financial Markets Authority, ESMA.

The aim of this regulation is to facilitate the cross-border distribution of investment funds, as most European funds are currently offered in only one Member State, their national state, and many managers are reluctant to enter a new market, which reduces the choice of investors in that country. However, we need investors and capital in Europe to finance our economy, hence this proposal which should remove barriers and encourage funds to explore the potential of a new market, for example by defining what marketing pricing is. It also harmonizes the conditions under which funds can leave a Member State's market if the expected success is not achieved. We have been very insistent that the supervisory authorities be informed of the activities of the funds in a given state so that they can carry out their monitoring mission and that there is a genuine exchange of information between the supervisory authorities, but also with the European Authority. Indeed, these are the necessary conditions to ensure adequate information and protection of investors, this was our main concern. Thanks to the trade-offs, we are also confident that fund managers will continue to fulfill their obligation to inform investors in a country, even after leaving it. I would not like to end without saying a word about the PRIIP and the key information document. My group did not request that the UCITS be given an additional two years before they were obliged to apply the provisions relating to the key information document.

Only 37% of UCITS and about 3% of alternative investment funds are currently registered for distribution in more than three Member States. This makes a Capital Markets Union rather meaningless. So four years on, this flagship project will finally reduce some barriers, increase transparency and remove overly complex and burdensome national rules. It is a win for the investors, getting more choice, better value and protection. I welcome this reform as a critical step.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which First of all, thank you very much for the excellent cooperation in two and a half years – two and a half years, which were marked by the balance of interests, the merging of completely different ideas. Ideas about how we make Europe safer, how, after the banking crisis of 2008, which cost the taxpayer EUR 2 000 billion, we are getting the world out of the firing line. In addition to the rapporteurs Othmar Karas, mrs Caroline Nagtegaal from the ALDE, Sven Giegold from the Greens, Ashley Fox and the other rapporteurs, I would like to thank the staff of the European Commission and Vice-President Dombrovskis in particular. We have been fortunate here that the Commission, in difficult negotiations, in difficult times with its staff – and this can be said – was available day and night to help us find the best possible compromise here. And what we have achieved is impressive: we have introduced key elements here in banking supervision, implementing what the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has laid down, which have not yet existed. We have introduced a leverage ratio, i.e. a reduction in banks' debt, a backstop for a capital under-ceiling. We have put a premium on global systemically important banks. By introducing a structural liquidity ratio, we have introduced the safeguarding of banks' long-term liquidity and solvency. By implementing the TLAC standard, we have ensured that ailing banks, especially large international banks, can be wound up in the future and that the taxpayer does not have to go, and, and, and. Personally, however, it was particularly important to me that, for the first time, we introduced a principle that, for me, is a bridgehead for the future, which is to be built in the coming years, something that ensures that we have a level playing field for all banks in Europe. , but not by equal rules for all, but by differentiation. In the past, we have failed to take account of the fact that small, low-risk, local banks should be treated differently from large, internationally riskier banks. We have failed in the past to ensure that they are relieved of bureaucracy where possible and not to be burdened. With this report – and Here I am grateful to all my colleagues – we have managed for the first time that all banks that are less than five billion and who can demonstrate in terms of quality that they are low-risk have so much red-scale relief that, hopefully, we will not be able to hear in future that the result of over-bureaucratisation is forced mergers, because small banks simply did not get to the brink of the current rules. With our ideas for a single European reporting system, We have hopefully managed for the future, that there is reliability, when banks of a smaller nature and others are confronted with queries which in the past have led to the need to meet the requests of different institutions and institutions on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and then perhaps on Thursdays we could perhaps start to do normal work. Making it safer, on the one hand, but taking into account the diversity of the risk profile of banks in Europe on the other – that was our task. And I believe that we, together with all the parties here who have worked constructively on this, have achieved this with the European Commission and, in the end, even after many long and difficult meetings with the Member States.

Regarding the banking crisis, we have in reality succeeded with three different legislations: first of all, the hierarchy, which we decided upon a year ago, and now the two legislations for the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). This is built upon the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive that was adopted in 2014. One of the fundamental aims of that was to change the logic of the banking sector, to clarify that those who own a bank or invest in a bank have full responsibility when bad times come. Together with the tools of a bridge bank or mergers of banks, we added the bail-in procedure, meaning that, if you have invested in the bank, you also risk losing the capital you have invested. This is something we have in order to achieve two fundamentally-important things: first of all to clarify to everyone that you have risk when investing in a bank. The other one is to ensure that you can do the bail-in procedure in a foreseeable and certain way. For me as the rapporteur of the BRRD from the beginning, and now with these legislations, it has been extremely important to stick to that rule, to ensure that the introduction of TLAC (total loss-absorbing capacity) is not a way of circumventing the fact that all capital in a bank is to be seen as ‘bail-in-able: that is, creating a market discipline and helping taxpayers in all the different events that can come. This also means that we have achieved better rules regarding how to set the TLAC in Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). I’m happy that we achieved a discretionary cap from Parliament’s side, meaning that you don’t punish banks with a high level of own capital, but also meaning that you can set the level of MREL and TLAC depending on the risk structure of the bank. This is what we have achieved and I think that we are now facing the fact that, if I may phrase it that way, never have we had such good opportunities for those who will have the responsibility to resolve banks in bad times, because this means that this will be easier – we are facilitating that – but it also means that the markets will be much more alert and avoid banking getting into crisis. That is, of course, the most important thing. The fact that everyone who invests in a bank now knows that you are risking something means that we will have thousands and thousands of supervisors securing that you have the right level of capital and the right level of MREL in the banks they are providing capital to. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Commission, who have helped us through with this.

The proposal built on existing EU banking rules aimed to complete the post-crisis regulatory agenda. The proposal was a major step in risk reduction, and also fulfilled our international commitments by implementing internationally agreed standards, while ensuring that banks can continue to support the real economy. The Council reached a general approach in May 2018 after intensive negotiations of three consecutive presidencies, the European Parliament followed in June 2018, and political agreement was reached in December. So I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members involved in negotiating this package for their commitment and their political will to reach a compromise, and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Simon and Mr Hökmark. Your efforts and dedication were instrumental in reaching this agreement. Parliament helped to improve several elements of the original Commission proposal. You enriched the package with additional elements that were absent in the initial proposal, for example in the areas of sustainable finance and anti-money laundering. The package on which you will vote tomorrow includes important measures to strengthen the resilience of banks. For instance, it introduces a binding leverage ratio as a backstop to prevent institutions from excessive leverage, and it establishes a binding net stable funding ratio to address excessive reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The package will also enhance the rules on governance and supervision of banks and will give macro-prudential supervisors additional flexibility to address macro-prudential risks more effectively. In addition, the new rules also improve the resolvability of banks when they are in difficulties. In particular, the new rules transpose into EU law the international total loss-absorbing capacity standard applicable to globally systemically important institutions. This will set a harmonised minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) that has to be met with capital or debt instruments of high quality and, together with numerous other enhancements, this will ensure that banks are building robust buffers that can be used in case of resolution so as to avoid a spillover on public finances and ensure a clear and transparent process vis-à-vis banks, authorities and the markets. At the same time, the package pays close attention to a number of issues that matter to the financing of the real economy. Your agreed rules improve banks’ lending capacity to support the real economy. In particular, they enhance capacity to lend to SMEs and to fund infrastructure projects. In this sense, these aspects are very much in line with our jobs and growth agenda. The package also injects more proportionality into the prudential framework for banks. It will reduce the administrative burden stemming from reporting, disclosure and remuneration requirements for small non-complex banks, and in areas where we introduce new standards, we have calibrated simple but conservative alternatives for small non-complex banks which they can use. The package will introduce for the first time the considerations of environmental, social and governance risks in bank prudential regulation, for example through the obligation for large listed banks to disclose the environmental and social risks they are exposed to. And last, but not least, following the recent money laundering scandals you included measures to enhance cooperation and information exchange between prudential and AML supervisory authorities and the European Banking Authority’s role in this context, together with the ESA review, those are important steps.

Together with the new banking regulation, we have taken an important step towards the completion of the Banking Union. This is the biggest risk bureaucracy and cost reduction in European banking regulation.  We have achieved this with six key points: firstly, a tougher own resources requirement that takes account of the structural characteristics of the European banking sector. Secondly, for the first time, there is a definition of proportionality between small and non-complex institutions, including qualitative criteria. Thirdly, we are creating significant administrative facilitation and 20% less regulatory costs for small banks. Fourthly, there will be even greater support for the real economy through the development of the so-called SME factor from EUR 1.5 million to EUR 2.5 million. Fifthly, the scheme also provides an answer to digitalisation by favouring software investments. Sixthly, the creation of a single European register of registration will lead to an end to the duplicate reporting obligations. We have therefore contributed, on the one hand, to stabilising the financial market and, on the other, protecting smaller banks.

Unfortunately, this amendment to the Bank Restructuring and Resolution Directive does not achieve this objective. Instead of requiring banks to have high and simple capital ratios, they have turned to complicated capital requirements with a number of exemptions in order to protect the banking sector. It has refrained from separating risky investment banking from the credit and deposit business.  And instead of finally tackling the too-big-to-fail problem and shrinking big banks, German SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, among others, dreams of merging the two wobbly giants Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, which would then have a combined balance sheet total of just under two trillion euros. But two old Opels don't make a Ferrari together. The stability of the banking sector would be disserviced with this merger.  The weaknesses of the resolution mechanism have also been disclosed several times in practice in recent years.

I think everyone in this Chamber agrees with me when I say that we do not want to find ing another situation like this. Fortunately, we have ... this package, which involves many measures to prevent us from going to the wrong. So if we vote in favour of the plan, banks will have to keep more money in their reserves from now on. So the so-called bank buffers are going up further in Europe. That's a good thing. But at the same time, our task is not yet complete. Too many banks still have far too many non-outstanding loans on their balance sheets. If the electorate gives me confidence again, that is what I will be fighting for in the next five years. Rules for banks need to be tightened when it comes to loans that are worth nothing or almost nothing. Moreover, I think banks should be more cautious when it comes to the government bonds they have. Because if countries do not have their act together, it should have no effect on banks and certainly not on savers. Let's face it, banks are not our enemies.

What I wonder is whether, in fact, we are convinced that we have reduced the risks within the European banking system and the most important risks.  In other words, what I have been saying for five years now in this Parliament, the greatest risk is in liquid securities held by European systemic banks. Liquid securities are derivatives, they are securities that have difficulty being then also valued by supervision and in the event of a crisis they can really lose so much value in a short time. And these securities from vigilance and not even from these rules are put under a magnifying glass, and this is a serious mistake that we will most likely pay dearly. And the biggest mistake, which is behind risk reduction, is to focus the will to want to reduce risks only on the credit side. Credit is the lifeblood of the European economy, small and medium-sized enterprises, families, those who want to buy a house, machinery and so on. The fact that a bank is being restricting credit to the extent that it is being asked to provide too many capital requirements, very often, in an excessive way, suffice it to say that, despite the existing requirements, the BRRD review asks banks to go and place additional securities on the market in order to obtain more capital in the event of a bail-in, and the resolution authorities will also be able to ask the banks to increase these requirements.  And I want to figure out now who has the money in one of these banks will feel confident that they're going to keep it in there, to the extent that an authority will ask this bank to go to the market and ask for capital requirements.

The introduction of TLAC (total loss-absorbing capacity) has been hailed by some as a sufficient solution to solve the problem of too-big-to-fail banks, but I don’t believe that’s possible without bank structural reform and a larger binding leverage ratio. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive has already been proven to be ineffective at preventing tax payer-funded bailouts. From the beginning of the process of negotiating the package, we have expressed serious concerns over the capital leverage ratio being set at just 3%. We should remember that the OECD and the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recommend a leverage ratio of at least 5% for institutions that are systematically important. So we are allowing, effectively, EU banks’ desire to compete with their American counterparts to put financial stability at risk. Finally, we’ll never be able to separate the too-big-to-fail problem from bank structural reform. The most effective way to achieve the objective of risk reduction is to separate retail from investment banking.

Therefore, I am pleased with this regulation as it is very much forward-looking.  Under the new rules, a systemically relevant bank must have significantly more funds to strengthen the principle of bail-in, and that’s good. The new rules also anticipate the change towards sustainable finance, giving the EBA a role in assessing risk for people and planet.

When interest rates rose again, these states were over-indebted. At the same time, their banks had become distressed. A vicious circle! The Deutsche Bundesbank shows a way out of this vicious circle.  The purchase of government bonds is not risk-free, so such bonds should be backed up with equity. But then the states will have to pay higher interest rates to offset the risk premium. They reject that. So there is still an underpricing of risk.

In order to prevent banks from incentivising their employees to take excessive risks, the Regulation provides for a maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration for all employees concerned. The bonus may not exceed the fixed annual remuneration of the identified employee, unless the shareholders decide, under certain conditions, to allow bonuses equal to this amount up to twice the fixed remuneration. The new rules also include requirements for bonuses that promote long-term risk-taking. The Regulation also introduces rules to ensure effective supervision by banks' governing bodies and to improve risk management. The composition of the members of the Board of Management requires diversity in order to contribute to effective supervision. The regulation also reduces the dependence of credit institutions on external ratings. Thus, all banks' investment decisions must be based not only on ratings, but on their own internal creditworthiness. I agree with the new capital requirements.

In any case, we have this debate, this last debate on the Rules of Procedure to create a securitisation of public debt prior to tomorrow's vote, on a proposal for a Regulation which the Commission has been presenting some time ago and which has been really difficult. I would like to thank, first of all, the support and closeness and spirit of collaboration of all the rapporteurs in the various groups, because, as I said, it has not been easy to be able to move this proposal for a Regulation until we reached an agreement, validated in our committee a few weeks ago and which tomorrow I hope you will get the broad support of this House. We were now discussing the banking package, which we will also vote on tomorrow, and the need for a safer banking system to avoid bailouts or fiscal crises in the future. But what we are going to discuss now, and we will vote tomorrow, too, is how to avoid fiscal crises like the ones we experienced in 2010 and 2012, because these bailouts created public deficits and those public deficits made it difficult to place public debt from many states, some of which ended up having to call a bailout on the European institutions. It is important to have a secure banking sector, but it is also very important not only to have secure national accounts but also to have instruments to combat and combat these public debt liquidity crises that we suffered in 2010 and 2012. And I believe that the Commission proposal we discussed in this Parliament was a well-oriented proposal, and I also believe that this Parliament has succeeded in improving it. It has managed to give the European authorities greater capacity to monitor these securitisations of public debt, we have given ESMA greater powers, greater supervisory capacity for such products, and I believe that we have improved, in turn, the quality of that senior stretch which is called to become, at least in the short term , in insurance, in a risk-free asset, in a European secure asset that in turn allows banks' balance sheets to be diversified. As I say, negotiation has been difficult in recent months, but we have reached a very broad agreement in this Parliament, aimed at ending the reform of the euro area in the face of the need for instruments that make it difficult, that make it unworkable to live crises like the ones we experienced in 2010 and 1012. It is important to have a secure banking sector, as we have discussed now, but it is also very important to have tools to enable States to deal with future crises without the need to embark on pro-cyclical adjustment programmes that end up worsening Europe's economic circumstances. And so it's a step forward, it's a determined step, but we have a lot to do.

Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities, or SBBS as they are known, are a novel instrument — constructed out of euro area sovereign bonds through pooling and tranching — that could help us advance towards a more complete Banking Union and a more efficient and integrated Capital Market Union. They could in fact boost private sector risk sharing, especially across borders, and equip banks with an additional tool to diversify their sovereign exposures. This would further weaken the nexus between banks and their own sovereign — which proved a major source of vulnerability in the euro area debt crisis.  As you know, the existing regulatory framework includes some obstacles to SBBS, in that they would be at a regulatory disadvantage vis-à-vis euro area sovereign bonds. Our May 2018 proposal aims at enabling them, basically by granting them same regulatory treatment as for sovereign bonds. Importantly, SBBS would, by design, not involve any mutualisation or transfer of risks among Member States, as they are a purely private sector instrument for private sector use.  And I also want to stress that our proposal does not alter in any way the regulatory treatment of euro-area sovereign bonds, rather our proposal takes such regulatory as a give.

Firstly, the proposed rules create greater security, secondly, they create a higher degree of integration – this is particularly important compared to potentially other products – and, thirdly, they create fewer risks for public budgets. Risks are transferred to the private sector by the proposal and at the same time help investors to diversify their investment holdings across Europe and to promote the networking of European financial markets. A hasty and ill-considered communitarisation of risks or losses is avoided. I see a valuable approach in the proposed regulation to build on the foundations laid after the financial crisis.

The last financial crisis is not so long ago, and we should all remember the consequences of unbridled speculation on securitised financial products.  And just as securitised mortgages have not made the financial system more stable in the past, securitised government bonds, i.e. sovereign bond-backed securities, will not be able to make the eurozone more stable, quite the contrary. They, too, are threatening to increase the instability of financial markets in the event of a crisis. They will not be able to help prevent the flight to safe facilities, nor will they help to correct the eurozone's design flaws. SBBS are thus merely a tinkering with the symptom, but not correcting the causes.  The political conflicts, and also the design flaws that are currently hindering a stable monetary union, cannot be circumvented by financial alchemy and technical trickery.  If we want a stable eurozone, we need a central bank that guarantees the government bonds of its members. Germany &amp; Co. must stop digging the water out of their partner countries with their unfair economic policies. We need public investment in economically structurally weaker regions.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has It is strange: ten years ago, I made two major reports on the causes and consequences of the greatest financial and social crisis with a Frenchwoman, Pervenche Berés. I ended the last parliamentary term with a report on the review of the troika in the programme countries with a Frenchman, with Li'm Hoang-Ngoc. And today we are presenting three reports together again, again with a Frenchwoman, Pervenche Berés, and these are your last reports.  At the same time, the Notre-Dame collapses. We could all welcome the reports today. Nevertheless, we are all sad. Because when the Notre-Dame collapses and not just burns, a part of us has collapsed, because we are Europe. We are part of the European Union. We have both always tried to overcome the ideological boundaries and put what we have in common. We have always tried to put substantive work above each other. That's why we were successful. And I would like to thank you, Pervenche, for your work on a day of sadness. One is just going under, the other is emerging. But I hope that the common strength of Europe can also rebuild the Notre-Dame. Maybe not as it once was. But we must never give up. And today's three reports, which we are making together, are already a milestone. I thank you and all the shadow rapporteurs for that.  We are creating new powers for supervisory authorities by pooling new supervisory and control powers against money laundering and terrorist financing, direct European supervision of certain cross-border financial transactions, less bureaucracy and better consideration of different sizes, risk profiles and complexities, more regulatory convergence through better instruments and new – no-action letters – and coordination groups, more consumer protection and the inclusion of sustainable risk factors, more involvement of supervisory authorities in decisions on third-country rules and greater democratic accountability to the European Parliament.  We strengthen governance through greater efficiency and faster decisions and avoidance of conflicts of interest, more tasks and powers of the Presidency, and a stronger role for the European Parliament. With a view to the new EU budget, we note that sufficient resources and staff must finally be made available, and we hope that the Member States will heed our call. And we are improving macro-prudential oversight to better identify systemic risks of all kinds in the future.  The reports are impressive. They are such a qualitative advance only because we have all worked together.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, dear Othmar Karas, this is indeed the second time that we have cooperated and I believe that we have cooperated as well as we did the first time. The Commission had put on the table a good, coherent proposal. If Member States want a capital markets union, then supervisory authorities must be strengthened. It may not be necessary to wait for the next crisis to realize that when you develop a market, it is better to have a gendarme to monitor that market, regardless of the quality of the players. Dear Othmar Karas, when you took responsibility for this report by my side, the child was indeed not doing very well. Some even considered him dead, some of the Member States rejoiced, but we saved him. We have ensured that Member States cannot use the pretext - which was politically useful to them - of progress in the fight against money laundering to be satisfied with it, but that they assume that real progress could not be made in the fight against money laundering without going ahead on the essentials, that is, that the European supervisory authorities are really able to exercise their competence. Perhaps less difficult, but I think it is a step that we must welcome, we have also made progress on the integration of a sustainability mandate. Supervisory authorities, whether in the banking, insurance or securities sectors, will have to examine the sustainability of the models implemented by the institutions. Similarly, in terms of consumer protection, we have taken an important step towards extending it in the area of banking and insurance on the basis of the powers that exist for the securities supervisory authority. I think that is a good step forward. Finally, at the initiative of some of our colleagues, we have introduced a coordination of mystery investigations, which is a good way to protect consumers. Moreover, for each of the authorities, we have improved a mechanism, in this case around the Banking Authority, to combat money laundering: this was normal and fair, until we had a truly independent authority and better coordination. In the area of insurance, we have taken reality into account. Too often, in this sector, shell companies are used to fail to respect consumer rights in other Member States: AEAPP will have stronger powers in this area and I can only welcome that. Finally, the securities authority, ESMA, will have more power to intervene with respect to data reporting providers and transactions in financial markets or benchmarks. However, the heart of the battle was obviously the question of governance. On this point, we have made useful improvements to decision-making to make it better informed, particularly in the event of a potential conflict of interest. The Chairs of the European Supervisory Authorities will be able to decide in the event of difficulties in reaching majorities and will be entitled to a tacit approval procedure for the convergence of supervision, the launch of procedures in the event of a violation of EU law and the settlement of disputes between the relevant national authorities in cross-border situations. Similarly, the authorities will be obliged to set up coordination groups when five relevant national authorities ask them to do so. But let us be honest, and I think, Vice-President, that you will be obliged to share my diagnosis: there is a certain hypocrisy on the part of the Council. He still wants to set up this capital markets union, which we know can be useful in financing the real economy, but when we want to strengthen that governance, we are told that we need to keep supervisory authorities that are \"Member States driven institutions\".

Therefore I am pleased that the co-legislators managed to find a political agreement on this very difficult package within just a few weeks during the trilogues in February and March. This allows this House to vote on this important legislative package still before the recess and brings much needed certainty for financial supervision in general and for the European supervisory authorities in particular. However, I must share the diagnosis that the level of ambition of the political agreement on a number of elements is indeed lower than initially proposed by the Commission.  Nevertheless, this result would not have been possible without the very constructive attitude from Parliament during the negotiations. Parliament has shown in those negotiations that it’s fully aware of the key role of the European supervisory authorities in achieving real market integration. So I would like to say thank you and congratulate the co-rapporteurs, Ms Berès and Mr Karas, for this work and for this achievement. And of course I hope for a positive vote in plenary. In my view this political agreement is a significant step towards complementing the Single Rulebook by more convergence of supervisory practices across the EU. Moreover, as a political agreement it is an important step forward to improve the EU’s anti-money laundering framework, broadly matching the ambition of the amended Commission proposal of September 2018. The new rules will confer new powers on the European Banking Authority in anti-money laundering supervision of the financial sector.  The three European supervisory authorities (the ESAs) have a key role in achieving convergence of supervisory outcomes and to ensure a level playing field for financial institutions and investors in the EU. Supervisory convergence is a precondition for a fully-fledged capital markets union. Truly integrated capital markets can only work properly to the benefit of the economy and consumers if rules are applied in a similar way in all Member States. I welcome that the agreement will equip the three ESAs with new and improved instruments to foster convergence in how the European financial sector is supervised. In particular, I hope that the peer reviews of supervisors will be more effective after this review. Moreover, newly established coordination groups will bring differences in supervisory approaches to light and will allow supervisors to cooperate in order to tackle prudential and level-playing-field concerns.  Finally consistent supervisory outcomes are also facilitated by some additional powers for ESMA, for direct supervision of certain benchmarks and reporting services.  I also welcome the strength and focus of the three authorities on consumer protection, on environmental, social and corporate governance considerations in finance, and on financial technology. Regarding governance, the agreement will contribute to more effective decision-making within the ESAs and I’m confident that the reinforcement of the chairperson’s role and powers will help to improve their governance. Finally, the legislators will equip the three ESAs with the necessary resources for the agreed tasks, even if industry funding originally proposed by the Commission was not agreed. I also welcome the political agreement reached on 21 March on the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) Regulation. The ESRB plays an important role within the European system of financial supervision in ensuring the stability of the financial system in the EU. This agreement will secure the further improved effectiveness of the ESRB.  The compromise found in political trilogues takes on board the majority of the amendments put forward by Parliament, as well as the Council. In particular, it requires the ESRB to carry out public consultations on a more systemic basis and strengthens its accountability. Furthermore, the compromise raises the visibility of the ESRB by giving a stronger role to the vice-chairs and the head of secretariat in the external representation of the ESRB. And as requested by Parliament, the new regulation also strengthens protection for whistle-blowers.

We are very pleased that political agreement was reached on this very important file. The new rules will ensure that powers related to the prevention and mitigation of risks of money laundering in the financial sector will be centralised at the European Banking Authority. The new legal framework will strengthen its mandate for collecting, analysing and further disseminating information to ensure that all relevant authorities effectively and consistently supervise the risks of money laundering and that they cooperate and share information. The authority’s power to act where union law is breached has also been clarified and enhanced so as to guarantee that action can be taken immediately when anti-money laundering rules are broken at national level.

I rise to speak on a report that has been long in hibernation and I had almost given up ever having an opportunity to speak on it, so my congratulations to the co-rapporteurs Ms Pervenche Berès and Mr Othmar Karas. These European supervisory authorities (ESA) reforms are an important step forward as a Single Rulebook with a consistent supervisory approach across the EU by the European supervisory authorities, and will, I believe, contribute significantly to well-functioning of the capital markets. But what is critical is that this reform will entrust the ESAs with greater consumer protection powers that will ensure that toxic financial products will be prohibited, and with additional responsibilities in their mandate on environmental, social and governance factors.  However, I am concerned that this exercise could become meaningless if we do not tackle the issue of money laundering with greater vigour, so I welcome the comments by Commissioner Jourová. European banks have lost EUR 20 billion in stock market value in the last six months, due to money laundering. Banking regulators need to show real ambition in addressing this. Given the powers to tackle this increase significantly, I am mindful that we still have not struck the right balance between the European level and the national level. This is, of course, a very fine line, but it does mean that the Member States have to move on from the status quo. That has been a recipe for a disaster and led to the last financial crisis.

Madam President, Mr Karas referred earlier to the report he had drawn up two or three years ago — perhaps even before — on the role of the troika in Greece, and I think this was an important report. However, the conclusions reached had no tangible effect, since the troika continued the same work in Greece and, at the same time, there was no compensation to the Greek people for what they suffered.

This introduces in itself unacceptable new risks and dangers to financial stability.  But it has to be said that as far as this review is concerned, our Group thinks that the expansion of the powers of the EU supervisory authorities to accompany the deepening of the CMU is absolutely necessary. In some cases we acknowledge that the opposition of certain Member States to expanding the powers of the European supervisory authorities (ESAs) throughout this process has been based on legitimate concerns. But in other cases though, it was based on a reluctance to actually subject a shadow banking and funds sector that thrives on secrecy and on an almost total lack of oversight to any kind of supervision at all.  It’s this secrecy and lack of supervision that actually allows the mis—selling of financial products and money laundering to thrive. The boost in powers for the ESAs, therefore, is something I welcome, but the outcome of the negotiations is far from ideal and should have been, and could have been, more ambitious.

I, therefore, commend the rapporteurs for having been able to defend the common European interests. Indeed, a common European supervision is essential for a common European capital market that allows us to share risks and make our economies more resilient. As with the banking package we discussed earlier tonight, the supervisory structures have to learn from past mistakes and to anticipate future developments, and one of these developments is Brexit. To what extent does Brexit trigger a race to the bottom? The answer very much depends on how much we are prepared to stand together. A stronger supervisory framework in Europe is therefore needed to cope with the consequences of Brexit, but also the emergence of fintech, new legislation on sustainable finance, the fight against money laundering and terrorist finance, and it’s good that the deal addresses these issues. But one word on sustainable finance, because I think there is a role the supervisors they need to play. We know that the risk of climate change and climate change policy are not priced in right now, not on the bank balance sheets, not on the balance sheets of insurances and pension funds and not by credit rating. And they will have an impact on the financial sector. Therefore, the supervisors should take the lead and take the mandate that had been given to them and to press on, making sure that these risks are priced in, and that the financial sector is prepared for the future in the short run, but also in the medium and long run.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. In the European Union, we have set ourselves the goal of regulating the financial market, which is geared to the risk of the business model. This means that financial market regulation should be targeted and proportionate. Nevertheless, we have regulated investment firms for a long time as if they were banks. This is despite the fact that investment firms have a business model that differs in very much from that of banks, including the way they deal with risks. The regulation of investment firms was therefore not accurate for a long time. Correcting this is the aim of the new prudential framework for investment firms. As rapporteur, it was important to me that we take seriously the task of establishing a tailor-made supervisory regime. And that means that, contrary to what some colleagues and some Member States would have liked to see, we are not simply adopting the new rules from the banking package, but are really considering what a sensible framework for investment firms might look like. And in the end, it succeeded. We know three categories of investment firms. In the future, the supervisory regime will differentiate more according to size and systemic relevance. There are three categories for this: large, systemically important investment firms, which are still supervised by banking supervision; medium-sized but not systemically important firms whose capital isation obligations are measured by certain factors relating to the various traditional investment services, the risks of which are more accurately defined; and small and non-interlinked investment firms with a low risk profile and subject to a less stringent prudential regime. This three-stage classification is at the heart of the new supervisory regime and takes better account of the idea of proportionality, which we have already helped to make more prominence in banking regulation. However, the new framework for investment firms is not only more proportionate, but also more robust, especially with regard to the third-country regime. This is particularly important in the light of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, which has already been postponed twice and is planned. After all, more than half of all investment firms active in the EU come from the UK, and thus from a future third country. With the new set of rules, we are ensuring that British investment firms are subject to a strict regime after Brexit if they want to provide their services here in the European Union. We have broadened the list of equivalence criteria, strengthened the accountability of third-country companies to European supervisory agencies and given the European Commission more leeway in examining equivalence applications. In doing so, we have made the third-country regime more robust without fundamentally excluding certain MiFID services. At the same time, we have also strengthened the Commission's accountability to Parliament. So we also know what the Commission is doing. The investment firm review is thus an important building block for making the European financial market architecture ready for Brexit, strengthening proportionality and ensuring tailor-made regulation. Overall, I think we have reached a good and sensible compromise. And I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups, to the Presidency of the Council and, of course, to the European Commission for the good and constructive cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 168, "date": "2019-04-15.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for his work. The review of the prudential framework for investment firms is an important part of the capital markets union (CMU) and banking union. It will set out a more proportionate prudential rule book for the vast majority of Europe’s small- and medium-sized investment firms. It should thus help these firms support the flow of investment in the Union and promote deeper and more integrated capital markets. The revised framework will also ensure that systemic firms remain subject to the existing prudential rule book alongside banks. Amongst these, the largest will come under the supervision of the single supervisory mechanism for their operations in the Member States that are part of the banking union. This will help ensure a level playing field in regulatory and supervisory conditions. Finally, some changes are introduced in how third-country investment firms can provide services to EU clients under the framework of equivalence set out in the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and Directive. These changes keep EU markets open to third-country firms while ensuring adequate transparency and safeguards for third-country operators offering key investment services on a significant scale and who also significantly enhance the role of ESMA in monitoring the activities of third-country firms in the Union. I wish to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for reaching this outcome.

It also corrects the situation by preventing some companies from enjoying national exemptions and from evading any regulation or oversight, as was the case before. The challenge was to divide the eleven types of investment firms identified by the European Banking Authority into three categories or three classes. The first includes the largest companies, those of systemic importance and still subject to banking regulation. The second includes most companies, about 6,000 of them, for which risks are calculated according to the so-called K factors. Finally, the third brings together small, non-interconnected businesses that do not pose a high risk and are therefore subject to very light regulation. It is a good compromise, both on capital requirements, which are proportionate while guaranteeing stability, but also on governance rules. The requirement for many companies to set up risk and compensation committees, and to ensure equal representation of women and men on these committees, is to be commended.

Keeping some investment firms in the existing prudential framework, alongside banks, makes sense when these exhibit bank—like business models and risk features. An open but tightened equivalence regime for investment services adds value and choice for EU clients, while ensuring a level playing field for EU firms and avoiding the Union becoming excessively reliant on firms based in third countries for the provision of some key investment services, notably in the evolving context of Brexit.  I have taken good note of several of your remarks where further changes could have been considered. The new regime provides for an adequate implementation and phase-in period with the possibility to review the provisions in a few years’ time.

On digital taxation, I know you have been vocally supporting our proposal and I would like to thank you for this.  Let me start my intervention by briefly recalling why the Commission presented an initiative on this issue on 21 March 2018. We did it because the underlying reasons remain valid and the problems that we are trying to fix remain unsolved. This has to be kept in mind while working on this issue during the upcoming months. After all it’s simple, international corporate tax rules are no longer adapted to realities of the modern global economy. They do not capture the benefits derived from digital services when there is no physical presence in the country.  The consequence of this inability to apply our current tax rules to these new realities is clear. Today profits from certain digital activities are barely taxed in the EU and this is unacceptable. It threatens the long-term sustainability of our public finances. It disrupts the conditions of competition for businesses in our single market and it undermines the fundamental principles of tax fairness.  This is why we have proposed two ways to ensure fair and equitable taxation of the digital economy.  Firstly, a structural proposal to reform the rules on corporate taxation so that profits are recorded and taxed where companies interact significantly with users via digital channels. This is a comprehensive solution.  Secondly, a more targeted proposal that responds to requests from several Member States for a provisional tax on the main digital activities that currently escape any form of taxation in the EU – the digital services tax. This is an interim solution to apply until the comprehensive solution is agreed.  As you know, Council discussions have mainly focused on this interim solution and we are obviously disappointed that Member States have not been able to reach a unanimous agreement on a proposal for the digital services tax, despite the fact that there was a large majority of Member States in favour. The failure to reach unanimous agreement on this file is largely explained by unanimity rule, according to which Council must decide unanimously on proposals in the area of taxation. As explained in this year’s communication on qualified majority voting, this is just another example of many tax initiatives where the unanimity requirement has hampered the progress needed to strengthen the single market and avoid its fragmentation. In today’s larger, modern and more integrated EU, a purely national approach to taxation no longer works and unanimity is not an effective way of decision-making. This is why we have launched the debate around this topic. In any event, I believe that the complex work that has led us to the near compromise on the digital services tax has not been in vain.  Firstly, it will provide a framework for our Member States which decide to move forward by adopting an interim solution at national level. Secondly, we will be able to examine the proposal on the table of the Council if the G20 and the OECD on the reform on the corporate tax system have reached no international agreement in 2020.  Moreover, the proposed digital services tax has the merit of having accelerated international discussion within the OECD and the G20 on the comprehensive solution. As you know, in March 2018 the OECD delivered an interim report in which it committed to reach a long-term consensus—based solution on the tax challenges arising from that digitalisation of the economy and the remaining [inaudible passage]. We strongly believe that the solution to tax and the digital economy must ultimately be a global one. We have to keep up the momentum for the G20 finance ministers discussions last year.  I will continue to work and engage with the international community and it will be important to coordinate the European efforts in the OECD.  Speaking with one voice will allow the EU to put more pressure on the discussions and better defend our interests. It will be important that in our efforts to modernise corporate tax rules, we avoid repeating mistakes from the past, creating new layers of complexity cannot be a way forward. We need to think of a system that is simple and future-proved. This should not patch the system but really reform it.

While the effective corporate tax rate averages 23% in traditional sectors, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, it is around 9.5% in the digital sector. Tax rulings allow the big digital giants, internet companies, to pay only 1% tax. This is unfair, it is unfair, it creates distortions of competition within the internal market and it weakens small and medium-sized enterprises. As a Christian Democrat and as a supporter of the eco-social market economy, I cannot and will not put up with this. All the proposals to eliminate this injustice and unfairness are generally on the table by this Parliament and, in particular, by the Commission and Parliament, because we have already decided on a European digital tax on online income, because we have already decided to set up a digital permanent establishment. But what do we fail to do? We are failing because of the lack of political will in the Member States, we are failing in the tax havens within the European Union, and we are failing to veto the Council by unanimity. I therefore call on the Member States to put an end to your blockade.

Mr President, I will speak in Dutch. Many people still feel the crisis. Wages lag behind profits. Fixed work is under increasing pressure, while the bill of burdens and cuts has increased. Isn't it cynical that the companies that have grown to become the world's biggest – Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon – pay the least tax? Does it not make sense that many Europeans – more than 35% of those surveyed in Germany, Sweden and Denmark – would have liked to have had a tax on digital turnover? Is it not cynical, then, that the proposal for such a tax on digital turnover has just failed these countries? Three-yard yes. There is therefore every reason to call into question the unanimity in the European Union on taxation. And yet. The proposal supported by the Social Democrats has had an effect. Firstly, the proposal has taken the United States to the negotiating table. That country is now prepared to discuss fundamental changes in the income tax in the OECD international negotiations. And fundamental reform is needed: the income tax comes from the beginning of the 20th century and is not up to globalisation and digitisation. Now Germany, the Netherlands and other countries must be prepared not to hide behind the idea of a minimum tax – which does not provide a substantial response to digitisation and globalisation and is merely a tool – but they must commit to a fundamental reform of the income tax. The European Parliament has already spoken out in favour of such a reform. There was a two-thirds majority for the CCCTB. Secondly, the proposal has led European countries to be tempted to propose a digital tax. France and Austria lead the way. Tributes to that. It puts pressure, necessary pressure on the international and European negotiations. I would like to call on other countries to come up with such a proposal themselves. Send the signal that cynicism will not prevail. Send the signal that the international negotiations will have to succeed.

We have budgetary and social responsibilities that are unique to Europe. The challenge is twofold. Firstly, we must collectively ensure that our public finances are sustainable, and, secondly, we also need to ensure a fair distribution of the tax burden.  We can be proud of what has been achieved together on this file, but we are also aware that the work is unfinished. We also believe that the blocking of the digital services tax by a few Member States in the Council, and previous similar experiences, should be seen as a wake—up call concerning the need for the Union to gradually move towards qualified majority voting on tax matters. The decision—making process on tax matters needs to be resolved.

No one in this House is able to read all this, much less anyone is able to read it outside Parliament, because people still have to make bread, not read everything that the European Parliament writes out. Another consequence of this disease is that we vote in an incredibly hasty, messy way. Votes are sometimes conducted at a rate of less than two seconds per amendment. In practice, the presidents of the deliberations admit that they do not look at the whole room, but at the leaders who sit in front. There is therefore, in fact, a vote in place of other Members, which is unacceptable, because the mandate of an MEP is inalienable. You can't give your voice to others or presume that everyone is voting like the whole group.

The result is that the two epp and socialist member parties, which are problematic in themselves, are completely in love with the nationalist partner. Corruption has intensified in the country.
