Fraud, together with any form of illegal activity that harms the budget of the European Union, must be combated effectively. It is possible only with the use of the right tools, and the selection of appropriate tools is made possible by knowledge of the facts. The European Union budget is intended to improve conditions in all areas of life. Any damage to the budget poses a serious threat to this goal. According to the Commission's 2015 report on the protection of the Union's financial interests, the amount of irregularities reported as fraudulent amounts to nearly EUR 640 million per year. Unfortunately, it can be assumed that the number is in fact even higher as not all cases are detectable and reported. The EU must defend taxpayers' money as effectively as possible, but there are various obstacles to this task. One is insufficient cooperation at various levels, another is the fact that not all countries implement the rules on time. There is also no uniform system for collecting comparable data from Member States. The report that is being debated today highlights a number of issues. I would like to remind you only of the most important ones. These include the amount of revenue foregone due to the VAT Gap and intra-Community VAT fraud, and the fact that only two Member States collect and share statistics on revenue losses caused by cross-border VAT fraud. A worrying phenomenon is the increase in the number of reported irregularities in three agricultural funds for at least the next five years. The sharp increase in cases of irregularities relating to the common fisheries policy is noteworthy. There are also concerns about the increase in irregularities and frauds in spending on cohesion policy. Analyzes of this phenomenon by the Commission and the Member States in line with the ECA's recommendations, they could help to stop the worrying trend. Likewise, the reasons for the high level of fraudulent cases in R&D and business innovation should be explained. Among the problems identified, the most important one is the lack of uniform reporting rules applicable in all Member States. This failure distorts the real picture. Another serious problem is the lack of an information exchange system between competent authorities in order to avoid transnational fraud. They also require special supervision of derogations from the applicable procedures when using funds to help refugees. Undoubtedly, ex ante and ex post controls help to inhibit negative phenomena, thanks to which more and more irregularities are revealed. At the same time, it is worth emphasizing preventive actions: they are easier than recovering funds. The entry into force of the directive criminalizing counterfeiting and putting money into circulation is to be welcomed. When discussing issues related to the protection of the European Union's financial interests, it is impossible to ignore the role of whistleblowers and the need to protect them. Therefore, it should be noted that appropriate internal regulations have been introduced in the institutions of the European Union. Investigative journalism plays a similarly important role. The report also provides a comprehensive overview of the functioning of OLAF, including the results achieved, the duration of the investigations and the analyzes prepared.

The fight against fraud is of the utmost importance for the Commission, as it is for the Parliament. Protection of the European Union’s budget is all the more important at a time when the trust of citizens in the European project and in its capability to bring security and prosperity is at risk. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and in particular Ms Pitera, the rapporteur, for the excellent work done on this motion for a resolution. The result is a comprehensive and well-structured report which covers a broad range of issues. It is also thanks to the political pressure exercised by the European Parliament in its annual resolutions that several issues highlighted in the Commission reports have been addressed and progress has been made at European and at Member State level. Over the last five years together, we have significantly reinforced a framework for the protection of the Union’s financial interests. Let me recall just the most important measures that we have adopted. We have adopted several important acts modernising the legal framework for the protection of the financial interests of the European Union such as the revision of the OLAF regulation in 2013, the package on public procurement directives in 2014 and the four delegated and four implementing acts on irregularity reporting. The legal framework for the programming period 2014-2020 for the first time refers explicitly to the obligation for Member States to put in place proportionate and effective anti-fraud measures. On the revenue side, the revised regulation on mutual administrative assistance in the customs area entered into force, creating new databases to fight better customs fraud. The last and not the least of these legal achievements is the directive on the protection of the Union’s financial interests by means of criminal law, for which a political agreement was finally reached, also thanks to the persistence of the Parliament. But this is not all. There are also important ongoing legal initiatives. The negotiations of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) have moved forward very fast in the last month, and we now have 17 Member States willing to establish the EPPO in enhanced cooperation and a few more making preparations to join it. Like the Parliament, the Commission supports establishing a strong and efficient EPPO with as many Member States as possible and with the necessary means to effectively fight crimes affecting the Union budget. We are convinced that the EPPO has significant potential to improve the current situation as regards the low level of prosecutions for crimes affecting the Union’s financial interests. OLAF will continue to play a key role as regards non-fraudulent and fraudulent irregularities. It will complement and support the work of the EPPO. Beyond the protection of financial interests it will continue also investigations into serious facts by members of the institutions and staff, likely to lead to disciplinary or criminal proceedings. The Commission is determined to maintain a sufficiently strong OLAF which will operate across all Member States and will thereby play a crucial role to ensure that an adequate protection of the European Union’s budget is assured in the whole European Union. Over the last five years we have also made progress on concrete actions and measures. I will mention three examples for which the Parliament’s support, reiterated in the Pitera report, is once more important and particularly welcome. The first is the embedding of anti-fraud measures in national anti-fraud strategies. The second is to extend the use of IT tools by all Member States to strengthen the fight against fraud, and the third is the accomplishment of harmonised and qualitative reporting of the detected irregularities and frauds by the Member States. The Commission acknowledges that the reported data are still not fully comparable and takes note of the request of the Parliament to improve the situation. New guidelines are being prepared in cooperation with national experts to address the most important issues to reduce disparities and standardise the reporting process. The document is expected to be finalised this year. It is by analysing such data that we can ultimately understand whether the measures we have adopted really make a difference. However, there is still much to do. The Commission will keep on fulfilling its role of supporting and assisting Member States where needed and of facilitating the exchange of best practices and know-how. I would like to close my intervention, stressing once more the importance of the Parliament’s resolution. It is by acting together towards the same target that we have achieved all these improvements. But we are aware that we cannot rest on our laurels. We count on you to keep on stimulating, encouraging and also criticising when necessary – the Commission and the Member States – in their fulfilment of the Treaty obligation to protect the Union’s financial interests from irregularities and from fraud.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Caterina CHINNICI", "mepid": "124861", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the meantime I thank the Commissioner for his introduction and I thank Mr Pitera, rapporteur, for the excellent work he has done. The report on the protection of financial interests for the year 2015 unfortunately shows once again a significant increase in fraudulent irregularities and cases of corruption in various areas of interest of the European budget. In this scenario, the PIF directive and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office are now fundamental tools to effectively combat crimes against the financial interests of the Union, but also, and consequently, to combat organized crime and terrorism which, by now we know, they are often financed also through such illegal activities. However, pending the entry into force of these instruments, action is needed to strengthen the coordination capacity between the national supervisory structures and to ensure closer cooperation by Member States with OLAF, given that, to date, one third of the reports of this Office have not yet been followed up by the national authorities. And coordination appears to be the sector on which we still need to work. Indeed, we cannot fail to note the absence of an administrative mutual assistance instrument aimed at improving the exchange of information within the structural funds. In fact, I had already, in the context of my parliamentary activity, reported this need in 2015 but, after two years, this proposal has not yet been followed up, which today appears more necessary than ever, also considering what has been said and underlined by OLAF. Another fundamental profile is that relating to the possibility of arranging for the coordination of joint investigative actions, under the aegis of OLAF, to be carried out simultaneously in the member countries concerned. The European Union has already developed a very important experience in the field of criminal judicial cooperation and I am convinced that exporting this experience also in the area of ​​administrative investigations can represent an added value. All this, however, must go hand in hand with the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office which, as the Commissioner pointed out, will be born through the enhanced cooperation procedure and therefore coordinated action is needed between administrative checks and criminal investigations. Last but certainly not least, in the fight against cross-border fraud is the role that whistleblowers can play.

The report raises many questions. Today we are looking at how well the control and reporting systems for irregularities and fraud are working, and looking at the report makes one rub your eyes. The number of reports of irregularities has doubled - with 81% more damage in four years - but the number of cases of fraud has decreased by 26% in the same period. So if you want to believe that, I don't. That means, the question is: How exactly do we look? And how exactly do we want to know? Commissioner, you yourself mentioned the fact that the Commission feels that this is strange and that it is concerned for the first time because of the comparatively low number of reports. How will the Member States' conflict of interest be overcome? When Member States report fraud, they have to repay the money they received. There is a strong inhibition to report fraud, and the available figures do not allow me to come to any other conclusion than the attitude “We just close our eyes and do not report it.” It cannot be that different Interpretations of reporting practice lead to different assessments of what is fraud and what is irregularity. So here the Commission should actually be much more advanced, and here you should also deal much more intensely with the question of the harmonization of reporting systems! I am struck by the fact that we take note of numbers every year and no one is interested in what actually becomes of the numbers. This year it will be different: we will ensure a follow-up. We also ask how efficient OLAF is. If you look closely at the numbers, then the cases with recommendations have not changed for many years. As long as the OLAF Supervisory Committee doesn't really has access to closed cases in order to deal with the question of the efficiency of OLAF, as long as it does not work.So I think these are major building sites and it would be good if the Commission did something about that too.Something else worries me: 75% of all fraud is detected through administrative controls.This is not a success story, as 25% is not discovered by administrative controls, but by chance.That is a hair-raising number.Here, too, there is an urgent need for action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 13, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Inés AYALA SENDER", "mepid": "28292", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr. president. I wish to thank Mrs Pitera for her report, which again seems to us to be a very interesting report. Although we have to say that what we are waiting for, and we believe that part of the solution that we are demanding, will come from the hand of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. That we would like since, once sixteen Member States have proposed enhanced cooperation, to see if an agreement is reached as soon as possible on the framework, the legal framework, and especially the means and capacities of a European Public Prosecutor's Office proper, which can finally fight really, with all guarantees but at the same time with all means, against fraud as is. It should also be said that we are in a situation in which we are again facing a multi-annual budgetary cycle, with all that are the cycles of funds - including the part of the crisis that has paralyzed a large part of that application. Hence, as Mrs Gräßle very well said, the times, the calendar in which the different Member States are asserting or announcing, denouncing and reporting their irregularities - be they fraudulent or not fraudulent, that I believe that the distinction it is important to do it - it has been quite chaotic. And in that sense, I too believe that an effort must be made, Mrs Thyssen, on the part of the Commission, to ensure that the calendars of the Member States are truly harmonized and comparable. On the other hand, we also have a situation in which there is a contradictory application, I would even say a bit schizoid, of the name and shame principle, because if the figures are very high - as has happened, as has been said - then it turns out that there are to criticize the Member States because what they have denounced was very high; but if the figures are low, they are also reported, because they have not reported. In other words, at some point, Mrs. Thyssen, I think it would be very important that the institutions, we would agree on how it is denounced, on that harmonization and, above all, on who is doing it well or badly, and not do a kind of totum revolutum to end up announcing disasters that are not such, sinceAs you very well said, progress is being made and what we need is to demonstrate these advances in a reliable and clear way.And finally, I would like to ask you for something.Here we are talking, and it is true, of the irregularities of 80% of the budget, which is the shared budget;But we also lack evaluations of a part of the budget that is growing exponentially, as is the case of Horizon 2020 and even of the EFSI guarantees, and in whose new twists and turns we find situations of deep concern: for example, the casethat these days has returned to jump in Spain on the Castor project within the scope of the FEIE.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the fight against fraud against the European Union budget must be intensified, because only in this way can smuggling and various other illegal activities be tackled effectively.

We are still struggling to overcome the effects of the recent financial and economic crisis and some of the consequences associated with the decrease in confidence of European citizens towards the institutions. This dramatically increases the role of the protection of the European Union’s financial interests as one of the most relevant ways to restore its attractiveness. In the relevant annual report 2015 there are several aspects that are of the utmost importance for the achievement of the main goal of the protection of the EU’s financial interests. Firstly, the total number of irregularities detected both by the Commission and the Member States is increasing for a second consecutive year. While there could be different reasons for this fact – including better control, an increased level of spending or simply a rise in fraudulent activities – we need better preventive work by the institutions.  Secondly, the anti-fraud measures undertaken by the EU institutions in Member States should target both the revenue and expenditure sides of the budget. The final goal is to secure better revenue permitting the implementation of stronger policies, while keeping the irregularities in expenditure under control increases the credibility of the institutions.  Thirdly, from a managerial point of view, we need a full implementation of a budget focused on results strategy. In the process of designing and implementing management and control systems, cost effectiveness should be pursued. This means that the control strategies should target predominantly the areas with a high risk and error rate. Thus the control would support the achievement of results without imposing an excessive administrative burden on beneficiaries. Finally, I would like to underline again the importance of the efforts made by both the Commission and Member States in the protection of the EU’s financial interests. All of the fraudulent cases raise public attention and damage the reputation of the Union. The proper functioning of the preventive and corrective mechanisms and adequate action taken by the Commission services to protect the EU budget are indispensable in achieving major results in the fight against fraud.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 16, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Benedek JÁVOR", "mepid": "124721", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear colleagues, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Pitera. We had excellent cooperation during the whole discussion period, and I think that finally the outcome of this discussion is really an excellent report, which I recommend to the Parliament to support. It is important that in the Committee on Budgetary Control there was a broad consensus on the report. It is a good sign that the different political groups coming with different political backgrounds could agree on the most important issues regarding the protection of the financial interest of the European Union. There are several points in the report, and I would like to point out only four important issues from my perspective. First, as was already mentioned, is the question of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). I agree that it is an important progress and development that finally we could agree and that as an enhanced cooperation the EPPO could start its work within two or three years. On the other hand, we have to keep in mind that this enhanced cooperation at the moment consists of 17 Member States, and that some of those Member States who are the most critical, from the point of the view of the spending of the EU funds, are not part of the EPPO, and this raises the issue: how can we put pressure on those Member States where we can experience a high level of corruption, if they are not part of the EPPO? From this perspective I believe that the strengthening of OLAF competences is something we have to do to have the rights and the competences to better control the spending of EU funds in the Member States. The second issue is the anti-corruption report of the European Commission. This was published three years ago, and it was promised that every two years we will see an anti-corruption report. Now the Commission shelved this anti-corruption report: this is exactly the wrong message to send to the Member States and those who are in the corruption business if the European Commission is not doing its best to mop up corruption in the European Union. The third issue is the whistle-blower protection. It was already mentioned that whistle-blowers can contribute a lot to protect the financial interests of the European Union. We have to help them and protect them on the European level, not only on the Member State level. Finally, if the investigative journalism is in line and in parallel with whistle-blowers, investigative journalists can do a lot. Thank you for the rapporteur to support this idea.

We see how easy it is to circumvent the control system when using particular crossings within the Union, so it is essential to cooperate on this issue. Another fundamental issue is that linked to European law in general on organized crime. To date, since there is only one avant-garde country, namely Italy, in the law against organized crime, it is easy for international criminal formations to settle in European states where the law is not at the forefront and therefore take over the ports of the Northern Europe, cigarette trafficking and then, let's see, migrants, where the situation is very difficult and not very transparent.

The present report on the protection of the EU's financial interests also raises very important questions and challenges in the area of ​​tax fraud. As the rapporteur has already said, we can really only tackle tax fraud if the problem is clearly identified and then solved efficiently becomes. The thrust must certainly be to ensure that the funds are used properly and thus to restore the citizens' trust in this area. A major problem in the area of ​​tax fraud is certainly the issue of VAT. The rapporteur pointed out in detail in the report: VAT, at 12.27%, is the most important source of income for the Member States of the European Union and also the Member States. And here we see that in the area of ​​fraud prevention a VAT gap of 160 billion euros is shown every year. Carousel fraud alone accounts for 50 billion of this - more than a third - and thus organized crime. VAT gap means that the outage is caused by both fraud and VAT avoidance strategies. We are also familiar with tax avoidance strategies from other areas. Here, the failure due to tax avoidance strategies and aggressive tax planning in the budget of the Union and in the budgets of the Member States can be estimated at 60 billion euros a year. There are only two Member States in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Belgium, that have statistics on revenue shortfalls due to cross-border VAT fraud. There was also a special report by the Court of Auditors, which found that the EU system was not effective enough and that there was a lack of comparable data and indicators on intra-Community VAT fraud is impaired. However, the Member States have a large number of interesting instruments at their disposal for combating VAT fraud. In particular, there are the following problems: a lack of cross-checking between customs and tax data, problems with the exchange of data between the tax authorities of the Member States and insufficient cooperation between the administrative judiciary and law enforcement authorities. And - what has already been mentioned today: the number of reports of irregularities is increasing - the number rose from 2014 to 2015 and more than a third - the number of reports relating to fraudulent activities has, however, decreased, namely by 11% in the comparison period. I would agree with the previous speakers: You have to follow up on this, that cannot be done with the right things. Another thing to think about: 52% of these fraudulent cases are in the agricultural sector, so special attention is required here.

Like almost all governments in the European Union, Greece is showing an inexplicable and possibly suspicious delay in implementing measures to combat smuggling. Specifically, while since June 2016, it has passed a law for the supply of machines that will track tobacco products from the place of production to the place of consumption, it has not yet conducted the relevant tender. In addition, it has taxed the price of cigarettes and forced tobacco retailers to use electronic payment machines, resulting in banks receiving 1% commission, losing revenue and, at the same time, pushing people to try to find the products. these in the illicit trade and thus endanger his health.

The first is the need that Parliament has already expressed to establish a European anti-corruption code that allows: creating a transparent system of indicators on the extent of corruption in the Member States; publish the progress made to eradicate it; and present a comparative annual report on the state of this scourge at the European level. Far from tackling this task, the report claims that the Commission has stopped publishing comparative data in this regard. And it has done so not only without notifying this House, but also ignoring this very specific agreement of the European Parliament that appears in paragraph 148 of the Report on the situation of fundamental rights in the Union approved on September 8, 2015. The second it is the need to focus the benefits of simplification and reduction of administrative burdens on users. We know of cases in which, after the conclusion of a certain project, such as the European Employment Portal, the project coordinator now sees how amounts unduly paid to one of the partners of the consortium are claimed that, for reasons beyond the project, has gone bankrupt. The Commission cannot resolve your difficulties in interacting with the partner by harming a user and, in this case, the coordinator. Finally, it is essential to improve the data exchange procedures between Member States and to standardize the criteria for monitoring possible infringements and the communication thereof.

When you add irregularities that are not fraudulent, the total amount of money involved goes to over EUR 3 billion. That, of course, is just the known fraud and irregularities because as the rapporteur correctly points out, by definition, there must be more that is not detected. And that is also before even asking the fundamental question as to whether taxpayers got value for money from the cash that was spent.  But this report in a lot of ways beautifully illustrates the European project as a whole, because whenever you have more Europe in one area it will result in problems implementing across 28 countries and the European Union will inevitably have to propose more harmonisation as the answer. For example, you get proposed responses like a European public prosecutor’s office, because the system will fail to function without it, and responses include imposing rules across all 28 Member States.  This is the very essence of the acquis communautaire. Once power moves from a nation state to the European Union in one area, it inexorably follows that powers must continue to flow in that same direction. That is how the European Union is set up. Really, there can only be two honest positions here. Either you support a European super state, with all that entails, and the loss of sovereignty and identity that comes with it. That view is logically internally consistent, and however much I disagree with it, I respect those who honestly hold that view. The other position is to recognise that the alternative is to leave the European Union and to get off the train before it reaches destination super state.

The number of financial irregularities has increased alarmingly: 36% in 2015 compared to 2014. It is an argument for an in-depth analysis, but also concrete measures. I support the report and hope that, once we adopt it, cooperation and cooperation between the Commission and the Member States will be improved, at the same time as between the competent institutions in each state. The analysis shows that the major source of revenue for Member States is VAT. Unfortunately, there is an increased vulnerability to tax fraud in cross-border transactions, Commissioner, and I think we need to focus on where the greatest vulnerability exists. Here there must be close and loyal cooperation between states to eliminate carousel fraud. Customs controls are very important in this chain of fraud detection, but it is clear that they are not enough. I also believe that control procedures need to be improved for products that are mainly used and smuggled because 75% of the total products are: alcohol, tobacco, textiles, electric cars; then there we have to focus on the controls, obviously also on counterfeiting. I welcome the ex ante and ex post community controls in order to detect irregularities that could prevent fraud in the future, but they need to be strengthened and streamlined and I support the rapporteur's position and I also call on the Commission to examine the possibility of Member States risks.

It also requires the courage to carry out in-depth reforms in justice at the level of the European Union.

It also indicates that continuous improvements and enhancements are necessary to bring the fight against fraud and irregularities in line with the expectations of the European citizens. Please rest assured that the Commission is fully committed to continue to strengthen the protection of the European Union’s financial interests and to reinforce our efforts in this area. To ensure the European budget is delivering its optimal impact and value for money, the Commission and the Member States have the duty to make every effort to prevent public money from being defrauded. On your question or your statement that the total number of irregularities detected by the Commission and the Member States is rising again and what the reason is for this, I can only tell you that there is no straight answer to this question. Identifying the main reasons behind increases and decreases in the number of irregularities is always, as you know, a complex exercise. Several factors may contribute to this. In relation to 2015, increased spending, changes in control strategies and delayed reporting have played a role. I kindly refer you to certain paragraphs in the PIF report about this. On fraudulent irregularities, there we see that the number of fraudulent irregularities has been decreasing. I want to tell you here that interpreting the true meaning of the fluctuations in the number of this kind of irregularities reported and in their related financial value is always difficult and could easily be misleading. As observers we tend to associate the positive judgment to decreases and the negative one to increases of detected fraudulent activities. However, we should never forget that we are looking at the Member States’ capacity to prevent and detect fraud. It is the detection efficiency of Member States that counts. Of course, as many of you said money lost due to fraud is money we could use better, we could invest it in useful projects. But we also should know that reporting of irregularities does not always mean that the budget lost the amounts. Member States and the Commission often recover the amounts. Let us not forget that. And then, of course, we recognise that there is a conflict of interests. But let me tell you that we also addressed this conflict of interest among other things in the public procurement directive of 2014, where the definition of conflict of interest is introduced, and I can also tell you that the Commission prepared guidelines with Member State experts on conflict of interests. One Member asked me why the Commission decided to discontinue the anti-corruption report. Well, an effective fight against corruption within the European Union remains essential, delivered through the right vehicle. Fighting corruption has become a key element of the European Semester process. I want to underline that the Commission will take up anti-corruption matters in the context of its main economic policy dialogue between the Member States and the European institutions. This is in line with the general approach of this Commission to streamline processes and focus on key issues in the relevant fora. There was also a question on whistle-blowers and about the state of play on initiatives of the Commission on the protection of whistle-blowers. There I can tell you that the Commission is assessing the feasibility and the scope for European action to strengthen the protection of whistle-blowers. DG JUST is carrying out an impact assessment, has launched a public consultation in March and is about to launch a targeted consultation. The Commission should decide in July of this year what action to propose before the end of the year, before December. Despite my efforts I have probably not addressed completely certain specific or certain technical issues in my introduction or in my reply to your questions, but I can tell you that Commissioner Oettinger will meet the rapporteur, Ms Pitera, at the beginning of June in order to continue the discussion on how to improve further the protection of the European Union’s financial interests.

The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) is a European-wide qualifications framework, which joins the qualifications of different EU Member States together. In a way it is a translation of different national qualifications which makes qualifications in different EU countries easier to understand. As such, the EQF is of key importance for well—functioning European integration and mobility.  According to the Commission, the upcoming review of the EQF will make it even easier to compare qualifications across countries. It will help learners, workers and employers to better understand what a job applicant knows and is capable of doing. The revised EQF is also supposed to facilitate the comparison and understanding of the qualifications of third country nationals.  These are important and admirable goals. Nonetheless, on the revision of the EQF, Parliament has adopted an oral question. The question – or really the questions – reads as follows:  Qualifications differ across the European Union and that makes it difficult to assess the knowledge and capabilities of workers and learners. In 2008, Parliament and the Council adopted a recommendation on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning with the aim of improving the transparency, comparability and transferability of qualifications in Europe. The EQF’s objectives have not yet been fully achieved. Therefore, as part of its New Skills Agenda, the Commission is proposing to revise the system through a new Council recommendation. Question 1: how will the proposed recommendation facilitate equal opportunities in the knowledge—based society and a better permeability between the education and training system? How will it help to match the supply and demand of skills in the labour market?  Question 2: why would the revised EQF work better? Why did the Commission deem a revision necessary, despite the current framework being only partially implemented and Member States’ calls to focus on this? Question 3: how is the framework contributing to the swift validation of informal and non—informal learning? How is the new relationship between ECTS and ECVET expected to work? Question 4: how will the Commission support a consistent implementation of the EQF across Member States, its use and involvement by all the relevant stakeholders, as well as its better visibility? Question 5: by using the EQF as a meta—framework, how will the Commission ensure that the specific features of national training and education systems can be recognised and understood in the other Member States?  Question 6: the growing migration flows to and from the EU highlight the need for a better understanding of qualifications awarded outside the EU and of their recognition in order to help migrants and refugees integrate into EU labour markets. How does the Commission intend to support the development and application of mechanisms to enable the comparison and recognition of third countries’ qualifications? In the resolution by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that will be voted by Parliament on Wednesday, it is also highlighted that relevant stakeholders – such as public employment services, social partners, education and training providers and civil society – should be further involved and closely cooperate in the creation, implementation, promotion and monitoring of the EQF, at EU level and also at national level, in order to ensure its broader support. We have also highlighted the importance of Member State commitment and involvement. So far only the Netherlands and Sweden have specific procedures put in place within their plans for the inclusion of non-formal qualifications. No Member State has specific procedures for informal learning within their national qualifications frames. This is an unnecessary barrier to the labour market. We should always respect national competences and guaranteeing that the distinctive traits of the education systems of the Member States are safeguarded but, at the same time, many Member States are still in the early stages of implementing their national qualification systems. This is too slow if qualifications are to be comparable across Europe. We have to see improvement here if a fully functional EQF is to be achieved. We also need to make sure that employers know how to use the system so that it can truly be the tool that we all want it to be. Improving the EQF is key to achieving our common goals, namely to see that people are not jobless and do not end up in a desperate situation with high unemployment rates. Commissioner, we look forward to hearing your answers to all these questions.

I know that you are currently working on a report on the Skills Agenda and I look forward to reading this. Your question today on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) comes at the right moment, as in one week’s time the Council will adopt the new EQF recommendation. Let me now address the issues raised in your question. Firstly, I want to stress that the EQF is a success story. In the almost 10 years since it was established it has helped to make qualifications more transparent and therefore more comparable across Europe. Twenty-four of our Member States have national qualification frameworks in place and have completed the referencing process of EQF. Others will follow this year. Citizens across Europe are already benefiting from the EQF level on their diplomas and certificates. This makes it easier for their qualifications to be understood in other Member States. This is why phase 2 of the EQF represents an evolution, and not a revolution. Compared to the 2008 text the eight qualification levels remain unchanged. The key principle remains: this is a transparency tool, not a recognition tool. EQF levels will feature on individuals’ diplomas and certificates and Member States, participating countries and social partners, indeed also social partners, will continue to meet at European level to agree the correct referencing of each qualification framework. But the world of qualifications does not stay still. People are increasingly learning in different settings and are rightly demanding that this learning and experience is better recognised. This will happen even more in the future. Qualifications and national qualification frameworks are adapting. This is why the new EQF recommendation proposes a continuous updating of the referencing process in order to ensure that this keeps pace and the referencing remains. As highlighted in your question and in your motion for a resolution on the EQF, equal opportunities and permeability should be strengthened. This is valid both within systems, for example to make progress from vocational to higher education easier, as well as between different systems and countries. I am sure Parliament will welcome therefore that our proposed revision puts a greater emphasis on credit systems to support flexible learning pathways, including by setting our principles for credit systems in a dedicated annex, that is Annex 5 as you know. And of course linked to this, a call for the proper recognition and validation of non-formal and informal learning in line with the dedicated Council recommendation of 2012. Member States are invited by the EQF to incorporate this validation in their national qualification frameworks. Indeed for the EQF what counts are the outcomes of learning, and not the duration or the institution where the learning took place. Ensuring the consistency of EQF implementation is the task of the EQF advisory group. This group, created in 2009, has proven its value in building trust between Member States, and its work will continue. We will continue our work together with the advisory group to better communicate about the EQF and to improve its outreach to citizens and employers. We will also look more closely at the reality on the ground through studies and peer-learning activities. In addition, CEDEFOP will support the EQF process updating, the European Inventory on National Qualifications Framework, and all this should also help to make it more visible. You know that the EQF serves as a translation grid, a translation grid between different national education and training systems. It helps to better understand and compare qualifications that are part of these systems. The EQF therefore fully respects and protects each national education and training system. The goal is transparency and understanding. The goal is not harmonisation. Regarding a better understanding of third-country qualifications, the proposal includes a specific recommendation on exploring such comparisons. We should not have illusions, though. The reference to the EQF requires mature national qualification systems. Pilots to date have been done by New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong, but this is not done in isolation. Migrants and refugees need our help now. Other actions of the new Skills Agenda for Europe focus on practical actions, practical action for a better understanding of the skills of third-country nationals. Next month I will launch a skills profile tool for this very purpose. It will be done on 20 June and this will coincide, as you know, with World Refugee Day. The new EQF also brings more clarity on international qualifications such as sectoral or industry qualifications. This will be achieved by expert and peer support to Member States for their levelling. The EQF has been a successful tool to improve the transparency of qualifications across Europe. It has stimulated Member States to introduce national qualification frameworks and it is a tool which individuals and employers are beginning use: people are referring to EQF levels in their CVs and I hope soon too in job adverts. The new EQF will build upon what we have achieved. It looks to the future to keep pace with changes in qualifications and continues to be at the forefront of skills transparency. Together with the nine other actions of the Skills Agenda for Europe we aim for a joined-up approach which promotes better skills in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 37, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "f’isem il-grupp PPE. - Nilqa ’s-suċċess tal-użu tal-proċess ta’ Qafas Ewropew ta ’Kwalifiċi.

For us this question is very relevant, for several reasons. Learning and the recognition of learning, formal and informal, throughout life are relevant, first, because of the profound changes that are taking place in the labor market, with increasingly vulnerable workers, with more temporary jobs and with a very worrying unemployment in some countries of the European Union; secondly, because the transformations within the labor market force us to make these changes, especially digitization; and, thirdly, because we have new groups at risk, such as people who have come to seek refuge, reception, in Europe, because this path is the path they can travel to enter the labor market. It is opportune to talk about this, it is opportune that we work on it, but there are several issues on the table. One: if we are going to be able to get the Member States to comply with the review, because it is true that with the European Qualifications Framework so far there are several States that have taken steps forward, but not all, and not all equally. Two: if we are going to be able to guarantee accessibility to all groups, also to risk groups, safely, free of charge and with public provision of this training. Three: if we are going to be able to listen to Parliament, because so far there has not been this work of listening to Parliament on this matter.

Internet, distance learning, study travel or volunteer work. Today, these are all ways in which individuals, whether young or lifelong, can improve their skills. However, the diversity of ways to acquire these skills automatically brings with it the need to somehow understand, evaluate and recognize them, so as to improve the individual's choice of employment and at the same time clearly name to the employer what skills the job seeker has. The European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is a tool for Member States to better understand and recognize skills acquired in other countries' education systems, or in non-formal and informal learning. Although the Recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework was adopted in 2008, its objectives of transparency, comparability and portability of qualifications have not yet been fully achieved, and it is therefore necessary to further develop and streamline this instrument in order to make it easier for employers, workers and and learners an understanding of national and international qualifications as well as qualifications from third countries. In this regard, Member States must step up their efforts to recognize formal qualifications and diplomas more quickly and effectively, as well as the additions to certificates and references of the relevant EQF level, and should make the results of the referral publicly available at national and European Union level.

Both the private and the public sector require skills that were almost unconceivable 30 years ago, and in adapting to these changes we should no longer follow old-school ways when it comes to education. Yet our education and training systems lag behind this new dynamic, limiting the recognition of non-formal and informal learning, including the skills gained during volunteering activities. This is damaging, not only in relation to a short-term economic outcome, but also to the main aim of education: generating adaptable and independent individuals able to face the challenges ahead with open minds and confidence. Greater flexibility in skills recognition is beneficial for European citizens, and can also lead to better economic and social integration for migrants and refugees, thus responding to another challenge of the EU. At the same time, through structured dialogues with the EU neighbourhood countries, especially the ones that have an association agreement with the EU, we should aim at referencing their national qualification frameworks to the European Training Foundation. In this way, if sooner or later these countries become EU members, their citizens will be ready to cope with the demands of the European markets and labour force from day one. Moreover, EU support through development aid should be directed to third countries in order to offer assistance in developing national qualifications frameworks.

The first is that we are leveling education systems by adapting them to processes of change towards globalization, which exactly distort what was the true essence of the education system as conceived not only within the European Union, but also in individual Member States. Education should be a moment of personal and cultural growth of young people and today, instead, we are moving exactly to the opposite side, we create an education system that serves the labor market as we want it or as we plan it, made of globalization , made up simply of changes to which not everyone can adapt. From another perspective, it is as if we wanted, or were in some way, treating a terminally ill patient with aspirin because, no matter how hard we can do to be able to stem the qualification problem within the European Union, we know very well what is the underlying problem, the fact that today unemployment is a real and dramatic problem and if we do not start to solve the problems from the base, that is where it is mainly necessary to act, whatever other measure we find, seek or imagine will not be effective nor efficient. If we do not create jobs, if we do not make expansionary maneuvers to support employment and if we do not try to solve the very serious problem of unemployment at all levels, we could talk about all this but it will make no sense, and it is no coincidence that we find ourselves to talk about mobility. I will give you an example by giving you some data: last year 110 000 young Italians left my country because there are no prospects, and believe me, dear colleagues, that the young people who left had qualifications, they had titles, they had skills, but they found a country that doesn't know how to value them.This is the reality, we have to start solving the problems at the root because we build and are building a house starting from the roof, but we never put a solid foundation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 43, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Dominique MARTIN", "mepid": "124751", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Madam President, Mrs Thyssen, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union wishes to set up a European qualifications framework for lifelong learning.

Moreover, the idea of ​​taking into account the three levels of knowledge seems relevant to us. Knowledge, skills and competences can be acquired formally and informally. Unfortunately, the motion for a resolution devotes an entire paragraph - paragraph 7 - to the inclusion of migrants and we strongly oppose this policy, given the 25 million unemployed in Europe, including 4 million young people. On the other hand, we fear that these equivalences will level down and thus devalue our training and our diplomas. Moreover, this question of equivalences raises the broader question of mobility. This better equivalence of skills is in fact used as a pretext for developing worker mobility, thus promoting social dumping, a source of more precariousness. Finally, the European Union has tried in the past to standardize training without any real success and this new system does not seem doomed to be more successful. For all these reasons, Madam President, Madam Thyssen, dear colleagues, we will vote against this text and table amendments so that this framework does not become mandatory.

The tools for assessing the skills already acquired or, even more so, necessary in a changing economy that explores new spaces and new opportunities are a fundamental step to allow an effective crossing between supply and demand for work.

The comparability of knowledge, skills and competencies should be decisively improved. It was possible to establish eight levels of education and thus to cover the entire spectrum of education.

Unfortunately, qualifications acquired abroad, as well as skills developed outside the formal education system, remain unrecognized and underestimated. European citizens suffer from this because it limits their opportunities for professional development, employment and promotion. For these reasons, I believe that the revision of the framework should result in greater visibility of skills acquired outside the classroom.

First of all, I would like to thank the Commission for taking the decision to revise the European Qualifications Framework. This framework has not been fully implemented to date, although it was published perhaps six years ago, and it is worth asking yourself why. After all, the European Qualifications Framework was created as a response to the urgent need to make it possible to compare diplomas and qualifications. If such an important and urgent goal is not met, then there must be a reason, and in my opinion the reason lies precisely in the tool. We have seen how difficult it was to translate the European framework into a more specific national framework, and in this resolution and in today's voices, we hear that they are simply insufficient, that there are new challenges, that there is the issue of recognizing qualifications acquired outside the formal education system. Today, for example, we have probably 40% of specialists in the IT sector, very high-class specialists who acquire their qualifications just outside the formal education system, so there is a need. There is also a need to understand what the diplomas and certificates mean of people who come from outside the European Union and come here to work, so yes, this change is very much needed. I think that these ideas of automatically indicating the level of the European Qualifications Framework they correspond to on diplomas and certificates issued in Europe would greatly contribute to making this framework more popular and more recognizable for the average citizen and employers. I still consider the postulates included in the New Skills Agenda to compare national qualifications frameworks very important.

The free movement of people is one of the key freedoms, and although we may have a different feeling, labor mobility in the European Union is not fully exploited and this option is used by very few people, a very small percentage of citizens.

People looking for a job abroad face a lot of problems, of course mainly with the recognition of their qualifications, but they are not the only ones who have problems.

Therefore, making education and training systems as diverse as Europeans easily comparable will be a very positive step towards our goal. I consider it important that the European Qualifications Framework be deepened and fully applied in accordance with other instruments such as Europass, Eures or Erasmus. As a result, the supply and demand for skills can be better matched to the labor market and companies will be able to more easily interpret the qualifications and competencies of candidates, which will promote the mobility of workers between countries and ultimately help to create jobs.

Let us not forget that, despite all its mistakes, the European Union is one of the most balanced regions in the world. Why is this important? According to the United Nations, the integration into the labor market of migrants from outside the EU, often without even basic qualifications, can take many years, even a decade - just to think about the lack of language skills. To give an example, a technician in a North African country was able to learn his profession on machines that were technology decades ago. The qualifications of this person cannot be practically recognized as equivalent to that of a European skilled worker. As technology evolves faster, these are increasingly real issues. We must not make this a political issue. That is why I particularly support the amendments that protect the high quality of qualifications. This is a fundamental interest.

It is not about automatic recognition or the harmonisation of national qualifications frameworks. Secondly, the EQF revision builds on the achievements of the recommendation of 2008, and it will make the EQF a more effective tool adapted to the reality of today and to the evolving nature of qualifications. And finally, the future success of the EQF is in the hands of Member States and stakeholders, who are in charge of implementation. The Commission’s role will be one of support. I count on your continued support for the EQF and for other initiatives within the European skills agenda.

This recommendation called on Member States to link their qualifications systems and levels to the eight levels of the European Qualifications Framework and, by 2012, indicate the level of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning in newly issued certificates or diplomas. The objectives of the European Qualifications Framework have not yet been fully achieved and the European Commission is already proposing to review the system on the basis of a new Council Recommendation. It would therefore be important to know whether this new recommendation will help to ensure equal opportunities in the knowledge society and better link education and training systems, and whether it will help to match skills supply and demand in the labor market. These issues are important because the EU's education and training systems differ, and it is difficult to assess what a person who has acquired in another country knows, knows and is able to do. Insufficient understanding does not allow confidence in the quality and content of a qualification obtained in another Member State. Lack of confidence in such qualifications makes it more difficult for workers with these qualifications to develop professionally, find employment, reduce opportunities for promotion and further training, and create obstacles to the mobility of workers and learners in the EU.

As long as there are soup kitchens and social supermarkets in our cities, one kilogram of discarded vegetables is too much. As long as our fellow citizens dig in the containers because they are hungry and one loaf of bread that is thrown away is too much. As long as children are starving in Yemen and Somalia and one bag of flour being thrown away is too much. 55 million Europeans cannot afford a quality meal at least every other day. About 88 million tons of food are thrown away annually. A situation in which 20 percent of the food produced is not eaten or thrown away is unsustainable and immoral. The aim of this report is to propose to the European Commission and the Member States policy and practical measures to reduce food waste along the entire production-sales-consumption chain. Maintaining food safety standards is our red line because public health is our priority. The report calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures to reduce the food waste target in the Union by 30% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030. To achieve this, we need official definitions of food waste and loss and a common methodology for measuring these appearance. Parliament considers that when proposing new laws that may affect food waste, the Commission should carry out an impact assessment so that we actually know whether a particular law will have a positive or negative effect. Education is key to reducing food waste. It is estimated that more than half of all food waste comes from households. The report calls on the Commission, Member States, local governments and other stakeholders to carry out educational campaigns to inform the public about the value of food and the prevention of food waste. An example is the misunderstanding of the difference between “use by” and “best use by”. Less than half citizens actually know that there is a difference and that food can still be consumed after the “best to use by” date has expired. We ask the Commission to review the appropriateness of the current labeling system and propose changes if necessary. In some Member States, VAT is still levied on food donations, which is in fact a direct consequence of European legislation. Some countries have circumvented these regulations, but we believe that the best solution would be for the Commission to propose an amendment to the VAT Directive that would explicitly grant tax exemptions for food donations. At the same time, some Member States encourage donations through tax breaks and other economic incentives for socially responsible companies. We believe that such and other examples of good practice should be promoted throughout the European Union. EU funds and programs such as the Most Needy Fund and the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development have the potential to increase donations and reduce losses in food production. We consider these opportunities to be underused and call on the Member States to become more involved in this matter. Citizens' awareness of this problem is at a very high level today and that is why we must not miss the opportunity to act. Honorable Commissioner of the European Commission, Honorable Representatives of the Member States, Parliament is asking you to reduce food waste in the European Union because closing your eyes to this problem is deeply immoral.

Food waste is an issue which is very close to my heart, not only because of my personal history, but also because food waste is unethical and immoral. Indeed, it is shameful to throw away food in a world where more than 800 million people go to bed hungry every day. Therefore we – institutions, industry and science, households, and also as individuals – can make simple gestures to make a real, tangible difference. I hope I am able to show, via my numerous interventions and participation in events throughout the European Union and beyond, that the Commission is fully committed to leading the European Union’s efforts to fight food losses and waste from farm to fork and to make solid progress towards achieving the United Nations sustainable development goal of halving food waste by 2030. Efforts to prevent food waste will not only increase resource efficiency, but will also reduce unnecessary pressure on the environment, reduce costs and really enable surplus food to be redistributed as a priority to those in need. Indeed, tackling food waste is one of the examples with a strong social aspect where successful businesses can benefit our people. By delivering better food, we deliver better health and quality of life. By creating commercially viable business models, we provide jobs. To be successful in all these tasks, we need focused coordination of all relevant policies at European Union and Member State level, which is rightly pointed out in Parliament’s report. I found the report very comprehensive and I welcomed the holistic view taken in the analysis and proposals put forward to prevent food waste and, more generally, to strengthen the resource efficiency of the food supply chain, including the management of water as a key strategic resource of the agri—food industry. I can assure honourable Members that I, together with my fellow Commissioner, will closely analyse your requests for action in the areas of environmental protection, agricultural policies, fisheries, finance, education and communication – to name just a few. I am also glad that the report follows the guiding principle of all Commission action on food waste, which is that food safety and the protection of both human and animal health remain our absolute priority and shall not be undermined or compromised in any way. With its circular economy package and related action plan, the Commission translates this general objective into a set of actions with clear commitments and deliverables.  The first commitment was already achieved when the Commission launched, in November 2016, a multi—stakeholder forum dedicated to food waste prevention, the European Union platform on food losses and food waste. The platform brings together both public and private interests, including Member States, stakeholders and international organisations, to spearhead European Union efforts to tackle food waste. At the first meeting of the platform, Members welcomed the establishment of this unique forum, integrating all players as a means of helping all actors to design ways of eliminating food waste from our food systems. The platform will soon meet again, giving stakeholders the opportunity to share experiences, business cases and successful models to allow their replication in all other Member States and business sectors and possibly bring these up to EU level. The platform is also a forum to help us deliver our next commitment, namely to elaborate a methodology to enable Member States and actors in the food value chain to quantify food waste in a consistent and comparable manner and to adopt, in 2017, EU guidelines to clarify how relevant provisions on EU legislation apply to food donation and to remove barriers, be they regulatory or operational, which hinder the donation of safe, edible food. Moreover, my services are working intensively on guidelines to facilitate the valorisation of so—called former foodstuffs as a safe resource for animal feed. There is huge potential to utilise former foodstuffs such as unsold bread or broken biscuits as animal feed. The guidelines are being finalised with experts from the Member States and we intend to publish them this autumn.  The Commission will also examine ways to improve the understanding and use of date marking by actors in the food chain, including consumers. We are currently carrying out further research and exploring, with Member States, food supply chain operators and consumers, possible ways to simplify date marking on food labels. This is no easy task. Should any changes be proposed in future, we would need to ensure that these, first, meet consumer information needs, second, can indeed make a contribution to food waste reduction, and – most importantly – third, would not put consumer safety at risk.  Finally, let me take this opportunity to thank the House and in particular the honourable Members directly concerned with our work on this report, which I am sure will help us make us significant progress towards our common goals to rescue food and help create a better world.

Around 88 billion tonnes of food are wasted annually in the European Union with the associated cost estimated at EUR 143 billion. It is welcome that this issue is getting increased attention. But we can and should do more. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was of course the lead committee on this file but I felt it was extremely important that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development had a say also. In putting together the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s opinion on the report I want to concentrate on farm waste and how producers can be assisted in tackling it. Finding innovative solutions to the problem of food waste from the farm to the supermarket shelf, to the consumer is in everyone’s benefit. Firstly it goes without saying that no farmer wants to produce waste food. Farmers’ livelihoods depend on getting their produce to the market and loss of produce at farm level equates to loss of investment and income. Therefore farmers can be part of the solution here. Farmer-led initiatives can and have offered viable economic solutions and provide value for products which might otherwise go to waste as well as socially innovative projects such as gleaning and offering food that might otherwise go to waste to food banks. In Europe we import 40 million tonnes of feed yet we waste 89 million tonnes of food. So there is also potential for the use of former foodstuffs, by-products, in the food chain in feed production. But I also recognise the stress and need for increased traceability. The role of retailers also needs to be recognised. We will all have heard stories from producers in our constituencies about farmers having to search for secondary markets at short notice, even plough their produce back into the soil, because the supermarket does not accept their product. This can be for a number of reasons, from standards in terms of a product specification to cancelled orders owing to changes in consumer demand and over production as a result of requirements to seasonal demands.

Globally, some studies show that a third of food is wasted each year. Across Europe, those thousands of tonnes could feed 200 million people. Food waste is ethical, but also environmental, social and economic nonsense. We need to strengthen consumer information, including their understanding of the dates indicated on packaging, on the one hand, and restore value to our food, on the other. Furthermore, research and innovation also have a role to play, both in limiting food waste and in food safety. It is also necessary to encourage the donation of unsold products via a reduction, or even elimination, of VAT, and by the establishment of agreements between economic players and charities to recover these unsold products. But to encourage donations, it will also be necessary to ensure that these food aid associations have the means to collect them, otherwise it would be a blow to the water. I proposed an amendment to the paragraph referring to ugly fruits and vegetables. Part of the waste actually results from the establishment of standards imposed by distributors on producers in order to meet consumer expectations. But I remain convinced that it is necessary to seriously analyze the consequences of these standards both on food waste and on farmers' salaries. However, promoting ugly fruits and vegetables is, in my opinion, more of a sleeve effect than a long-term solution. The supply of ugly fruits and vegetables is random; gold, to make a sector work, you need a sustainable offer.In addition, this paragraph asks to encourage and develop these markets, but what about the farmers who currently supply the fruit and vegetable distribution channels?Be careful not to introduce unfair competition.For me, the solution involves better education and better information for consumers, not to mention an analysis of the consequences of their requests and their behavior.I am nonetheless convinced of the importance of this report and of the need to give it broad support in order to send a strong message.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 75, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "f'isem il-grupp S & amp; D. - Ippermettili nibda billi nirringrazzja, qabel kollox, lir-rapporteur Biljana Borzan, tax-xogħol tajjeb ħafna li għamlet, għaliex il-ħela tal-ikel mhijiex issue politika biss, għalija din hija issue morali, għaliex l-amm jintrema u jinħela huwa litteralment skandaluż.

Large amounts of food are lost every day in the various links of the food chain. The figures are indeed hallucinatory: worldwide the loss amounts to 1.3 billion tons of food per year, about a third of the total food production. In the EU, an estimated 88 million tonnes of food would be lost annually, which equates to 173 kg per person per year. It goes without saying that we have to put a stop to this. Wasting food is bad for people, the environment and the economy. Moreover, food waste is at odds with our ambition to switch to a circular economy, in which we are fully committed to preventing waste and trying to reuse or recycle precious raw materials as much as possible. That is why I endorse the priorities in this resolution: halve food loss by 2030, roll out a concrete action plan to achieve this goal, and focus strongly on awareness and prevention. The keys to success are undoubtedly the involvement of all players in the food chain and an important role for regional and local authorities so that tailor-made solutions can be delivered. Flanders, the nation that I represent here, is taking the lead and has already developed its own action plan to reduce food loss by 15% by 2020. All actors, from farm to fork, are represented in a chain consultation. Numerous interesting initiatives are being launched, such as the Chefs Charter of Horeca Vlaanderen or the Green Vent Scan. The donation of food is digitally facilitated via online platforms and apps. The expansion of the 0% VAT rate for the distribution of unsold foodstuffs also has a positive effect. In addition, consumers receive all kinds of tips, information is distributed about the best-before dates and “ugly” fruit and vegetables are once again making their appearance on the shelves. The mandatory collection and recycling of bio- waste and encouraging home composting are important in the fight against food waste.A recent visit with some colleagues to the Ecowerf composting plant in Leuven shows the enormous possibilities in this regard.In short: the fight against food waste is a matter for everyone, and governments must set a good example.Let's work on that together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 77, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Ulrike MÜLLER", "mepid": "124862", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, dear colleagues! Our food waste topic today is an urgent issue that concerns us all. 53% of the food thrown away comes from private households. In this context it should not be forgotten that we in Europe do not all live in total abundance. Around 55 million Europeans cannot afford a full meal even every other day. Nevertheless, to illustrate: every European throws almost two kilos of food into the trash every week, and in addition there is the same amount of waste that is generated in the upstream area of ​​the food chain. The European Union has declared war on this waste. The aim is to cut food waste in half by 2030. So far, however, we have lacked the basic instruments for this, Commissioner. We therefore appeal in this report to come up with a uniform definition and measurement methods as soon as possible. That is the foundation on which we can design measures. So far we have 29 regulations, 10 directives, 14 documents from at least seven policy areas - you mentioned it - and we have to act as quickly as possible. Two topics are particularly close to my heart. First: Consumers are the key to success, which is why we need to create more awareness of the problem, bring nutrition education back to the fore, and make important information more accessible to consumers. Among other things, the shelf life must become more understandable. I only mention the two key words best before date and consumer date. Of course, we can rely more on new media and thus better reach the younger generation. Second, food donations must be simplified. For me that means that we have to see the food chain stakeholders as part of the solution and not as the cause of the problem.It is up to us to create a positive framework for donations and thereby activate voluntary commitment.With this report we are providing important impetus for this.I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs very much for the good cooperation.We have seldom been so closed in an own-initiative report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 78, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Merja KYLLÖNEN", "mepid": "124736", "text": "On behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, thank you to my colleagues for their excellent cooperation.

There is much to be done about food waste, but we need to define things first in a mutually agreed way so that Member States and stakeholders can measure it more accurately and develop ways to reduce waste and use the rest otherwise, for example by donating edible food to those who need it. Poverty-induced hunger can be alleviated with surplus food that has been found to be safe, but it means that surplus food must be made sensibly available to people.

That is why I am glad to hear your words today, how you and other commissioners will work diligently on this, and I eagerly await the trialogue, because as a shadow rapporteur for the Greens, I have succeeded in introducing a binding goal for the European Union in food waste.

We send and create one environmental problem. And we know how weak individual Member States are still in achieving the goals that we ourselves have defined, and that the Commission has defined in the circular economy package in terms of reducing waste disposal by 2030. Of course, the burden should be borne by all, politicians, citizens and the economy. But one thing is certainly important, that it is crucial in our policies that we adopt that through innovation, through technology, we enable not only less food to be wasted but also that the packaging in which that food is packaged also does not end up in landfills it doesn’t happen to burn in incinerators because we are witnessing that by 2030, two million people a year could die from the consequences of actually burning waste.

I of course support this text, which insists on the need for a clear definition of food waste in order to be able to quantify it and limit it as much as possible. Likewise, it is more than urgent to ensure that citizens better understand the difference between the statements \"to be consumed until\" and \"to be consumed preferably before\", as misunderstandings could be the source of a problem. absurd waste. On the other hand, it is commendable that this report sees variable pricing based on deadline as an effective tool. Indeed, financial incentives are always preferable to a punitive approach. I also support the idea that supermarkets, but also local governments, must play a vital role in reducing waste. The latter are best placed to promote short circuits and local products, especially among young people. At the same time, it is essential to ensure that all food approaching the expiration date is donated to charity, which clearly is not yet taken for granted.

This leads to the conclusion that the problem of hunger is not primarily a problem of food production, technology and raw materials, nor climate change, but above all a crisis of morality and a crisis of policies implemented both globally and within countries. Today, more than ever, we need new policies geared towards people, not profit. We need rational resource management and sustainable management.

Equally high are the associated costs: carbon emissions, water pollution, soil and ecosystem degradation. All these are consequences of overproduction.

There are several ways to achieve this, but the primary responsibility for this naturally lies with the consumer. Clarity about best-before dates can help consumers in this regard. Recent research from Wageningen University has shown that if expiration dates on long-life products such as rice, pasta and coffee are omitted, this leads to 12% less waste. It would therefore be good for the Commission to seriously consider whether it is possible to expand the European list of products that are exempt from a best before date. Flexible regulations regarding food donation could also be interesting. However, we must be careful that the safety and quality of food is always a priority. Food safety must never be compromised. In addition, I am a strong supporter of initiatives whereby the government and parties such as catering companies and supermarkets work together to reduce food waste. We must encourage and welcome these promising initiatives. Where necessary, see whether laws and regulations can be amended without incurring entrepreneurs with unnecessary bureaucracy.

Europe has committed, with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, to halve this which is one of the most unbearable economic, environmental and ethical contradictions, but to date nothing is foreseen in European legislation.

Two: to support the achievement of this goal with the specific actions that have already been mentioned, but also with a specific hierarchy for food, which privileges human consumption through donations. The waste is not only that of final consumption, but that throughout the chain, from agricultural production to food processing, from distribution to catering, and it is there that we must make it more convenient for companies to donate to those in difficulty rather what a waste. Finally, to encourage the use of organic waste that can no longer be donated as a secondary raw material for new products. So, the invitation I make here, both to the Member States and to the Commission, is to share this urgency that Parliament is also expressing with this further and important report, to find a solution starting with the circular economy package, today under negotiation.

It is good that we talk about production limitations, but these production limitations have to be associated with the concept of food sovereignty, because what cannot be is that they do the same to us as with milk: do not tell us - to Spain - that we have to produce less milk so that our foreign milk market is invaded, because that does not make us more sustainable, it makes us poorer.

We disregarded that in Germany, for example. Not only were large biogas plants funded there, which then invest in residual materials such as liquid manure or leftover feed and bring them in, but maize is grown there, and 10% of our area is now used for purely energetic use, and I believe that energetic use on This waste hierarchy must end.

After all, they are raw materials that can also be used for industrial processing.

Because 60% of what is wasted in our homes is avoidable, which would save 565 euros a year or remove one in five vehicles from circulation, thereby reducing pollution. For this, we need a consistent labeling of food, which avoids the variation between 28 and 35 days in the expiration date that the same foods have in different places or that the time of this expiration depends on the market demand. We need packaging with adequate quantities for consumption, stimulate the reuse of food and modify the VAT Directive, which prevents donations from being exempted for food banks. We also need to work to change quality standards and thus avoid the numerous waste that is produced in food. These are, therefore, all ambitious and appropriate measures.

It is right to try to do something about food waste. Food is a valuable commodity, and if food is wasted, it is incredibly expensive, because we don't just waste a specific food, but everything that has been put into the cultivation and production of this food: soil, water and of course energy , Fertilizers, sprays etc. It is not only expensive, it is also environmentally harmful. Because it is harmful to the climate if we produce much more than we ultimately consume ourselves, because we simply throw away a large part of what we produce. And of course it is extremely ethically questionable, above all against the background of the fact that the world population is growing so rapidly, the arable land cannot be increased and we have to think about how we can use the available land Feed the world and not just ourselves. The problem we have when we deal with the topic of “How do we avoid food waste?” Is that there is no internationally valid definition - not in Europe, and obviously not internationally either. And unless there is such a definition, it will be very, very difficult to determine how much the individuals in the food chain contribute to this food waste. We must be careful not to confuse the loss that arises in agricultural production with waste. There are inevitable crop losses, and there are also almost inevitable storage losses due to insects and fungi. One could certainly get a grip on this through the use of genetic engineering. But that is mostly not really wanted in Europe. And of course you can't do it in the processing either Process 100% of a piece of fruit or a vegetable. There, too, there is always waste, and that is more likely to be attributed to loss than to waste. But one thing is clear: the main culprit is actually ourselves, we consumers. I count myself among them. We are not sacrosanct and we are not always the victims. We have to realize that the best before date does not mean that I have to throw away the food. This is what the use-by date is for. But there is a lack of information about this, and this is where our Member States at home are called upon. But we also need to have information at home in the Member States about the value of a food itself. Because people are so urbanized nowadays, including in Europe, they no longer have any access to the actual value of food. Food is valuable - many people in the world who are in bad health know that.

debate and I am grateful to this House for taking such an active interest in this important issue. May I say a few words? First of all, the Circular Economy package published in 2015 includes European Union level initiatives needed to support implementation of the food-based prevention programme by all actors through the whole food value chain. The proposal for revising the Waste Framework Directive requires Member States to reduce food waste at each stage of the food supply chain, monitor food waste level and report back on the progress made in preventing food waste. But I would like to mention a couple of points which were raised in the debate. First of all, Mr Škrlec mentioned the European Court of Auditors’ conclusions. The Commission cannot agree with these conclusions and regrets that the works done together with Member States since 2012 has not been fully recognised. We have identified the most efficient actions to take at EU level to combat food waste and want to remain truly ambitious. Given the multifaceted nature of food waste prevention, we have sought to engage both with private actors and public entities through all relevant fora, including expert groups with Member States and various consultative groups with stakeholder participation. This inclusive approach resulted in the Integrated Action Plan to tackle food waste adopted by the Commission as part of the Circular Economy package in 2015. Moving forward, the Commission will continue to strengthen its supporting efforts in the European Union Member States, notably through the European Union Platform on food losses and food waste, bringing together both public and private interests. Launched in 2016, the platform will support all actors in defining measures needed to prevent food waste, share best practices and evaluate progress made over time. I would like to strengthen, of course – some mentioned mandatory targets for food waste reduction. But the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to halve global per capita food waste by 2030 is our food waste target, so no additional aspirational target was deemed necessary. We need to measure food waste consistently before binding targets can be proposed at EU level. The Commission’s proposal for revising the Waste Framework Directive requires Member States to measure food waste once again and to use indicators and targets set at national level to monitor progress in food waste prevention. Some mentioned definition of food waste. Food and waste are already defined in the EU regulatory framework, and an additional legal definition of food waste is not necessary. What really matters is a clear description of the material which constitutes food waste at each stage of the food supply chain. The Commission is therefore elaborating a methodology that will illustrate, in the light of EU definition of food and waste, which material may be quantified and measured as food waste, taking into account, amongst others, exemptions as defined in the Waste Framework Directive, and the definition proposed by the European Parliament will be further discussed internally within the Commission and with Parliament and Member States to ensure a satisfactory outcome. Some of course also raised questions about food donation. Food donation is local by nature: food which is available for donation has to be collected and redistributed to charities in a very short time in order to avoid any possible issue of food safety and ensure that food reaches those in need. For this reason, Member States and their local authorities are those best placed to directly intervene in this issue. The EU food donation guidelines seek to address the specific issues and obstacles encountered by Member States and stakeholders which need to be addressed at EU level. By focusing on better implementation of existing EU rules, the EU guidelines on food donation will support Member State authorities and stakeholders in ensuring the redistribution of safe, surplus food to those in need. Of course, also Mr Piecha and some others mentioned issues on VAT. Value added tax is governed at EU level by the EU directive and must be implemented in international law. VAT legislation can sometimes have implications for food donation, and the Commissions has worked actively with the Member States to clarify how VAT rules apply to food donation. In line with the guidelines agreed by the VAT committee, the Commission recommends that, in the determination of VAT for the donation of foods, the value of those goods should be adjusted according to the circumstances and the state of the goods at the time of donation. The Commission considers that, when food donations are made close to the ‘Best before’ date or the goods are not fit for sale but can be safely consumed, these circumstances should be taken into account by Member States when determining the VAT due – which could even be zero. Changes in the VAT Directive are not being considered. In its 2011 communication on the future of VAT, the Commission set out its policy to make the system simpler, more efficient and robust. A broadening of the tax basis important in achieving the goal set in producing new exemptions would run counter to the policy. You mentioned questions about better use of date marking. The Commission is working actively on this issue and initiated in 2016 a new study on date marking practices to help inform its work. It is important to promote a common understanding and use of date marking amongst all actors. This study will investigate how date marking is utilised by food business operators and by regulatory authorities and possibly-related impact on food waste. Outcomes of the study will help inform future policy-making. Any future changes to EU rules must meet consumer information needs, ensure food safety and make a meaningful contribution to food waste. Let me conclude by expressing again my gratitude to Ms Borzan and the shadow rapporteurs. The report, as well as your views and opinions expressed today, will, of course, be given due consideration by myself and by my services. We will continue to work together with our partners in the Member States and stakeholders towards our common goals, remove needless waste of food, and save our resources.

The numbers on food waste are staggering, especially considering how many millions of people are malnourished or starving today. I believe that it is the moral and political responsibility of the European Union, one of the richest and most prosperous communities in the world, to reduce the huge amount of food thrown away every year. Based on all this, the report of the Committee on the Environment is very important and timely. One of the key objectives of the decision adopted today is to facilitate the work of non-governmental and church organizations involved in food donation, as donating unsold food throughout the supply chain not only results in a significant reduction in food waste, but also helps those in need. I am very pleased that the plenary report contains my amendment encouraging the use of the funds provided by the European Union's Food Aid Program, the FEAD, to deliver surplus food. In many regions, especially the disadvantaged ones, the biggest challenge is to deliver existing food to those in need and to set up and operate the right logistics.

Personally, I hope that the issue will be looked at as holistically as possible. As an example of this, I see that, for example, negligence in animal welfare should be counted as a loss: the death of farm animals due to ill-treatment, inadequate care or other negligence should be counted as “loss”. Information enables action, and in solving the problems of our food production, that information must be as comprehensive as possible.

The rules for crossing it should be the same everywhere, but in some places this border is weaker than in others and this situation creates a distortion of commercial traffic from abroad and a detriment to the financial resources of the European Union. The resolution of which I am the author is a parliamentary document which puts this situation on paper and was prepared with the invaluable contribution of fellow rapporteurs for opinion and shadow rapporteurs in the INTA committee, whom I want to thank everyone. Madam President, there are European ports where customs controls are rigorous and careful, others where they are less so. This situation creates unfair competition between shippers, port administrations and states, which Europe cannot tolerate. Investigating I found various types of distortion. There is the case, for example, in which the same European legislation is respected, but applied in a different way between different countries. There are some ports that run on the thread of the legality of European standards and there are also those that just do not respect the rules, enjoying, for certain periods, the connivance of a part of the national authorities. An example is the gigantic scandal that broke out a few months ago, when it emerged that tons of Chinese counterfeit goods had crossed the European border into the United Kingdom and then poured without controls into France and Italy, where they caused losses of 4 billion euros in VAT. not collected, not to mention the prejudice to the entry of the European Union, which amounts to approximately 2 billion euros of lost customs duties collected due to the lower declared value. This situation undermines the foundations of European trade policy. When we negotiate free trade treaties, in when we tell citizens that they don't have to fear products that are dangerous to health and the environment, we need to be sure that we can deliver on this promise and that we can effectively control goods entering Europe. Unfortunately, this is not the case because Europe allows some countries to apply the rules differently or to turn a blind eye to part of Community law. This is why in the resolution we ask for an intervention by the Commission to ensure the harmonization of controls and the uniform application of the law, to identify differences in treatment between economic operators, to continue the path of computerization and interoperability of databases at European. We also ask the Commission to measure the impact of these different customs practices on inbound and outbound trade flows and to work in the WTO to promote the implementation of the international agreement on trade facilitation and finally to cooperate on customs matters. with the main commercial partners. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to write this resolution, I met with operators from many ports in Europe and Italy, collected their testimonies and brought their concerns to Brussels. For this I would like to thank all the people I met in the area and, in particular, the Customs Agency, the port authorities, but also the freight forwarders and terminal operators of Genoa, Trieste, Taranto, Palermo and Gioia Tauro and, last but not least, the health and phytosanitary offices that have lent their contribution. Finally, a special thanks goes to the Guardia di Finanza, the police, all those European civil and military forces that carry out customs control activities at the borders. I am very keen to thank them and to tell them that my resolution aims to highlight the legislative gaps between our countries, but in no way wants to question the excellent work that these forces are doing for the safety of goods on our territory.I hope that the Commission will follow the recommendations we have formulated, both for the protection of European citizens and for the protection of shippers, economic operators and port activities, but also to protect competition and to protect the dignity of commercial policy..", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 135, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, the customs union, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next year, is at the core of the EU. Vigilance and constant effort are needed to cope with ever new challenges to its functioning. They concern the safety and security of EU citizens and come with new trade patterns like e—commerce. Let me briefly refer to some of the points raised in the report. First, on governance, in its communication of December 2016 on developing the customs union and its governance, the Commission outlined a strategic way forward. Stronger partnership between EU institutions and Member States, between customs and other border authorities, and between customs and trade, is a major priority. The Commission will report biannually to Parliament on the implementation of this strategy.  On uniform application, harmonised customs rules and electronic data exchange and processing are essential to the uniform application of the customs codes throughout the Union. In consultation with stakeholders, the Commission is preparing the necessary guidance.  On IT systems, we are working hard with Member States towards full integration of customs IT systems. In the meantime the transition will have to be properly managed. IT systems are also needed to support our customs cooperation with third countries. On customs simplification and controls, we are committed to developing customs simplifications in combination with risk—based controls. This is reflected in the legal provisions of the Union Customs Code (UCC) and in the EU strategy and action plan for customs risk management. We are also reflecting this position in our negotiations of international agreements to strengthen both trade facilitation and customs cooperation on controls.  E—commerce and rapidly increasing volumes of small shipments are a major challenge for authorities. We are working with Member States, partner countries, international organisations like the World Trade Organisation, World Customs Organisation, and traders to find innovative solutions. Duty and tax evasion and avoidance are a major issue. We must develop coordination between customs and tax authorities and the relevant IT infrastructures with a view to improving the effectiveness of controls as well as accelerating trade. On customs enforcement of intellectual property rights, the entry of counterfeit goods into the EU remains a major challenge. We have legal instruments in place. However, we need to redouble our efforts, in particular when it comes to closer cooperation between customs and the police and the implementation of risk management. On customs infringements and sanctions, I would take this opportunity to thank the Committee on International Trade for its support in the directive on the common framework for customs infringements and sanctions, which is crucial for uniform application of customs legislation and for respect of our WTO obligations.  Finally, I would like to confirm the Commission’s continued commitment to working closely with the Parliament so as to ensure that EU customs policy is effective, proportionate and fit for purpose, both within the EU and at international level.

The role that customs services play in the global trading environment, coping with the damage done by the illicit trade to the formal economy is indisputable. Illicit activities have a detrimental impact on economies in terms of growth, jobs, foreign investment and integrity of markets. At the same time they generate large sums for transnational organised crime. In order to eliminate the negative influence, the quality and performance of customs control on the transit of goods, particularly at ports and borders, is of high priority. It is necessary to ensure that there are homogenous control techniques among Member States for filtering at ports and borders by promoting modern risk management best control strategies.

The customs authorities play a significant role in how the provisions of both the multilateral and bilateral agreements are administered.

The customs union is undoubtedly one of the first achievements of the Union, but it is not over: we are far from achieving an adequate harmonization of customs controls. In some sectors, economic operators look for European ports that establish lower inspection and control and sanction requirements, allowing the entry into our markets of products that do not comply with European or environmental or phytosanitary requirements and, of course, allowing the entry of counterfeit products and illicit goods. And these divergences are allowing not only unfair competition with our industry but also between European ports, by penalizing those who demand greater requirements and controls, and are causing market distortions, trade traffic diversions and, of course, an environmental impact. negative. This situation, I think we all agree that it is inadmissible. And it is avoidable and depends on the political will to defend our Union. The European Commission, the Council, the Member States have to do whatever is necessary to achieve a truly perfectly harmonized customs union. And the European Parliament too. So we are here, bringing this magnificent resolution, introducing concrete measures to help solve this problem. The European Union effectively needs to harmonize the inspection criteria and the number of controls at customs; you need to establish indicators to assess customs practices. And I argue that it is necessary to ensure that we have a European control body that truly guarantees harmonized treatment at the Union's ports of entry: it cannot be such a complicated process that we continue to experience the situation that is taking place . Necessary also improve coordination between customs authorities, OLAF and EUIPO, and harmonize sanctions and strengthen cooperation to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights.Illicit trade - we have already said - also contributes to the financing of criminal organizations dedicated to terrorism, money laundering, drug or arms trafficking.In conclusion, the European Union needs harmonized controls, inspections and sanctions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 139, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Martina ANDERSON", "mepid": "113959", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, this report calls for harmonisation of controls at all points of entry into the customs union and for increased surveillance and security measures.

This is not counting farms that straddle the border nor houses where you enter the front door on one side of the border and leave it through the other side. Now during the conflict in Ireland cross—border smuggling was a daily occurrence. Among the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement was that smuggling was dramatically reduced. If the might of the British military could not close the border, EU customs officials will not be able to close it; mission impossible. So bringing back customs posts on the border in Ireland will be unworkable as well as politically unacceptable and also an invitation to smugglers to set up shop on the border. Increased surveillance and security will be a direct threat to the peace process if the controls are located on the border in Ireland.

So, of course, there are issues. I also note that a recent report by Transparency International shows that, sadly, corruption is the norm and not the exception in public life, ranking 176 countries across the globe for corruption. We see that in the European Union there are countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom which all come out in the top ten, but there are other EU countries – and I will not name names for the sake of fairness – which are ranked lower than the one-party communist state of Cuba. So, when we talk about clamping down on illicit trade at EU level, there is immediately an issue. And when we look at the EU accession countries – the countries that the EU wants to absorb – the corruption levels seen there are ones that, frankly, would make Al Capone blush and, indeed in one case, are even worse than Iran.

I believe that our two institutions share the same objectives of wishing to have a strong customs policy, which is to first facilitate and accelerate legitimate trade and at the same time have efficient controls on the ground which ensure the safety and security of citizens, making sure of stopping fake or dangerous goods, drugs, explosives and arms from entering the EU market. I would like to underline that the Commission recognises the importance of the external dimension of customs policy. In the recently published reflection paper on harnessing globalisation, further investment in EU customs risk management is seen as one of the means of responding to the challenges of globalisation and ensuring a level playing field. I would like to address some of the points made during the debate. It is true that further work is needed, particularly with regard to strengthening cooperation at all levels, with economic operators, with Member States, with trading partners and also internally with other EU agencies and Commission services. But I can assure you this remains top on our agenda. The Commission will also endeavour to cooperate with other law enforcement administrations in order to achieve a harmonised and integrated control approach. This is the only way to both ensure the safety and security of citizens and to protect the financial interests of the EU. We should also remember that customs intelligence is also invaluable to law enforcement authorities and security agencies and should be fully explored.

I am slightly surprised at some positions, especially my colleague from the Greens, who spoke of harmonization as a problem for the states that are already the most virtuous today. Here, I believe that harmonizing customs controls is, on the other hand, an opportunity especially for those States that are more virtuous today and among these, I also recall Italy, which has a primacy in terms of the severity of controls. Another thing that I would like to point out again to Commissioner Dombrovskis and which has not been mentioned is that we do not need to have only more efficient checks, which certainly will have to be done, but above all it must be recognized that we need uniform checks. This does not depend solely and exclusively on problems linked, as I explained at the beginning of my speech, to illegality, therefore to corruption, but there are also different practices linked to different sensitivities. As I said, during the missions I carried out in the area, I was able to see how there are different technical sensitivities, for which the operators carry out the shopping forum linked to the fact that in certain ports some counterfeit goods would never enter, as the operators are more sensitive about certain topics, and can do it elsewhere. We need to make customs clearance practices more streamlined, faster for operators, but we also need to make sure that it is not possible to bring in goods from a different port simply because there is not the necessary knowledge. some things.

First of all, I would like to thank you for the good and extremely constructive cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs and everyone who has contributed to the report. As rapporteur, I very much welcome the Commission's new eGovernment action plan for the years 2016 to 2020. With our vote tomorrow, we as Parliament are sending out an important signal that we want to support and promote the digitization of public administration and public institutions. With this report we are calling on the Member States to make the public sector fit for the future. Our aim must be to modernize administrative processes and to remove bureaucratic hurdles at all levels. In the age of digitization, the internet has become a part of our everyday life that we can no longer imagine life without. The further development of electronic services and the provision of public online services are therefore imperative in order to improve and make services more efficient for citizens, but also for companies, especially small and medium-sized companies. Digitization makes it possible to make new forms of public services more easily accessible and to guarantee accessibility. A central access portal through which citizens and companies can also have cross-border access to all information and administrative services is a very important step. Another element is the once-only principle, in which citizens and also companies enter their data once and do not have to repeat the same information over and over again. In this way, dealing with authorities can be significantly simplified, and cooperation between different bodies can also be significantly facilitated. Further progress also needs to be made in the area of ​​electronic public procurement Member States are made. This way, bureaucracy can be reduced and more transparency and efficiency can be achieved in the allocation process. Among other things, the implementation and further development of electronic signature systems and the development of standards to enable the interoperability and portability of data sets are important here. To this end, the public authorities must cooperate more closely at all levels. This can lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of public services. In spite of all efforts to push ahead with the digitization of public administrations, we must not forget that still not all Europeans have the same access to the Internet or the necessary digital skills or the necessary trust in digital offerings to use the online services of the public administration also to take advantage of. That is why broadband expansion is a basic requirement for the targeted progress in the eGovernment action plan, particularly in rural regions. We have to give citizens and companies adequate access to the internet so that they can participate in the new forms of electronic administration. In addition, digital skills must be promoted through training and further education opportunities. These competencies have to be developed especially among employees of public bodies, as they are often not so-called digital natives. As long as there is a need for personal support when dealing with authorities and administrative tasks, these services should also be guaranteed in addition to the online offers so that something like this is still possible in the online and offline approach, because we are allowed to use them Don't leave a citizen behind. Citizens should therefore also be offered improved opportunities for further training that also impart digital skills accordingly. An essential point, however, is that especially when handling sensitive and personal data, data protection is generally guaranteed.In this way you can strengthen trust in online services and encourage more people to contact their offices via this route.The eGovernment action plan is an important step towards leveraging the potential of digitization in public administrations and services, improving cooperation and efficiency, and thus making services more transparent and better for citizens and companies, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 154, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "- I would like to start by saying that I welcome the new action plan and that online public services are a priority for the 21st century.The digitization of public administration and the digitization of public administration procedures is absolutely key to our future.I also welcome the demand that, by 2022, all public administrations be open and transparent.It is a relatively ambitious goal.I would also like to welcome the demand for the digitization of health services, because these health services can improve the quality of life of citizens.Cross-border eGovernment is crucial for the realization of all 4 freedoms that underpin the EU.In general, I would like to welcome this action plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 155, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Julie WARD", "mepid": "124963", "text": "   – Madam President, we are now seeing a giant, international cyber attack wreak havoc on private and public computer systems across the world, including the National Health Service in the UK.

There is more to eGovernment than just putting up websites and offering public services online. Its impact is much more far—reaching. It is a key enabler in achieving the transformation of Europe’s public administration, contributing to growth, competitiveness and quality of life. One major achievement of the first year is the proposed draft regulation on the single digital gateway, which also introduced the once—only principle at European level. With the addition of five new actions to the Action Plan, the mid-term review of the digital single market confirms this. The challenge is not to introduce digital technologies into public administrations, but rather the integration of digital technologies into public sector modernisation efforts. It is its transformative nature, impacting all levels of government and various public policy domains, that has great potential to bring significant benefits. The smart use of ICT by governments can help deliver better policies and decisions to tackle the pressing social and economic challenges of our times. By becoming more open and transparent, government and public bodies become more accountable and trustworthy. This report provides an additional layer to the topic of eGovernment in general. Indeed, it provides further food for thought in terms of developing future actions to be included in the Action Plan in the coming years. I am encouraged that all EU institutions share a common vision on what the future of eGovernment will look like. This vision can only be reached if all stakeholders embrace it and commit themselves to working together to make it a reality: governments, public bodies at all levels – European, national, regional and local – and also industry, business and citizens. The European Parliament is uniquely placed in this mission. On the one hand, it can communicate to its constituents the benefits of this digital transformation. On the other hand, it can work together with the Commission in adopting eGovernment—related legislative proposals. One of the key themes of the eGovernment Action Plan is that the Commission shall lead by example in applying the underlying principles of the Action Plan, such as digital by default, cross—border by default, and applying the once-only principle. The Commission is taking its commitment seriously and also offers Member States, local and regional administrations and other stakeholders financial support to accelerate the digital transformation of government. This is being done through various programmes, including structural funds, the Connecting Europe Facility and Horizon 2020, and I am confident that Parliament will also wish to lead by example and it can count on the full support of the Commission in advancing the digital transformation of government.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 167, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow.Written statements (Article 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 168, "date": "2017-05-15.json", "name": "Enrico GASBARRA", "mepid": "124817", "text": "in writing. - The modernization of the internal market is one of the fundamental commitments of this European legislature, which is proceeding in several sectors and which certainly needs a strong impetus from the national public institutions themselves.

As the report puts it – digital first. I would add European-in-design – interconnectivity, interoperability, cross—border by nature – key to a true European eGovernance. The EU has to make sure that the furthest villages and islands are connected to high-speed internet, developing 5G networks to be available to everyone as soon as possible. Being connected should be a right, not a privilege! Investing in resilient, trustworthy and sustainable e-solutions may seem costly at first, yet the long-term benefits in administrative, financial and communication terms will prove to be worth the initial costs. Equally, investments are needed to dramatically increase the level of digital literacy and cyber hygiene. Citizens need reassurances, full transparency and accountability on how their data is treated to make full use of e-solutions.

The visa waiver is a positive gesture on the part of the EU and will hopefully inspire Ukraine to implement effective reforms. Ukraine borders seven countries, and its gateway to the EU is the westernmost county, Transcarpathia, which borders four EU member states. Much of the traffic to the EU passes through here, but border crossings are already congested, their infrastructure is outdated and there are few of them. Thus, despite the visa waiver, it will not be easy for citizens to get to the European Union. In addition to visa-free travel, it is therefore essential to develop border infrastructure and areas, to open new border crossings, to modernize the railway and road system, and to include it in international traffic. It is important to end the hours of waiting at border crossings. Citizens with valid travel documents must have dignified travel conditions when entering the European Union.
