As I told you last Thursday, this week's plenary session will be held exceptionally here in Brussels because of force majeure.  I took this decision on the basis of the report of Parliament's Medical Service, which, following a thorough analysis of the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic (the coronavirus), established that the transfer of the European Parliament to Strasbourg for plenary would represent a significantly higher risk to our health and that of the local population. I have therefore noted that the necessary conditions were no longer in place to ensure the safety of all participants in the plenary. The decision to hold the session here in Brussels was taken in the spirit and intention of continuing Parliament's work and not interrupting legislative activity. I would like to thank the French authorities and all those involved in this process for their cooperation. I would also like to thank Parliament's administration, which has been following this matter for weeks. We are experiencing a difficult time for our institution and it must be the commitment of everyone – of all Parliamentarians and of all political groups – to protect parliamentary activity, so that our democratic life can take place. Our governments and the European Union itself are asking our citizens to make sacrifices, and we too must set a good example: we must do everything possible, as long as possible, to ensure the continuity of the legislative and budgetary function: the decisions to combat COVID-19, to support work and the economy, which are hard-hit at the moment , but also to continue our work on the Green Deal, immigration and the multiannual financial framework. All this requires us to remain in our place. Our closeness at the moment goes to all the Members who are in the red areas and who cannot move. For those who are not in the same condition, my invitation is to follow the recommendations of the authorities and, at the same time, to consider staying in Brussels at this time in order to minimise travel. We know that travel, as we have been able to ascertain from the checks we have made, is a cause for concern. We must honour our parliamentary mandate and pay tribute to all those in Europe and throughout the world who are doing their daily duty to stem the spread of the disease. I am convinced that with responsibility but also with pride we will rise to this challenge. For these reasons, I have today convened an extraordinary meeting of the Conference of Presidents and I thank everyone for their cooperation and spirit in this matter.  We have decided to amend the final draft of this plenary's agenda as follows: the March part-session will consist only of tomorrow, Tuesday 10 March, and will be structured as follows: from 9.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m., council and Commission statements on the coronavirus epidemic. Of course we want Parliament to be present and to be an actor and a protagonist in this battle. In the afternoon from 3.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m., there will be statements by the European Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on the multiannual financial framework: we know that Parliament is an actor in this matter. Next up will be the Statements by the Council and the Commission on the migration situation at the Greek-Turkish border and the joint response that the European Union wants to give. These amendments were approved at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents and, of course, as everyone understands, we want Parliament to remain open and functioning but, of course, we need all the necessary precautions and to reduce our work to the essentials. That is why the sitting is now suspended and work will resume tomorrow at 9.00 a.m. Thank you for your cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 1, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-03-09.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   I declare the 2019-2020 session of the European Parliament concluded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}]
