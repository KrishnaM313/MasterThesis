First of all, I would like to thank the journalists involved in the leaks and revelations. They did a splendid job and this was investigative journalism at its best. It seems that the British media magnate, Lord Northcliffe, was thinking about Panama and other leaks when he famously said that ‘news is something someone wants suppressed’. Indeed, those who carried out the barbaric murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia aimed to suppress a similar kind of revelation. In my view, the work of journalists was not only key to the issues related to taxes and money laundering, but it was part of global proof of the paramount importance of traditional journalism in times of disinformation campaigns and distorted or entirely fake news. I am proud that the European Parliament took the baton and established its Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion (PANA Committee) and has been delivering. In particular, those citizens who feel left behind and abandoned by globalisation and other developments may see the behaviour of some rich individuals and companies implicated in leaks as further evidence of the injustice of the world they live in. The European Parliament, after thorough investigations, puts forward clear recommendations on how to improve the situation. Furthermore, it has already presented some of these recommendations, the Commission has made some proposals and the Member States have taken some steps in the directions indicated. Last week, for the first time, the EU published a list of tax havens. It took time and it has certainly not expanded, as some expected, but it is a first and important step. Stricter rules will apply when doing business with the listed countries as two important proposals made by the Commission refer to this list, namely the public country—by—country reporting proposal and a proposal on transparency requirements for intermediaries. Stricter reporting requirements will apply for multinationals with activities in listed jurisdictions or for intermediaries designing tax schemes routed through a listed country. To be credible, we should not only look outside the EU. Speaking about Member States, nothing is all shiny there. I would not perhaps go as far as Oxfam and consider Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands to be tax havens per se, but some Member States are not very helpful in the fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance and for fairer taxation in general. Tomorrow there will be another – hopefully final – trilogue meeting on the revisions of the Anti—Money Laundering Directive. This is an essential piece of legislation and, in my view, the one that directly answers the Panama Papers revelations. One of the remaining key issues is the level of public access to the register of beneficial owners of companies and trusts. The PANA Committee is in favour of the widest possible access without limitations. One of the significant PANA recommendations relates to the financial intelligence units in Member States. They must be strengthened and have appropriate resources and personnel at their disposal.  Before I conclude, I would like to thank Jeppe Kofod, my co—rapporteur, and the shadows and other colleagues for their work and cooperation. It has been a lot of work and we must get the best out of it in tomorrow’s vote.

I would also like to be able to thank the Council, but I have to say that it has been very difficult for us in the PANA inquiry committee to have sincere cooperation with the Council. One of the things we should do is reform the way in which we deal with corporate tax policies in our European Union. The Panama papers, as you all know, were at the time the largest leak – 11.5 million documents. It revealed that a corrupt global elite of politicians, celebrities and corporate leaders had been corrupted and that they do not only put themselves above tax laws, but also above the law as such. We looked into that world in the PANA Committee. We have seen that many heads of states and governments have used opaque structures to hide their assets, to avoid taxes, to do money laundering, and even to carry out criminal activities. This is really detrimental to the trust in our societies and to democracy. Therefore, we need to act on behalf of the citizens to clean up the mess that we have seen in the Panama Papers. Our conclusions are clear. We have seen that EU legislation has not been properly implemented by Member States or enforced by the Commission, for example the Anti-Money Laundering Directive or the Directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. We have seen that the Commission lacks resources and enforcement in this area; we have seen that some Member States grant golden visas to ultra-rich people and do not carry out the due diligence that they should. We have seen that sweetheart deals for big corporations multinationals like Apple, Nike, Starbucks and Ikea have been done by Member States. We have become caught in a sick race to the bottom on taxation and on regulation, and also sometimes on lack of implementation of our own EU legislation. Some of our EU Member States work to dilute and to avoid taking real steps in this field. We have had a secret working group in the Council – the Code of Conduct Group (Business Taxation) – for more than 20 years and they have not proven that they can end these harmful cross-border corporate tax regimes. In our recommendations, we are clear that we need to see open doors and transparency, not only in the way we make corporate tax policies and anti-money laundering policies within the European Union, but also when it comes to intermediaries, banks, lawyers, wealth managers, accountants, the whole industry that lives to put these schemes in place. We need a public EU register for beneficial ownership. We need a tax Europol to have true law enforcement for the people who commit these crimes. We need also to see that tax advisers face real sanctions if they engage in illegal behaviour. We need to end secrecy, tax secrecy and tax havens, and we also need to see that whistle-blowers are protected much better in European Union and also that we support investigative journalism that is doing the job that politicians should have done instead. What we see tomorrow is very important. We have in our recommendations 211 concrete recommendations to fight international tax evasion, tax avoidance and money laundering. Tomorrow, we will see which political groups and which Members of this Parliament are ready not only to talk, but also to vote and to ensure that we have a progressive stand in this Parliament. Now it is time to act, and we want a minimum corporate tax rate in Europe in order to end the endless race to the bottom on corporate taxes and regulation. We need a good and sound list of tax havens, not only in third countries outside Europe, but also in our own family. We need to clean up our own mess within EU Member States and ensure that they also fulfil the highest standards. We have four countries in the EU, and we need to take action to ensure that they also fulfil the highest standards in order to fight tax evasion and avoidance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  I thank both rapporteurs for their work on what is, in my opinion, one of the key items on the agenda of this plenary.

This cycle - this political sequence - began very early in your mandate and also in mine, which has been marked by an almost uninterrupted succession of shattering financial scandals. Each time this European Parliament met with the TAX 1, TAX 2 and, today, PANA committees. I would of course like to extend my sincere congratulations to the two rapporteurs, MM. Kofod and Ježek, to the commission of inquiry, to its chairman, Mr. Langen, and to all of those who contributed to the report we are discussing this morning. If the work of the PANA commission is now successful, I sincerely hope that the dynamics it has generated continue. I know that your Parliament wishes to continue its work in this regard. He will do so with the full support of the Commission and with mine in particular. When it comes to tax fraud and tax evasion, the job is not finished, and I would go even further: it is never finished and will never be finished. The imagination of fraudsters and their ability to invent new mechanics are endless, so the fight must also be endless and relentless. More scandals may come, and I would even say, alas, no doubt, because human nature is so made, and so is the greed of some. This will call for a new determined response from our institutions, from the Commission and Parliament in particular. The implementation of the real advances that we have made in recent years must be effective, and we still greatly need the political impetus given by this Assembly to bring the many proposals that are on the table to fruition. In short, if this cycle ends this morning, the political momentum, that of priority to the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, tax optimization and aggressive tax planning is not complete and must not run out of steam. It would be all the more regrettable if the European Commission and Parliament worked - as you know - in close collaboration, not to say hand in hand, with the PANA committee as with its predecessors. Two weeks ago, I myself was before the PANA committee to take stock of our progress after having discussed at length with the ECON committee on our fiscal agenda. What I can say, three years after the entry into force of this new commission, is that this collaboration has borne fruit: we have already imposed a complete paradigm shift. During these years - this is an international movement - from a culture of secrecy to that of transparency, from compartmentalization to cooperation between administrations. It had never been done before. There is nothing to be complacent about, the fight is not over, but we have come a long way and it would be absurd not to say so. We were able to do all of this thanks to your support and our common work. I therefore wish: that tomorrow we can continue on this path and even deepen it. It is Parliament - like any Parliament - that must decide on the organization of its work and the form it will take. To make further progress, we are of course inspired by your proposals, which echo the driving role that we want, that I want to continue to play by your side against tax fraud and tax evasion. I will therefore start by coming back to some of your proposals to show how the agendas and priorities of our institutions are already converging, and then also show how we can go further. I will classify them briefly into two sets: the actions which aim to make the exchange of information between tax administrations the norm and those aimed at pushing transparency down to the smallest detail and into the smallest corners. As we all know, the automatic exchange of information is crucial in preventing multinationals and some, usually wealthy, taxpayers from trading between national tax codes. Your report rightly points out that our system needs to be further strengthened on this point. Major progress is already visible on the ground, with the generalization of the automatic exchange of information. This began to apply for certain categories of income in 2015. The first automatic exchange of information relating to financial accounts took place at the end of September 2017 and, in June 2018, the first automatic exchanges of financial account will take place. information of a fiscal nature on the activity of multinationals. When implementation fails, the Commission does not hesitate and will not hesitate to intervene. For example, we have already opened 18 infringement proceedings for failure to transpose the directive on administrative cooperation: one for what is called DAC 1, 13 for DAC 2 and nine for DAC 3. Idem for the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive: we have already initiated infringement proceedings against 16 Member States for failure to transpose. Everyone must of course do their work so that the results can be achieved at all stages: proposal, adoption and effective transposition in the field. Obviously, this task is not finished. Several projects are open and launched to further advance the automatic exchange of information. I therefore presented, less than 15 days ago, a proposal to develop cooperation and trust between European administrations in order to more effectively investigate cases of VAT fraud. You know that this VAT fraud, in particular cross-border, is passive and represents 50 billion euros of losses for our national budgets for the benefit of organized crime and probably also the financing of terrorism. The Paradise Papers further shed light on the extent of this fraud in some jurisdictions involving luxury goods, such as yachts or private jets. I say in passing - I will come to this a little later - to those who tell us \"but you do not put European countries on your list of tax havens\" - I will explain - that these are indeed European practices of which I speak and that we must banish and fight. We must propose to strengthen the powers of what is called \"Eurofisc\", which is also the cooperation between the tax and customs administration, their European partners, such as Europol, OLAF and the brand new European Public Prosecutor's Office. I know that by doing this we are stepping a little on the beds of the sovereignty of tax administrations and that there will be resistance. However, if we do not move from the culture of everyone for themselves to a culture of cooperation and transparency, also between administrations, then we are not doing our job. I am therefore sending our Member States and their tax administrations a strong message that this cooperation must take place. Your report also mentions the cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs) which play an essential role. In June, the Commission published a report and recommendations which identify all the obstacles to this cooperation. We will actively support the work of the Financial Intelligence Unit Platform. We also plan to come up with an initiative to improve cross-border sharing of financial data. Next to the automatic exchange of information, which - I repeat - is the mother of all reforms and the essence of all progress, we must now even more transparency. The \"Panama Papers\" and even more the \"Paradise Papers\" have highlighted the role of intermediaries in tax avoidance and optimization schemes. Your report notes a lack of transparency - and I was going to say almost by definition - about these aggressive optimization schemes. We share it fully. We must shed light on these arrangements between friends which bind, in the greatest opacity, multinationals - not all multinationals -, consulting firms - not all consulting firms -, law firms - not all law firms - and banks - not all banks. I say this because I think we should avoid stigmatizing professions. I totally understand why they take offense, but at the same time we have to separate the wheat from the chaff. Those who do their jobs with absolute respect for the law and ethics and those who fail to do so. This is why the Commission proposed in June that intermediaries systematically report to the tax authorities in their clients' countries optimization schemes that meet certain characteristics - not all schemes, some characteristics. These data will be accessible to all Member States to further strengthen cooperation between administrations. I said it before the PANA committee, I will say it again here in the plenary: I call for the adoption of this fundamental proposal by the Member States within six months. Let's not waste time, it must be done entirely during this term. Finally, the mandatory country-by-country public declaration, which we proposed last year, will also be a major step forward. I insist on the term \"public\": I think that today, to refuse transparency, to plead opacity is something totally archaic, which belongs to the past. These are old protective reflexes that don't correspond to anything today. Opposing transparency and competitiveness is a poor alibi. Yes, we have to go to the public declaration and we have to go quickly. Forcing large companies to disclose the details of their activity in each country where they operate, or rather asking them to do so, will allow everyone (citizens, journalists, parliamentarians, NGOs) to exercise their right, which is a power of control. The latest scandals remind us to what extent the role of this transparency and of these actors of public control is fundamental in bringing fraudulent practices to light. I take this opportunity to really salute the work of the media, of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, without whom we would not have made so much progress. While European cooperation in tax matters is absolutely necessary, it is certainly not sufficient. We know that multinational corporations or wealthy individuals use global tax schemes to evade taxes. In this regard, I want to stress, of course, the list of third countries at high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing - this is a fundamental tool. Another fundamental list is the first list of tax havens, adopted by member states last week. I want to say it very frankly here. This is progress: 17 countries have been identified for breach of good governance standards, but above all - because it is at least as important - 47 countries have committed themselves at a very high political level to reforming their tax system and meet the criteria of good tax governance. It is therefore a dynamic that must be welcomed. However, it must also be said that there are shortcomings or incompleteness. I ask the finance ministers to avoid any naivety about the commitments of the 47 countries of what can be called \"the gray list\", which must change their tax laws as quickly as possible. This needs to be watched very closely and, if not, darken the situation. I therefore wish to appeal here formally and solemnly to the Member States on the monitoring of these lists. I call on them first to define dissuasive national sanctions. We must do everything to keep the pressure on the member countries, the principle of \"name and shame\" (denounce and blame) is a first step forward, but we must go further. This is why it is necessary to examine the immediate effects of the adoption of the list and its impact on the triggering of the European Fund for Sustainable Development, on that of the European Fund for Strategic Investments or more generally on the financial regulation of the Union. . These issues must be resolved quickly. This applies to European funds; this also applies to international financial institutions, such as the EIB or the EBRD. I also call on the Member States - I am finishing this, Mr President - to keep the follow-up of these first stages in a tight and precise timetable. In three months, we should be looking at the hurricane-affected countries - we've given them a deadline, then you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. Six months from now, we need to review all of the commitments and make sure they are kept. In a year, we will have to review the list by removing those who have kept their promises - that is the goal - and add those who have not kept their word. I know that on some benches - I understand them all the better as I share this - and beyond this chamber, some were hoping for more from this list. I share those expectations, but I believe in taking this list for what it is - a positive first step - and going further. I know in passing the question of our own Member States arises. I say it again here in Parliament - I know it does not generate much media attention, but it’s the truth: you cannot compare the situation of any country in the European Union with such and such a tax haven, ie systemic and systematic which is on our list. But there are practices in our Member States that must be combated, and saying that they are not tax havens does not mean that we must let these practices continue to continue quietly. No, when there is VAT fraud or when there is suspicion of fraud in Malta, the Isle of Man, when there is legislation in the Netherlands which appears to have already been condemned, I say \" speed up ”. We must therefore be absolutely rigorous with this and not confuse practices to be combated or banned with belonging to a list. Ladies and gentlemen, it was not my ambition to cover all the recommendations in your report, it would have taken even longer. It is very comprehensive, but I wanted to recall the main lines of the work we are doing to guarantee more efficient and fairer taxation in the European Union, in accordance with the expectations of our fellow citizens and your recommendations. I also know that you and I know that going further will also require changing the rules of the game from unanimity to qualified majority voting. All this your report says or suggests, and I thank you. I repeat my availability to you to continue to cooperate fully with your assembly in the fight against tax fraud, avoidance and optimization. I know that, in this fight, the Commission and Parliament are moving forward, once again, together. I know that, for you, this is a sine qua non and, for me, an absolutely indispensable support, for which I would like to thank you by welcoming, once again, the work of the rapporteurs and the committee.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Luděk NIEDERMAYER", "mepid": "124701", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, tax policy should be one of our key economic priorities, and it is, unlike in the past.

We have introduced new measures such as the Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (ATAP), we improved cooperation through the Directive on Administrative Cooperation and we are improving our efforts to fight money laundering through amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. We have also improved transparency, which is a very important part of this fight, and a lot of initiatives such as the Common Corporate Tax Base (CCTB) and tackling VAT fraud are on the table.  So progress has been made, but, as was revealed in the work of the PANA Committee, the mission is far from being completed. We need to improve enforcement, as was suggested, for example, in the Azerbaijan Laundromat hearing. We must make beneficial ownership information more available in order to fight money laundering, and the EU should use its soft and hard power more effectively to influence other countries.  Last, but not least, the Finance Ministers must agree to dismantle tax practices that are not in line with the mutual interests of the EU. At the same time, over-politicising the issue, proposing not functional, or even bad, measures that make good headlines and no progress, is not the way forward. That is why I believe that in the plenary vote we will substantially improve the report of the committee and the report will get broad support.

Now, at the conclusion of the work of the Panama Committee of Inquiry, it is necessary to draw a conclusion. I think what we can establish is - as it was after the work in the special investigation committee TAXE - how important it is that we, alongside the member states, as the European Chamber of Citizens - as the European Parliament - against money laundering and state-organized tax avoidance, Drag field. Why? The Member States' Code of Conduct Group and other forms of cooperation between the Member States are inadequate. No Member State picks out another's eye like the crow. That is the experience that we have had in recent years, and only if we as the European Parliament move forward resolutely here, regardless of which government is in power in a member state, will we also succeed, against tax havens and places where the fight against money laundering is not carried out in the way we imagine it to actually proceed. As the Chamber of Citizens, we have the opportunity not only to show the member states their limits, but also to get them to act. As the European Chamber of Citizens, we are in a position to develop public pressure, which behind closed doors certainly does not arise when the Member States discuss these things.

Since the establishment of this special commission, seven fact-finding missions on money laundering and tax fraud have taken place, from February 2017 to September 2017. In addition, twenty-nine ordinary meetings, sixteen coordinator meetings and a series of public hearings. All this was in an extremely tense and strict time frame. The reports in the PANA Committee have shown how important it is to have appropriate vigilance and oversight systems. Although there are still many problems, some more serious than others, I would like to welcome the efforts of the Member States, which are actively working to combat illegal taxation and money laundering schemes. It is especially important to talk about tax havens and tax havens. It is important to remember that great efforts are being made and significant progress must be made. This is especially important in times like ours - with countless new forms of threats to national security, citizens, etc. Money laundering schemes are not only used for personal gain, but as we all know - to finance terrorist activities very close to our doorstep. Achieving a balance between not hindering economic development and maintaining our security is not an easy task. But every effort must be made to protect the citizens of the Member States of the European Union.

But Daphne Caruana isn't even; Besides being with the multimillion dollar lawsuit problem she was murdered. And her family has contacted us to say that they still need an independent commission of inquiry and are not being informed. So we named a room after her to recognize her memory, but we have to do something else. In this committee we have had to review the existing European legislation and its actual compliance, both in fiscal and financial matters. We have had to assess what is wrong in the fight against money laundering; how capital disappears in public finances; how it is possible to finance terrorism, drug trafficking or sexual slavery. They are the most serious crimes, those that most attack freedom, those that most attack the rule of law. And the dens of financial secrecy collaborate with intermediaries in rich countries, where these great assets are located. Some of the smartest tax advisers, lawyers, financial institutions, auditors and managers of large capitals and wealth have in fact acted as facilitators of evasion or avoidance.

A specific demand of the Panama Committee of Inquiry has already been met, namely the black list of states not willing to cooperate, which has been available since December 5th. Many were disappointed that there were only 17 states on it, not a single EU country, not even relevant tax havens such as Guernsey or Andorra and not even the USA, which do not want to cooperate with the European tax authorities. On the contrary: just recently five EU finance ministers sent a letter to the US finance minister warning that some of the regulations proposed under the new tax reform would violate the WTO rules and the agreements of the OECD in the fight against Tax avoidance violation. The black list is still having an effect; Of the 92 countries asked, 47 have promised to cooperate with the EU tax authorities and to adapt their tax legislation and have ended up on a gray list. In the future there will even be sanctions against these states, from freezing EU funds to measures at the state level. The black list is only one requirement of the report of the PANA committee of inquiry; many other points are still open. There is a great need for action here, because aggressive tax planning means that European households lose 70 billion euros in revenue every year. From a financial point of view, VAT fraud is a major issue, accounting for 150 billion euros. And the digital economy, where the Council adopted new rules on December 5th to make it easier for online businesses to comply with VAT regulations. The fight against money laundering will be countered with the revision of the fourth money laundering directive. Likewise, there should soon be proposals against mediators.

If the financial and tax planning sector gets too much power, everyone will eventually lose. There are also many other important points in the PANA report. I call for the development of a common definition of tax havens, better regulation of free production areas, raising the level of ambition of money laundering surveys in third countries, strengthening the code of conduct for companies and tackling tax evasion and avoidance intermediaries.

Since the start of this mandate, you have known that this is also a high priority for this Commission, and it is certainly mine. Together, we have done - this is undoubtedly due to a context, but it is also due to a will - more in three years than in the previous twenty years on this front, thanks to the journalists - to whom I pay tribute - , thanks to whistleblowers - whose role I recognize - thanks to Parliament, thanks to your work, and I also hope a little thanks to the Commission. What are the successes that we have already achieved over the past three years? Let’s not neglect them, don’t make it seem like we’re starting from a clean slate every time, because it has a bit of a discouraging side. The automatic exchange of information relating to financial accounts, and thus the end of banking secrecy, is still a real revolution for a whole generation or generations. The country-by-country declaration for business is not yet public and I call again on the Council to move in that direction, but it does exist. The two directives for the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion which will, little by little, prohibit a whole series of reprehensible mechanisms, some of which - it's a bit of an optical illusion - are already a thing of the past, while their effects are revealed. I welcome the adoption in Council last week of the VAT proposal for e-commerce, which will also reduce fraud. So you can see that we are moving forward. We advance, sometimes with big steps, sometimes with smaller steps, but we advance. Can we be satisfied with this first assessment? By definition, no. We must continue, we must go further, we must never release the pressure, we must continue to supply proposals. You know that, for my part, I will not let go and that the Commission will be active on this front until the last day of its mandate, I assure you. European citizens are asking us to do so. More than that, they demand it. Each of us - and this goes for the Member States first - will be held to account on this front. I say it clearly, we must not wait for the next scandal to act. The Commission is assuming its responsibilities. In this sense, we have relaunched the project for a European corporate tax base. I am saying here that this reform, which is not just an anti-fraud reform, which is the definition of business taxation for the 21st century, is the mother of all reforms. I will not be able to finish this term satisfied with my work as Tax Commissioner if we do not succeed. You are right, we must speed up and I call on the Council to speed up and conclude this file before the end of this year 2018 which is about to begin. We must therefore put into practice a simple principle according to which companies must pay their taxes where they generate their profits. You know that the fact of having a common consolidated base - and I insist on the term “consolidated” - precisely makes it possible to avoid the transfer of profits, which is an absolutely massive source of fraud, that is what is true. tax justice in action. The Commission will also make proposals for fairer taxation of digital businesses which, by their very nature and the archaism of our tax systems, largely escape corporate taxation. It is not acceptable that the effective tax rate for digital businesses is more than half the rate for traditional businesses. There is something there that is a distortion. Preparing for the future also means adapting our tax system to adapt it to these new realities. I wanted to assure you of the will of the Commission to move forward in this direction. I would like to respond to some of the very many questions raised by members. I'll start with the blacklist. I want to be clear on this point: this blacklist is not the Commission's list, it is the Member States' list, it is the Council's. The Member States and the Council have chosen a modality which is to go through the code of conduct, to have an intergovernmental development method. Well, that’s their responsibility and it’s the finance ministers who have to justify it. I see my name, every time it would be the Moscovici list. No, this is not the list I proposed. What I proposed was that there be a list, but it was the Council that made its list, with its strengths and weaknesses. Having said that, I still want to say one thing to this Parliament - which I know well, I have been a member of it -: sometimes the best is the enemy of the good. This list, undoubtedly, is progress, first of all because it exists - it is the first in the history of the European Union -; secondly, because the process of screening, of dialogue with the Member States was carried out in a serious manner; finally, because these results are not negligible: 17 countries on the black list and 47 on the gray list. What is important to me is that, is that the very process of listing, of listing, has led a lot of countries to make commitments. So I put it that way, I think that discrediting this list, seeing it as harmless, null and void, unnecessary, is not a good process. If we do so, we will discourage this still incomplete goodwill, whereas we must, on the contrary, go further. Yes, this list is progress, limited progress, incomplete progress, but undeniable progress. How to ensure to complete it? First, be extremely serious about the commitments. It’s the heart for me. Second, to forcefully call on the Member States to put in place sanctions, and real sanctions, and then be able to initiate a process. This is not a photo, this is not a discharge. Behind that, we will have to bring this process to life. So, there is a big question that is asked, I saw that there was an amendment that had been tabled, on which I will refrain from expressing myself, whether or not there are tax havens in the European Union. If we look at the criteria that were taken at the start, if we do a systemic analysis, if we compare ourselves to others, I think this point is questionable. I said it. Moreover, I think, here again, that putting such and such a country on the list of tax havens would be a little discouraging or encouraging them not to pursue the efforts they have already made, and I do not want them to do so. name, but the automatic exchange of information, it exists, the application of BEPS, it exists. There is no country in the European Union that has a zero tax rate. That said, there are very serious problems and very serious shortcomings in a number of countries in the European Union, and if Parliament considers that this justifies listing them as tax havens, it is your right to do it. For my part, I tried to explain what the process was. This is what I want to stress, not just on the lists, but on the tax systems of the Member States, because that is the problem. It is the fact that some of these tax systems are favorable, it is true, to practices that we condemn. The fiscal transparency agenda is also being built and implemented within the European Union. It is the implementation of BEPS measures - I spoke about it - it is the convergence in tax matters, which must remain an objective. There, I urge parliamentarians, but also citizens, to hold their governments to account, to denounce those who refuse to move forward on the path of transparency. It is true that there are still marked differences, cautions, and that, when the media fires again, when there is no more scandal, I myself see a return to this kind of human and political nature which so that, suddenly, the natural returns to the gallop and shyness is required again. For my part, I will continue to call on Member States to work on changing their tax rules, those that remain favorable to aggressive tax planning and optimization, to adopt real sanctions - I really believe that it must be. a very operational conclusion for all of our work - and I also hope that - I have heard contrasting points of view on this - we move towards the end of the unanimity rule. The Commission will publish a communication on this at the beginning of 2018. Finally, I hear the calls to use Article 116 and I undertake to move forward on this path by the end of the mandate, with, all the same, a finality. , which is not to misuse it. We have a tool called \"enhanced cooperation\", which has never been used conclusively. I would like, if we use section 116, we do it in a positive way. Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, once again thank you for your involvement and your determination. You are going to vote tomorrow on the amendments and the final report of your committee and, in the role which is mine, I invite you to maintain the highest level of ambition. The Commission has already answered and will continue to answer, to answer your calls and I will spare no effort. Let me say it again: together, let us not lower our guard against tax evasion and opacity. We have already won battles.

When EFSI, the Fund for Strategic Investments in Europe, launched in 2015, the Commission let us know that it put the annual investment needs, the investment gap, at EUR 700 billion. Today the European Investment Bank tells us: With the new fund, we have succeeded in narrowing this gap by 100 billion euros. What does that show us? First: the fund is useful, it helps. But secondly: it is nowhere near enough to meet the additional investment needs in the European Union. That is why we need the combined efforts in the Member States, and we will, ladies and gentlemen, need a Commission proposal for a comprehensive investment strategy. That is what our report also calls for and what we expect the Commission to present it. Nevertheless, let me say today: I am filled with joy and pride in what we have achieved together. Yes, there were voices that wanted to give us the advice, just let it go. The money is called, it fits. Yes, quantitatively, the first stage, the first two years, was already successful. But the European Parliament wanted the fund to get better, to become more modern and to reach the regions where the need for investment is greatest. I would like to thank José Manuel Fernandes, my co-rapporteur, and all the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs, the committee chairmen, their teams, the many, many helping hands in the background who have made it possible for us to have a very good report today, a very good one good extension of this strategic investment fund until 2020. Because the 91% support that we got in the two committees is proof that they worked hard and that the Colleagues behind this modern investment instrument. What was achieved: additionality? No, in addition, a project is no longer only considered if the European Investment Bank has calculated that it is particularly risky. It's a math formula that doesn't really help us. We want at least 40% of the initiatives to contribute to the fight against climate change. We are obliged to do this, and that will be the great new task. The cooperation with the regional and national development banks will improve because it will benefit the small and medium-sized enterprises that we particularly need in this struggle for prosperity and modernization, for our industry, for our commercial operations in modern times. The system becomes more transparent and the allocation of funds becomes more clearly understandable. Yes, we have created a fixed system of indicators that objectively assess which are the best projects and which projects should be particularly supported. Business as usual is no longer possible, not even within the European Investment Bank. Ultimately, we will send an independent expert to the steering committee who will improve transparency and cooperation. All of this will move us forward. I am looking forward to a refreshing discussion here in plenary, to a good vote and then to an active, really modern fund for the next few years up to 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "reporter. - Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner and Vice-President of the Commission, all colleagues, all colleagues, to thank and thank my correlator Udo Bullmann for the excellent cooperation, for the loyalty, for the results we have obtained, for the committee chairs, chairman of the Committee on Economic Affairs, Roberto Gualtieri, and also to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Jean Arthuis, to all political groups and their shadow rapporteurs, a special word for Othmar Karas who also made an essential contribution to economic issues. The European Fund for Strategic Investments is a very important fund that has helped to mobilize investment, reduce inequalities and also create jobs. More than 250 billion euros have already been mobilized and more than 400 thousand small and medium-sized companies have been supported. Its success is impressive, which does not mean that the ambition does not continue to improve geographic distribution, and that is why we have strengthened the Advisory Hub, which is an investment advisory platform so that territories that have more difficulties can be supported . I remind you that this investment advice platform is free for public entities. Small and medium-sized companies only pay a third of the cost and we have reinforced the proactivity of Advisory Hub, of this investor advisory platform. In addition, we have also broadened the scope of the Fund: the forest, the social area and social services, agriculture, fisheries are also clearly present in this European Fund for Strategic Investments, which is an additional fund. And here additionality has also been reinforced: an additionality where nothing is automatic and where the impact in terms of employment, in terms of investment in the place, has to be seen, taking into account reality. Less favored regions tend to be more supported. This is not a fund for territorial cohesion, but it is a fund that should help territorial cohesion and it is a fund that does not replace the cohesion policy, but it also requires complementarity with the funds that we have, namely the Structural Funds. Small projects are cherished, this is also extremely important, and hence the work we did in this area. Investment platforms remain a gamble, but the role of financial development institutions is also strengthened and, here, I call attention to the fact that Member States strengthen their financial institutions for development, their development banks, and those who do not have them must create them because the financial instruments will be here to last. It is also extremely important the greater involvement that Parliament has.

There is also a greater presence, at the bottom, of Parliament in this Juncker plan, in this investment plan.

On behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), our main concerns regarding the expansion of eligible sectors in the digital economy, the funding of SMEs, extension of SMEs window, the blending of EFSI and ESIF funds, and environmental considerations were properly addressed this time. However, one point I would like to highlight, which is important for the ITRE Committee and which remains unresolved despite our efforts to emphasise it, is that the requirement of delinking the EFSI guarantee from the Member States’ macroeconomic requirements under the Stability and Growth Pact.  There is also a straightforward message: reductionary fiscal policy kills the demand for lendable funds, and the EFSI is a supply side instrument. Now we know that supply cannot create its own demand, so it sends a clear message to policymakers regarding the limits of supply side financial instruments as long as the demand is weak.

However, the criticisms, the debate we have had, the monitoring of the projects, some good and others bad, have led us to reduce the cuts in the EQF in this new EFSI, \"EFSI 2\". almost in half through the use of margins and part of the EFSI profits - because it gives profits.

I want to thank the rapporteurs, Udo Bullmann and José Manuel Fernandes for their great cooperation and also all the chairs who run our trilogues very smoothly and skilfully, like Mr Gualtieri and Mr Sarvamaa, and other MEPs who participated in this effort. Let me take stock of the investment plan’s achievements before I turn to the changes under EFSI 2.0. Up to now, EFSI has managed to trigger additional investment worth EUR 250 billion. In other terms, it will create new jobs and new financing opportunities for infrastructure, investments and SMEs. In addition to large infrastructure projects and industrial investments, some 530 000 European SMEs and mid-caps have already benefitted from EFSI financing. In other terms, according to the European Investment Bank, EFSI investments made up to now will increase European GDP by 0.67% by 2020 and this will increase the number of jobs by 690 000. This is only the result of EFSI investments up to now. The overall figure will be higher when EFSI expires later on. This is only the result of EFSI. This is not the result of the entire investment plan for Europe. There the third pillar in particular plays a role. Geographically, EFSI has also functioned very well. I will give you a list of the countries which are the five best users of EFSI and it looks quite good. Estonia is number one, Bulgaria is second, Greece third, Portugal fourth, and Spain fifth. Our idea was to address market failure and it seems to be functioning as we planned.  Let me give you some concrete examples of EFSI projects. In Poland the EIB is providing a loan of over EUR 30 million for the construction of 1 300 affordable houses for low-income earners. In Greece, the EIB is lending to a telecoms operator to roll out high-speed broadband, bringing better internet access to rural and remote areas of the country. In Finland, EFSI supports the first ever social impact points scheme in Europe. The scheme will support the integration of up to 3 700 migrants and refugees in the Finnish labour market through training and job matching assistance. In the Czech Republic, a start—up called Frusack received an EFSI—backed loan to scale up their reusable bags business. In Germany, the EIB is lending EUR 35 million to a medical device company to support the development of a new approach to treating the most aggressive type of brain cancer, and in Romania, EFSI is helping a recycling company called GreenFiber to broaden the scope of their business. Under EFSI 2.0, we ensure that all the projects continue to match the high expectations which we have set. This EFSI extension will increase the target of investment to be triggered to at least EUR 0.5 trillion by 2020. EFSI 2.0 comes with a number of enhancements as a result of the input and commitment of the co—legislators. Let me outline some of them. First, there is a more precise definition of ‘additionally’, and, second, investment decisions will be better explained and the scoreboard on which they are based will be published. This is a measure of transparency and also of increased accountability. Thirdly, technical assistance to project promoters at a local level will be strengthened so that even more regions and sectors can benefit from it. Finally, EFSI 2.0 will better focus on EU political priorities, such as climate change and environmental projects.  I would now like to focus on three areas where the Parliament’s constructive, but determined, pressure was key and take this opportunity to two rapporteurs, Udo Bullmann and José Manuel Fernandes. The first relates to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion. Thanks to Parliament’s efforts, due diligence on European Investment Bank operations under this regulation will include a thorough check of compliance with EU and international standards on anti—money laundering, the fight against terrorism, financing and tax fraud, and on tax avoidance. The second area where the European Parliament has clearly left a footprint is increased transparency. Thanks to Parliament’s efforts, the scoreboard of indicators will be made public after the signature of each project and the investment committee will substantiate its decision on the granting of EU funding.  Finally, Parliament’s efforts are also clearly seen when it comes to support for small—scale projects. As Mr Fernandes rightly pointed out, what is perceived as small in some countries or regions is actually a large-scale project in others. Better use of platforms, a delegation model with national promotional banks and a reinforced advisory hub will help smaller projects to benefit from EFSI more than they have been doing so far. Before I conclude, I would like to highlight that much still remains to be done. EFSI plays a major role in catalysing private investment, but the impact of these funds would be enhanced by further addressing barriers to investment in Member States. I refer to the third pillar of the investment plan that is a joint European and national responsibility. Thank you very much for the great cooperation.

However, it should be emphasized that the cohesion policy as the main investment policy of the European Union has already brought proven results not only in terms of creating investments, but also supporting structural reforms, developing human capital and creating sustainable jobs.

I obviously want to start by congratulating the rapporteurs for this report, Mr Bullmann and Mr Fernandes, because I think they have done a fantastic job and the groups and shadow rapporteurs have tried to help where possible. The investment plan has been in place for two and a half years. And I remember that when we made that assessment report for its first year of operation, we already detected some flaws, certain shortcomings. And that has been what we have tried to solve in this version 2.0 of the investment plan. The first one was the additionality criterion, and I believe that with the requirements that we have added we can achieve true additionality. Because if we use the European budget as a guarantee, it has to be to ensure that those projects that are going to benefit from the budget could never have been financed in any other way and, if not, we would be giving away public money. We have also talked about a better geographical distribution, and with cooperation with national investment banks and the elimination of obstacles to small projects - among other measures - I believe that we can greatly improve the implementation of the investment plan throughout the territory European and also in the sectorial part, because we had detected that some sectors were not benefiting sufficiently. And for this reason, with new specific criteria, we are going to place more emphasis on job creation, the fight against climate change, new technologies or sustainable transport and, finally, the budgetary part. And here we must recognize that the Commission, which we did not manage to hear us in the budgetary part in the first part of the investment plan, here has put much more appropriate financing on the table. In the first investment plan, we already asked the Commission to reduce the need to provide the guarantee and here in this second investment plan it has made a reduction and, therefore, with the same money we will be able to finance many more projects.!!

He pursues good goals and he gives good results. In my country - Belgium - the volume of financing currently stands at 1.2 billion euros, which should ultimately generate 5.8 billion euros in additional investments. Sixteen infrastructure and innovation projects have already been approved and more than 4,400 small and medium-sized enterprises are expected to benefit. A good instrument which pursues good objectives and gives good results deserves to be extended and improved. I therefore welcome the decision to extend the Juncker Fund for three years, I welcome the objective of setting the total amount of investments to be mobilized at 500 billion, thanks to the leverage effect, and I welcome the improvements made to the initial system. to make it more efficient.

As with EFSI 1, we continued our work on EFSI 2 and with good results. The point is still that there are success stories, and the Commissioner rightfully put them out. There are also a lot of projects about which people are raising doubts. Is this now really what EFSI should be subsidising or supporting? For that reason, we also had a very critical report which Parliament adopted at the beginning of this year which claimed that EFSI 1 was not functioning yet. If you look now at the improvements that we made in EFSI 2, you will see that we have made some big improvements. Firstly, on the definition of additionality: we made sure that additionality really means something that otherwise would not have happened at all, and not only something that follows the European Investment Bank (EIB) definition of additionality.

It seems that small countries did not have the tools and means to be able to cope and make concrete proposals. If there really was such a huge impact on this plan, given that for the first time in the European Union more than 535,000 small and medium-sized enterprises are going to benefit, it is a challenge for my country, Cyprus, to be exploited.

Here, a rather ridiculous figure compared to what the economy needs today.

Today we are at 40%, we can only be happy about it. But I would also like to welcome a side effect of this plan, which seems to me to be quite positive: it is the way in which it has led many Member States to draw inspiration from the model of national development and promotion banks in order to promote the capacity to draw up, in each Member State, investment plans which are now better selected and in development. This has also led to changes in the governance of the European Investment Bank, even if there is undoubtedly room for progress.

Europe has an investment gap of a minimum of EUR 300 billion a year. EFSI plays a crucial role in filling this gap and intervenes where the market fails to do so, but we must reiterate that only a comprehensive framework for investments, structural reforms and common policy will foster growth in the EU. These three dimensions are complementary and necessary to each other.  EFSI will bring EUR 500 billion up to 2020 for more projects, allowing citizens with innovative ideas to access finance more easily in order to launch new projects. This will also make EFSI bigger, greener, more local and more transparent. EFSI keeps a strict approach to the additionality concept, making sure the projects selected are risk-based and would not have been financed otherwise. This is very important, to avoid past infrastructure projects financed such as ghost airports, highways without traffic and high—speed railways without passengers. EFSI should not become a new cohesion policy instrument. I agree with geographic balance in Europe, but we are talking about investment and growth, not about new solidarity instruments.  EFSI also contributes to the COP21 objectives, to keep sustainable development and environment objectives in mind. EFSI also increases the local presence level through the reinforcing of the European Investment Advisory Hub. The decentralisation of EFSI is also a key element, in my view. Who better to identify local needs for the economy than local governments? Of course, this has always to be accompanied by European supervision in order to select projects that have a real European added value.  My congratulations again, especially to the rapporteurs.

For many reasons, I am not in favour of this report, nor do I wish to extend the duration of the EFSI Fund. One should ask oneself: why do we need such an investment fund at a time when interest rates are already extremely low and the market is flooded with cheap money? The answer lies in the nature of the plan. The European Fund for Strategic Investments is explicitly funding risky projects, projects that are not able to obtain funding through the financial markets at a time when money is easy. Very dodgy indeed.  The European Investment Bank and European Commission admitted many times, and I quote: ‘The EFSI projects’ portfolio risk profile will be higher than the average risk profile of the other EIB projects and assets. The EFSI provides a first loss guarantee so that the EIB has been able to invest in more risky projects.’ Let us not forget that at least EUR 16 billion – the equivalent of more than GBP 14 billion – in the EFSI project are guaranteed through the EU budget, plus EUR 5 billion – an equivalent of GBP 4.4 billion – is coming from the European Investment Bank, which is owned by the EU Member States, including Britain, and that will be so after we leave, I should think.  Besides funding projects in the field of energy, EFSI is often used to fund semi-governmental infrastructure projects which are harmful to private business. It sets up in competition with private business. In theory, this megalomaniac EFSI project sounds like a good example of free market capitalism and wealth creation.

It is a very important moment because, once you vote in favour of the extension of EFSI, it means that you will raise its firepower up to half a trillion euros by the end of 2020. It is a significant tool for improving Europe’s competitiveness and for increasing the number of jobs.  I must say that the biggest challenge we still have with EFSI is the lack of awareness. (The President called for silence) Many companies, many regions, many municipalities and authorities have never heard of EFSI, even though we have been communicating massively. If you look at the countries and regions which have benefited the most from EFSI you can see that local authorities, and also private banks and MEPs, have been actively promoting the opportunities which EFSI can offer. I can give you some examples of very active MEPs. I am sorry not to mention them all but, for instance, Ms Spyraki from Greece, Mr Kelly from Ireland, Mr Gualtieri from Italy, Ms Kaili from Greece and Ms Maydell from Bulgaria have organised a significant number of events promoting EFSI opportunities for local entrepreneurs and local authorities. I encourage you strongly to promote this good example.  The second point I want to make is that EFSI has not created a division between East and West.  (The President called for silence) If you look at the list of the countries which use EFSI most, Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, and Spain are the first five, then you have Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Italy, Poland, France and Croatia. So, EFSI can be used everywhere but it depends on the activism of local authorities and entrepreneurs, and also MEPs, as to how well informed people are of the opportunities.  I would like to stress the importance of combining EFSI opportunities with structural funds because this would further expand the opportunities for cohesion countries to use EFSI.  My final point is that, since EFSI is a demand driven fund, it is not the medicine for all diseases. We have to make sure that companies working in the circular economy field, in artificial intelligence, in agriculture and forestry, and in energy efficiency, to mention just a few areas, use more EFSI financing, because it can give better opportunities to invest in new innovations. I would like, once again, to thank this House for the fruitful cooperation.  Commission statement As a result of the political agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the financing of EFSI 2.0 an amount of EUR 275 million will be redeployed from CEF financial instruments, which represents a reduction of EUR 225 million in comparison with the Commission proposal. The Commission confirms that the financial programming will be revised to reflect the corresponding EUR 225 million increase of the CEF programme. In the framework of the annual budgetary procedures for the years 2019-2020 the Commission will make the appropriate proposals to ensure an optimal allocation of this amount within the CEF programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "Rapporteur.- Madam President!In view of the advanced time I will not use the two minutes.I will make one point, which I believe is the most important: this fund for strategic investments in Europe is necessary and it is useful.But this House, the European Parliament, neither waved through the concept the first time at EFSI I nor the second time it was renewed and nodded its approval.No, we designed it.It is, it was and it remains sorely necessary that you, ladies and gentlemen, get involved in the implementation of this very necessary vehicle, because we make it an instrument for a better quality of life and work, for more sustainability and formake the future of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 112, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "reporter. - Madam President, this is an open fund that is not required, but that is proposed, and proposes to support, above all, Member States and investments in those Member States where there is more difficulty in accessing the market.

In addition, investment decisions become more transparent. The Investment Committee will explain in more detail why it believes the criteria for EFSI support are met. Austria currently has six signed projects, mainly in the areas of transport (regional train infrastructure) and renewable energies. These correspond to an investment volume of EUR 2.3 billion.

However, if we look, for example, at the recent decision by the European Investment Bank, the EIB, to finance the Tripla shopping center in Pasila, Helsinki, with EUR 130 million in EFSI-guaranteed credit, I wonder how complementarity will be achieved. The project itself may make sense, although the main beneficiaries of the project are private companies. In addition to the EIB, the financial package, which has been hailed as competitive, includes other banks, a solvent Helsinki and plenty of private financing. Funding seems to have been sufficient in the midst of all the European Central Bank's funding supply, which makes it difficult for me to believe that the project would not have taken place without the involvement of the EFSI or the EIB.

In a nutshell: The regulation is intended to simplify the clarification of rights for online content and thus make more content accessible to Europeans and allow Europe to grow closer together. Contrary to what has been discussed, the regulation does not introduce a pan-European license. It is still possible to limit the range. The ordinance also explicitly prescribes remuneration. Indeed, I would have liked to see stronger rules for authors here, but that could not be done with the majority. The report in the Committee on Legal Affairs lags far behind the report of the Consumer Committee, and it rightly lags behind the report or the opinion of the Committee on Culture and thus follows the Committee on Industry. I cannot see a balanced proposal. What we will see is that consumers continue to use illegal access such as VPN to be able to consume content. No creative person in Europe will see an extra cent for this. I think that we Europeans shouldn't leave the audiovisual media to the big American corporations, but rather enable our European providers with better rights regulations to enable access for our citizens. I want better access for the citizens, for linguistic minorities in the European Union, and I want fair remuneration for creative people. One last note: The portability regulation, which is celebrated as a success, does not help here because it only applies for a limited period of time, because it only applies to access from the home country.

The Brussels Conference on Afghanistan was a turning point in our cooperation. We Europeans have stepped up our engagement with Afghanistan, both financially and through a new diplomatic push with regional and international players. Now, one year later, we can see progress in a number of areas. Key achievements include the National Strategy for Combating Corruption, and also the successful work of the Citizens’ Charter, Women’s Economic Empowerment National Priority Plan, and managing migration in the country. Progress has also been made on budget and fiscal reform; and the government has taken several measures to create a more competitive, export—oriented and job—creating economy.  But the work is not finished. The security situation remains fragile. There have been a number of attacks in Kabul and other areas against security forces and places of worship affecting innocent civilians, including women and children. We are alarmed by the high level of violence and the number of civilian casualties – and, frankly, reconciliation and sustainable peace are the absolute priority for Afghanistan and also for us as the European Union – but a peace process can only be successful if it is led and owned by the Afghans themselves.  The Afghan Government can count on the EU to be a partner in its search for peace. We will not stop working to create the right environment towards a negotiated settlement, including through the work of the recently appointed EU Special Envoy for Afghanistan.  We want to support the country in the areas where it needs it the most. And precisely to discuss these priorities, last February we have signed a Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development with the Afghan Government. The Cooperation Agreement is a political commitment to set up a constant dialogue on all the issues we care about, from the economy to migration, from women’s empowerment to human rights. First, we are with the government as it tries to bolster the country’s fragile economy. This includes support to the rural economy, but also to the fight against drugs as well as illegal mining. Helping to strengthen Afghanistan’s regional connectivity is also quite important for us.  Second, there can be no sustainable development when human rights and fundamental freedoms are not respected. Whilst some progress has been achieved in this field, a lot still needs to be done to improve women’s and children’s rights, to abolish the death penalty, to prevent torture and ill—treatment, to guarantee access to justice and the freedom of expression and to support human rights defenders.  The development of Afghanistan also requires women and girls to be able to contribute in full to the country’s social, economic and political life, as well as to the future peace process. So we are working to empower women in Afghanistan – helping girls go to school, training policewomen, and supporting innovative projects by female entrepreneurs. Third point, we have started a comprehensive dialogue with Afghanistan on migration. Let us be clear on this: managing human mobility is an interest we share with the Afghan people. We both want the Afghan youth to find better opportunities at home. We both want to prevent that the people of Afghanistan risk their lives in dangerous journeys across the world. We both want also that those who return home can have the opportunity to a better life. To this end, we have already mobilised almost EUR 200 million to ensure the returnees’ reintegration into society, and we will continue to work in the framework of the Joint Way Forward (JWF), a common political engagement for managing migration in a sustainable way, based on solidarity and dialogue. Finally, we are working to strengthen democracy in the country, and also the rule of law and promoting good governance. Part of this work is the fight against corruption. The Afghan Government has stepped up its anti-corruption measures and adopted in October a national anti-corruption strategy. Implementation of this strategy is now what truly matters.  We also as the European Union continue to support the civilian aspects of the security sector reform: a new police advisory project will be launched soon.  Next year, in 2018, Afghanistan is expected to hold parliamentary and district elections, followed by presidential elections in 2019. These elections need to be transparent, credible and inclusive, including for women. The Afghan authorities still need to implement a thorough electoral reform to ensure the trust of the electoral stakeholders in the process. We have already committed around EUR 19 million to support and accompany a democratic electoral process. My dear colleagues, the Afghan people deserve democracy and human rights; they deserve peace and prosperity. The European Union will continue to work with its partners in the Afghan Government to achieve this. It is not an easy goal. At the same time, we will further develop our engagement with our international partners, to make Afghanistan and our common region more peaceful and more prosperous.

The Taliban, nevertheless, poses a sustained and credible security threat, with ISIS and the Haqqani network among the terrorist groups compounding the problem.

Today, we have not moved much closer to the overarching goal, which is to achieve Afghanistan’s self—reliance.

However, there is no other solution than that of building a coalition with other international and regional partners, the government and civil society that works even more effectively.  I strongly believe that we should focus on four crucial pillars. To begin with, it is fundamental to continue promoting peace, stability and security. We must aim to achieve an inclusive peace process, as only a regional solution can be sustainable. Secondly, ahead of next year’s elections, we have to advance with the difficult task of state building, with special attention given to women’s rights and the uncompromised fight against corruption. Moreover, we need to accelerate economic and social development. For example, we can explore the ways in which Afghanistan could use its vast mineral potential. Finally, regarding the EU engagement on migration challenges, those coming back home from Europe or its neighbouring countries must find a safe environment with real opportunities to restart their lives.

In fact, it is the second most unsafe country in the world. To put it in the words of Pro Asyl: Afghanistan is not a safe country. And yet, despite the disastrous security situation, collective deportations from EU member states to Afghanistan are carried out, again only last Thursday in Germany. What a grotesque, inhuman logic! Even if some things have gotten better, nothing is really good. The military side of the conflict not only caused numerous deaths with a huge number of unreported cases, but also devoured huge financial sums.

The security situation in Afghanistan has worsened again and according to the UN, there are over 1.8 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan. On average, 1,500 people fly internally per day. In 2016 alone, there was an increase of 650,000. Afghanistan is also one of the poorest countries in the world and the situation is exacerbated by the social and economic difficulties of integrating all internally displaced persons and thousands of Afghan refugees returning from neighboring countries daily while all Afghan youth also to enter the labor market. In Pakistan alone, 1.7 million Afghan refugees live and in Iran 1 million that the authorities there want to send back. It should be added that EU countries, which actually contribute to receiving a very small part of the Afghan refugees, also send back t.o.m. young people who have been refugees all their lives and never set foot in the country. And how is Afghanistan supposed to recover, reach peace, get out of poverty, corruption, drug trafficking and meet the challenge of creating jobs for both those who already live there and those who return, when the great danger is that those who are sent back are captured up by the Taliban, Daesh or other criminal gangs as the only way to support themselves. We are not solving this by simply expanding our military operations or, for that matter, the civilians. What is very problematic for me in our policy is the contradiction that at the same time as the Member States are expanding the military presence in the country due to deteriorating security situation, we are sending Afghans back against the background of an improved security situation.

Most will arrive on our roads, transformed into heroin, and will finance the eternal Afghan conflict, which 17 years after the first US intervention shows no sign of abating. In fact, at least three parallel wars are being fought in the country: one against drugs, one against the Taliban insurgency and one against corruption. And all three are getting lost, proof of this is Trump's decision to employ 4 000 new men in Afghanistan, after a complex 2017, where the Taliban insurgency was joined by Isis, increasingly active and ready, according to several analysts internationals, to build their next stronghold in the country. Europe rightly calls for an Afghan-led political process, in which all parties can sit at a negotiating table: a difficult solution, especially as long as the conflict continues to be a goose that lays golden eggs for all parties involved; for the Afghan forces, who, through corrupt officers, divert to the rebels, in return for payment, the weapons and aid received from their Western allies; and for the Taliban themselves, who through the cultivation of opium, the exploitation of natural resources and various other illicit trafficking, are accumulating fortunes of the order of billions of dollars.

A French fighter and an Algerian fighter are also among the Daesh fighters who have just arrived from Syria, which is very worrying.

This is why it is important that the post of Prime Minister be formally created in the Constitution. Fortunately, the US decision to stay in Afghanistan is a good decision, but former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar entered Kabul six months ago, greeted - disturbingly - by President Ashraf Ghani. Hekmatyar was supposed to strike a deal with the Taliban, but no one can deny that since arriving with his fighters from Pakistan, the security situation is deteriorating very rapidly and no progress has been made on negotiations with the Afghan Taliban. I am talking about those who wish to accept the current Constitution, guaranteeing in particular human rights, democracy and especially the rights of women. The destabilization of Afghanistan also passes through Pakistan, which, through its intelligence services, forcibly returns Afghan migrants to their country and continues to support Islamist groups allied with the Taliban, such as the Haqqani network.

The advent of Trump has not changed the trend either, and the withdrawal of NATO troops and its allies, which was initially scheduled for 2014, has been postponed to 2020 and beyond. Many say it is not fair to leave work before it is done. But what work are we talking about? Unemployment has increased from 8 to 40 percent, Kabul has gone from one million to five and a half million inhabitants, and the only relevant activity is the production of opium.

From this debate I conclude that we all share a common interest in using EU diplomatic power and EU financial instruments to their full potential in support of a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan. In 2016 the Afghan Government made strong commitments towards self-reliance, responsibility and ownership of its political course and development policy. The European Union, as part of the wider international community, remains firmly committed to supporting the Government and the people of Afghanistan in this endeavour. The Government of Afghanistan’s continued engagement and appropriation of its commitments will be essential for this to be successful. Our European support to Afghan refugees has been demonstrated in many areas and in many aspects. I personally visited Iran twice to show the tangible European solidarity on the ground in various areas there. In particular, I witnessed in a very demanding field, education in emergencies, our tangible solidarity there. So I strongly believe that, as the European Union, we are fully committed in order to provide any assistance to the Afghan people, not only inside Afghanistan but also outside Afghanistan. A few words about irregular migration. Irregular migration to Europe is a reality and it needs to be addressed. Together with the country of origin, we do address it from a comprehensive angle in the spirit of the partnership framework, looking in the wider context at the causes of migration: poverty, conflict, insecurity. We are trying to remedy those causes with our instruments, political and diplomatic security, and development cooperation. In our discussions and actions we pay particular attention to sustainable reintegration of returned persons, not only from Europe, but also from the region, from where the biggest numbers of returns take place. It is about creating opportunities in the country of origin so that young Afghans find reasons to build their lives there, and not choose the dangerous irregular migration route and become victims of human traffickers.

This was another way of showing teamwork and the joint action of European Union institutions plus Member States. I was in Bangladesh in one of the largest camps hosting Rohingya refugees. When you see the camps with your own eyes, when you talk to the people there, when you hear the stories, and when you see the reality on the ground, it makes quite a difference. The thing that struck me the most was the number of young children – I have to say children of my little daughter’s age, six or seven years old – taking care of younger children who were two or three years old. These were children who were travelling together. The older ones were raising the little ones, but we are talking about children we normally consider very, very, very little. It is hard to imagine what that must feel like because these kids are forced to grow up. They are stripped of their right to childhood, and this is going to stay for the rest of their lives. I also met a group of women and heard from them about the violence they had suffered and the violence against their children. When you have heard these stories once, you will never ever forget them. When you hear these stories, action is no longer just a political priority, but it becomes a sort of moral imperative. I am telling you this because sometimes we have to link the political dynamics to stories, faces and people. That same night, I met with the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, not only to express the European Union’s support for the country, but also, and most importantly, to discuss possible solutions to the crisis. Since the camp is in an area where it is certain that when the rainy season starts, the situation will become impossible to manage. It is a camp hosting some 650 000 people in one place.  The day after that visit – the day after I talked to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh – I was in Myanmar for the Asia-Europe meeting. Right before the summit, we asked to set up a special meeting with all the ministers who were there, including Aung San Suu Kyi, to discuss the situation of the Rohingyas and to find a way forward together. It was a quiet meeting with no cameras and no publicity, but it was a very important one. We agreed at that meeting on a shared perspective to start facing the crisis, step by step, but with commitments and with strong regional and international involvement. Just a few days later, – actually, if I am not wrong, three days later – a deal between Myanmar and Bangladesh was announced and signed. We had discussed that deal during that meeting. We had encouraged the two parties to discuss together the first steps that could be made.  We know very well that it is still an extremely difficult situation and that implementation of that agreement will have to be accompanied and monitored extremely carefully by the international community, but this is finally a first step in the right direction after months, if not years or decades, of inaction or actually, even worse, sometimes of turning a blind eye. It could be an entry point to address the crisis from a bilateral point of view between Bangladesh and Myanmar and, together with the agencies, starting from the UNHCR.  For us, this comes after several months of intense engagement. I was here when you adopted your last resolution in September. One month later, we adopted conclusions on the crisis in the Foreign Affairs Council. In the light of the disproportionate use of force by the army, we also decided to suspend invitations to the Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and other senior military officers, and to review ongoing practical defence cooperation.  Meanwhile, we have been active at the UN Human Rights Council. First, we supported the extension of the fact-finding mission’s mandate. Second, we supported a special session on Myanmar last week and the resolution proposed by Bangladesh. We also supported the resolution at the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee. Beyond public statements and beyond the political and diplomatic work we have carried out in these months, we stepped up our humanitarian assistance and co—hosted the UN Pledging Conference in October in Geneva. As usual, the European Union has pledged more money than anybody else. If you look at the European Union and Member States together, we pledged more than the rest of the world combined. Let me add that our pledges always turn into real money and real projects that help real people, meaning that we always deliver on our pledges.  But the humanitarian work alone is not enough. We have to solve the problem. It is now up to Myanmar to improve the situation in the Rakhine State so that everyone can go back to their homes in a safe and dignified way. The rule of law and full humanitarian access must be granted as a first step. So far the Government has granted access to the Red Cross and the World Food Programme in Rakhine State, but we will continue to press for full access to the broader UN and NGO community. At the same time, the people of Rakhine must be guaranteed the right to education and basic social services, and the difficult issue of citizenship must be addressed, all in line with the Annan plan. Let me say that this is perhaps the most important political point to me. The authorities of Myanmar have declared their intention to fully implement the Annan plan. Aung San Suu Kyi has expressed her willingness and commitment to do so, not only in our private meetings, but also in our common press activities and publicly several times. We know very well that she faces an extremely complex situation in the country. The democracy of Myanmar is a very young one. The country is still somehow in a democratic transition, and the path towards an inclusive and pluralistic democracy is never easy, particularly after so many years of military rule. I believe that Aung San Suu Kyi needs and wants our support to implement fully the Annan plan, to translate the political commitment into real action, and to do it, step by step, accompanied by the international community and other countries in the region.  In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to work for dignified voluntary returns based on the bilateral agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar. We will push for humanitarian access in Rakhine State, based on the first openings made by the Government, and we will work to address the root causes of the crisis and push for the full implementation of the Annan report. I am sure that the European Parliament will continue to contribute to such work that will hopefully bring results, although probably not within a very short time period. However, I believe that the first steps in the right direction have finally been taken even if, again, I am not hiding all the limits, difficulties and shortcomings that we will still be facing in the months ahead. This is why we have to continue working in that direction together.

Last week, Alex  Crawford, this extraordinary Sky News correspondent who went under cover in Myanmar, testified at my conference that of all humanitarian crises this is probably the worst she has ever witnessed.

The EU can be powerful in galvanising a global response, but to do so it must lead, not look for middle ground. That voice must roar not whisper. There can be no repatriation of the one million refugees unless they are recognised first as citizens of Myanmar and unless the UN is present as well as the media and humanitarian NGOs.

The EU also needs to pressure the civilian government to refer jurisdiction over the crimes committed since 25 August to the International Criminal Court. Self-referral is possible under Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. The perpetrators of the grave human rights violations in Myanmar must be held accountable, including those who hold high military rank. The civilian government has the responsibility to fight impunity as best it can.  The current situation in Rakhine State does not allow safe and sustainable returns, according to the UNHCR’s assessment, and there is a huge threat that refugees may be forcibly returned. Any returns can only take place when safe and dignified conditions can be guaranteed. Independent human rights monitoring, as well as full humanitarian access on the ground, must be a prerequisite for any repatriation.

Burma, which has been known as Myanmar since 1989, has undergone remarkable transformations since the reforms began in 2011. Following the overthrow of decades of military dictatorship, the new government, democratically brought to power in April 2016, represents a historic opportunity for the country. The European Union has played a key role in the process of change, with its own specific means. In recent months, however, there has been legitimate concern about official violence against the populous Rohingya community in Rakhine State, which is making hundreds of thousands of members of the persecuted ethnic group without mere citizenship ground and forcing them to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.

Elsewhere, Muslims slaughter Christians. Religious conflicts are a pretext; they are a smokescreen to cover up the economic interests they gain from these conflicts. In this case, the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya is done for economic reasons, in order to seize their land where the Rohingya communities lived, because there is interest from the multinationals to make mines.

The UN speaks of the Rohingya as the most persecuted minority in the world. The persecution, murder and expulsion of Rohingya is not a development of the last few years, it just seems that the world has not looked right until recently. There have been 20 military operations in the Rohingya area since Burma gained independence in 1948. Hundreds of thousands have had to leave their country, 1.5 million Rohingya are already in exile, their villages and towns have been devastated, tens of thousands have been murdered, and their property has been turned over to the Burmese. After the revolution of Buddhist monks and the release of Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest six years ago, there was faint hope of a cautious democratization of the country. However, the situation of the Rohingya has not changed so far. On the contrary: the military showed their power, continued to murder, continued to devastate the villages and homesteads of the Rohingya and again forced hundreds of thousands to flee. Humanitarian aid for the refugees is needed in the slum camps in which they are located. But at the same time political solutions are needed. The EU has been providing 700 million euros in development funds to Myanmar since 2014. These are to be linked to the condition that the Rohingya are finally recognized as citizens. Political solutions must also be found at the regional level, because neighboring countries such as Bangladesh are also affected by the mass displacement.

Another precondition should be that the Myanmar authorities return all looted property and compensate returnees for the loss of lives and goods during the violence. To avoid past mistakes, no returns should be forced or take place in the absence of strong assurances that Myanmar would respect the dignity and rights of the Rohingya who return.

As many Members said, there is a certain amount of work we can do. There are other things that are not in our power or our hands to solve, but the fact that we are by far the largest humanitarian donor, literally keeping people alive in very difficult conditions, is already a very important component of our work on stabilisation and development assistance and on political dialogue.  I would like to stress the fact that the bilateral agreement was reached after we applied pressure and after our meetings together with both the Bangladeshi and the Myanmar sides. We will continue with the monitoring of the implementation of this agreement and with the support specifically for human rights, democracy and – let me mention one point that was raised by one of you and that I believe is extremely important – the work we do on accountability and the fight against impunity. This has to be part of the commitments that are taken by the Myanmar authorities. We know very well – as I said at the beginning and as you are all extremely aware – that Myanmar is, even more than a young democracy, a country in transition still, and we have to be aware of the fact that we have to do two difficult exercises at the same time. On the one hand, we have to find a solution to the issue of the Rohingya that is sustainable and in full respect of all of their rights. This is doable with the full implementation of the Annan report, to which Aung San Suu Kyi has committed herself. On the other hand, we have to strengthen the democratic process in Myanmar, knowing very well that there is a political fight in that country and things are complicated, to say the least. So we also have to prevent the clock turning backwards in Myanmar itself, and after so many years of military rule this is always a risk. So this is the exercise we are doing and, with a strong commitment and strong engagement from the European Union side, we will continue to do so. On returns, these obviously have to happen in a dignified and safe manner, in full respect for all rights and international standards. This is not an issue that is going to be solved easily – on the contrary – but I believe that one first extremely small but encouraging step has happened. It is not just a bilateral issue between Myanmar and Bangladesh, but without that first bilateral step, the international work to try to solve the problem would not be possible. We will continue to work and to push the international community and in particular, as I said, the UNHCR and international NGOs towards a full role in this process. It will be a long process that will require all our political determination.  The Council for sure will come back to this point: we adopted Council conclusions in October, and I am ready to put this issue on the agenda again any time to try to help and push for a solution to this issue.  Thank you very much for keeping this issue high on the agenda. I believe this is useful and I count on your full support in the continuation of our work on this.

The different situations we are facing in our eastern neighbourhood, in our southern neighbourhood, in the Middle East, in large parts of Africa, in North Korea, or – and how we will be able to convince ourselves at tomorrow’s Sakharov Prize ceremony – in Latin America, as well as our challenging relations with Russia and China, are all emerging as huge political challenges for our Union and our Member States.  With this annual report on the common security and defence policy, we try to identify the major issues our Union faces and outline a possible way forward.  According to the last survey conducted by Eurobarometer, 65% of Europeans are in favour of a common European foreign policy, while even 75% are in favour of a common security and defence policy. The European Union ought to deliver on the expectations of its citizens. In my report, the first report I have presented, I focused on the three ‘c’s. Firstly, coordination of an assessment of the profound threats and challenges within the EU. We have to scrutinise the current political and security environment and take measures to guarantee the security of our people and our territory. This will for most be achieved by stabilising our direct neighbourhood, such as the Western Balkans, by promoting reforms and tackling the root causes of armed conflicts.  The second ‘c’: consolidation and deepening of the European project through enhanced EU capabilities. The European Union – as we all know – is the biggest market in the world, a major political and diplomatic power, the first trade partner for most of the countries and regions in the world, and the first humanitarian and development donor worldwide. I am convinced that only a coherent coordinated action across these EU policies can harness the EU’s collective force.  Finally, the third ‘c’: cooperation within coalitions and with institutions delivering security. The European Union must continue to develop its strategic autonomy and to create its own capabilities to better address regional and international conflicts. In an increasingly conflict—ridden and unstable international environment, only a combination of effective multilateralism, our soft power and our credible hard power can be capable of confronting those major security threats.  A final remark: yesterday’s agreement to establish the permanent structured cooperation marked a huge step forward towards an independent and strong EU security and defence policy, and thus to a certain degree of hard power. Finally, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for the good and fruitful cooperation. It was a pleasure to witness the largest political groups in this House collaborate closely towards a stronger common foreign and security policy for our Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 201, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mister President! Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: Habemus PESCOm. Finally white smoke after eight years: This is an occasion to celebrate, as our longstanding parliamentary demand - start of permanent structured cooperation - has finally been implemented by the Council. I remind you, Mrs Mogherini, that you only worked with the Member States for a few months to get PESCO going. We in the European Parliament have been working on this since 2009, since the Lisbon Treaty came into force. In 2010, in the CSDP annual report, our colleague Danjean made the first parliamentary demand to start PESCO. We didn't let go of this topic either. We have found supporters in many political groups, so that in 2016 in the report on the European Defense Union by colleague Paet PESCO was identified as a central building block of the Defense Union. The defense union serves to take our fate into our own hands and to organize and guarantee the security of our citizens and the Union itself. In the Defense Union, the EP stands behind the path outlined in the Lisbon Treaty of moving from the progressive definition of a common European defense policy, which is currently taking place, to common defense. With the Lisbon Treaty, 28 governments have already passed this and ratified 28 national parliaments. So we don't need a new treaty for this, we just have to implement what we agreed years ago. Addressing the transatlantic among us, I would like to say clearly that the possibilities of the EU treaty are indeed compatible with our NATO commitments. We stand by NATO and want to work with the EU to strengthen the European pillar within the alliance with concrete measures. It is very good that the Commission's reflection paper on the defense of EU offers is realistic Support of cooperation speaks. Indeed, the EU's contribution to strengthening defense capabilities lies in creating incentives for Member States to cooperate more on research, skills development and procurement. NATO also benefits from this, since, as is well known, the member states only have a single set of forces that they can make available to the EU, NATO or a coalition of the willing. It is very good that the Commission is continuing its planning for EU-funded defense research. The European Parliament had already put the first budget line for defense and defense research on the rails as part of a pilot project in the 2015 and 2016 budgets. The overriding goal remains to provide 500 million euros per year for defense research from 2021 - the beginning of the next financial period. The consideration here is very simple: Those who already cooperate with one another in research will also do the same in development, procurement and military use. Let me turn to the draft law on the European Defense Industry Development Program EDIDP. 500 million euros are to be made available for this program in 2019 and 2020. In principle, the proposal is to be welcomed, since with this step the Commission minimizes the risk that the Member States could lose interest in joint programs after EU-funded defense research. The proposal offers the chance for national defense ministries and procurement agencies to actually get into cooperative programs. Back to PESCO: Together with my colleague González Pons, I put our parliamentary ideas on PESCO on the table in March of this year. These are more ambitious than the projects agreed here. PESCO is more than PEPCO - permanent project coordination. Nonetheless, I am pleased that the Council is Yesterday's PESCO resolution took up our central demand for the costs of structured cooperation to be paid from the Union budget, i.e. administrative costs and operational costs outside of military operations. I am looking forward to the proposal of our Budget Commissioner Oettinger to finance PESCO. Together with the Council, we in Parliament are called upon to make the budget available quickly. But the Council should also take the opportunity to finally make the Athena mechanism for financing military operations user-friendly, that is to say with far more jointly borne costs. The countdown to the European Defense Union has started with the latest proposals from the Commission and the Council. Now is the time to bring all the loose ends together in an EU White Paper on Security and Defense, so that we can clearly explain to our citizens the goal and the path to the Defense Union. I look forward to your support in treading this common European path!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "   vicepresidente della Commissione/alto rappresentante dell'Unione per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza. – Grazie signor Presidente, sa che di solito mi siedo dal lato della Commissione, ma effettivamente per questo dibattito credo che sia istituzionalmente più corretto che io mi rivolga a quest'Aula da questo lato. Verrò poi al tema del doppio o triplo cappello del mio ruolo.  Let me start by thanking David McAllister and Michael Gahler for their great work and the entire Parliament for its excellent and long-standing work. Looking at your reports, I see first of all a very strong consensus amongst us on how crucial our unity has become for our European citizens and for the entire world. There is a need for the European Union as a force for peace and security; there is a need for us to be a credible and reliable power on the global scene – a rational, wise and calm one. So I am glad that your reports also demonstrate a great ambition, the ambition to make our Union even stronger so that we can fully take up this role, because this is exactly what the situation requires. When we look at the world around us, we see not just uncertainty, not just unpredictability, but confusion and sometimes very dangerous confusion. This is why we are becoming more and more of a point of reference for so many around the world, because we are reliable and our partners know where we stand; we are predictable because we are open about our interests and values; we are cooperative, and our friends know that they can always count on us. When others have put into question the United Nations and multilateralism, we have decided to invest even more strongly in them. Not only have we supported António Guterres in his work on reforming the UN system, but we have also worked with UN agencies all around the world, and particularly with UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. When we set up our own initiative for the future of Syria and the region with the Brussels process, we did it to support the Geneva talks led by the United Nations through all possible means and in strong coordination with them. We have stood by the nuclear deal with Iran and we are working for a peaceful solution to the crisis with North Korea. We have invested in the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development. We have put our relationship with Africa on a more equal footing, with so many joint initiatives, from our support to the G-5 Sahel Joint Military Force to the European External Investment Plan. We have invested in resilience, for instance with our eastern partners, working on our youth, on the fight against corruption, on energy sector reform, and on strategic communications. And we have continued to be a force for peace and reconciliation, starting with our own region, Europe, with the Western Balkans and a credible path towards our European Union. We have become an indispensable partner for peace and reconciliation for a more effective multilateralism, for sustainable development. We have also become an indispensable partner and power for international security and a global security provider. In today’s world, security and development go hand-in-hand. So hard and soft power must also go hand-in-hand. Our work on security and defence is part of this broader picture. It has nothing to do with the militarisation of our Union, we are not turning our Union into a military alliance. But if we want to help our African partners whose growth is hampered by insecurity or if we want to make sure that instability abroad does not affect our own citizens, then we also need to be a credible military actor, using all our tools, including military ones, and using them the European way – which means for peace, for development, for people’s rights, wisely and in a cooperative manner. This year our common defence policy has taken steps forward that seemed unthinkable just a few months ago. The Gahler report is very ambitious, and I think these are the right times to be ambitious and daring. Today the main building blocks of a European Union of security and defence are finally there. We can now research and develop our defence capabilities together. We can buy together to ensure that we have the capabilities we need, while spending efficiently. We can act together to manage or prevent crises, to strengthen our partners, to make our citizens more secure. To get there, we have set up in just one year – even if this is built on many long years of parliamentary work, and not only in Parliament – an impressive number of new tools and initiatives, all of which would have seemed impossible just a few months ago – just last year, when we were holding this same debate in this hemicycle. We have done that while bringing our cooperation with NATO to an unprecedented level. Last year, we announced 42 joint actions with NATO, we have implemented them – I was reporting about that implementation with NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg just last week and, by the way, let me take this opportunity to congratulate him on the extension of his mandate to 2020 – and last week at the NATO ministerial meeting we agreed together 32 more actions, so our NATO partners know that a stronger European Union makes NATO stronger because our Member States and NATO allies have one set of forces as you mentioned that can be used in different environments, different frameworks and our organisations can only be complementary. And now I come to the tools we have put in place during this year of work. First, we created the first ever command centre for our military training and advisory missions. I have the impression that the demand for our military and civilian missions can only grow in the future, and now we have the right structures to plan and command our missions. Second, with the European Commission – and here perhaps I should jump over to the other side of the Hemicycle – we have set up a European defence fund. For the first time ever, the European Commission is committing common resources to invest in defence – not to militarise our budget, but on the contrary to help Member States spend better on defence by spending together. Third, we have established a coordinated annual review on national defence budgets for which a trial run has just been launched, and the first progress report is planned for November next year. And of course, the most historic step: just yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Council activated a Permanent Structured Cooperation on defence. This was unimaginable just a few months ago, let alone at the beginning of my mandate. I remember very well that at my hearing before your joint committees – and many of you might remember it as well – I replied to a question from Mr Danjean that I would work to use all of the instruments that the Lisbon Treaty gives us, and we have. We did it in the most ambitious and inclusive manner, with 25 Member States from the very beginning launching PESCO together. The 25 have taken binding commitments to improving their cooperation, and the progress on these commitments will be assessed regularly. We will start with the first set of 17 projects. These are very practical programmes. They will facilitate cooperation between our armed forces, fill some gaps in our capabilities, and make our European defence spending much more efficient. I have mentioned this several times, we have an investment gap across the Atlantic: the Europeans invest 50% of what the Americans invest on defence, but the output gap is much more impressive because what we get out of our investment is 15% of what the Americans get, so here is where we can act at the European Union level to make our investments in defence more efficient. These projects range from common military training to new technologies for protecting our critical infrastructures, to providing medical support to our operations, and I could continue. The possibilities of the Permanent Structured Cooperation are immense and they will be even greater if we manage to make the Permanent Structured Cooperation work together with all our new defence tools. The Member States that launched the Permanent Structured Cooperation have committed to fully participate in the comprehensive annual review on defence, and they will use the European Defence Fund whenever possible. The defence fund could be used to create a bonus for projects undertaken in the Permanent Structured Cooperation framework. The coordinated review will help us identify new fields for cooperation so that Permanent Structured Cooperation can step in. Obviously these initiatives will have to be developed coherently and using all possible synergies, but I believe that is exactly what the Lisbon Treaty had in mind when creating the not double, but triple-hatted High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency. Actually, this is why I should deliver my speech somewhere in the middle of my speaking positions in the hemicycle, because I think that the work we have done this year also has an institutional value, to show that the different institutions we have can join forces in a coordinated manner towards one objective and delivering results that were considered impossible to achieve. I must confess that at this moment I am torn between two different personal feelings: on the one hand, I think ‘Habemus Papam’ – white smoke, mission accomplished – but there is no time to celebrate. It is true that we made it, it’s historic, it’s big, but at the same time the real work is just about to begin. I think we have to be aware that this is a new chapter in the history of the European Union, but today we have the paper, we have the ink, and we have a good story to tell. So we have work to do and I think we have to look immediately from today, the day after the decision on the Permanent Structured Cooperation was formally taken in the Council and look immediately at the next steps. So it is not only about the Permanent Structured Cooperation and its possibilities, the concrete projects and many more other things, but other fields of action will also be on our agenda in the year to come. The work on our battle groups, for instance, is not finalised yet, and I hope and I encourage Member States to be ambitious and to achieve progress in the Athena Committee by the end of this year or early 2018. On top of that we are also working on new proposals on how to fund together our work on security and defence. Together with NATO we are also working to improve military mobility inside the European Union, and this project also fits very well in our defence cooperation agenda. Last but not least, I would also like to see in the next few months progress on our civilian missions and capabilities, because security threats have changed and this makes our civilian engagement even more important. Think of our new mission to support security sector reform and stabilisation in Iraq, or our long-standing civilian commitment in the Balkans or in Eastern Europe, and you realise that these are key elements of our work on security. So the European way to security and defence lies precisely in the careful and wise mix between targeted military and civilian actions. That is what makes the European Union a unique security interlocutor and player in the world. In three years of common work since I started, our European Union of security and defence has advanced enormously. I would say we have achieved more in these last three years than in the previous 30 or 60 years and it makes me proud, also as an Italian, that this happens in the year of the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. That was part of the dreams of our founding fathers and mothers. But again, we have to look at the next 60 years.

Today we are debating two of the most important reports this Parliament has ever debated, namely the reports by Mr McAllister and Mr Gahler. As the complex security challenges are becoming more and more serious in our neighbourhood and beyond, the EU remains –as you rightly mentioned recently, Madam High Representative – the most predictable, credible and humane global power necessary to the whole world. Yes, we are expected to act in a united and effective manner inside and outside the Union to protect our citizens, to support our partners and allies, and to be able to prevent and manage rapidly the external threats from conventional to hybrid warfare, cyber and terrorist attacks. Therefore, strong cooperation in the context of the CFSP and CSDP is the best answer. Only this will allow the EU to enhance our defence capabilities and prevent duplication.  It goes without saying that these commitments require adequate Member State and EU budget adjustment and funding. I welcome the progress made since the adoption of the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security policy, including the adoption of the European Defence Fund and the legislative proposal on the European defence industrial programme, as well as the notification of the activation of PESCO last November, which is a major victory for the Union and for our future defence and security capabilities. I would like this to become the most inclusive and ambitious project possible for our Union.  Finally, I would like to stress the importance of our transatlantic relations and our strategic and complementary partnership with NATO, as well as the importance of the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans for the security and stability of the Union.

Events in Libya have seen large tracks of its territory fall into the hands of armed militias. The illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 has sparked fresh tensions with the European Union, whilst war still goes on, sadly, in the east of Ukraine. President Erdoğan of Turkey, meanwhile, presses ahead with his reorientation of Turkey in a Middle Eastern direction, seeking a dominant role in regional politics and hollowing out democratic institutions at home. Furthermore, despite continued progress and improvements in the Western Balkans, Euro-Atlanticist integration of that region still remains challenging. This is set against a wider backdrop of increased global threats such as terrorism, climate change, migratory fluxes, cyber attacks and a less engaged and isolationist America following the election of President Trump.  It is no surprise, therefore, that we see a renewed focus in demand by Member States to work together more closely at EU level in the realms of foreign security and defence policies. The 2016 global strategy set out a bold vision for the EU in this regard, and a concrete example seen this year in the form of permanent structured cooperation on security and defence (PESCO), with 25 out of 27 EU Member States now having joined, and the launch of a European defence fund, prove that this is now a reality.  Despite Brexit, it is clear that the United Kingdom, my country, understands the need and has a desire to remain fully engaged with the EU in these areas, and will remain a member of NATO and seek a strong NATO common security and defence policy (CSDP) cooperation.

We live in a time of new security challenges for Europe and this automatically means that we must adapt our policies to the changing situation. But at the same time, we must have ice in our stomachs and not let ourselves be swept away by a multitude of ill-considered proposals and measures that even sometimes contravene the Treaty, and that is where we are today. We Greens believe that instead of the EU taking on new tasks, we should be better at those we already have today. These include various types of peace efforts and work before, during and after a conflict, including aid. We also want to reform the EU's battle group so that it can actually be used in EU or UN peacekeeping operations, and we want to see more cooperation between EU countries, not least in terms of defense materials. That is why we are more positive about the voluntary cooperation in Pesco, which has long been enshrined in the Treaty. On the other hand, we strongly oppose a quantitative target for Member States' defense budgets, and believe that targets should be qualitative, ie. a budget for real needs with a focus on increased defense capability. The two percent target is not a guarantee of increased defense capability. The only clear winner is the arms industry. Investments made must be smart and efficient to get more security for the money, instead of risking contributing to arms race and increased tensions. Today, EU member states spend most of the world in the world after the United States on defense, but we get relatively little for our money, just as Mrs Mogherini said, because each country keeps its own defense industry under its arms with inefficient subsidies. The result is that we have an overproduction of defense equipment in the EU. It drives countries to sell the surplus abroad to sometimes hesitant buyers. And the Commission has recently calculated that we can save between EUR 25 and 100 billion on increased cooperation in the field of armaments, and through increased cooperation and coordination released funds are reinvested in strengthened defense capabilities and also make it easier for Member States to cooperate in EU peacekeeping operations. In summary, we are green for increased cooperation on materiel and for greater joint involvement in conflict prevention and peace-promoting efforts. On the other hand, we are opposed to the gradual transfer of power over defense policy to the EU. We do not want to see an EU budget for defense or a defense fund, defense industry program, EU Ministry of Defense or an EU army. We want the EU to continue to be a peace project, not for the Union to become a military alliance or be given responsibility for Europe's territorial defense. Then I have a question for Mrs Mogherini, and it is also about the letter that 4 party groups sent to the High Representative about an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia - something that we in this House have already taken a position on 3 times.

The report presented to us today shows how much the European Union is doing in spite and against the will of the peoples and their interests. For a long time, this was done on the sly, but it has become evident since the infamous Treaty of Lisbon, which was imposed on the peoples of Europe, and particularly on mine, when the popular votes had been extremely clear. We are already questioning the merits of NATO, an organization which places the military assets of its members under the command of a political will that is not that of their people. The European Union is placed under the dependence of NATO, and therefore of American interests, while Trump's foreign policy is marked by uncertainty and it is more than ever necessary that each country retain its freedom to act. . Yes, cooperating with allies and conducting joint military operations is useful, but being a single force under the command of the European Union, certainly not.

These two reports were entrusted to deputies of the party of Mrs. Merkel. So it’s not surprising to read some untruths there. Thus, one of the rapporteurs dares to say, for example, that Russia would prevent the resolution of the conflict in Syria, then, in the next paragraph, that the priority would be - I quote - \"to consolidate\", for migrants, \"a way legal and secure access to Europe ”. Let's get back to a little serious, if I may! When it comes to CSDP, it must be remembered, and I quote, that \"most European countries are incapable of defending themselves. The national army is often barely good at parades and a few multinational mode missions of medium intensity and range. \" Madame Mogherini, it was Nicolas Gros-Verheyde who made this observation in the introduction to the book he published last April and which you yourself prefaced. If the armies of our various countries are more and more like paper tigers, it is first of all because we have continued to reduce defense budgets, even though China, the India, Indonesia, but also Russia and the United States are increasing their spending in this area, which obviously conditions any credible foreign policy. In 2016, with 664 billion dollars, the American budget was three times the budget of all Europeans combined. In his report, Gahler calls for the creation of an integrated European force. But instead of an artificial superstructure, if we want our armies to cooperate effectively, we should first promote operational and logistical consultation: this is through the multiplication of joint military exercises between armies, mutually recognizing the disparity of capacities and ambitions that common strategic perspectives can be defined.Only the conduct of operations by coalitions with various perimeters to three, four, five, or even more, constitutes a realistic objective.In short, flexible and voluntary cooperation.Finally, what's the point of making big speeches about Defense Europe if it's to keep buying American equipment?After Brexit, France will be the only European country to have both nuclear weapons and a seat on the UN Security Council, but also a successful military industry.Behind large groups like Dassault, Thales or MBDA, there is a myriad of innovative SMEs that deserve to be supported.Robotics and biomimicry, these are defense sectors in which we must invest so as not to be left behind by our competitors, whether American or Asian.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "- Mr President, of the European Union countries, only Greece and Cyprus face a real threat to their security coming from Turkey, which is directly and formally raising claims against its territorial integrity.

The policies that are being implemented today go in this direction and, from this point of view, they do not infringe on the sovereignty of States either. Each retains its own armed forces, each has them as they wish. France - it has been repeated here -, which today remains the most active military nation in Europe, has troops deployed in the UN, in NATO, in the European Union and in strictly national capacity. This in no way encroaches on its sovereignty, but guarantees that of the Europeans a little more. This is what we have to work on today: pragmatism, flexibility and, above all, efficiency.

The logic of all this is to underline the need for western solidarity and for us all to put our energies into revitalising the alliance that binds the United States and Britain to the security of Europe. It is called NATO, but instead the European Union is creating an entirely separate European defence union separate from NATO but still involving most of the NATO allies.

First of all, many thanks to David McAllister and Michael Gahler for trusting and productive cooperation. The McAllister report sums it up: it is about a combination of effective multilateralism, joint soft power and credible hard power. That's exactly what it's all about: the combination of soft power and hard power. We can be proud of our soft power, and we must continue to develop it in the future. Because it's not about a pendulum that now swings from soft power to hard power, as if one was yesterday's news, so to speak, and the other our future, but rather both. But it just doesn't work without hard power. There is a lot to do. How can we work better in the EU? More efficiently, for example, through joint procurement and research. I simply do not leave it as it is when Mrs Lösing from the GUE Group makes the same false claims every time, as if we were trying to set in motion an arms spiral here, and then leaves the room because the debate is not really about it Interested. In this respect, we should not allow this to be offered to us without contradiction. \"The world is out of joint,\" said a former German Foreign Minister. We can no longer rely on the US alone. We must take security in Europe and around the EU into our own hands. That is fair to the USA and unfortunately also necessary, especially since the US President is increasingly developing from a guarantor of security to a security risk. We will have to discuss a lot more. What financial contribution will the Member States make? What role does parliament have to play in concrete terms, and how will we shape the joint project of limiting and controlling arms exports? We made a good start.

Moreover, on a global scale, politics is precisely the field that generates conflicts and threats.

Therefore, the implementation of something like a common defense policy is only another step on the way to liquidate the sovereignty of European countries. And that's true about the process we're starting. The European states have already been deprived of the possibility to decide on monetary and fiscal policy and legislation. Yet foreign and defense policy will be taken away and European states will become a fiction. Europe will resemble the United States, but only in the sense that European countries will be like some set of American Indian reservations.

If we are wondering what this cooperation can bring, I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the long run, the effects of research and development and implementation of modern technologies may be particularly important. Today we have two problems. The first is that defense spending is too low in Europe, and the second is that too little is spent very badly. This is illustrated by the fact that every year all EU countries spend 40% of the US defense budget, and unfortunately our effectiveness is only 15%.

Security and defence has once again become the underlying issue of the EU integration project. It is clear that no single Member State can tackle the complex security challenges we are facing today alone. In order for the EU to be able to respond in internal and external challenges, we need to step up cooperation, pool our resources and focus on strategy priorities. I am aware that it will take time to reach full cooperation. However, the first projects to come out of the initiative, especially in the areas of training, capacity development and operational readiness, seem to be promising. In order to make full use of this cooperation, we will need to care about the seeds which we already sowed. This would also mean establishing fully—fledged EU civilian—military strategic structures, support from the Union budget and trust and cooperation on the side of the Member States.

These significant shifts have almost exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic among us who worked on the European Defense Union Report. I would like to emphasize the importance of continuing a credible enlargement process as the best guarantor of security on the Union's south-eastern borders, but also within the European Union. I also emphasize the need for clear communication of these achievements. It is not about the militarization of the European project or the European army. It is about meeting the expectations of more than two thirds of our citizens who prioritize security as a priority. We have duplicated actions for too long and spent resources uncoordinated.

The political weight and influence of the Union does not correspond to our important economic, commercial weight, in terms of development cooperation and humanitarian aid.

We will thus be stronger and have more response capacity as our citizens demand. That is why I congratulate you, Mrs Mogherini. One of our main external priorities is instability in the neighborhood, both southern and eastern. We also have global interests and we cannot stop acting in any region. The transatlantic axis is a key element of our foreign action. That is why, as Mr McAllister's report calls for, important links with the United States must be preserved. It is also relevant to increase our presence in the vast space of Asia-Pacific, whose stability we also need.

This is the result of a common work that needs now to be continued. Let me start by saying that I count on this common work to continue in the months and the years ahead. Some of you were asking if we can be optimistic today. I know that we are not used to that. It is about realism and pragmatism today more than optimism. To quote a great figure of the last century and partially also of this one, Nelson Mandela said that ‘it always seems impossible until it’s done’. This is exactly such a case, where everybody was predicting that this would be impossible for various reasons. The work on the European defence would be impossible because the political conditions were not there, and because of this and that, and we proved that political conditions can be created when there is determination and when there is the support of our citizens. As some of you mentioned – I think it was David McAllister – our citizens strongly support our common work at European Union level on security and defence and also on foreign policy, and this creates the political conditions for us to deliver. On this, there is a top priority for our citizens. This has also been possible, and will continue to be possible, which is even more important because we decided at a certain moment to move from the theoretical ideological approach and debate on European defence and security work to a practical, useful and concrete approach, consisting of single actions that could improve our work on security and defence, delivering on the needs of our citizens.  Madam President, I will address most of the concerns and questions of Members of Parliament who are no longer here, which probably means that their concerns were not so urgent. It is more difficult to work with facts and practical decisions to be taken than to stick with stereotypes. However, if you look at the facts, we are not talking about creating a European Union army: all 25 Member States that are launching the permanent structured cooperation are going to continue to keep their national forces. They are also going to continue to use their capabilities, either in European Union missions and operations or in NATO if they are NATO allies, or in UN peace-keeping missions or in other ways. What we are doing is not militarisation; we are not working on the militarisation of our Union. We are not turning our Union, which is and will remain a political union and a force mixing hard and soft power, as most of you remember. We are not turning this into a militarisation approach; on the contrary, when I say that our missions and operations will be even more needed in the months and the years to come, it is exactly because the world needs more and more missions and operations like the European Union ones, which are working for peace in a cooperative manner on the ground. This is what is required. This is a different approach – the European way – and this is what is needed in the world today. The force for peace sometimes also requires hard force and military means, but they must always be used for the service of peace. We have not weakened, duplicated or entered into competition with NATO. When I say proudly that we have never worked so well and so much together with NATO in the fields where NATO doesn’t have the instruments to work on some threats, and that we have useful cooperation with NATO as a military alliance, I find it a bit strange to hear that this would mean that the European Union would be subordinate to the United States.  The following two debates are going to be on the Iran nuclear deal and on Jerusalem. I have the impression that we are putting strategic autonomy in practice in these times, so maybe we might face the contrary problem down the road. But I think we have to get out of the pre-cooked ideological arguments that we are sometimes used to using in the political debate and look at the reality. Reality changes, and this reality has changed in the European Union, thanks in part to the work of this Parliament, to a lot of determination and sometimes to our stubbornness. The last myth that we have to overcome is that it is about spending. How much Member States spend on defence is up to national governments and national parliaments. It’s not even up to this parliament, but to the way in which these investments are made, whether it’s an efficient or inefficient way of investing which means together or not together, in a fragmented or in a coordinated manner. For example, investing in a European manner or buying in a European manner. Again, strategic autonomy in industry is an area in which the European Union can make a difference. So, there are national decisions, but the European Union is the only one – and NATO and our American friends have understood this perfectly well – that can change the fundamental factor of spending better on the European Union side. My last two points are very specific ones. One is to answer Ms Alliot—Marie: I am already preparing an annual report on the CSDP, and I would be very pleased to use this opportunity for the European Parliament to include a report on progress on this specific issue. I think it is going to be very useful to carry on the work in a practical, concrete and punctual manner, including on the resources that we will have to allocate in the future to sustain the ambitions which we are defining. The very last point, Madam President – and I am sorry to raise this – but this is a debate about European foreign security and defence policy. It’s about the comprehensive approach bringing together different tools and instruments. The work of the Parliament is extremely valuable in this field – unique, I would say. I would not have made it without the work of the parliament. It is quite sad for me to see that in one afternoon this plenary has eight points on the agenda on foreign policy. This is fragmentation, and it is a waste of the visibility and working capacity of the plenary itself. Obviously, it is your autonomous choice, but if you could streamline a little more the focus of foreign policy debates, I think this would be added value for the work of the Parliament.

Apart from that, it does not make sense to repeat wrong things, it does not make them more true. Just to reiterate, it is of course not about the militarisation of the EU. We will definitely not be financing military operations out of our budget in the future. We will definitely not be buying tanks or aircraft or helicopters out of the EU budget in the future. Rightly so, this remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments. But we have to become more efficient. This exercise is primarily a ‘more efficiency’ exercise, because if we plan together, if we procure together, if we train together, that makes us more efficient in the tasks ahead.

In the near future, there should be more intensive cooperation in the area of ​​security and defense between 25 EU countries. It is to be welcomed if the European Union does what it is particularly strong, to pool its resources and to agree on a common approach.

If we look around us – and we are doing this quite consistently today – we see a dangerous world, indeed. There is a risk that tensions will rise around the holy places of Jerusalem – we will discuss this in the next debate – Daesh has been defeated in Iraq, but the war in Syria is not over yet, Egypt has just suffered one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, and the war in Yemen is getting worse by the day. To look a little bit further, in the Korean Peninsula there is a security challenge that potentially affects all of us: nuclear proliferation is a reality. Against this background, preserving and implementing the nuclear deal with Iran is an absolute must. We simply cannot afford more tension in the Middle East and another nuclear proliferation crisis. We cannot afford to undermine the credibility of a multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council resolution, and we cannot afford to dismantle a deal that works and delivers on its promises. The deal with Iran is ensuring the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. This is vital for our collective security in the European Union, in the region and beyond, and it is even more important as we face a nuclear crisis with North Korea. With a nuclear deal with Iran, we have established the strongest monitoring system ever set up. The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported nine times that Iran is implementing all its nuclear-related commitments. It took us 12 years of extremely difficult negotiations, led by the European Union, to achieve these results. Renegotiating the deal, or parts of it, is simply not an option. No one can possibly believe, in good faith, that this is a credible path to follow. After President Trump’s announcement of a new US strategy towards Iran, we Europeans have made our position very clear. Preserving the deal is our shared security interest, and the best way for the United States to address their security concerns – which are also ours – is in close cooperation with we Europeans. We Europeans share many of our American friends’ preoccupations regarding the regional situation and Iran’s ballistic missile programme, which is inconsistent with UN Security Council Resolution 2231. This is why we still have some targeted sanctions and an arms embargo in place. But these issues should not be mixed up with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the nuclear deal and must be addressed in the appropriate formats and fora. Dismantling a nuclear agreement that is working would not put us in a better position to discuss all the rest. The opposite would happen. In fact, this is what we always do in our contacts with Iran. We discuss all the issues we have on the table, from cooperation to the difficult ones, including regional issues. On 20 November, we held the latest EU—Iran high-level dialogue and, as you know, I meet regularly with Foreign Minister Zarif. For more than two years now, we have built a very frank relationship with Iran. We are always open about our disagreements – and there are many – and we always try to find the best way to address them. This approach has also driven our conversations on human rights. We still have substantive disagreements but, together with Iran, we have agreed to focus on tangible results. For example, we welcome the recent adoption by Tehran of the revised anti—narcotics law. If properly implemented, it could lead to a significant drop in the number of executions of drug offenders in Iran. At the last high-level dialogue I mentioned a few weeks ago, there was also agreement to continue our engagement on women’s empowerment and on the treatment of prisoners. We have also agreed to look into possibilities for cooperation on the fight against drugs and on migration. Let me remind us all that Iran has played – and continues to play – an important role in hosting millions of Afghan refugees and we are ready to increase our common work and support in this field. Since we reached the nuclear deal, our engagement with Iran has entered a new phase. As I mentioned, it is not always easy. There are many issues where we disagree, but it is definitely a new phase. Trade between Iran and Europe increased by 94% in the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Oil exports have reached the pre—sanctions level and billions of outstanding oil debts have been paid back. Foreign direct investment is increasing and the Iranian Government reported growth of 55% compared to the previous year. Progress in the financial and banking sector has been slower due to a number of factors, but important work is being carried out to improve the situation, also including on the Iranian side. Civil nuclear cooperation is also an integral part of the deal, and let me stress that, as the debate refers to the Iran nuclear deal, I am focusing here on the implementation of the deal and all the nuclear-related parts of it. I would obviously be very pleased to have a ninth debate today to address all the issues that are not covered under the nuclear deal and that are issues that we are addressing and we believe need to be addressed in our relations and talks with Iran. I am thinking of the war in Syria and the conflict in Yemen, even if I touched upon some of the bilateral issues we are working on. As I was saying, civil nuclear cooperation is an integral part of the deal. Our civil nuclear cooperation makes the nuclear deal more solid through increased transparency. The second High—Level Seminar on Civilian Nuclear Cooperation has just taken place in Isfahan and concrete cooperation activities are being rolled out. This cooperation is important for we Europeans and is even more important for the people of Iran. I would like us all to remember the images of young Iranians – girls, boys, but also not just young people – celebrating the deal in the streets of Tehran. I believe we have the responsibility to show these people and the Iranian leadership that they have an interest in making Iran more open and more cooperative, and that this brings benefits to the leadership and the people – especially to the people. It is in their interest and in our own interest. The deal with Iran prevented a nuclear escalation in the Middle East. It showed that diplomacy is the best way to overcome longstanding problems that sometimes seem impossible to solve. This is something we have not forgotten and this is why we believe that a diplomatic, but critical, engagement with Iran can benefit the entire Middle East and prevent a regional escalation that would destabilise the whole world. At this complicated moment for the region and for the world, let me say that the European Parliament has taken part of the responsibility for our collective security and I am grateful for that.  I would like to thank you for your contacts with the US Congress and I would also mention the visit of the delegation for relations with Iran to that country. As always there was excellent cooperation and coordination with me and with all our teams that are working on these files. I think we showed teamwork and that the European institutions across the board – including the European Parliament that to me plays an essential role in European foreign policy – managed to, as we always say, speak with one voice or pass the same message. Then, when the message is passed by different players across the EU institutions, it becomes louder and clearer. So let me thank you once again for your cooperation over the last weeks and months. Let me also say that I believe we will need this kind of cooperation even more in the weeks and months ahead, which will probably also be difficult. The work is not over, but I think that we are doing what needs to be done, again thanks also to your determined work.

Since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) entered into force, the International Atomic Energy Agency has – as you rightly mentioned, Madam High Representative – certified nine times that Iran is in compliance with the commitments set out in the agreement. Following this, the international community has lifted the nuclear-related sanctions, whereas sanctions imposed by the EU and the US relating to human rights abuses and terrorist activities remain in place. The US non-nuclear-related sanctions are, nevertheless, much more comprehensive and have an extraterritorial effect that causes legal uncertainty and poses problems to the EU forums dealing with Iran.  The EU position is unequivocal. The US President’s decision to decertify the deal is damaging US credibility and interests, especially now, considering the worsening of the North Korean crisis. This decision remains purely an internal matter for the US, as the agreement remains a multilateral agreement and cannot be scrapped by a single party. In parallel, there are a number of other issues that are not part of the agreement but should be included in our EU high-level dialogue with Iran.

Many so-called hardliners labelled it as a capitulation. These people not only failed to appreciate that the deal was concerned with one particular aspect, i.e. Iran’s nuclear weapons programme, but also they viewed the sanctions as an end in themselves rather than as a route to the negotiating table. Iran’s human rights record is atrocious. I am the first to admit to that, and we should not fail to speak out against, and I have done on many occasions. Its support for terrorist groups in the Middle East is well documented and must be thoroughly condemned. Its continued engagement in a regional, sectarian battle for supremacy with Saudi Arabia creates instability and should be strongly discouraged. These issues are, however, irrelevant when it comes to discussing this deal. That the JCPOA be enforced and measured solely against its specific aims is integral to its negotiation. Halting and hopefully ultimately preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is what we must remain focused on, not stoking the narrative of Iran as a pariah state deserving of sanctions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that Iran has kept within all of the technical parameters of the deal, even if at times, these parameters have been pushed to their limits. I am pleased, therefore, that the EU Member States and the High Representative have spoken strongly in favour of the deal, following President Trump’s continued threats to withdraw from it, which I regard as unacceptable. At a time when tensions with North Korea are at a breaking point, the ability to highlight a successful nuclear non-proliferation deal is of more value than ever.

A deal on the new looming nuclear arms challenge was a hurdle that needed to be overcome.  Firstly, the systematic human rights violations remain the priority, and should be part of every dialogue, visit and communiqué involving the EU. There can be no watering down of what we mean when we talk about human rights. They are universal, even if people pray to a different god or are born in a different culture. Executions, torture, censorship and gender discrimination without due process are unacceptable.  Secondly, Iran’s role in its region is a disaster. In Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, it is clear that Iran, through the Revolutionary Guards, as well as Hezbollah, seeks to ruthlessly push its interests and influence, and I am glad that the High Representative mentioned the problematic ballistic missile firings as a key point of concern as well. We should not be naive, and we should not be distracted either. We were warned about the potential unrest in the region as a consequence of the nuclear deal, but instead of tearing up the deal like President Trump suggests, let us do what we can to stop Iran’s toxic influence. We stand by our words and will honour EU commitments, but we must never blindly defend the indefensible. Through the new challenges to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action by President Trump, I actually fear that we are again ending up in a place where all we will talk about is the nuclear deal.

In this context, his participation in the resolution of various conflicts and political crises, especially in the Middle East, is necessary and is constantly judged.

The image of Iran as the enemy par excellence and the only source of regional instability certainly does not help the future of the Middle East. Honestly, I struggle to identify him as solely responsible for regional problems: on the contrary, he is certainly in good company. The defense of human rights is necessary and mandatory, but as has been recalled, in addition to Tehran's role in welcoming Afghan refugees, the nuclear deal is working globally.

The position of the President of the United States has been very clear. This matter has to be addressed jointly and that is why it has not wanted to certify the agreement and has forwarded it to Congress. However, I want to say that I agree with the position of Vice President and High Representative Mogherini that it is important to preserve the achievements of this agreement, to address it separately and, indeed, to try to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region. Therefore, I support and really share the opinion of the High Representative. However, that should not lead us to the situation of being unaware of the disturbing situation - to which other colleagues have referred - of human rights in Iran. The high representative has offered to have a critical dialogue and to address this situation in a future appearance. We are concerned about the rights of minorities, the application of the death penalty and the situation of the opposition.

The Iranian nuclear program went from being highly opaque to allowing monitoring and even applying restrictions, and remember that it was signed at a time when it was believed that this country was on the verge of secretly obtaining the bomb nuclear. Having seen the failure of the embargo, which lasted for a long time, and which mainly punished the Iranian people, this agreement, supported by the European Union from the first moment, was a notable diplomatic success and, as such, was welcomed by the wider international community. In his incendiary vertigo, President Trump proposed to the United States Congress the approval of new sanctions against Iran on the grounds that this agreement does not meet American interests.

Iran never gave up its nuclear ambitions and was launching ballistic missiles instead, it supported terrorists – like Hezbollah – and it tried to achieve the status of a regional power, penetrating Iraq, Syria and Yemen, which could shake the very fragile regional balance of power.  It seems, therefore, that Iran is rather encouraged by this deal, not curbed by it, and therefore I do not see any reason why we should be worried about preserving the deal. It is a failure.

And if Iran builds atomic bombs, Saudi Arabia and all countries in the region will also make atomic bombs. So far this has been avoided.

The Iran nuclear deal was a diplomatic success of the European Union. With recent developments related to the statements by the President of the United States, who expressed the willingness to withdraw the US from the agreement, the diplomatic effort of the European Union must be even stronger. I agree with the High Representative in reiterating that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a multilateral agreement adopted by a resolution of the United Nations Security Council, and that therefore it does not belong to any state and cannot be modified unilaterally. We need to confirm our support for the agreement: in addition to being the basis for a renewed economic relationship with Iran, the implementation of the JCPOA, with the consequent easing of sanctions, is having a positive political impact on Iranian citizens. Furthermore, I believe that Iran's opening to an international dimension can be a stimulus to improve the internal situation and a unique opportunity to initiate a process of full integration of Iran in an international and global context. The European Union, of course, must pursue the establishment of a strategic and structured dialogue, which must also go beyond the superficial aspects, and which must therefore also address issues related to the violation of human rights. The alarming use of the death penalty, the persecution of minorities, the arrests of activists and discrimination against women cannot be ignored.

First of all, the purpose of the nuclear deal with Iran – the name says it very clearly – is nuclear, and only nuclear. Was this a right or wise choice or not? It was taken 14 years ago at the beginning of the negotiations, and I don’t believe I disclose a secret if I say that it was the decision of the Gulf countries and the American administration at the time to limit the negotiations to purely nuclear issues. It was Iran at that time insisting on having a negotiation that would have included other aspects.  Was it a wise choice or not? Not for me or for you to judge it today, but the decision back then – not by Iran, by the way – was of a different kind. Since it was purely nuclear, we have facts certified by an agency that has proven to be crucial and will continue to prove to be crucial in other nuclear proliferation issues like the IAEA, certifying that nuclear commitments of the nuclear deal have been met constantly. It would not be wise to weaken the credibility of the agency, of the IAEA, when a few months or years from now we will hopefully need to push for the IAEA to enter and monitor other nuclear programmes. So if the agency testifies and certifies nine times after inspections, after technical work – and that needs to be happening in fully independent, non-political arguments for that on all sides – that the nuclear commitments under the nuclear agreements are met, then the deal is working. Full stop. That is a fact.  Then, second, does this mean that we are positive about Iran, that we trust Iran, that there is an optimism about the atmosphere? It is exactly because it is a country like Iran that you need to have a nuclear deal, because you do not want a country like Iran in that region to develop a nuclear weapon. If it was Switzerland, maybe we would be in a different position. It is not about being naive; it is the contrary. It is the lack of trust that makes the deal indispensable. And this was the reasoning of all the years of negotiations. This was the reason why the US administration engaged in this at that time, not having diplomatic relations with Iran, which is something that on the contrary most of the European Union Member States have. And there is one fundamental argument that some of you have raised: if we start saying that, with any change of administration, agreements and international commitments are put into question, we are not doing ourselves a favour, because nobody would accept negotiating any agreement, any international agreement with any administration of the future or of the present. In Latin we say: Pacta sunt servanda. That is the basis of any legal system of the world.  So it is exactly because there is and was no trust that an agreement was needed. Then it is true, not in an article of the JCPOA – I know it almost by heart by now – but in the preamble of the 104 pages of agreement, that there is a reference, half a sentence, that suggests that this agreement could open the way, could form the basis for a different kind of engagement, a more constructive engagement in the region. That sentence – here maybe I disclose a secret – was introduced at Iran’s request, because the Iranian leadership at the time, which is the same that has been reconfirmed today, intended to use the agreement as a way to ask their own population, their own public opinion, for a mandate to engage with the rest of the world in a political battle which we know very well has happened inside Iran and is continuing to happen. Some of you referred to the fact that undermining the full implementation of the nuclear deal also weakens those in Iran’s political scene who are trying to commit in their own way – which is not ours – towards an opening and an engagement with the rest of the world.  Weakening or putting into question the JCPOA is a way to strengthen the hardliners in the political scene in Iran. Is it convenient for us? Not for us, for sure. Having said that, what would happen if the deal was not there? Imagine that tomorrow the deal was no longer there. Would the human rights situation in Iran improve? Probably not; on the contrary, hardliners would be stronger. Would the regional behaviour of Iran improve? For sure it would not. Would the Iranian nuclear programme continue to be monitored? No. Would the IAEA have the means to be in the country? No. Would we be sure that Iran would not develop a nuclear programme that is purely peaceful? Definitely not, and enrichment would go up again tomorrow.  So is it convenient to keep the nuclear deal in place? Yes. This is the very simple argument that is keeping the entire world committed to the full implementation of the JCPOA, and I am confident that the United States of America will also remain committed to the full implementation of the JCPOA. This is what we discussed with Secretary of State Tillerson last week in Brussels, and this is the message we got from him. We are continuing to implement the agreement, and just today in Vienna the Secretary-General of the EEAS, Schmid, who has played a crucial role in these negotiations together with an excellent team from the European Union side, is chairing at deputy level the Joint Commission of the JCPOA once again. We do it regularly, sometimes at ministerial level. We did it last time in September with all the parties around the table. So I believe it is a matter of convenience; it is not a matter of being naive or ‘liking’ a system or a country. On the contrary. Two points I would like to clarify: one is related to the agreement. There is no sunset clause in the agreement – I know that this is often referred to. Read all the 104 pages of the agreement; there is no sunset clause to the agreement. The agreement has many different provisions with many different durations. Most of them last for a long, long time. Most of them last forever. And in the very beginning of the agreement there is the most important commitment taken by Iran: of never developing a nuclear weapon. This is a commitment that is there for ever as an NPT part.  So let’s stick to the facts. The nuclear deal, the nuclear commitment, fulfils more safety in the region and for us. That is why I said to our American friends that this is a matter of strategic relevance for European security. It is not about business, and it is not about the region; it is about security, because we do not want to see a region that is already troubled enough in a nuclear arms race. We miss just that. And then, good luck with North Korea: if we dismantle the only working deal on non-proliferation in the nuclear field, I want to see how we manage to peacefully solve the nuclear proliferation crisis that is currently ongoing. We have one deal that is preventing a nuclear proliferation, and we want to dismantle it? We must be crazy.  So I think, and I am confident, that we can continue to work to ensure that Iran continues to fulfil its commitments under the deal in full. That is the key point. The last point I would like to mention is on human rights, because it hurts me enormously when I hear voices saying that we stay silent on human rights. Actually, we are the ones that are more vocal on human rights when it comes to Iran. Look at President Trump’s speech. Look at the American discourse on the death penalty and compare it with the credibility on the death penalty that Europe has. Sorry to be blunt, but we have entered into a time where diplomacy has a different language. We are the ones raising individual cases, and we do it even today; in Vienna, issues were raised on individual cases. We are the ones who have started a human rights dialogue with Iran that regularly takes place. We are the ones, not others. And we are the ones raising this issue constantly. I don’t see others doing this. We never, ever avoid raising issues on human rights because of other reasons. We always do that, constantly and consistently, and sometimes – most of the time – we are the only ones. So let’s at least support and recognise the work we do. That is going to continue to be a very important aspect of our engagement with the country.  But again, I would say the most important thing for me are the social and the political dynamics inside the country. The Iranian population was celebrating the Iran deal, not because of nuclear issues, but because it was representing the opportunity to open up the country to international engagement. That is the investment that is smart to do as Europeans, and that is why I would like to thank this Hemicycle in its vast majority and the parliamentary delegations that travelled both to Iran and to Washington to support what is a fully united European Union position, when the entire world is looking at us to guarantee that the full implementation of the agreement is maintained by all sides.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "Thanks Vice President Mogherini.His marathon is not over and you will also stay with us for the next discussions.The discussion on this point is closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 317, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Ramona Nicole MĂNESCU", "mepid": "39717", "text": "  in writing. – Apparently, the Iran Nuclear Deal follows its course, and its implementation is flawless.

We believe that Jerusalem shall be the capital of two states: West Jerusalem for the state of Israel and East Jerusalem for the state of Palestine. We believe that the only way to achieve this goal is through direct negotiations between the parties based on the 1967 borders and that there is no alternative solution that would be both viable and sustainable, meet the aspirations of the two sides and address the legitimate concerns. This is the position of the entire European Union and this is what all 28 Foreign Ministers said yesterday morning to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one by one, in full unity. Our position is built on the most solid foundations. It is based on the Oslo Accords between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and on the international consensus embodied in UN Security Council Resolution 478. Our partners know very well where we stand and we have made it very clear – always, and during these last very difficult days. As a partner and as a friend, we have always been clear in our contacts with the United States, before and after the decision was taken. Exactly one week ago, I met with Rex Tillerson, the US Secretary of State, together with the 28 Foreign Ministers of the European Union Member States, and we invited the United States to carefully consider the repercussions that such a decision may have had on public opinion in the region and all around the world, because what happens in Jerusalem has global repercussions for good and for bad. This move risks strengthening radical forces in the region and weakening forces of wisdom and moderation, being completely counterproductive. We discussed these arguments with our American interlocutors, including a couple of days ago with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s Middle East adviser, and our contacts with our American friends will continue in the coming days and weeks.  The Israelis and the Palestinians also know where we stand and this makes us a credible, predictable and indispensable partner for them to restart a meaningful peace process. It therefore comes as no surprise that our meeting yesterday with Prime Minister Netanyahu was very open and frank. We did not hide our disagreements because this is what good friends and partners, as we are, should always do. We have made it clear that we will continue to respect the international consensus on Jerusalem as Europeans, including on the location of our embassies, until the final status of Jerusalem is resolved through direct negotiations between the parties.  At the same time, we understand Israel’s security concerns and we want to see them properly addressed. I took the opportunity of the visit of Prime Minister Netanyahu – the first one for more than 20 years – to condemn in the strongest possible terms all attacks against Jews everywhere in the world, including in Europe, and all attacks against Israeli citizens. At the same time, we believe that Israel’s security interests are best served by having a stable, viable, independent Palestinian state living in peace and security at the side of the Israeli state. This is what many great Israeli leaders have rightly believed throughout the years and this is what led Yitzhak Rabin to sign the Oslo Accords. I presented the very same position, very openly and very clearly, to our Palestinian and Arab friends. Last week, I spoke with President Abbas and guaranteed that the European Union will continue to work for Jerusalem to be the capital of both the state of Israel and the state of Palestine. We agreed with President Abbas that he will join us in Brussels on the occasion of the January Foreign Affairs Council, and we will have a similar discussion with him on the perspectives of the relaunch of the Middle East peace process that we had yesterday with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I also asked President Abbas to do all he can to make sure that all demonstrations remain peaceful. On Friday, in Brussels, I met with my Jordanian counterpart, and also my friend, Foreign Minister Ayman Al Safadi, and with him contacts have continued on a daily basis, actually several times a day. We are in contact with what we consider to be a key player at this moment because Jordan plays a very special role when it comes to Jerusalem. His Majesty the King of Jordan is the custodian of the holy sites, as agreed in the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. He is also a very wise man and I believe all of us remember the very wise words he addressed to this very Chamber a couple of years ago. I thank the Minister for the restraint and the wisdom shown by Jordan in this difficult situation, including the work done by Jordan and others during the League of Arab States Ministerial Meeting in Cairo last Saturday, where the Arab Peace Initiative was recalled as a useful framework to re—advance the possibility to start negotiations. The steps taken by the Arab states in these days and in the coming days, in the near future, will be particularly important: to show leadership, wisdom, restraint and moderation, keeping the clearly defined position that we are backing in full consistency with our consolidated position and role.  I can say that I believe that, in these hours and days, the European Union is an important point of reference for the Arab world. Regardless of all the narratives and the rhetoric about the Arab world and the West, Europe constitutes an important point of reference to uphold the principle and the consensus developed on Jerusalem. For us Europeans this situation is a call to mobilise with even greater conviction for peace between Israel and Palestine. We are determined to play an even more active role in trying to provide, first, a political horizon for the two-state solution – there is no realistic alternative to two states – and, second, to work to create the appropriate international and regional framework to relaunch direct negotiations. So we will keep working. We are continuing to work at this time with both parties and with the Middle East Quartet, which means together with the United States, Russia and the United Nations. This format, as I have said in recent days, could possibly be enlarged to include key regional players such as Jordan and Egypt, but we could also involve other important partners, such as Norway, who could play an important part in supporting this process. The United States should – and could – continue to play an important role in that framework.  It is in the darkest hours, such as these, that the work of peacemakers becomes more difficult – yes – but more important. We must first of all engage to prevent any escalation around Jerusalem, which could have terrible consequences for the region and beyond, and we must engage to preserve the objective of two states and recreate the conditions for the peace process to restart – the key to restart the engine.  Let me conclude by saying that Jerusalem is not just a city. Jerusalem is the cradle of three faiths. Our ancestors believed that it was the centre of the entire world and the whole world still looks at Jerusalem. It can be a reason for division and even war or it can be the most powerful symbol of peace and reconciliation. The region and the world count on Europe – count on the European Union – to stay engaged with a clear, united message and clear, determined work and this is exactly what we are doing in the clearest and most united manner.

The Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations have constantly used the notwithstanding clause of the Jerusalem Embassy Act to delay the implementation of the decision, without however contesting it. President Trump’s statement should come as no surprise, especially since he announced it during his election campaign. In the words of the statement, \"the United States has not taken a position on the final status issues, including the precise limits of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.\" This therefore does not contradict our position on the two-state solution, with Jerusalem as the capital.

Achieving peace in the Middle East does not depend on the status of Jerusalem, but on the deradicalization of societies there and the establishment of democracy and respect for human rights. We must note that a number of states today that oppose the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel are essentially opposed to the existence of the state of Israel as a Jewish state. This also takes on an additional dimension in light of the recent terrorist attacks on the Jewish community in Jerusalem, but also in Sweden where an anti-Semitic protest and a bomb attack on a synagogue took place. These are real problems that we must tackle with due seriousness, because the European Union has been indifferent for too long to the situation in the Middle East, as well as to the radicalization that is taking place on its soil. I believe that President Trump, in opting for a proactive US policy in the Middle East, has considered all aspects of his decision and that in cooperation with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states he has reached a certain level of agreement by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Such a decision should not be seen as opposed to the position of the European Union and the solution of two states for two peoples. On the contrary, I want to hope that this will encourage all parties to act faster and more efficiently, and that Jerusalem will continue to be, and above all, a holy city of Christians, Jews and Muslims.

The statement by President Trump recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is basically repeating what the US Congress and Senate already said with an overwhelming majority in 1995. It does not threaten the peace process and does not change anything about the accessibility of the holy sites, but simply recognises the fact that it has been a most important place for Jews for 3 000 years and the capital of the state of Israel since 1949. For Israel it is a confirmation of what in fact already exists and nothing more.  However, we have notoriously seen an aggressive reaction from the Palestinian Government and Hamas. They call for a third intifada, they shout anti—Semitic slogans, fire rockets on Israel and so on. They attack innocent civilians. So, Madam High Representative, President Trump’s announcement might be seen as politically insensitive, but the response is outrageous.

This announcement, and the decision to move the US embassy, is a counterproductive measure that will damage the chances of peace.

He is putting the US in violation of UN resolutions 476 and 478 by recognising part, or all, of East Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This poorly judged announcement has triggered words of concern and condemnation from around the globe. The entire Middle East has braced itself for the prospect of social unrest.

One: our role and the US role. Is this move from the United States a possibility for the European Union to play the mediator role alone? Is the US discredited as an honest broker, as many think in the Arab world? Can we go forward alone? I want to be very clear: I believe that it is not in anyone’s interests to see the United States’ role discredited. It is in everybody’s interest to make sure that we create the appropriate regional international framework that can accompany the restart of talks.  This is not the situation today, but I believe it is the responsible role of the European Union to try to help moving in that direction. Peace will not happen with the United States working alone on a plan, but peace will not happen without the United States being credibly engaged. I believe it is first of all an interest that our Palestinian and Arab friends share that we get to a point where together – and this is why we are engaging in the Quartet and with others in the region – we join forces. It is not either/or. It is not either a European Union initiative or a US initiative or anybody else’s initiative. We have to join forces. This is why I said there is not going to be a European Union-specific initiative or a specific mediating role that I am going to take or that we are going to suggest. No, we need to unite and join forces because this is not an easy conflict to solve, and we need all the relevant players to be engaged, but on a clear political horizon: two states, Jerusalem the capital of both, and steps that can be accompanied by this regional international framework to help the parties get there.  This is also why I did not say to Prime Minister Netanyahu that he is persona non grata – definitely not. He is the Prime Minister of Israel. I made it very clear – very clear – that we disagree on many different things, and I was probably clear even beyond what is normally done in diplomatic terms, because this is the way in which things should be. The European Union has a clear position. It states very clearly, it is consistent, and all its Member States are consistent with it: we are not going to move embassies, we are not going to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel until the final status of Jerusalem is determined through direct negotiations, and we want to see two states where Jerusalem is the capital of both.  We are very clear on that but we talk to everybody, starting with the parties. The European Union is well positioned, and is credible. I know that sometimes it is not perceived like this, but it is a credible interlocutor and partner for the two parties, the regional relevant players and the international community. Otherwise Prime Minister Netanyahu would not have been in Brussels yesterday morning, meeting the European Union and discussing the perspective with us. Even if I disagree with him on many things, I appreciate the fact that he visited and I think it is useful that we engage first of all with the parties on the way forward. And, by the way, it would be a little bit strange to play the mediator role and not talk to one of the parties. This is not even in nature, I have to tell you.  The second point: what is the priority now? First, to keep the situation on the ground calm, and this is why I am insisting on this report, which we need to give it to Jordan and to His Majesty the King of Jordan. Keep the situation calm in and around Jerusalem, and not to allow violence or escalation to take root. Second – and this goes together with it – to support the forces of wisdom in the region and to avoid a vacuum on the political scene, which would open the way for radical forces to benefit from this development. This is a specific role that the European Union can play because of our position; that is very clear and loud. The risk that I see is that the discourse gets polarised and that the forces that have always worked for peace, including in the Arab world, get isolated and marginalised, and that radicals take the leading role. This is a risk that Israel cannot afford, and that the Palestinians cannot afford either. The Palestinian leadership has always been ready to engage in dialogue for peace, in direct negotiations, and it would be damaging to both the Palestinians and the Israelis, but it is a risk that we are running. Third, as I said, keeping the political horizon, the political objective, very clear: two states with Jerusalem as the capital of both. Fourth, building an international and regional framework that can accompany the restart of direct negotiations. And last but not least – this is our own homework – I was pleased to see full unity in the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday (we always underline whenever we have a little comma that is different one from the other); 28 Member States fully in line, singing with different voices exactly the same song, consistent with the united position we have and have constantly had. This is what makes us powerful in passing the message, and I believe that this is going to be key for the continuation of our work. Last but not least, I took the opportunity of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s visit yesterday in Brussels to wish him a Happy Hanukkah already, but please do not turn a religious celebration into a political argument. This is very dangerous, and it is not respectful to religions. Maybe it is because I was born a few hundred metres away from the Vatican that I think this. This should not be done, and especially this should not be done when we are discussing the situation in Jerusalem. It is dangerous; religion should never ever be used for political purposes on either side.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 361, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "The conversation is closed.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 362, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "José BLANCO LÓPEZ", "mepid": "125044", "text": "written. - The president of the United States of America, by electoral calculation, has set fire to the very fragile status quo that governs between Palestine and Israel.

As Commissioner Avramopoulos is responsible for our internal work on migration, he will complement my introduction and will stay for the conclusions as well. We have all seen the images on CNN of the detention centres in Libya. Unfortunately, what the media has reported is not new. We have discussed this in this Chamber several times and this is not the first time that I am telling you about it personally.  I first heard the stories about the detention centres and the unthinkable violations of human rights a few years ago in Lampedusa; I was surprised that the rest of the world was not strongly reacting to stories that had been well known, not just for a couple of weeks, but for years. I heard them from people who had been tortured or had lost their loved ones. I heard them from the NGOs, from doctors and humanitarian workers who had been in those centres. If any of you have seen the film ‘Fuocoammare’, which I believe was also shown in the European Parliament in Brussels, I have heard those stories because they are told and are shown just in a film. So unfortunately there is nothing new.  But let me tell what we did after we first heard those stories, which does not mean two weeks ago, but a few years ago. Personally, I would say that it was still too late because Europe and the European Union should have acted even earlier, but it is now two or three years since we decided to act in a situation that was not easy.  Well before the media started to report on the situation in Libya, the European Union started to act. How? We engaged with the United Nations and in particular with international organisations for migrants to provide an alternative to migrants stranded in the country. I have said many times that our goal is to close the detention centres and I remember very well saying this in this Chamber a couple of months ago. We have worked to do precisely this, but it cannot be done overnight. We have now been working with the IOM and the UNHCR for a year, supporting their work inside Libya, which is the only way to address the situation. We need to give these people the opportunity to leave Libya safely, towards a better life, or I would rather say towards a life because in the detention centres you cannot call it life. Thanks to our work—the work of the European Union—just this year we have assisted over 15 000 migrants who were trapped in Libya and who now have been able, not only to go home with assisted voluntary returns supported by us and practically and operationally done by the IOM, but to start a new life.  I will give you one example. I was told the story of a group of ten young men from the Gambia who went home from Libya, thanks to our support, and with our funds bought a small refrigerated truck and are using it to deliver fish around the country. This is just one little story and is one example out of thousands of good stories about voluntary and sustainable returns. It is with stories like this that we also show local communities that embarking on a dangerous journey is not only a risk but is extremely dangerous and you might end up in a worse place than the one you left. These are the kind of stories that I think we need to share and we need to tell. We believe this is the right way to do things. It is humane, sustainable and with the right international standards in cooperation with the UNHCR and the IOM. Today new partners are finally joining our work.  The summit between the European Union and the African Union ten days ago in Abidjan was a turning point. It was a turning point not only on this, but was a key political summit for the EU—African Union partnership. This is not the issue we are discussing tonight—that is the tenth debate that we can have at about one o’clock tomorrow morning. On this issue our African partners have realised that it was time to seriously engage.  I believe our African partners had had enough of seeing their brothers and sisters dying in detention centres or along the route in the desert. They want to stop it and to stop the criminal networks that are making money out of death and slavery. We have set up a joint task force with the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations precisely to address the situation of migrants inside Libya and, already in the first ten days, the results are quite impressive. Right after we did that, in just nine days, we have assisted almost 2000 migrants in going back home from Libya voluntarily with the assistance of the IOM and there is a new awareness and a new common determination to act.  So thanks to this we now aim to transfer a further 15 000 people who are currently in detention centres. This would allow us to empty—to empty—the current population in the detention centres in the next few months. This is feasible. We have already assisted 15 000, 2000 of them in the last nine days, and we are aiming to transfer another 15 000 in the next couple of months with the practical work of the IOM and the cooperation of the African Union on the ground. But this is not enough. For some people going back home is not an option because of war or persecution. So for those who have the right to international protection we need to open new avenues to come to Europe or other safe places. The Commission has proposed welcoming 50 000 people in need of international protection and we have just launched a new programme with the UNHCR called the Emergency Transit Mechanism. The first transfers have already taken place so that those who have the right to receive asylum can come safely to Europe instead of risking their lives.  Is this enough? Clearly it is not and we are frustrated by every single person we do not manage to reach and every single place we do not manage to go.  You know the situation on the ground in Libya. It is not easy for the IOM and the UNHCR or for the NGOs simply to get around or to get access. Clearly it is not sufficient. It is not enough yet and we need to continue working together, including with the Libyan authorities. We need to overcome once and for all the system of systematic detention. We must allow the complete and proper registration of migrants and prosecute the criminal groups who are smugglers and enslavers.  I discussed this with President Sarraj this morning in order to prepare together the first meeting of this task force between the European Union, the African Union and the United Nations, which I called for at a political level for Thursday morning in Brussels. We will have this first operational meeting at a political level to accelerate our common work in Libya, but also beyond Libya because the situation further south along the route is also not at all rosy. We, first of all the European Union, are working to put an end to death and exploitation, to reduce risky journeys, to save lives at sea and in the desert and to provide international protection to those who need it. We are also working hand in hand with the United Nations to make progress in the political process in Libya.  Let me conclude with a word on this before I give the floor to Commissioner Avramopoulos to complete my remarks. The political process in Libya is, first and foremost, for the benefit of Libyans. We sometimes tend, with our European lenses, to forget that Libya is not just a place where migrants are passing through or detained. Libya is a country that has gone through very difficult times and is still in a very difficult situation. The Libyans themselves need to see our political support to overcome the current situation, but obviously improved governance will also help address the migration challenge inside Libya.  So the European Union is actively supporting the UN action plan at every stage. I met with President Sarraj ten days ago in Abidjan and, with Special Representative Salameh in Rome ten days ago. While there is not much progress to report yet, there is some movement in the right direction, but it is fragile and we need to stay resolute, particularly to support the Libyan Political Agreement through and beyond the deadline of 17 December. So it is clear that this job will not be done in a day. There will be bumps on the road and we will need long-term engagement, but we are on the right path. We are the only possible path to manage migration in a more humane and sustainable way and, finally, we are not alone. We will continue to work with all our determination, together with the African Union and the UN and in particular, the IOM and the UNHCR.

I am more than happy to be here and wish to complement what my colleague, Ms Federica Mogherini, said some minutes ago.  The situation is as described, but I think on the ground it is even worse, and the images we saw on CNN recently do not reflect the reality. We are conscious of what is happening there, but let me start by making one thing crystal clear: it is not the European Union’s action that has created an inhumane system in Libya. Quite the opposite. For far too long these unacceptable, appalling, conditions have existed there and it is the European Union which, together with its international partners, is coordinating the efforts to address and improve the situation on the ground. Our collective efforts cannot ensure from one day to another a result which equals our expectations, but with our joint and international cooperation we hope to achieve results in the short to medium term.  We are working in a very difficult context, as you are all aware. An inclusive political transition, along with the stabilisation and economic consolidation of Libya, remains a key prerequisite for addressing migration—related challenges in Libya in a sustainable way. Within this complex framework, we are managing to work in Libya on all possible fronts. Cooperating with third countries, especially in North Africa, is a cornerstone of the comprehensive migration policy that we propose to step up in our contribution to the Leaders Meeting this Thursday evening on the way forward in migration.  Together with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organisations, we are focusing first on improving the conditions of the migrants stranded in the country, secondly, on supporting their voluntarily return and reintegration back home and, thirdly, on creating legal pathways to Europe for people in need of international protection.  I am not going to repeat what Ms Mogherini has already said about registration, humanitarian assistance on the ground, and the voluntary reintegration of migrants to their own countries. I will focus on the legal pathways which should become the preferred way for people in need of protection to safely reach Europe.  In mid-November, the first group of 25 of the most vulnerable persons needing protection was evacuated from Libya to Niger for further resettlement in France, thanks to the support of the UNHCR, to EU funding and the consent of the governments of both Libya and Niger. With EU support, more evacuations from Libya to Niger will be carried out by UNHCR in the coming weeks. As announced in our roadmap presented last week, our target is to reach 1 000 by the end of February.  The continuous evacuation of people trapped in Libya depends on several factors. It is, of course, linked to the capacity of our Member States, together with other destination countries, to rapidly resettle from Niger the asylum—seekers evacuated. As you know, in September, the Commission called on the Member States to make available at least 50 000 resettlement places in the next two years for asylum-seekers located in some priority countries. This, of course, includes the countries of the central Mediterranean route. Member States replied in a very encouraging manner, offering until now almost 40 000 new resettlement pledges, and we are confident that additional pledges, from Member States which have not yet replied to our call, will be offered. Meanwhile, the moment to start fulfilling these pledges has already arrived, and I count on the support of the European Parliament in reminding them of the urgency of this. I also count on your support for the target we proposed to the Leaders – that 25 000 resettlements take place before October 2018.  In parallel, we continue to help the Sahel countries to better manage their borders and reinforce their capacities in relation to the fight against migrant smuggling and human trafficking. I understand that there are still concerns about the efficiency of our collective action on the ground, as Amnesty International today reported. Instead I would call for more, and stronger, joint cooperation between all actors and partners, since we all have the same objectives: stability in the region, unity in Libya, solidarity and practical support for the people in need. I look forward to the exchange of views with you tonight.

The European Union and its Member States have strongly condemned the inhumane situation to which smugglers subject migrants as they pass through Libya. It is estimated that today there are between four hundred and seven hundred thousand people living in these degrading conditions. I also welcome the reaction of the Union, the African Union and the United Nations in the framework of the recent summit in Abidjan, to seek an immediate solution to this intolerable situation, as well as the commitment to help the Libyan authorities to do facing this very serious problem. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive migration policy with the situation of the countries of origin and transit which, together with the management of migration flows, includes an effective development cooperation policy with our African partners: with investment projects, institutional consolidation, security and protection of human rights. A policy that creates opportunities so that it is not necessary to emigrate to have a decent future and that ends the business of the mafias that traffic in human beings.

Hell in life, that's Libya. And those who manage to escape tell it. Torture, sexual violence, kidnapping, slavery: the daily horror. Mrs Mogherini explained it perfectly, and not for the first time today. The video published by CNN has not actually discovered anything new, but, like that cruel photo of Aylán - remember? -, it has managed to stir consciences and accumulate reactions. Let us use this momentum to move in the right direction and also so that you can explain what the European Union is really doing. But it is very important that we put the protection of people above the protection of borders. That is the big difference between those of us who think this way and those who are just obsessed with security and border control without thinking about people. The question is how to act in Libya. If there is no State, there are no structures, there are no interlocutors, how to find a solution? There is huge concern about what we are doing in Libya and with whom we are doing things in Libya. And this can only be remedied with more transparency, and this debate is an opportunity for that. The situation in the country certainly does not allow us to face the humanitarian drama and, therefore, the idea of ​​returns is a good idea, a very good idea. But they return to their countries, with what possibilities? To what extent are we willing to share responsibility for this side of the Mediterranean? Or are we going to systematically try to move the problem away from our borders? How are we going to deal with economic migration, which, in human terms, is an euphemism? Economic migration, people are looking for life, a bearable life. So, once again, we insist that Europe needs to clearly define, for its own survival, a sustainable migration policy.

Every time, like you said, we express our horror, we are shocked and then we basically move on. I know, Mr Avramopoulos, that you are personally very committed to a proper EU migration policy, but there is one thing that you said that I disagree with, which is that you basically said we are not to blame for this. It is true that the atrocities are committed in Libya by Libyan people and not by Europeans. However, it is also a consequence of our policy choices. We also know that a lot of funding from the EU, but also from Italy, is going into Libya and ending up in the pockets of God knows who: militia, terrorists, corrupt politicians. We have seen the images of a boat used by the Libyan Coast Guard that has been funded by Italy. It is our money going into that misery. Let us stop funding the misery.

According to the plan, the IOM is supposed to officially help non-vulnerable migrants to return to their countries of origin. For this, the EU is also providing financial aid for - as it is said - a face-saving return. That alone cannot be enough, because we must also promote more development programs in the countries of origin and expand the framework for legal immigration to Europe. On the other hand, people in need of protection, i.e. people who have fled political persecution and civil war, are initially to be brought to Chad and Niger under the leadership of the UNHCR, and from there are to be resettled to willing states in Africa or the EU.

What I would like to say at the beginning is that finally we are all on the same side. We share the same concerns and we are trying to find solutions. Some of these solutions are not common, but I think we have reached a level where we all understand that more action has to be undertaken, more responsibility shown, and more initiatives undertaken, in order first of all to bring back stability in Libya.  Ms Valenciano, we are still in the early stages but yes, I agree with you that we have to work, we need to work in a balanced way with our partners and also to face reality. Europe is in need of economic migrants, but for this purpose we need to enhance and open legal pathways, legal channels, while in parallel reducing irregular migration. As long as irregular migration is there, pictures like the ones we saw some days ago will be replicated.  As you know, Member States keep the right to determine the volume of admission of third country nationals coming to work in their countries. It is their national competence and responsibility. As far as the Commission is concerned, we stand ready to coordinate and propose pilot projects with selected third countries and of course provide related financial support. This would be in cases where Member States commit themselves to hosting certain numbers of migrants coming through legal channels, in particular for economic purposes. We are not discussing with the Member States, and as you very rightly said, Ms in 't Veld, my goal, the Commission’s goal, is the implementation of a comprehensive migration policy. The same goes for the particular case of Libya. As Ms Ayala Sender said, we need a global solution addressing all problems and challenges. Dear colleagues, it is clear that we are all equally aware and shocked at the terrible, appalling and inhumane conditions in Libya. Yes, this has to stop and has to stop now. The situation in those detention centres is unacceptable. The European Union is pursuing efforts to support the establishment of a standardised process by the Libyan authorities through concrete projects.  Another question you would ask me: who are these Libyan authorities? The legitimate government of Tripoli is there, recognised by the United Nations, by the European Union, but does this government have the power? Does this government have full control of the situation in Libya? The answer is clear: no.  When migrants are rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard they are disembarked and taken to reception centres that meet international humanitarian standards, and once again we have to praise and commend IOM and UNHCR for the work they are doing on the ground, even putting the lives of their people there in danger. The European Union is actually supporting the development in Libya of alternatives to detention.  Recently the Libyan Government agreed to allow UNHCR to open a transit and departures facility to Tripoli for people in need of international protection. IOM is also working with partner non-governmental organisations on pilot projects to promote safe spaces which would have the capacity to host a small group of vulnerable women and children. As regards the use of funds, we are monitoring, as in every case, how they are used. We are not aware so far of misuses but are ready to listen to concrete evidence.  Dear colleagues, fanciful statements about complicity and blame might grab headlines but they are not helping anyone, least of all the migrants themselves. The situation in Libya is not bad because of the European Union. This discourse has to stop. On the contrary, the situation is slightly better compared to the recent past thanks to the European Union, and we shall continue working on the ground in order to support these people. You described the situation in Libya before. I will pick out some of your words because ultimately Libya is lacking all elements to be qualified as a state. The situation is chaotic. There is no strong interlocutor on the other side. The country is divided. There are approximately 20 independent militias operating uncontrolled on the ground. The country is a paradise for smugglers and an open corridor for irregular migration. We here all share the same objectives.  First and most important is to save lives and provide these desperate people with support. The European Union, its institutions and the Member States are working to achieve it, pure and simple. We do so by first stopping people drowning in the Mediterranean – and you see that the numbers have gone down drastically – evacuating them from disastrous conditions in Libya and offering them safe and legal pathways to come to Europe. I will not repeat what I said at the beginning, but it is clear that we have a lot more work to be getting on with to make it better still.  I count also on the Members of this House to help us advance, because what we have achieved in general in migration, from the very beginning of our term as the European Parliament and as this Commission, has been achieved thanks to our cooperation, and once again I would like to express my gratitude to all of you for your support. Today the European Union can be proud of its policy and of the adoption of the principles upon which this policy and this strategy is based.  The MEPs who were here in the previous Parliament know very well that there was no migration policy, there was no migration strategy, just an embryo somewhere in Brussels, but not something clear and concrete. So we can all share this effort to achieve what we have done. But yes, we have to do more, but we will do it together. This is not a national, regional or a European problem. As we said before it is a global one, and I was more than happy one year ago when I proposed to the former Secretary-General of the United Nations to hold this extraordinary General Assembly and he did it in New York. So in this way, we made this issue a global one. It has become a global responsibility and we are all responsible globally for what is happening in the Mediterranean and in Libya. The European Union has taken its part. All others should do the same.  So before I sign off, I would like to call for more and strong joint cooperation by all of us, all actors and partners, since we all aim, as I said, for the same objectives: to bring back stability to the region; to bring back stability to Libya; to be the ones that will contribute to bringing unity in Libya, because the country is divided and fragmented; to work on the principle of solidarity towards these desperate people, but also among ourselves; and finally, to produce practical results by giving practical support to the people in need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 395, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "I close the debate.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 396, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Laura FERRARA", "mepid": "124833", "text": "in writing. - In Libya it is difficult to understand whether the European Union is waging war on smugglers or migrants.

However, there is also a second part. The report also expresses great concern that democracy, human rights and the rule of law are increasingly being pushed back and threatened around the world. I tried to make this clear and precise and to avoid repetition. First point: especially for religious minorities, life in more and more regions has become extremely difficult. States are increasingly suppressing these minorities through blasphemy laws. Non-state actors, such as the Islamic State, suppress them through violence and terror. I am pleased that the report consequently calls on the Commission to work in particular for respect for religious freedom and to support it worldwide. Second: The human rights challenges in connection with the refugee and migration crisis of last year are by no means over - something we have long heard in relation to Libya. you still require significantly greater efforts to combat the causes. The report is clear and calls for sustainable solutions to be found, including through a strengthened neighborhood policy. Third, civil society is also suffering from a growing number of repressive laws. Here, the freedom of expression both online and offline is increasingly narrowed and curtailed. And it is also endangered, and thus actually one of the basic requirements of our democratic society, which sometimes goes swimming, is endangered. The so-called Human Rights Dialogue remains a particularly important foreign policy instrument of the EU, since human rights can seldom be better defended than through direct talks and negotiations. As the EPP coordinator for trade policy too, I am pleased that the report continues to reaffirm the practice of human rights clauses in international agreements and to highlight the generalized system of preferential tariffs as a model and effective tool for promoting the effective implementation of key international human rights conventions. And I can say from experience: It was a very, very long work over the years before we could implement it. Two final remarks. First, we believe we need to find a different timeline. To talk about a situation from 2016 at the end of 2017 - that is actually too far removed from the events. As MEPs, we repeat it year after year: it really has to change. Second: Human rights have taken on a different quality in the digital age. When it comes to human rights, we are no longer just dependent on dictatorships, we are also dependent on technical possibilities. I believe that this second point is not yet sufficiently anchored in consciousness. We should work on that.

We are living in extremely difficult times for human rights all around the world. We are facing a global problem. One could even call it a political or cultural problem. When we Europeans raise human rights issues with our interlocutors, sometimes they tell us: ‘You Europeans are the only ones who still care about human rights. Why do you keep doing this?’ Some countries are questioning the Council of Europe and the very idea of a continental system to watch over human rights. Some have withdrawn from the International Criminal Court, although many others have redeclared their commitment to it. Human rights may be a difficult undertaking, but by no means a desperate one. For every bad story there are also many good stories, often less reported. Let me assure you, we may sometimes feel alone as a force for human rights, but we do not intend to change course.  If you look at the European Union Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy, and the European Parliament’s report, it is clear that we all agree on the analysis of the situation. The timing of the European Union Report was not ideal this year, as Antonio Panzeri pointed out in his recent letter. This year, as you know, the European Union Report was postponed because of the mid-term review of the Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. To improve our report and its impact, we will deliver a streamlined and much shorter report next year. We will focus on thematic issues and use country-specific examples rather than going through each country one by one. Our next report will be tabled in the spring of 2018.  Today, we would like to focus on three issues in particular. The first is civil society and the role of human rights defenders. In your report, you highlighted that the space for civil society is shrinking in many parts of the world and you called for the EU to use all means to protect human rights defenders and NGOs. Even on the occasion of our forum with NGOs last week, there were friends and colleagues who were not allowed to travel and to join us in Brussels. What we keep hearing is that old narrative of a clash between interests and values, but whenever one person’s rights are abused we are less safe and secure. Our society, when human rights are not guaranteed, is more fragile, less resilient and an easier target for radicalisation. Investing in human rights, in civil society and in open societies is the best possible investment for the security of our countries. It is what we call sustainable security, security with deep roots in societies and communities.  Looking at the mid-term review of the Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, which was published in June 2017, it is evident that we have taken a number of measures to address this issue. All our European delegations today have at least one human rights defenders liaison officer. They have worked together to support human rights defenders who were put on trial. In many cases we have helped them leave a country when their life was at risk. The protection of human rights defenders in civil society is also frequently the topic of our human rights dialogue with third countries. We would like to thank, once again, our Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, who has helped us keep a constant focus on human rights issues all around the world.  The second issue is violence against women and girls. No continent is spared. Every culture, including our European culture, still harbours some forms of discrimination and violence. One in three women in Europe has experienced either physical, sexual, or emotional violence. The European Union is already, and by far, the first investor in gender equality and change around the world.  Let me just mention two recent initiatives. First, we are extremely proud of our decision to sign the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention. Second, the Spotlight initiative launched by the European Union last September with the United Nations is a truly unprecedented action, for the size of our investment, which stands at half a billion euros, and for its innovative way of working. Spotlight will be run together by several European Union agencies and European Union services, and with our delegations around the world. We will engage beyond governments, with civil society organisations and local communities. This is not a traditional, top-down development assistance, because a change in attitudes cannot be imposed from above. It can only grow from the heart of each society and each community.  Our third point is about democracy support and election observation. We would like to thank all of you who have spent energy and time as heads or observers of our election observation missions. As rightly pointed out in your report, a special focus is now given to the follow-up of our missions’ recommendations. These recommendations are now always raised in our political dialogues with partner countries. We are also working with local associations and institutions. Our engagement with local authorities goes well beyond the moment when ballots are counted. Too often, part of our societies feel that the ‘system’ is not working for them. Many people have the impression that they are not listened to and they are losing trust in their institutions. This feeling of exclusion is one of the great enemies of our democracies. If we want to save our democracies we must also improve our democracies. When we work for better institutions, or to open up the space for civil society or for free and independent media, we are also contributing to resilience and to sustainable security. This is the European way to security. It is about our values and it is about our interest. In these difficult times, we have become an even more indispensable partner for all those who believe in human rights and work for them. The Commission is sure that with your support we will continue to be the credible force for human rights that the world so urgently needs.

It is therefore essential that this dimension is well covered in this report. In particular, I am worried to see that sexual and reproductive health and rights were quite overlooked. It is unacceptable that women and girls’ bodies remain an ideological battleground. The integrity of women and girls’ bodies is an inalienable human right that should be protected.

I would like to thank the author of today's report on human rights observance in 2016. Admittedly, as the rapporteur said, it was submitted late, more than a year after these events. It is difficult to keep a good distance to these events. I would like to thank both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for trying to find these key points in this annual report. In particular, I note that priority was given to freedom of religion and belief and to persecution against this background. Religion is not a direct cause of conflict, but is often used as a tool in conflict. I think we must oppose this, and religious freedom is a fundamental value of freedom, it is a human right that should be fully respected. I would also like to say that we should always remember that the death penalty is still being carried out, and that human trafficking is also a disgrace, and in particular, what we heard on the occasion of the report on the situation in Libya, in other parts of the world. The situation of the population in post-conflict areas such as Iraq or Syria, the difficulty of adapting, returning to their homeland. Moreover, a situation that affects minorities, such as the situation of the Muslim Rohingya population in Myanmar, which is also discussed here in this Parliament, and the phenomenon that concerns the relationship between big business, entrepreneurship and people in certain areas. The phenomenon of land grabbing - we are dealing with the embarrassing thing that here the indigenous people are deprived of the right to land.

On the other hand, I believe that in the face of the large economic subjects that increasingly govern the world, the appeal to individual and collective rights is the way forward to prevent everything from being subjected to the natural law of the market. We need to accompany the revolution of equality, the revolution of dignity, which can increasingly place the self-determination of the person at the center. The challenges we face are manifold. We must know and see, and above all face. Human rights defenders face discrimination and intimidation and are often killed. The European Union must maintain a single position on the values ​​of human rights, but often different positions are met. Europe can have a credible voice if the message it sends is not only shared as a whole, but also if it is able to show a strong coherence in its internal and external policies.

We should not censor ourselves when speaking about violations of human rights and democracy in the world without referring to particular cases, countries and regimes. We should not be shy in naming and shaming abusive state and non-state actors. Such an approach would give more value to our work and to the work of civil society, whose representatives expose themselves to danger and abuse, yet continue to act as watchdogs and brought these events to our attention.  The aim of the report is also to be a supportive instrument for the work of the European External Action Service, as well as to the EU delegations in the third countries.

This annual report includes strong language on the shrinking space for civil society, including the call for an EU monitoring mechanism for cases of violations of freedom of assembly and association.  Given that I have only one-and-a-half minutes of speaking time, I would like to focus on the situation of environmental rights defenders, which the annual report explicitly mentions. Their important work often goes against the interests of influential companies, and they face severe human relations by state actors as well. According to the NGO ‘Global Witness’, on average three environmental human rights defenders were murdered each week in 2015. In 2016, there were around four murders per week and this murderous trend went on this year. Almost 40% of the environmental human rights defenders killed are indigenous people. We are glad that Lolita Chavez, a committed environmental and indigenous human rights defender from Guatemala, is one of the finalists for the Sakharov Prize this year. Environmental human rights defenders like her are under threat when they oppose the interests of corporations and governments. The sectors most affected are mining, extractive industries, agri—business, hydroelectric dams and water rights and logging. The EU and its Member States are clearly not doing enough to ensure corporate accountability and legal redress. It is time to hold accountable those European corporations who contribute to the excessive violence against those activists.

In Bahrain, at least 169 peaceful critics have been targeted in the space of a year. Last week, Bahrain activist Nedal Al-Salman was banned from travelling to the EU NGO Forum on human rights, and as we speak, Nabeel Rajab is serving a two-year sentence solely for speaking to the media. He is facing 15 more years for tweets about the Saudi-led coalition air strikes in Yemen and the use of torture in Bahraini prisons. Nevertheless, neither the High Representative nor any EU Member States publicly condemned the confirmation of his sentence on 22 November. Nabeel Rajab is a prisoner of conscience; he deserves our full support and resolute action. In Turkey, the situation is truly appalling. The European Union’s ambiguous relationship with Mr Erdogan is unacceptable, and our policy must change. Many human rights defenders, lawyers, academics, civil society representatives, trade unionist activists, judges, journalists, civil servants and artists face trumped—up charges of terrorism. I would especially like to highlight some cases that are close to my heart, for example Zehra Doğan and the Istanbul 10. The EU must uphold its human rights commitments in assisting civil society actors worldwide as stated in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2015—2019 and the EU global strategy. Ms Mogherini, I urge you to call for the immediate release of Mr Rajab in Bahrain and all jailed human rights defenders in Turkey, and to concretely engage with defenders well before they are put on trial.

I would like to focus on Africa, because I believe that what the Commissioner said is the visible shrinking of space for civil society and social organizations, this is a consequence of, inter alia, suppressing peace protests in countries such as Congo, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Sudan (these are just examples), but also the persecution of journalists and human rights defenders, of course. Armed conflicts in Africa include not only civilian casualties, but also cases of sexual violence against women or, for example, recruiting child soldiers. These and similar cases and phenomena, of course, contribute to mass emigration both within Africa itself and, of course, to Europe, which is why I believe that the promotion of human rights on the African continent is one of the main challenges also for us, in the European interest. I would like to thank the rapporteur for having clearly highlighted in her report the fact that the European Union is working with Africa also at this level.

Unfortunately, from year to year and from report to report, we find that human rights, instead of advancing, are, in some cases, suffering serious setbacks in different regions of the world. It would not be fair to ignore that some advances have been made and that many of them have been achieved with the direct or indirect involvement of the European Union. But they are still timid and insufficient progress. Wars and terrorism, the situation of migrants and refugees, trafficking in human beings, slavery, the criminalization of fundamental freedoms, the persecution of minorities, the repression of human rights defenders, the criminalization of abortion, contempt by indigenous peoples, disrespect for the rights of women and children, among others, constitute an extremely dangerous scenario, since they are phenomena that are often interconnected. This scenario therefore requires the European Union to live up to its values ​​and responsibilities. The truth is that all over the world there are millions of people whose human rights are the target of violations from different points of view and who look to the European Union as the last hope of achieving some protection, justice and reparation.

I, too, would like to begin by congratulating you on your comprehensive report, in which the author, on behalf of the European Union, reaffirms his commitment to the promotion of universal human rights, fundamental freedoms and values. The Union must be able to promote respect for human rights in third countries beyond its borders. Many cases of human rights violations appear in the report. I think we can agree that the right to education and the mother tongue is one of the fundamental rights. Thus, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, unfortunately, in Ukraine, the process of reducing the right to use the mother tongue of national minorities by the article on the language of instruction in the new Ukrainian Education Act began in 2016. While so far minorities have had access to all levels of education in their mother tongue, after 2018 it will be limited to primary school, meaning the new law will take back already acquired rights. However, last Friday's EU-Ukraine Association Council's final document states that the EU's official position is that the existing rights of minorities cannot be curtailed. And in a report released Monday, the Venice Commission said criticisms of the week's article were justified and suggested that it be amended. Primarily because the text adopted differs significantly from that on which minorities were consulted and agreed. The seven-week article of the law also contains significant ambiguities, although international and constitutional commitments must be taken into account in the case of comprehensive reforms, especially in the case of existing minority rights. I hope that Ukraine will fully implement the recommendations of the Venice Commission, consult with the minorities concerned and its neighbors, and incorporate the needs and suggestions of nationalities in the implementation of education reform.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health":

I believe it is an example of the EU adding real value, and of the Parliament working well. The EU external competences are still new, and at best we can use the footprint and historical connections of our Member States to use that insight to inform a values-based foreign policy in the wider world. We can use that insight to inform ourselves, but not be a prisoner of the baggage of history. On that point, on a slightly personal note, it’s a great tragedy for me, that as the EU begins to speak with one voice in the wider world, my own Member State, the United Kingdom, has decided to retreat into isolationism with Brexit, if not my country, Scotland. I assure you, there are plenty of  constructive partners in Scotland, and we’ll be in touch. On this report, it is right that we take stock of the situation in Hong Kong. We are 20 years after the handover from the British to the Chinese, and 20 years into a 50-year commitment to a ‘one country, two systems’ approach. Hong Kong is the 14th biggest trading partner of the European Union, it is an important partner to us, an important part of the EU-China dialogue. And it’s important to be frank: Hong Kong is a great place but all is not perfect. There remains a concern that the ‘one country, two systems’ is being undermined, and in paragraphs 1(b) and 1(l) we voice that concern – not criticism but concern. I believe we have struck a balance. Freedom of speech also must be defended, now and in the future, and in paragraph 1(p) I believe we have struck a balanced statement which takes due stock of where things are. In paragraph 1(t) we set out ways in which we could support and strengthen civil society within Hong Kong, a crucial set of groups that are doing increasingly difficult work; they look to us for support. I am very pleased that we have reached such a high degree of consensus across the house: only two amendments of substance from the GUE group in favour of greater partnership on tax work, tax avoidance, money laundering, and financial transparency.  For my part, I strongly support the amendments, I urge colleagues to support them, too. I think there is a key area where we could assist in the fight against organised crime and money laundering. And with that I would warmly thank the shadow rapporteurs, our most excellent secretariat, the Green/EFA Group staff, and I commend the text very warmly to the House.

More than 2000 European companies are present in Hong Kong, and the European Union is Hong Kong’s second largest trading partner in goods after mainland China. Vice President Dombrovskis was in Hong Kong just ten days ago, and we have invited the Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, to visit us in Brussels as soon as possible. We care about Hong Kong, and we know that its autonomy has been the foundation of its success. The people of Hong Kong are now asking to resume electoral reform, and to have a genuine choice for the election of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council in accordance with the basic law. But, as your rapporteur rightly notes, the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ has come under increasing pressure. The rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in Hong Kong have been questioned. The implementation of the electoral reform has been postponed. On top of this, we cannot forget the case of five book publishers who went missing in 2015. To us, that is the most serious challenge to the basic law since 1997, and, unfortunately, it is not an isolated event. In line with the report’s recommendations, we intend to reinforce our bilateral dialogue with Hong Kong. Our latest European Union-Hong Kong structured dialogue took place less than a month ago. What we always stress in our dialogues is that the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ is essential for Hong Kong’s prosperity, but it is also important for change; for its own growth and prosperity. Our relations with China are becoming more and more intense, not only economically, but also on foreign policy and security issues. Our dialogue is very open, and our message to our Chinese friends is very clear: preserving ‘one country, two systems’ is in their best interests, and we are ready to work with them to make this happen.

Dear colleagues! The issue we are now debating has received completely absurd treatment in many media in the EU. So let me start by stating it with seven-inch nails: we are not going to ban kebabs in the EU. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the other hand, we have objected to the Commission's proposal to allow the addition of phosphates in frozen meat to skewers, ie. kebab. We thus want to preserve what we have today, the status quo. If the Commission is to update the EU list of authorized food additives, three criteria must be met: 1. The additive must not be harmful to human health; 2. There must be a technological necessity; and 3. It must not mislead consumers. None of those parts meet the Commission's proposal, unfortunately! However, the core of our objection is first and foremost about health. Doubts have been raised scientifically about the health aspects of phosphates in meat. There is concern about whether the phosphates increase the risk of e.g. incidence of cardiovascular disease. This is also what has led EFSA to decide to give high priority to a reassessment of phosphates and their health effects when put into food. That reassessment will come during 2018. We therefore believe in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that there is no reason to open up for the addition of phosphates in meat until we know that assessment from EFSA. So when we say no to allowing phosphates in frozen meat, it is primarily for health reasons, and because we want to wait a year while EFSA works. But having said that, there is also no technological necessity present, because there are actually plenty of good kebabs on the European market today that are completely free of phosphates. And if you want and absolutely want a binder in your kebab, then there are both E-number-free and chemical-free binders on the market. So it is possible to act without phosphates. And then I would like to address some of the things that have been raised in the media. In Germany in particular, there has been great concern on top of our vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and there have been stories of job losses and all sorts of things. I would like to state that the current EU rules also apply in Germany, so Germany is not allowed under the EU today to add phosphates in frozen skewers with meat. If it takes place in Germany today, it is because the rules are not being obeyed. Others have also highlighted that there are some types of meat that are allowed to have phosphates in. That is correct! There are e.g. some traditional sausages where allowed. But we do not think there is any reason to allow a whole lot of new areas until we are sure that there is no health problem. Incidentally, this was also a matter that we in the Environment Committee raised with the European Commission back in 2014 with our then chairman of the Environment Committee, Matthias Groote. We raised the concern and we still share that concern. So instead of shouting that the EU will ban kebabs, which is not true, the media and businesses and citizens should instead ask the Commission why the Commission wants to make our food worse and more unhealthy, because that is what this story is about! In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we take our task of seriously protecting European citizens, and that is why we appeal to the precautionary principle. We await EFSA's assessment of the phosphates in 2018 before we think any changes need to be made.

This debate is not about banning kebabs. This debate is about maintaining the current legislation, which clearly prohibits the addition of phosphates to meat preparations. That is why we oppose the Commission proposal to allow this. Yes, there are problems in the Member States. Yes, there are debates in some Member States whether kebab is a meat preparation or a meat product. But then it is up to the Commission to help Member States, to step up controls, to guide them there. I have tabled another amendment on this that clarifies the situation. Mrs Sommer, you led the resistance in Germany and I am very sorry for doing so in a populist, unfair way. This is not right. The addition of phosphates in kebabs is not allowed. That's what the regulations say. There are only three reasons why the Commission can deviate from this and still include phosphates in a positive list. Mrs. Schaldemose has listed them. It must be clear whether or not they are harmful to public health. There are plenty of studies that cast doubt on this. Even EFSA has not provided a conclusive answer to date and EFSA has decided to conduct an overview study, an overview study that will not be concluded until the end of December 2018. The precautionary principle then says that we have to wait a while until there is clarity. Second, there must be certainty that there is an alternative. The debate that has taken place in the press in recent days and weeks shows that there are alternatives, alternatives where no E-numbers are added to kebab preparations, which are safe, which are healthy. If that is possible - and I have tabled an amendment on that too - then it becomes clear that the opposition of Ms Schaldemose and myself is effectively not opposition to the kebab industry against workers in the German meat industry.Finally, it is indeed true that phosphates are also added to other products such as burgers, such as sausages, even soft drinks.If the EFSA study says that they are harmful to public health, then you should delete those products from the positive list.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 440, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Bart STAES", "mepid": "4751", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the application concerning the use of phosphates in frozen vertical meat spits received in 2015 has been discussed in detail several times by the Working Party of Governmental Experts on Additives as regards the fulfilment of the conditions for inclusion in the Union list and the use of food additives. These conditions are defined in the Regulation on Food Additives. They provide that a food additive may be included in the Union list only if: firstly, it does not pose safety concerns; secondly, there is a reasonable technological need; thirdly, the issue does not mislead consumers; and, fourthly, its use has advantages and benefits for the consumer. Let me briefly set out the evidence that all these conditions are fulfilled for this application. Regarding safety, the safety of phosphates was evaluated by the Scientific Committee for Food before 1991, and the maximum tolerable daily intake of 70 milligrams per kilogram of body weight expressed as phosphorous was established. Current authorisations are based on this evaluation. Phosphates are authorised for use in a wide variety – I would like to draw your attention to this – of foods, including meat products and certain meat preparations. The extension of their use to frozen vertical meat spits does have a significant impact on overall exposure to phosphates. I would like to draw your attention to this because it is very important. Following a request from the Commission, in 2013 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) assessed a published review on health risks associated with phosphate additives. In the light of this assessment, EFSA did not question the conclusions of opinion of the Scientific Committee for Food. The Commission regulation setting up a programme for the re—evaluation of approved food additives requires EFSA to re—evaluate the safety of all food additives approved before 20 January 2009. The end of 2018 was set as a deadline for the re—evaluation of phosphates. All the relevant and most up—to—date scientific evidence will no doubt be collected and evaluated. The Commission closely follows the re—evaluation programme and considers appropriate risk management measures, when needed, on the basis of published opinions. Pending the publication of the new EFSA opinion on phosphates, the health—based guidance value established in the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Food remains valid.  Regarding technological needs, the technological need was recognised for certain meat spits, as specified in the draft regulation. Phosphates are needed, in particular, for the stabilisation of meat spits and for bonding meat pieces together to ensure homogenous freezing and to prevent the risk of unbalanced heat treatment or of raw or burnt spots. This is very important from a health point of view. Economically and technologically practical alternatives were not identified.  As regards not misleading the consumer, if added water makes up more than five percent of the weight of the finished product, according to the applicable European Union legislation, it has to be explicitly mentioned in business—to—business trade. As regards water in roasted meat spits, as consumed, the data provided by the applicant demonstrated that the use of phosphates does not lead to any additional water content. As a result of the heat treatment, additional water is not retained despite the addition of phosphates.  Finally, let me address the advantages and benefits for the consumer. Phosphates ensure homogenous freezing and prevent the risk of unbalanced heat treatment or of raw or burned spots. The avoidance of raw parts or burned spots results in a better quality and tastier product for the consumer. For the reasons I have set out, the Commission is of the opinion that the draft regulation fulfils all the relevant requirements of the Regulation on Food Additives.

The objection of the Social Democrats and the Greens is pure scare tactics, it is ignorant and it is irresponsible. Why? Phosphates are permitted in many foods, but they are also found naturally in many foods. If that were really that dangerous to health, we would all be terminally ill long ago. And why, dear Social Democrats, did you actually have no problem with phosphate in Kassler in 2014? What do you have against doner kebab? A doner kebab contains just 134 milligrams of phosphates. That is a fraction of the 4,200 milligrams of phosphate per day that the EFSA declares to be safe. In addition, phosphates have long been allowed in grilled kebab. And by the way: EFSA - the Commissioner said it - examines all food additives, not just phosphate, because it can be so dangerous under certain circumstances; that's not true. The claim that doner kebab does not need phosphate is ignorant. On the contrary: without phosphate there is no kebab, but a slumped heap of meat, burned on the outside, still raw on the inside, a hygiene risk. So there is a technical need, and there is no substitute, tapioca flour cannot be used for doner kebab either, and it also contains phosphate. There is also no misleading consumer because of the addition of water. The Commissioner has just explained. The added water mainly evaporates when the meat is cooked through. So all the arguments in the motion for a resolution are wrong and yet you are sticking to them? You are endangering tens of thousands of jobs for no reason; that is irresponsible. It's really just a technical clarification that phosphate is allowed in raw kebab skewers as well as in grilled ones. Without this clarification, phosphate will be banned in kebab.

Ms. Sommer, what you are doing here is scaremongering at a high level. You say: there will be no more kebab if we vote in favor of this objection tomorrow. I will try to react to this in a very factual manner and not encourage this scare tactic any further. Our objection is directed against a decision by the Commission on the exemption for the addition of phosphate-containing additives in frozen meat skewers for kebab and gyros. The addition of phosphates is not permitted for meat preparations, except for precisely defined exceptions. These exceptions include - you said that right - Kassler or meat roast, which is used in sausages. Strictly speaking, since the Food Additives Ordinance came into force in 2008, no phosphates should be used in the production of frozen meat skewers. If lobbying was required here, it would have been here. For once you are right. There is a legal loophole here. However, there are also very different interpretations of courts in Germany, for example in a judgment from Munich and one from Augsburg - both are not identical. The S&D Group is not generally against the fact that this exemption should also be granted for frozen meat skewers. The point in time alone cannot be understood by us at all. The European Food Authority - and the Commissioner has confirmed this again - is currently checking the effectiveness of additives containing phosphates. The results will be available by the end of 2018. So then we have a reassessment. Dear Commissioner, if the assessment was made in 1991, it was a very long time ago and we may have learned something new. So we should wait for this evaluation and then decide which food products remain on the exception list and which should be removed.So this scaremongering that there would be no more kebab is completely wrong.Doner kebab can also be produced without additives containing phosphates.You just said that wrongly, Ms. Sommer, and it has been described differently in the media several times, especially by the largest manufacturer in Germany.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 443, "date": "2017-12-12.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, the way kebabs are made in street stalls today has little to do with how they are really to be made.

In any case, we are now talking about phosphate in frozen meat, because some Members simply want to ban them. The objection to the Commission's action is, in my view, unfounded. I believe that the Commission is responding correctly to current practice and is providing the regulation with greater transparency and certainty for both consumers and producers. Phosphates are already explicitly allowed in fresh meat today and it is quite consistent that this should also be the case in frozen meat. Should it prove to be defective in the future, it is of course possible to continue working with this limit. As we know, phosphates are used both for the more pronounced taste and smell of meat. The use of phosphate is certainly not ideal, it should be reduced, which is also the case, under pressure of regulation or also for the purpose of quality. Manufacturers strive to improve this quality and voluntarily reduce the content of these substances. Our role is to ensure, above all, health safety. So, of course, I agree that we should be very careful, and that is why the Commission also allows only a minimum amount of phosphate. Our role in this is therefore clear and the Commission's action is moving in this direction, which is why I support its regulatory proposal.

As a new member of the House, this is my first full day of plenary. In fact, I am happy to be able to follow the principle of Montesquieu, who said: \"If it is not necessary to make a law, then it is necessary not to make a law\". In this case, regarding kebabs, one would have to say: if it is not necessary to make a ban, then it is necessary not to make a ban. After studying the documents and after the deliberations, it seems to me to be clear that it is not necessary to make a ban because the phosphate content in the kebab is much, much lower than in many dishes and, incidentally, also beverages that we constantly eat take us. If Mrs Sommer, who thankfully took up this issue so as not to contribute to overregulation at European level, is accused of populism, as has just been done, then that is self-directed, because the scare-mongering that is behind it if an attempt is made to intervene centrally on our part in something that affects the everyday life of the citizens, which is real populism.
