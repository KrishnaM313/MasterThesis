[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Maria ARENA", "mepid": "124936", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, it is a bit of a pity that the Commissioner is not with us, I hope she can join us despite the traffic. Indeed, we have a report today on parental leave. We looked at a directive that began in 1995 and has been in place since 2010 to assess and make a number of recommendations for parental leave. Parental leave is, of course, one of the tools that helps to better balance private and professional life. Parental leave is important insofar as, as we can see, it allows families to make not only the choice to have children, but also the choice to go to work. Today, in Europe, we have the following two challenges: both the challenge of the birth rate, which is important, but also the challenge of the employment rate for all men and women. In the current situation, we have identified a number of difficulties in relation to these different challenges and the application of this directive. First, we continue to see real discrimination against women in employment, because they are locked into traditional roles and are seen as posing a risk of motherhood and, therefore, of cost to the employer. According to Eurostat data, we see that parental leave is less taken by men - and, in general, that they are less concerned with everything related to the private sphere. But for parental leave, the phenomenon is all the stronger: only 2.7% of men take parental leave. So you see the disparity between a woman's reality and a man's reality. Finally, I will quote the figures in relation to the employment rate, which still shows a real disparity between the employment rates of women and men, the disparity in wages, the disparity in the pension level and the disparity in careers. Parental leave must be able to respond to all of this. Of course, not alone, and we look forward to also working on the Commission's roadmap, which deals precisely with the reconciliation of private and professional life. But we have made a number of recommendations in this report that help to correct the situation in terms of parental leave. The first obvious thing in this analysis of parental leave is the question of its portability. It appears that when parental leave is quite transferable, traditional models are reinforced, namely that women carry the social model, and men carry the economic model. This portability, when left completely free, reinforces this model: it is women who take parental leave, and only 2.7% of men are in this situation. We therefore advocate that parental leave cannot be transferable or, at the very least, transferable, as far as possible, within a framework that does not reinforce traditional roles. Flexibility, of course, but not flexibility that accentuates the situations in which women - as well as men - find themselves today. The second recommendation is the question of treatment. It is a little too easy to propose a leave when it is not paid, because it also leads to a strengthening of the traditional role, that is, the person who assumes the social role, will take it - he will be forced to take it because he has no choice - and the person who assumes the economic role will not be able to get rid of that economic role because he is not being paid to do so. We therefore argue that, when there is parental leave, it can be properly paid. In our poverty report, we see that women are much more poverty-sized because they have to take a certain number of leave that is not properly paid. The question of remuneration arises in this case as well. The third issue is protection. Taking leave - parental leave - often means giving up your job when you return to the workplace. We must therefore protect the worker who decides to take parental leave so that, when he or she returns to work, it is possible not only to return to the job they deserve, but also to receive protection at that level. Finally, we also propose an extension of the age and duration of leave, because - those who have children know it - a child does not stop at 6 years of age. Unfortunately, a child, he continues to grow, and I want to say \"luckily a child continues to grow\". So we also need to work on the age and duration of the leave Parental.  All these recommendations are made, and I think they should help both the social partners to find agreements on parental leave, but also the Commission in the work it is doing in the context of the roadmap on work-life balance.\" I hope that the Commissioner will support these proposals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all let me apologise for my late arrival. We spent one hour in front of the gates of Strasbourg due to the unexpected heavy traffic so I want to apologise. I would like to thank Parliament and Ms Arena for this report. It shows that we have a good basis in EU legislation, but also room for further improvement if we want more women to enter and/or stay in the labour market. Working parents and care-givers need better-designed arrangements to reconcile their work and their private lives, and the Commission is committed to just that: a ‘New Start’ for working parents and carers. As your report shows, working families still face significant challenges. We are checking the current EU legal and policy framework against today’s labour market. Our New Start will allow workers with children or dependent relatives to better balance caring and professional responsibilities. We want to enable working parents and carers – in reality these are mostly women, as we heard before – to remain in employment and make progress in their careers. Therefore, labour market participation of all parents and carers can only be improved if we allow for a better sharing of caring responsibilities between women and men.  Our new initiative will of course be based on an analysis of the current situation in all Member States, including also the implementation of the parental leave directive. Your report is therefore particularly timely. The Commission services are currently carrying out conformity assessments so as to ensure the whole and complete application of the parental leave directive. We are in intensive dialogue with Member States where there are any doubts.  The Commission is also engaging more broadly with stakeholders: both the social partners and the general public have been consulted, in February 2016, and the Commission is currently finalising the second-stage consultation of the social partners. Subject to the results of this second-stage consultation, we intend to set out our New Start as a broad package that may include legislative and other measures, while fully respecting the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. The package could contain measures on different leave arrangements, flexible working, childcare and long-term care.

In the discussion on parental leave, a great deal of attention is paid to the division of this leave between a man and a woman. It is true that currently only 3% of men, fathers choose to take advantage of this opportunity. Thus, the non-impassable month of leave guaranteed by the Directive remains unused, losing both the father, the child and the mother. However, being a dad myself, I am convinced that increasing the participation of fathers translates into benefits for the whole family, as it provides a stronger father-child bond and supports women in their professional development. However, I believe that increasing the participation of fathers in family life will not succeed by extending the period of non-insane parental leave, as evidenced by the statistics mentioned above, but by educational measures aimed at presenting families with the benefits of such a solution.  In my opinion, we also cannot intervene forcibly in the family life of our citizens, but we should only try to suggest the best solutions that allow for some flexibility and choice by parents of the most appropriate model of childcare, taking into account their current family and professional situation. I therefore believe that the current solution, which sets only minimum requirements for parental leave, is right, leaving Member States autonomy in choosing the solutions best suited to the characteristics of individual societies.

There are some positive examples, but women still do most of the unpaid family work. In order to put an end to discrimination against women in the labour market, three points need to be implemented: firstly, parental leave must not be transferable. This is very important, otherwise women will structurally take over the entire parental leave entitlement and thus remain the risk in the eyes of many employers – with the consequential costs of gender pay gap, old-age poverty. Secondly, parental leave must not lead to financial or other disadvantages. This must be compensated for by family policy in the Member States.

As a Member of the Family Party, I support any approach that strengthens the right of parents to time with their children. However, this does not change the fact that I know the competences and non-competences of the EU and respect subsidiarity. This is precisely where we need to be careful when we talk about future EU measures for more maternity and parental rights. Not everything that is well-intentioned is well done, and with overzealousness or attention to detail we can make up a lot of things. Similarly important and difficult is the definition of what parental leave is. Go through the Member States and you will find 28 different definitions. There can't be a one size fits all. I therefore advocate the virtue of moderation for the benefit of mothers and fathers. Let us create feasible minimum standards and not a bureaucratic ballast! Let us argue for strict, clear rules at European level and a big plus in measures at national level! This must be the target of a new maternity directive for Europe.

I believe we have come forward with a good document which broadly reflects the political priorities of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I sincerely hope that the Commission will take full consideration of these priorities in their forthcoming proposals. Now this report is against a background of a failed attempt so far at agreeing an updated modern Maternity Leave Directive and, of course, in the expectation of a new proposal from the Commission on work-life balance and hopefully some kind of carers leave directive. Indeed, I was encouraged to hear the Commissioner talk about a new start for parents and carers.  Today we are assessing the implementation of the Parental Leave Directive. Some of the political messages we put forward include: family rights, including parental leave, are equal in terms of individual rights and accessibility. Secondly, we believe that these rights should be individualised, as far as possible, and that a significant part of the leave should be transferable. But we have left some flexibility for Member States in conjunction with social partners.  I believe this is a reasonable and a sensible approach, it allows us to strongly indicate our position in regard to gender equality and work-life balance without insisting how individuals lead their lives. We are sending a strong political message, but we are giving some choice.  We call for a paternity leave directive; we say it is essential and urgent. We ask Member States to extend the period of parental leave, currently at four months; that is, in particular, for parents of children with disabilities. This is very important and recognises the special circumstances which those parents face. We also call on the Commission and the social partners to increase the age of the child for which parental leave can be taken; again this builds in flexibility and allows for a life cycle approach. We welcome the fact that some Member States have gone beyond the minimum provisions and enabled same-sex couples, and parents of adopted children, to benefit and we recognise the need to extend that.

Mr President, this report, which details parental pay in three entities, even if it is presented in the best interests of the child, does not hide the very questionable, even dangerous, side effects for our societies.  The regulatory obligation of paternal leave, constrained in time, in non-transferable pay, in the strict mirror of a maternity leave, is an unbearable intrusion into the freedoms that Member States have to decide, together with their social partners and national enterprises, the time given to private and professional life, but above all to the framework of the reception of young children.

Significant changes can be observed in the perception of the role of a man in the process of raising a child, resulting in paternity leave being taken in almost all Member States. Their length and level of use is still small. Unfortunately, fathers benefit marginally from parental leave available to both parents. Only less than 3% of them do so, which shows the scale of the problem. However, it seems that the most important challenges we face are related to changes in the labour market. In many Member States, workers employed under so-called non-standard contracts are not entitled to parental leave. Given the popularity of these agreements, very many Europeans are not able to exercise their right to care for a young child, which certainly affects their procreative decisions. Europe is already facing a demographic crisis, and the labour market situation described will only exacerbate it. We should therefore consider possible ways of reconciling flexible forms of employment and the right to parental leave. In doing so, it is necessary to take into account the specificities of individual Member States and to actively involving the social partners in this process. It is worth taking the example Polish, in which the pro-family arrangements developed by the previous ruling coalition resulted in one year of maternity leave. Like the UK, Poland is in the top flight of European countries providing the longest maternity leave, and the wide promotion of paternity leave is increasingly effective.

However, if we want to increase women's employment and pay without threatening our already ageing demographics, we need to think about better coordination of leave time without stifling business and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises.

I wanted to remind you briefly why we are withdrawing the Maternity Leave Directive. In fact it brought positive results and developments in only certain Member States. We promised, together with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM), that the Commission would come forward with a more ambitious and wider package or approach to solve several important problems and to achieve several important goals. You spoke about opening the choice for women to go to work. We have a high percentage of women educated at university in Europe and this is a waste of talents and previous investments when they cannot work due to the lack of good conditions. This is good for the economy and for the whole of society. We need to look at the demographic line which is declining. This is a worrying phenomenon. I think it was Mr Hetman who said that we need to do it in the interest of children, but first they have to be born. We need to open the conditions for this. We need to decrease the economic dependence of women on men because, if I look at it from a wider perspective, according to our studies the dependence of women on men in economic terms increases the phenomenon of domestic violence. So everything is connected with everything. Working on this package – and it is also very clearly shown in the interim results of our consultations – we need to be very careful about subsidiarity and proportionality, as was said here several times, because there are many differences in the positions of the Member States. There are traditions and deeply rooted habits of families. There are very different approaches from the side of employees and employers.  So it will not be an easy task to create a good package of legislative and non-legislative measures. My opinion on this is that it is our duty to create the conditions and to open the space for free choice. It is the right of individuals and families to use this open space, I think this is the proper way to look at it and this will also help us to avoid the risk of social engineering or some naive legislative proposals which will not bring the desired results. A question was asked here about where the line between the FEMM and labour market approaches comes. In the Commission we have resolved this issue: it is mainly my agenda, but we work in very close cooperation with Marianne Thyssen and the experts from the labour markets here because this package will also contain very important proposals which will reflect the modern trends in the labour market.

I believe that more needs to be done to identify as effective tools as possible to improve the work-life balance in European policies, with the aim of reducing gender discrimination with regard to childcare and women's participation in the labour market, but also in terms of the distribution of family responsibilities between women and men.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 36, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Monika BEŇOVÁ", "mepid": "23868", "text": "  Writing. – The rules on parental leave at European level are governed by a directive that was formally amended in 2010.

However, this alone is not enough. It is also necessary to think about a new model of work organisation, which contributes more to the coordination of family and work, and is more suitable than the current less successful models. This is particularly necessary for carers of children/family members with disabilities.  I also consider it important to point out that, in addition to the minimum expectations of parental leave, I do not see the potential for edification at EU level, as the labour market opportunities, family models, work culture traditions, etc. in some Member States are changing slowly and cannot be overridden in a short period of time. On the basis of experience, I believe that much greater emphasis should be placed on educating, persuading employers, promoting different modern new working time models, spreading good practices that are more adapted to today's lifestyle requirements and the needs of families, while at the same time showing employers that they would not be bad for the use of parents with children, but that they are acting in a family-friendly way that benefits them in a way that is particularly good for them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 39, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Claude ROLIN", "mepid": "125107", "text": "  In writing.

It is certainly necessary to strengthen the possibilities of both parents to stay at home after the birth of the child and take care of them. At the moment, the implementation of the current Parental Leave Directive varies considerably from one country to another and overlaps with other types of allowances and leave. However, in my opinion, this only shows how difficult it is to try to regulate such sensitive areas at European level. Historical experiences, the model of family life, as well as family and working life differ from one country to another. Social policy is part of the EU's shared competences – and I therefore believe that the principle of subsidiarity should be maintained in this case.

There is no doubt that Europe is the fastest-ageing continent. In the European Union, the rate of birth rate and intergenerational exchange is incredibly low. There are many reasons for this situation, but the first thing to mention is a departure from the family values that promote traditional European values. No institutional solution will remedy this situation unless we try to restore family importance and special value with a place for mother, father and children. In recent decades, we have faced public danger and harmful tendencies linked to family devaluation in the public sphere and even an attempt to change the definition of family. Countries that have chosen this wrong path are facing the biggest demographic problems. To change this, we must not forget the reasons why this happened. It is therefore necessary first to restore the correct order in the realm of values and then to concentrate on the measures to resolve the greatest social crisis that Europe is experiencing. One such measure is the issue of parental leave. These leave must be support, not a threat to the functioning of the family and the decision to have children.

The most marginal in our communities are the most vulnerable to exploitation. Imagine a young Eastern European woman: smart and ambitious, seeking a good life with opportunities, she meets a young man and falls in love with him and his promises of a good life together. She follows him to London, only to find that he has brought her to a brothel. Her passport and personal possessions are taken, she is pushed into a bedroom with no sheets on the bed, and she is beaten if she refuses any client that is brought to her. She is too brutalised to make any decision about escape or where to seek for help. Her boyfriend has deserted her, probably recruiting other victims. Other girls in the brothel like her: young, scared, beaten, raped and isolated. The men who come to the brothel don’t ask questions, not concerned about the bruises or the fact that she can’t speak the language.  The EU trafficking legislation is now 5 years old. It is an excellent framework for the protection of victims and is a great example of how EU countries can come together to address issues that can’t be tackled alone. But many countries are slow in implementing this. They, and we, are failing the victims across Europe. Victims experience terrible brutality and suffer many long—term physical, mental and emotional effects. I’m confirming the need that victims are properly provided for, with healthcare, accommodation, material assistance and legal support. This legal support should include claiming compensation, which victims are entitled to but very rarely get. Legal support should be available and free of charge. Victims who have been exploited are in no position to pay for that help. I’m also calling for an extension of the 30—day minimum recovery and reflection period, particularly for victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. The effects of this form of trafficking demand specialist support over a very long period. In the UK we have 45 days, but even this is a short time for survivors who have been repeatedly raped over many months. We owe them more than just this month of recovery.  Professionals need to be trained to spot trafficked people. This is clearly failing now. This includes front—line law—enforcement and border staff, judges, magistrates, healthcare professionals, counsellors, teachers and others. Sadly, we will never know how many victims are not found. We must also step up awareness campaigns for groups vulnerable to the traffickers, as well as the wider public, to help them spot the signs of trafficking. Trafficking in human beings is happening where you all live. Open your eyes to the signs of trafficking. We should suspect trafficking when we spot sleeping bags in restaurant kitchens, or factory workers working long hours in poor conditions. It’s in the porn movies and the brothels where the girls can’t speak the local language and never leave to go to the shops. The directive asked Member states to consider criminalising the knowing use of services of trafficked people. To me, it’s scandalous that this is not already a crime. Where else is it acceptable for someone to knowingly engage in an illegal act but not be prosecuted for it? I am pleased that I have been able to work on this report and to play my part in stamping out this vile crime.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr In my previous job I worked, among other things, to combat trafficking in women. I worked with women's shelters, police officers, prosecutors and survivors of prostitution. Some of what I learned from them, I have tried to translate into the Text of the European Parliament, on which we are going to vote today. I'll highlight the most important parts. The first is that we must have different strategies for different forms of trafficking in human beings. In Europe, by far the most common form of trafficking in human beings is that of sexual exploitation, although there is, of course, trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation, which this report also deals with. We have to have a gender perspective. The majority of those exposed are women and girls. We must strengthen the rights of those who are exposed, as Miss Bearder has said. They must have all the support, and they shall also have the right to a residence permit. Ladies and gentlemen, we must follow the money and fight those who profit from trade. We must combat demand. That is the key to the work, and this report clearly highlights it. When we talk about demand, I would like to say a few words about demand in the sex industry. This house has to put its foot down and say that the exploitation of women and girls, boys and men in the prostitution industry is not okay. Most people go into this when they're kids, and that's not okay, even if they grow up. Instead of repeatedly punishing those who are vulnerable, and those who are exploited, it is time to put the responsibility where it belongs. That is, we should attack the pimps, the brothel owners and the sex buyers, Johns, or cods, as we say in Swedish. I know it is radical in this house to dare to suggest that men should not have the right to buy access to women's bodies. But we don't live in the 19th century anymore. It's 2016 – it's time to take a stand for a more progressive view of sexuality and the relationship between women and men. It is a question of standing up for human rights, for feminism and for equality. Decriminalising those who are exposed, and instead criminalising those who exploit, both sex buyers and pimps, is also an effective way of combating demand. If you remove the demand, there will be no trade in people. It is a step in the right direction that this report wants to criminalise those who buy services from victims of trafficking, but we can go even further next time.

I am committed to ensure that we will continue to stress the gender dimension of trafficking and ensure a victim-centred approach. With the same proactive manner we will continue to ensure that European Union law and standards related to anti-trafficking efforts are properly transposed. Out of the 27 concerned Member States, 26 have communicated to the Commission full transposition of the anti-trafficking Directive. The one remaining, Germany, has informed us about a political agreement reached and we are expecting information on the transposition soon. Our services are currently in the process of analysing the information officially notified by the Member States, with the help of a compliance study. The report on the extent to which the Member States comply with the Directive is foreseen to be presented by the Commission in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Commission has been particularly pro-active in monitoring the transposition: only one month after the transposition deadline in May 2013, the Commission had opened 13 infringements based on non-communication. In November of the same year the Commission had sent four reasoned opinions as part of infringement proceedings for non-communication - to Spain, Luxembourg, Italy and Cyprus. This demonstrates the commitment of the Commission not to hesitate in taking actions for ensuring implementation of EU law. The Commission will soon present the first report assessing the progress made in fighting trafficking in human beings. With this report we identify areas of progress and achievement, but also expose gaps and efforts that are still to be made. Clearly, the EU has delivered but still a lot remains to be done.  Our message should be clear: we cannot allow people, human beings, to be treated like commodities. We must work together to ensure we prevent the crime from happening because then it is too late. We must crack down on trafficking where it matters for traffickers the most, on their profits. At the same time, we must ensure that we also crack down on the demand for services and cheap labour that fosters all forms of exploitation. Here we all have a role to play; we must ensure we do not foster a culture of impunity for those who exploit and use the victims. We must ensure that the victims are not treated like the criminals.

As more and more refugees and asylum seekers come to Europe, so more are vulnerable to trafficking, and we in this Parliament and the European Union have to take a two—pronged approach to the terrible issue of human trafficking.  First of all, zero tolerance: we will not tolerate human trafficking in any form at all, whether it is women and girls – who are by far the majority of victims – or other human beings who are trafficked for labour exploitation and other forms of exploitation.  As part of the two-pronged strategy, we also need to focus on victims, and that is difficult. Most of the victims, as has already been said, are vulnerable women who have been trafficked away from where they came from and who face appalling abuse. But we need to make sure that we and the Member States provide adequate services for them so that they can come forward. We should do this because we should do it, but we should also do it because victims can play a key role in identifying traffickers and making sure that those traffickers – the majority of whom, interestingly, are men – can be prosecuted and convicted, because unless we address this, we will not wipe out trafficking.

Traffickers make millions, billions a year of profit on our continent. They deceive men, women and children as the main reason for sexual exploitation, but thousands of victims are destined for begging, forced labour or organ removal. 80% of trafficking victims are women. Most are deceived young people with false promises of employment and then raped, drugged, threatened, blackmailed, stripped of their passports, burdened with debts... In Europe, some 140 000 women are subjected to sexual exploitation and human trafficking. For a problem of European scale we need European solutions, of how not.

According to Europol over 10 000 migrant children are missing in Europe. The UK’s National Crime Agency reported that 3 309 people were potential victims of trafficking for exploitation in 2014, an increase of 21%.  Why are we seeing this modern day form of slavery on the rise? Well, a UK Government report in 2014 said free movement within the EU is extensively exploited by organised criminals to bring human trafficking victims to the United Kingdom, and in 2013 Europol even admitted that the free movement of people reduces the chance of detection of such crimes. So even the EU’s agencies and cheerleaders say that free movement is the big problem.  The EU has created the perfect environment for trafficking to flourish. I am sure business for criminals could not be better with the open door European leaders gave in response to the migrant crisis, once in Europe, and the free movement of people. By encouraging millions of people to come to Europe you are playing into the hands of the traffickers, both within and outside Europe.  Whether it is individuals paying criminals to get them into Europe or families sending off their children for the hope of a better life, the EU has put hundreds of thousands at risk of exploitation and endangered lives by encouraging an exodus across the dangerous Mediterranean Sea. But not satisfied with that, you want Turkey to join the EU and to liberalise visas. Opening the door to a country like Turkey, giving 70 million people access to the UK and Europe, will without doubt increase trafficking.  There is a simple way to deal a blow to traffickers. It is to end the free movement of people, close down the Schengen Area and stop open door immigration. It is for Member States to take back sensible control of their national borders and to conduct criminal background checks.

Extensive information campaigns on the issue of trafficking in human beings are needed, including on the issue of gender equality at an early school age. Education and training are a cornerstone for reducing the risk of human trafficking.  Secondly, early identification, appropriate assistance and protection of victims. Member States need to improve their victim identification systems. It is necessary to increase the number of crisis centres to accommodate them and strengthen their reintegration programmes into society.  Third, tracking money is a key strategy for investigating and prosecuting organised crime networks that profit from trafficking in human beings. The role of Europol and Eurojust is important here.  Last but not least: enhanced cooperation with third countries. Neither Europe alone nor the Member States individually are able to cope with this global challenge. Only with a coordinated approach at international, national and interinstitutional level can we give a decent response.

Of course trafficking in human beings can take on many dimensions, such as sexual exploitation, forced labour, organ removal and forced begging. Moreover, the number of victims of trafficking in human beings from minority groups is disproportionately high because of the marginalisation of these citizens. Huge refugee and migration flows are intensifying the problem of trafficking in human beings, especially children. It is therefore necessary for each Member State of the Union to have appropriate mechanisms in place to prevent and, at the same time, identify victims and provide them with assistance in cooperation with specific support groups.

This includes the denial of freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of religion and belief, and the persecution of persons belonging to minorities, in particular the Crimean Tatars.  High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini discussed these issues in person with the leaders of the Mejlis of Crimean Tatars during her last visit to Kiev in November 2015. The decision of 26 April by the so-called Supreme Court of Crimea to prohibit the activities of the Mejlis, which is a self-governing body of the Crimean Tatars, and labelling it an extremist organisation, represents a grave attack on the rights of the Crimean Tatars as a whole. Furthermore, it constitutes an additional very negative deterioration in the human rights situation on the Crimean peninsula since its illegal annexation by the Russian Federation in 2014.  Let me reiterate once again the EU’s long-standing call for full, free and unrestricted access for international human rights actors to the whole territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and Sevastopol. In the light of recent developments this remains absolutely vital.  In less than one week, 18 May will mark the anniversary of the deportation of Crimean Tatars in 1944.

We use every opportunity to address these issues with our Gambian interlocutors and to push for improvements. These subjects are regularly on the agenda of the Article 8 political dialogue meetings, the most recent of which took place on 26 April in Banjul. Human rights concerns were also raised on 11 April when the Gambian Minister of Foreign Affairs held talks with high-level EU officials in Brussels. Unfortunately the crackdown on the two rare and peaceful political protests on 14 and 16 April 2016 confirmed our concerns. Protesters were arrested, some were mistreated and one person died in custody. Thirty-seven persons, including the leaders of the strongest opposition party, the United Democratic Party, are currently on trial on charges including conspiracy to commit a felony. This is particularly worrying as it occurs in the run-up to presidential and parliamentary elections in December 2016 and, respectively, April 2017. The EU has issued a statement voicing our concern at the crackdown and demanding an investigation. We are part of a common front, as similar statements were issued by the United States, the United Nations and the United Kingdom, as well as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. The United Nations, the African Union and ECOWAS deployed a joint high—level mission to Gambia last week, which renewed calls on the Government to respect freedom of expression, assembly and political participation, to allow due process of law and to conduct an investigation into the death of the Opposition member. In the most recent Article 8 political dialogue meeting in Banjul on 26 April, the EU raised the crackdown on the protests among other human rights concerns. According to the Gambian Government, an investigation was underway and the results would be shared with the EU. The EU delegation to Gambia continues to monitor the situation closely in contact with all stakeholders and strongly encourages the Gambian Government to follow the rule of law. We think that it is important to remain engaged in dialogue with the authorities, as this provides the best possible platform from which to address our concerns and to influence the situation concerning human rights and governance.

The only thing that would remind us that Djibouti is supposed to be a democracy is the regular holding of elections - elections so manipulated that President Guelleh's scores no longer even create a democratic illusion. Moreover, European election observation missions are still expected to be carried out. The African Union, following these observation missions, recommends the establishment of an independent electoral commission to end the democratic charade. Djibouti's geography makes it a strategic point that France has been enjoying for years, leaving it with its main military base abroad. I have no doubt that my country is partly responsible for the political situation in Djibouti, but so are other foreign powers: Germany, China, Japan and the United States also have military bases there.

Madam President, Djibouti, despite being inhabited by some 864,000 inhabitants and with little land and no natural resources, is an important base for foreign military forces. Djibouti is characterised by high unemployment and widespread poverty, and is also a transit point for thousands of African migrants. At the same time, the country's government is responsible for many cases of human rights violations. In particular, in the 2013 elections the government violently suppressed the protests of the opposition parties resulting in several deaths.

Djibouti has actively supported regional initiatives and continues to provide troops to AMISOM, the African Union Mission to Somalia, which is key in the fight against Al-Shabaab and to securing Somalia’s political process. At the domestic level, the development of the political and human rights situation in Djibouti is a matter of concern. Human rights activists and opponents are subject to harassment and the political space of the opposition is narrowing, especially since the run—up to the presidential elections of 8 April 2016. Throughout the pre-electoral period, members and supporters of the opposition have been arrested and detained without charges. The EU has followed these worrying cases closely and expressed its apprehension at different levels.  On 21 December 2015, the police broke up a traditional religious ceremony that took place close to the capital of Djibouti. The intervention of the police and security forces resulted in several deaths. The EU issued a statement on that occasion, demanding clarification on the events and that the perpetrators be punished. The EU condemns the violent action and considers that an international inquiry into these matters is of utmost importance and therefore welcomes the mission of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which will be in Djibouti this week, and hopes it will allow clarification of the issues. With regard to the recent presidential elections, the release of full and detailed results broken down by polling station would have increased the transparency and credibility of the process. The EU notes with regret that the dialogue on the implementation of the framework agreement on political and institutional reforms, concluded between the Government of Djibouti and the coalition of opposition parties at the end of 2014, came to a standstill last year. This is a missed opportunity for engaging in a democratisation process in Djibouti.  Democratisation and governance efforts, as well as greater respect for human rights, are needed to ensure Djibouti’s internal stability in a region marked by conflict and poverty. Therefore, the EU will continue encouraging all political forces in Djibouti to restart the political dialogue in view of engaging in political reforms, improving good governance and putting an end to the tensions the country has experienced in the last years. On the question raised by Madam Arena – what is the EU’s position with regard to the Djiboutian women who went on hunger strike to denounce the rapes perpetrated by the Djiboutian army – I want to assure you that the EU has followed the issue very closely. The EU considers that an investigation should establish the facts and the perpetrators be brought to justice.

It is particularly in the case of tax avoidance, where the current legal framework is no longer sufficient. At present, the Member States lack the necessary transparency to enforce the principle of paying taxes where profits are made. The draft law calls for more transparency. This not only leads to the effective enforcement of the national tax framework, but is also in favour of the competitiveness of SMEs. However, this increased transparency will only help if Member States have easier access to this information from other Member States.

In addition, the rules on transparency on the information that multinational companies are required to report, with regard to the activities carried out in the individual countries in which they operate, the so-called country-by-country-reporting, will apply exclusively to companies with revenues of more than EUR 750 million, that is, only 10% of all multinationals operating in Europe, and these companies will also be able to benefit from exemptions that allow some confidential information to be maintained.

The most telling example is steel: because of its massive overcapacity, China is flooding the world market with products that it sells at prices below the cost of the raw material. It is a certain idea of Europe that is at stake. Employees and consumers will turn away from the EU even further if it proves unable to protect them.

Thanks to this document, the WTO countries can treat imports from China as coming from a country that is not a market economy and, as a result, subject to much higher duties (about 30 % of the value of the product).  According to all observers, including Trade Commissioner Malmström, China has not become a market economy in the meantime. Despite this evidence, however, the importing countries of Northern Europe and the multinationals would very much like to see the Asian giant granted market economy status.

The resulting high level of China's production capacity results in low-cost exports of industrial products to European Union countries. China's exports of cheap steel from state-owned steel mills in the Land of the Rising Sun could seriously hit hundreds of thousands of European steel workers whose jobs could be at risk.

Producers are concerned about the economic growth of the sector if EU producers are not provided with legal protection. Already, EU producers have to meet high EU requirements in various areas, such as environmental requirements that limit the capacity of industry in the EU, but China does not have such high environmental requirements.

This prospect is of serious concern to large monopolistic groups in the EU, particularly those active in manufacturing industries, such as the steel industry, where Chinese capitalist groups strengthen their position vis-à-vis their European Union counterparts. Competition is further complicated by intra-city opposition in the EU, with other parts of the capital looking to boost trade with China, looking forward to its large capitalist market. Monopolies, the EU, urban governments and parties, employers' and sold-out reformist trade unions are trying to cost the working class the interests of capitalists in the dispute with its competitors.

If the exporting state is not a market economy, other methods can be used to estimate the cost of production. This is how higher anti-dumping duties are likely to be imposed. According to the common interpretation of China's protocol of accession to the WTO, the EU must recognise China's market economy status at the end of the year and thus have to apply lesser anti-dumping in order not to violate WTO directives.

The 2030 Action Programme agreed last autumn is an ambitious project aimed at eradicating poverty completely by mainstreaming sustainable development in economic, social and environmental terms. During the negotiations, the EU has repeatedly stressed the integrated nature of these three aspects and has committed itself to implementing them both within the Community and in external relations.  The traditional model of development cooperation is becoming increasingly important and should be limited to countries affected by conflicts and crises. On the other hand, the need for more flexible and innovative instruments based on measurable and verifiable development achievements is increasing. The new objectives are based on a partnership model between developed and developing countries, taking into account their different capabilities and needs.

The practical feasibility of the idea and its impact on the internal market and its competitiveness may raise questions. It is well known that the participation of European SMALL and medium-sized enterprises in the production chain is significant. The cost implications and other negative consequences of the introduction of a mandatory system are unforeseeable.  The report notes that the Commission should take into account and analyse the economic impact of mandatory designation of origin on SMEs in the agricultural and food sectors.

The Commission's analysis is useful, but the conclusion does not address important aspects, i.e. the profits from better consumer information. I am convinced that, in the case of feasibility studies for milk and dairy products, the cost assessment for the industry is exaggerated, as all these products are in one category. If the scope were limited to slightly processed products only, the costs associated with this would be much lower. Many manufacturers and sellers in the EU already provide such information on their own initiative, reflecting the actual needs of consumers and low costs.

Feasibility studies for milk and dairy products exaggerate the cost assessment for industry by assessing all these products in one category. If the scope were limited to slightly processed products only, the costs associated with this would be much lower. Many manufacturers and sellers in the EU already provide such information on their own initiative, reflecting the existing need among consumers and low costs. Mandatory labelling already exists for many products, i.e. meat, eggs, fruit, vegetables, fish and many others. The Commission should submit a proposal for a mandatory designation limited to milk and lightly processed dairy products such as cheese and cream, as well as slightly processed meats, where there is evidence of consumer interest in such information. However, any proposal must minimise costs for producers and consumers. An additional assessment by the Commission of how to implement such a proposal in a cost-effective and proportionate manner would be welcome.

Although this would ensure greater transparency in the food chain and also improve the information of European consumers, the European Commission has not yet made such a proposal. The resolution calls on the Commission to make it mandatory to mark the country of origin or place of origin for all types of drinking milk, milk and meat products, which is a very important requirement.

Unfortunately, the reasons for this are not mentioned in the report. The Hungarian maternity-parental leave system is extremely generous, both parents can use it from the age of six months, the father can choose to stay at home with the child. However, this alone is not enough. It is also necessary to think about a new model of work organisation, which contributes more to the coordination of family and work, and is more suitable than the current less successful models. This is particularly necessary for carers of children/family members with disabilities.

The promotion of maternity, but also the subsequent deepening of childcare, which allows for properly set parental leave, require improvements in standards, including a higher financial assessment during this type of family leave. It is precisely the lack of financial support related to parental leave that is one of the reasons why there has been a long-term low interest on the part of fathers in its use. Change in this area would lead to a better and more equal application of women in the labour market. This would also demonstrably bring positives in terms of the level of economic development in individual countries. It would also contribute to achieving the 75% employment rate target in the European Union set out in the Europe 2020 strategy.

The Hungarian maternity-parental leave system is extremely generous, both parents can use it from the age of six months, the father can choose to stay at home with the child. However, this alone is not enough. It is also necessary to think about a new model of work organisation, which contributes more to the coordination of family and work, and is more suitable than the current, less successful models. This is particularly necessary for carers of children/family members with disabilities.  I also consider it important to point out that, in addition to the minimum expectations of parental leave, I do not see the potential for edification at EU level, as the labour market opportunities, family models, work culture traditions, etc. in some Member States are changing slowly and cannot be overridden in a short period of time. On the basis of experience, I believe that much greater emphasis should be placed on educating, persuading employers, promoting more modern new working time models, promoting good practices that are more adapted to today's lifestyle requirements and the needs of families, while at the same time showing employers that they would not be bad for the use of parents with children, but that they are acting in a family-friendly way that benefits them in particular.

Maternity and paternity leave and parental leave have long been the subject of discussion in the European Union. In order to ensure a better balance between work and family life, we need a balanced family policy. Even the employment target under the Europe 2020 strategy will never be realised unless parents are better cared for! Four months' maternity leave is simply too short. It is proven that it is better for the child's development that the child can stay longer with his or her parents. It is also possible to consider whether equality is achieved in voluntary paternity leave. Even in Member States where paternity leave has been possible for a long time, there may not be any positive results. Only around 2.7% of those who take parental leave are men, and this figure is not much higher in my own country, where the potential parental leave for fathers has been around for a long time. So should we rethink this model? Every child and parent is happier when the relationship is in order. Moreover, having a child must not be a disadvantage in a woman's life, and it is not fair that women should be punished for having children in employment. In many cases, pressure can even be exerted not to remain on parental leave. Not to mention ying about future plans in job interviews.

The limited use of parental leave by fathers was also found, since there is a reduced remuneration during it.

These discrepancies are hard to understand, since the job performed by parents represents a measurable contribution to the economy and parental leaves have long-term benefits for children’s development.

Trafficking in human beings, as stated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, constitutes a violation of fundamental rights, it is also a violation of the victim's personal integrity and a serious organised crime that undermines the state and undermines the rule of law. This Directive aims to better protect victims of trafficking in human beings and reduce the vulnerability of potential victims. It is generally recognised that this Directive is a comprehensive piece of legislation with a commendable approach to human rights and a clear emphasis on the gender dimension of trafficking in human beings. Although victims are people of different genders, age groups and different backgrounds, statistics clearly show that the majority (80%) of victims are women and girls. Gender is a determinant of vulnerability for both men and women. Women's vulnerability is linked to barriers to access to education, the gender pay gap, unequal access to decent work, gender-based violence, unemployment and underemployment, increasing poverty and migration among women, gender-related development strategies, strict migration laws and policies, as well as armed conflicts.

It happens, in fact, that the victims of these traffickings are often criminalised and therefore become even more fragile and excluded, without any protection. This report proposes, in the drafting of the directive, to follow an integrated approach based on human rights, with a particular emphasis on the assistance and protection of victims. With the aim of making the standard truly effective, particular attention is also paid to the gender perspective.

Criminalising the demand for prostitution has been in operation in Sweden for 15 years and in Norway for 8 years. However, after all this time, there is no conclusive evidence that this legal solution has reduced the number of sex workers and victims forced into sex work exploited by people smuggling.  However, there are many examples and studies showing that it has increased the vulnerability of sex workers, contributed to their stigmatisation and reduced their access to health and justice. Growing and prominent organisations are protesting against this solution, citing these studies, arguing for alternative solutions to reduce demand. Thus, criminalised demand has not only not achieved the desired objective, i.e. it has not reduced demand, but it has also made people who are now in need of a black market even more vulnerable, who are thus forced to work in a much more dangerous environment, subjected to abuse and harassment.

Despite the directive, victims of trafficking in human beings are still not recognised early and consistently enough and continue to have problems with access to justice and services and fair treatment to which they are entitled under EU law.

It is also argued that the demand for such services can be reduced by criminalising the buyer instead of the provider. The refugee crisis is increasing human trafficking, with women and unaccompanied minors being the main victims.

Taking out a mortgage to buy a home is the single biggest financial transaction that most people undertake in their lives. So we need a vibrant and competitive mortgage market, one where people have choice, but also one where they know what they are buying and what risks they are taking on. One of the products that became popular in recent years was loans made in foreign currencies, and for many years they offered consumers low interest rates. But recent experience has shown that they can become a problem if they are offered to households that cannot protect themselves properly against sudden changes in exchange rates, and here I think loans in Swiss francs, provide a good example.  These have been popular in countries like Croatia, Poland, Hungary and Romania. But when the Swiss National Bank stopped pegging Swiss francs to the euro in January last year, the cost of servicing those mortgages shot up and that left households struggling to keep up with their mortgage repayments, which in turn put pressure on governments to take action to help those who were in difficulty. Some countries have already passed laws; others are considering doing so. In terms of what the Commission has done for the future, we have acted to ensure that risks associated with foreign currency loans are better managed by strengthening consumer protection in the Mortgage Credit Directive.  But that does not deal with the problem of the existing loans in foreign currencies, and here we are working closely with governments that are considering how best to respond. Of course, there is a need to protect the interests of consumers, but we also need to make sure that any measures taken are fully consistent with the single market and that they do not restrict disproportionately the free movement of capital or the freedom of European companies to do business anywhere in the EU. We also have to consider the potential damage that would be done to investor confidence if we were to undermine legal certainty.  Croatia has chosen to pass legislation that allows borrowers to convert Swiss-franc loans into euro-denominated loans at an exchange rate that pre-dates the franc's appreciation. It puts borrowers in the position that they would have been had they initially chosen a euro-denominated loan, but it places the cost of the conversion, a cost that I understand is some EUR 1 billion, almost wholly on the shoulders of the banks that issued the loans without regard to the different circumstances of the borrowers. The Commission was not consulted on the draft legislation, and the Croatian government was under no obligation to do so. Since its adoption, we have assessed whether Croatia's amendments to its Consumer Credit Act and the Credit Institutions Act are compatible with the principles of the single market. Let me give you our initial analysis. It is clear that the goal of protecting borrowers to avoid a debt crisis can justify restrictions to the free movement of capital or the freedom of establishment, but in our view, allowing borrowers to exchange their loans from Swiss francs into euros at an artificially low exchange rate and placing the cost almost exclusively on lenders goes beyond what is needed to avoid a crisis and protect those borrowers. There is clearly a problem that needs tackling, so we need to find a proportionate solution in line with Treaty freedoms and one that helps maintain investor confidence in Croatia.  The issue has been discussed at the Ecofin Council. We are monitoring the situation carefully in Croatia, but also in other countries that are currently considering passing legislation. We are keeping all options open, including of course opening an infringement procedure if that proves necessary. We are in close contact with the Croatian Government, who tell us that they are keen to find a way forward and they are talking to the banks concerned to find a more balanced approach that shares the burden of adjustment more fairly. I support that approach, but clearly there must be progress soon or we will have to take appropriate action. So, we need a solution that strikes the right balance, one that is consistent with EU legislation, that protects consumers but also investment and the single market. That is the solution that I will continue to push for, and that is what I want to see in every Member State where this is currently a matter of concern.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1488, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner! Ladies and gentlemen! For the time being, Commissioner Hill, thank you for answering our question. We asked this question because laws adopted and prepared to convert foreign currency loans in Romania, Poland and Croatia – sometimes even retroactively – are shaking the confidence of citizens and investors. Credibility, legal certainty and confidence are being undermined.  Recent steps have led to great concern about the reliability, predictability and stability of the legal framework, not only in these countries, but also in the European Union. And the European Central Bank has made it clear that these measures have a negative impact on financial stability, the banking sector and the real economy, as well as a great risk of contagion on the other Member States. I therefore say very clearly that Europe's populists – and there is a connection here – must not shake the foundations of our legal order when they are out for short-term votes.  The rule of law is one of the cornerstones of the common Europe! We must defend the community of law and the European Union community of values and must not allow confidence and credibility to be retroactively overridden in the deposition of trust and credibility, contrary to European law.  And, Commissioner, I would like to add a few additional questions to you in this context. You touched it, but you didn't answer it completely.  Which countries have informed the Commission in advance of the legislative proposals, as would be mandatory under EU law? What measures do you intend to take to make it clear to states facing such debates that this is contrary to EU law – namely the freedom of capital – and what dangers this envisad?  How do you see the central pillars of the common Europe, such as the free movement of capital and legal certainty, if rules are introduced in which loans are suddenly retroactively relocated to a historical interest rate?  Europe's economic strength has been, and still is, its rule of law and its entrepreneurial freedom.

Of course, the European single market is important. Predictability for investors is again very important. We are, however, talking about a commercial contract, a commercial contract between two parties that must also assume the benefits and risks equally. In a commercial contract, it is the banks that give the credit, they have interest, they receive insurance but, at the same time, they also have to bear certain risks. It must be very clear to everyone that we are still talking about the effects of the 2008 crisis. We are talking about loans taken by European citizens in the period 2007-2008 (when interest rates were 10-11%, when house prices were very high), customers who paid for years these loans, who gave advance of 20-30%. Basically, the banks recovered their credit all these years but, because these customers were no longer able to pay that credit, the banks also took their house and left them indebted.  It is a social phenomenon, it is a very great social tragedy in many countries, such as Croatia, such as Romania, which must be managed by all the stakeholders. We must bear in mind that at the heart of the financial crisis of 2008 were primarily banks which, overnight, turned from commercial banks into investment banks that gave mortgages, without taking any safety measures, to people who could not pay those loans in ten lifetimes, just because they could roll them over. This irresponsibility of the banks and this hunger for profit of the banking system has cost us all a great lot.  Guess what! Banks have been bailed out, bank executives, investment managers in those banks have retained their financial benefits, but people have been homeless after paying for years for those homes and not only have they run out of homes, but they still owe them. This situation cannot continue.  You are saying that in Croatia a billion is the \"price\" – I put quotation marks – that banks pay for this situation to be regulated and to assume some of the burden of this situation. But in addition to that figure, Commissioner, I would also be interested in putting in other figures, because a figure is never enough. What is the amount of credits given during that period? What is the profit rate of the banks during that period? What is the value of the housing assets that banks have recovered from customers who have not been able to pay their homes and how have they recovered it in the housing market?  There are a lot of negative phenomena related to this foreign currency credit crisis. There are, for example, situations in Romania where banks have taken the homes of those who have not been able to pay, have given them to so-called executors, who have capitalized on a black market, parallel, real estate at prices of nothing, and will return to certain people who had connections with the banks that had given the original credit. It's a phenomenon that's affected a lot of people. It is a negative phenomenon, which also distorts the market economy to which you refer.  This is not just about the free movement of capital. It is about the responsibility of the financial system, the responsibility of the banks and the measures they take when they have loans. No one prevents a bank from taking additional safety measures, from letting the customer choose, for example, as in Romania, for the law that has just passed, the Law on Payment, to opt to give the property back when it can no longer pay or to come up with additional guarantees. In Romania has now passed a very good law, from our point of view, the Law of payment, which says that a citizen, if he can no longer pay his mortgage, the real estate loan, give the real estate to the bank and close his debt. Of course there has been very high pressure: that it is not right, that investors will no longer have predictability, but the situation is a very simple one. In the loan agreement, the mortgage agreement makes it very clear that the mortgage covers the loan, the amount of the loan. Therefore, when the property returns to the bank, it is closed. The debt is closed. Say that banks suffer very large losses. What is the loss, when an ordinary person pays 30% in advance, pays interest and rates for years, which cover the difference in money and, at some point, can no longer pay, after a year, two, three? The bank remains with the advance, the bank remains with the rates paid and the bank remains with the real estate. What is the loss of the bank, it is not very clear to me. I believe that it must be a clear contract, in which everyone assumes the benefits and costs of this contract, and banks must remain commercial banks, never be investment banks again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1490, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, I cannot help but note the fact that foreign currency loans are extremely widespread in some Member States. In particular, loans in Swiss francs have been popular in the recent past in eastern Europe countries, where about 60% of outstanding loans are taken in foreign currency.  The data show that loans in foreign currency belong mainly to European households, the share of the corporate and government sectors is relatively small. It is also noticeable that only in the UK and Luxembourg a large percentage of loans in Swiss francs are granted to persons – citizens of other countries, which reflects the status of these countries as international financial centres. The attractiveness of loans in foreign currency lies in their immediate benefits, such as lower interest rates and a longer repayment period. However, they pose quite a few risks, as households do not expect to have income in the relevant foreign currency or to be protected from currency risk.  As I have already noted, a few years ago in Central and Eastern Europe the popularity of loans in foreign currency, in particular Swiss francs, increased as interest rates were much lower in Switzerland. People took advantage of such loans for the purchase of real estate. In 2008, however, the value of many currencies collapsed against the franc, resulting in borrowers being put in a situation where they had to repay in local currency an amount many times higher than the value of the loan.  According to data from 2008, Bulgarians are the world record-holder for borrowing in foreign currency, among the most popular are loans for buying homes. However, according to analyses conducted last autumn, 99% of bank loans are in BGN or EURO, as these currencies are considered stable and are not expected to be affected by the changes happening in international markets. While in the 1990s loans in dollars or francs were popular among my compatriots, after Bulgaria's accession to the EU, many businesses and households benefited from the integration of our country's economy into the European economy and increasingly used the euro and bgn.  In addition to the security of the euro, this is also due to the protection that European legislation provides to its citizens. In particular, the Unfair Terms Directive and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union provide a set of rules to replace unfair terms on such credit agreements in foreign currency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1491, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Marisa MATIAS", "mepid": "96820", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, it seems that we are talking about a very specific technical issue here, but in fact we are talking about a fundamental political problem, which is transversal to many other issues, and we end up playing it all the time.  I would like, however, to start with a note: it seems to me, from the outset, that the subject of this debate is wrong, because if we take into account the cases that are here, the loans that have been reported are loans that have been made in national currencies and not in foreign currency. But let's not be under any illusions. In fact, the purpose of the reported practices is to eliminate all risk on the side of financial institutions, discharging this risk, as always, on top of customers.  The only justification for the profitability of banking activity is that we assume that the risk is also taken on the part of banks — either in all or at least part of the risk. That is what should be taken into account when we talk about any credit agreement. But that is not the case in most mortgage contracts, and, moreover, every time we talk about this, we must remember the number of families who have had tragic situations, because they have not been able to repay their loans, have had to be left without a home and have yet to have to pay. Therefore, the risk was entirely on the side of families and the financial sector fully protected. In this regard, I would say that the response of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this House on this particular matter is quite revealing. And it is revealing, I would say, of the attitude of the European institutions on the regulation of the financial sector. The European institutions have no problem interfering in the management of the national financial sectors, as they did very recently, and illegally, in the process of selling Banif in Portugal. But if there are citizens who denounce contracts that violate the principles of good faith, balance and justice, the response of the European institutions is very simple and it is almost always the same: put the banks in court and resolve themselves.  Therefore, the titanic Europe that we see in imposing budgetary policies or in the choice of buyers in national competitions always becomes, or almost always, a noist when it comes to protecting citizens against those who are the abuses of the financial sector. And it is for these and for other reasons, Commissioner, that the credibility of the European institutions and the European Union has fallen sharply across Europe. There can no longer be such a heavy burden on citizens and all excuses and some more to continue to protect the financial sector. And therefore promises are not enough; it is not enough to say that the Commission intends to protect consumers. Concrete action is needed, and I would like to see the same commitment by the Commission to protect the citizens of this European Union, as it is committed to protecting the internal market and the free movement of capital.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1492, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Krisztina MORVAI", "mepid": "96661", "text": "   – Mr President, I have been looking forward to this debate today.

I have listened very carefully to your speech, Commissioner, and I am glad that the European Commission sees it as important to negotiate with individual national governments that are, say, labour-related, conversion laws, and that we are trying to find a solution that, on the one hand, will help people who have been put in a difficult social situation, but on the other hand that we are looking for a solution that will not harm the internal market of the European Union. that we are looking for a solution that is not retroactive, and that we are looking for a solution that does not conflict with the principles on which our integration is based. On the one hand, I sympathise with people who, by taking out credit in another currency, have put their credit in a difficult economic situation, on the other hand, the result cannot be the adoption of laws that are contrary to the principles of the European Union. I am very glad, Commissioner, that you are watching this and that you have reassured us that you are dealing with individual national governments.  In short, if some national governments want to help their fellow citizens who have taken risks and taken out favorable loans that have subsequently proved less profitable, then these governments and these countries cannot do so at the expense of business. And they should not do this at the expense of another group of borrowers. In short, if we help one group of borrowers, how do other borrowers who were more responsible take out less attractive loans and now they don't get into a difficult situation? Let us also note that the assistance of one group of debtors is always at the expense of someone else and that it is therefore also other debtors who have approached the matter more responsibly. I am, Mr Commissioner, from the Czech Republic, and just as there was a boom in these foreign loans in Swiss francs in Eastern Europe, which we are essentially talking about, I was in the Czech Government, which strongly warned Czechs not to make good promises and not to take out loans in Swiss francs. In the Czech Republic, too, we do not have this problem at the moment. We have strong banking, we have a strong crown, even though we are a relatively small country, and we do not solve the problems that our neighbors solve. And there is also the question of how governments in eastern European countries contributed to this at the time, and how they warned their citizens at the time that if they took out an attractive loan, they would increase their risk and that the risk might fall on them. So I am very much begging you not to be subject to populism here, and to really – and I feel that this effort is on your side – to have a debate with national governments and to look for solutions that do not harm the internal market, which for me personally is the main value of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1494, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "   – Mr President, if one looks at the actual distribution of currencies around the world, then it is clear that an absolute majority rarely moves across native borders for the purpose of trade, investment or anything else – unless numismatics are involved. Therefore, in order to engage in trade relations, national currencies have to get exchanged for something else. For the most part that includes the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, pound sterling, the Australian dollar, the Swiss franc, the Chinese yuan and the Russian rouble. The same situation applies to foreign currency lending: for example, according to the European Central Bank, in January 2016 most foreign currency loans within the EU itself were in euros, US dollars or Swiss francs. Households are usually the primary borrowers, with non-financial institutions coming next and financial institutions third.  Depending on the country, households and non-financial counterparties (NFCs) may change places. For example, most such loans in Bulgaria are by NFCs, while households constitute a majority in Poland. Interestingly enough, in Hungary and the Czech Republic household loans in foreign currency are virtually non-existent. At the same time in the UK, Cyprus, Ireland and Luxembourg, a majority of foreign currency loans are taken by financial institutions. Moreover, Swiss francs dominate in foreign currency lending in Austria, while in Poland and Greece their share is around half of all such loans. In other words, depending on each country, financial stability, economic growth and other factors, a choice is made in which currency it is more reasonable to take loans. A covered foreign currency loan, such as a loan denominated in a currency other than that of the borrower’s home country, for which repayment terms are prearranged through the use of a forward currency contract, means that an agreement is in place that obligates parties to exchange given quantities of currencies at a pre-specified exchange rate with a certain future date. However, not all foreign currency loans are covered, and this is precisely where an effective regulatory system is necessary in order to create an environment where, for instance, potential borrowers are fully aware of lending specificities, while banks cannot make unsubstantiated demands or change the lending conditions midway through. The principle risk of foreign currency (forex) lending is the potential volatility of the exchange rate involved. For example, since the Bulgarian lev and Danish crown are linked to the euro, if a Bulgarian or Danish national takes a loan in euros, the risk of rapidly increasing loan payments is rather low, so one of the only things a person would have to worry about is the stability of their income. If, however, a Russian or Ukrainian national decided to take a loan in a foreign currency – for example in US dollars or euros – a couple of years ago, the situation may have turned out differently, as is precisely the case now due to several currencies’ depreciation, including the Russian rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia, over the last two years. Of course, there may be serious issues arising from having a common currency, due to financial crises or internal financial instability taking place in one or more states employing the currency, such as Greece for example, where the question of the reinstitution of the Greek drachma was seriously considered some time ago. For the most part, however, having a common currency is quite beneficial. In the case of foreign currency loans, this is quite true if the common currency has a stable exchange rate in relation to the one in which the loan was made. A couple of months ago, questions for oral answers were submitted to the Commission on the matter of foreign currency loans, or more precisely retrospective conversion of foreign currency loans into local currency loans. The issue mostly concerns EU Member States outside the eurozone. The main point of such actions is that many people often buy foreign currency denominated cars or have personal loans, thereby putting hundreds of thousands of households at risk of financial problems in case the exchange rate rapidly changes. Even more so, quite a few people also have mortgage loans converted into national currencies in addition to their foreign currency debt. Conversions therefore may be necessary for the sake of ensuring national financial stability. One of the main matters at hand is that the above—mentioned retrospective conversions take place at non—market exchange rates, thereby raising the question of them being in line with the general principles of EU law, such as freedom of capital movement and freedom of establishment. As a result, these actions may, for example, contribute to damaging investors’ confidence in the internal market. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice stated two years ago that certain foreign currency transactions relating to loan agreements are not yet covered by EU legislation.  Since is the Commission who is responsible for ensuring that EU law is correctly applied, it is absolutely necessary for it to clearly make its position known on the matter of legal compatibility between the practice of retrospective conversion of foreign—denominated loans and the obligations of Member States to communicate to the Commission any draft regulation not related to the transposition of adopted EU law or international law. In addition, should the above—mentioned ECJ statement indeed be true, it is also highly necessary to extend the respective EU legislative coverage to loan agreements currently omitted.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1495, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Mr President, I would also like to begin my speech by expressing regret that, unfortunately, we are not getting to such a serious subject until Thursday afternoon. However, I was happy to hear the Commissioner's opinion, it is really clear from him that the European Commission is dealing with this problem. I would like to appreciate this, although I feel that it would probably be necessary to add in this matter. This topic, which, for example, sounds somewhat distant in the Czech Republic, because this problem has not touched the Czech Republic very much, has really affected a number of Central European countries, but even not only Central European countries. These are mainly citizens who, until recently, had large mortgages in foreign currencies. The number of foreign mortgages even exceeded the number of domestic mortgages in some countries. The motivation was therefore, as has already been said, a low interest rate. Unfortunately, however, these citizens' calculations did not work out very well when, due to the strengthening and weakening of individual currencies, even though there were no changes in interest rates, they were forced to repay much higher amounts than originally anticipated. Some Member States of the European Union have decided to address the consequences of this widespread phenomenon through retroactive measures, when, for example, they are converting loans in foreign currencies into loans in domestic currencies. First of all, it must be said that the action of these states threatens one of the fundamental principles on which European law is based, and that is the free movement of capital. At the same time, it directly affects the second principle, which is the protection of the rule of law. I say this even though I have some sympathy for the efforts of some Governments of the Member States to address the negative social consequences that result from these bad decisions made by their citizens. In any event, the retroactive nature of such measures should be condemned. Prevention, preventive measures and strengthening the financial literacy of the public are the main way. Drastic steps that undermine investor confidence and ultimately undermine the principles of European integration cannot be encouraged. However, I do not want my speech to sound like there are no problems in this area. On the contrary, the problem I have encountered is, for example, the abusive nature of the provisions of credit agreements expressed in foreign currency, according to which a different rate is used to determine the amount of credit than when repaying it. This is an example from Hungary, which has also been assessed by the European Court of Justice, which, by its decision, has recently paved the way for the invalidation of clauses of this type, which are only beneficial to financial institutions and harm citizens as consumers. The Commissioner also commented on the protection of consumer rights. I am glad that the Commission is aware of this. I think that we should strengthen consumer rights, but at the same time not touch on those principles on which the rule of law is based.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1496, "date": "2016-05-12.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Mr President, from an Irish perspective, I think that today’s discussion on foreign currency loans is an important one. At a time when ECB rates are at historic lows since the time of the financial crisis, Irish people find themselves in the situation where Irish variable mortgage rates are significantly higher than the EU average. Some banks are charging up to 4% in Ireland, while the EU average is around 2%. It is a situation about which my Irish colleagues and I have written a cross—party letter to ECB President Mario Draghi, and we hope which will get a positive response.  But it is a discussion today that reminds me of an additional reason for concern, as an Irish public representative, related to our high interest rates. To a lot of Irish people, a foreign currency mortgage may look like a great deal. Lower interest rates, longer maturities; it seems like a great idea. An Irish person on a foreign currency mortgage could save an awful lot of money in the short term. However, this is a gamble that must be looked at from a long-term perspective. Despite early savings, there is a huge risk that one will have to pay more in the long run – potentially a lot more. For this reason, I feel there is a need to maximise the amount of information that a bank is required to provide to consumers interested in such a loan, and I call on all Member States to ensure this happens.  I think most of us here would agree that if loans are taken out in a foreign currency, the economy becomes less stable. When there is a high share of foreign currency loans in the economy, households become very sensitive to fluctuations in the exchange rate, and this significantly affects consumption and housing demand. The Central Bank responds to fluctuations in such output, and therefore more foreign currency loans will lead to stronger adjustments in short—term interest rates. This in turn makes the exchange rate, and therefore borrowers’ expenditure, even more volatile. Additionally, with deep exchange rate depreciations, we have a surge in servicing costs expressed in domestic currency, and this could bring mass defaults and lead to a systemic banking crisis. I feel this should even be a warning sign to the United Kingdom voters ahead of the Brexit referendum. If there is to be a sharp depreciation of sterling, as is predicted, should Brexit occur, United Kingdom banks would be forced to offer foreign currency loans and possibly bring increased instability to their economy at a time when they would need not need any more. In this regard, I welcome the Commission’s recognition of the problem of irresponsible lending and borrowing, including the irresponsible behaviour by market participants that blighted Europe, and my own country in particular, before the financial crisis. I commend them on the work they are doing to correct these problems. Finally, I want to say to the Commissioner that you are doing good work and we appreciate it, and to keep it going. I call on Member States to implement fully the provisions laid out in the Mortgage Credit Directive.

I believe that we need to establish clear rules for the future with regard to consumer protection, especially since the bargaining power between consumers and banks is very often extremely disproportionate to consumers.

I regret that, because it is an extremely important subject. In terms of some of the themes that have come out from the debate, perhaps the most important starting point is: what can we do to protect consumers in future? Part of the answer, I think, lies – as a number of colleagues have referred to – in the Mortgage Credit Directive, which will put in place a better framework with specific remedies to protect consumers, in case for those who take out foreign currency loans, the rates were to rise sharply in cost. I think, more generally, in terms of what we need to try to do to improve retail financial services for consumers across the European Union, we do need to have more transparency. We do need to try to increase the size of the market so that consumers are able to have the best choice of products that is available and, as Mr Kelly mentioned, if you look at the pricing of certain financial products across the EU, they vary hugely from country to country. One of the ideas behind the Green paper on retail financial services that I have launched, and the process we are working on, is to try to strengthen that single market for retail financial services and think about financial services, not from an institutional point of view, but from the point of view of the millions of our fellow citizens who use them.  Now I start with that point because the importance of trying to build a stronger single market for retail financial services links to the point about having a single market for capital and the free flow of capital, which a number of colleagues have referred to. That, I think, underpins the approach that the Commission has taken in the case of these foreign currency loans. As a number of colleagues have said, it is very important that we strike a balance between the interests of consumers – and clearly there it is absolutely and perfectly proper for Member States to take action to protect the interests of consumers – but, at the same time, if we want to uphold the single market in capital, if we want to deepen it and strengthen it , we have to uphold the legal framework that operates and we need to make sure that governments, when they take steps – perfectly properly to protect consumers – do so within the framework of that law. That in essence is what lies behind the approach that the Commission has sought to develop with a number of Member States. In response to a specific question, I was asked how many Member States consulted the Commission in advance of taking measures, well Member States are not obliged to consult the Commission before the adoption of the laws in fields of financial services. We are monitoring measures in Romania and Poland because there Member States have provided us with their draft laws. We are also, as I said, in discussions with the Croatian Government to see if we can find a balanced solution to the challenge that we face. It is not the case, as was alleged, that the Commission is seeking to infringe Member States who take action to protect consumers. That is far from the point. I hope I have been completely clear, that it is, of course, absolutely proper for governments to take those actions but, as a number of colleagues have mentioned, the issue of retroactivity is extremely important, the question of proportionality is extremely important and the issue where there is no differentiation by governments in the laws they pass between consumers is also a cause for concern. I am hopeful that we will be able to find practical solutions to the problems that we face. I am encouraged by the support I have had from a number of Members of Parliament for the approach that we are taking. I am personally involved in doing that work; discussing it with Ministers. I hope that we will be able to make that progress, in order to provide clarity and legal certainty for financial services, but also for consumers. So as far as Croatia is specifically concerned, we are continuing to assess the situation there and to make sure and explore whether the actions they are taking are compatible with the single market and the commitments that Croatia has made under European legislation. We will keep up the pressure on that. Also, we are following discussions in other countries where possible measures in relation to foreign currency loans are being considered, just to check that they are in line with EU law. But this is an important issue. I will keep it firmly under review and we will take the necessary steps that we need to make sure that consumers are protected but that we have a common framework and we uphold the rule of law, so that businesses are able to invest with certainty, because if we want to get growth and jobs to be encouraged, if we want to encourage investment , and if we want to build a capital markets union, then businesses need to know that they have certainty and that they are able to invest for the long term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
