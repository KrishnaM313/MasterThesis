My point of order is based on article 118 of the latter relating to the hearing, which took place yesterday in committee, of candidates for the Executive Committee. Indeed, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, by a discriminatory measure that I believe to be contrary to the rules, the floor was refused to non-attached Members. However, article 118 of the regulation which regulates this question refers to Annex XVI. Annex XVI of the rules provides that although the group coordinators have the competence to organize the discussion, on the other hand, speaking times are allocated in accordance with Article 162. Article 162 (4) provides on several occasions for a speaking time for non-members.

They sent us strong, if sometimes contradictory, messages. Today and in the years to come, we must respond to them. To meet their expectations, their anxieties, their hopes with dreams, because in Europe there is a place for the dream. It is here in the European Parliament, the centre of European democracy, that I want to present the general guidelines that will preside over the work and action of the next Commission. I am saying general guidelines. The summary guidance that I have sent you in writing in all official languages, because all languages have the same dignity. I would like to thank the translators who spent a sleepless night on a text that I finalized late last night.  The Commission's detailed programme will be the College of Commissioners, which will be yours to legitimise not to vote in the autumn. The Parliament that has just begun its mandate as a legislature is a parliament that is different from its predecessors. You are the first parliament to really elect, in every sense of the word, the President of the Commission. You will elect him in a new spirit. The day after the election, you insisted on the requirement that the results of universal suffrage be taken into account. In doing so, you have given its true meaning, its true democratic and political significance to Article 17, paragraph 7, of the Lisbon Treaty. Without your insistence and advocacy, this article would have remained a dead letter forever. You defended the democratic principle and you were right to do so. A parliament that imposes the observance of the democratic principle does a noble job and deserves neither acerbic and unjustified criticism nor trial of ill-inspired intent.  I want to pay tribute here to the other leading candidates who have added a strong dose of vivacity, another democratic debate. If the political family of one of them had won the election, I would have been the first to ask this House to invest it with the mandate to compose the next Commission.  Parliament and the Commission are two of the most community institutions. Therefore, it is only normal for the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission, on the one hand, and for Parliament and the Commission, on the other, to have a privileged working and design relationship. We will be community actors, not against the European Council or against the Council of Ministers; Europe is not built against states or nations, which are not a temporary invention of history, but which are settled in the long term. We, Parliament and the Commission, will act in the public interest and I would like us to do so together.  The European Council proposes the Chairman of the Committee. That does not make him his secretary. The Commission is not a technical committee made up of brilliant senior officials at the behest of another institution. The Commission will be political. I want it more political. It will be very political. Its composition must reflect the plurality of the majority of ideas that are being put in place and I would like the European Council, when it organises its internal architecture, to be inspired by the same principle.  The President of the Commission is elected by your Assembly, but that does not make him a receiver of orders. I will not be the European Parliament's aide-de-camp. But do not doubt for a second my desire to terminate the office of a Commissioner to whom you have withdrawn your confidence, nor my willingness to follow in principle in principle by a legislative proposal your interventions and invitations in this direction. Also, the right to ask questions will not be undermined. It will remain as it is.  I will ask the Commissioners to attend the highlights of the important trilogues more often, and I would like the Council to do the same. I will ensure that the register of lobbies is made public and mandatory. I would like the Europeans to know who came to see who, who spoke to whom, and I would like the other institutions to follow us in this process. (Applause) I will ensure that the procedural rules surrounding the various GMO authorities are reviewed. I would not want the Commission to decide when a majority of Member States would not have encouraged it.  In general, ladies and gentlemen, let us renounce ideological debates which have no other purpose than to fuel divisions. Let us replace them with virtuous debates based on strong convictions and ambitions that bear far. Let's choose pragmatism as a method. Let's focus on concrete achievements that have beneficial effects for all Europeans. Let us not fatm those who observe us through inter-institutional debates that take us away from the essential, that is, the European citizen. And I say to governments: \"Resist more often the temptation of criticism when you return home on the decisions you have taken together in Brussels.\"  (Applause) \"If you said yes in Brussels, don't say no elsewhere. Never say, ever again, after a meeting of the European Council or the Council, that you have won a victory and that the others have lost. In Europe we win together and we lose together.\" (Applause) Europe has become unreadable because very often we turn its description into a caricature. Let's give up national navel-gazing. In Europe, let's play together. Let's apply the community method. Yes, it's demanding, but it's effective. It has a proven track supply and is more credible than intergovernmental excesses. Ladies and gentlemen, the Community method must be rehabilitated. (Applause)  Ja, Herr President - ich dr-cke mich jetzt in der Sprache des Weltmeisters aus , Europa hat an Glaubw-rdigkeit eingebàt. Die Distanz zwischen der European Union und den Bàrgern w-chst. Nur die total Blinden und die total Tauben h-ren und sehen das nicht. Die European Union befindet sich sehr oft in Erkl-rungsnot, und wir befinden uns in permanenter Bringpflicht, um Europa besser zu erklàren. Europa, Herr President, braucht eine breit aufgestellte Reformagenda. Der Status quo ist keine komplette Palette. Wir messen sie erweitern. Die Menschen haben sehr oft Angst vor Reformen. Sie empfinden sie als bedrohlich, als zu risikoreich. Aber wer kein Risiko eingeht, der geht das greere Risiko ein. Wir messen Risiken eingehen, um Europa wettbewerbsf-higer zu machen. Wir haben als European Union an internationaler und globaler Wettbewerbsf-higkeit eingebàt. Wir sind zur-ckgefallen, weil wir stehen geblieben sind. Wir messen wieder in Vorsprung kommen. Wettbewerbsf-higkeit wird oft verwechselt mit einseitigem Sozialabbau. Aber Wettbewerbsf-higkeit erreicht man nicht mit Sozialabbau. Wettbewerbsf-higkeit erreicht man dadurch, dass man sich ein breit gef-chertes Konzept an die Hand gibt. Ziel muss sein, die European Union zu einem aktiven Standort zu machen - Standort fàr Menschen, Standort fàr Investoren. Dazu geh-rt auch das Prinzip - man muss manchmal an die Notwendigkeit erinnern - dass die Wirtschaft den Menschen zu dienen hat und nicht umgekehrt. Wirtschaft hat den Menschen zu dienen. (Beifall) Dies erzwingt, dass die Binnenmarktregeln keinen h-heren Wert haben als die sozialen Mindestregeln. Binnenmarkt geht nicht immer vor, auch das Soziale muss seinen Platz in Europa behalten. (Beifall) Ich bin ein begeisterter Anh-nger der sozialen Marktwirtschaft. \"Wohlstand for alle\", hat Ludwig Erhard gesagt, nicht nur Wohlstand fer einige wenige. Wohlstand for alle, das muss die Maxime jeder Wirtschafts- und Sozialpolitik sein. Man sagt oft angesichts der Krise, die soziale Marktwirtschaft hette versagt. Nein, meine Damen und Herren, nicht die soziale Marktwirtschaft hat versagt! Versagt haben die, die gegen die Kardinaltugenden der sozialen Marktwirtschaft durch Profitgier, durch Geldgier, durch die Politik des schnellen Geldes verstoen haben! Nicht die soziale Marktwirtschaft hat versagt. (Beifall) Soziale Marktwirtschaft funktioniert nur, wenn es sozialen Dialog gibt. Der soziale Dialog hat in den vergangenen Krisenjahren gelitten. Er muss sowohl national als auch und vor allem auf europeischer Ebene wiederbelebt werden. Ich mechte ein President of the sozialen Dialogs breast. (Beifall) Standortsicherung braucht Wachstum, nicht schuldenfinanzierte Konjunkturprogramme, die zu Strohfeuer fàhren, die auf Dauer keine Arbeitsmarktwirkung zeitigen. Was wir brauchen ist ein nachhaltiges Wachstum for Jahrzehnte. Wir brauchen ein anspruchsvolles Arbeits-, Wachstums-, Investitions- und Wettbewerbsf-higkeitspaket. Wieso brauchen wir das? Weil wir viele Menschen in Europa wieder zur-ck nach Europa, wieder zur-ck in die Mitte des Lebens fàhren messen. Wachstumspakete, Wettbewerbsf-higkeitspakete, Investitionsprogramme haben nur ein Ziel: die Menschen wieder in die Mitte der Gesellschaft zur-ckzubringen. Es entsteht zurzeit innerhalb der Grenzen der European Union ein 29. Staat. Das ist der Staat, in dem die wohnen, die keine Arbeit haben. Ein Staat, in dem jugendliche Arbeitslose wohnen. Ein Staat, in dem Ausgeschlossene, Zur-ckgeworfene, am Wege stehen Gebliebene leben. Ich hette gerne, dass dieser 29. Mitgliedstaat wieder ein normaler Mitgliedstaat wird. Deshalb schlage ich ein anspruchsvolles Investitionsprogramm vor. Bis Februar 2015 mechte ich dieses anspruchsvolle Wachstums-, Investitions-, Wettbewerbsf-higkeits- und Arbeitspaket vorlegen. Ich hàtte gerne, dass wir in den nechsten drei Jahren 300 Milliarden Euro an 'ffentlichen und vor allem privaten Investitionen mobilisieren. Das werden wir tun, und ich wre dankbar, wenn das Parlament mich auf diesem Weg unterst-tzen wurde. Wir kunnnen das tun durch zielorientiertes Nutzen der bestehenden Strukturfonds und durch das zielorientierte Nutzen der verf-gbaren und auszubauenden Instrumente der European Investitionsbank. Wir brauchen Investitionen in Infrastrukturprojekte, abgestimmte Investitionen, wir brauchen Investitionen im Breitbandbereich, in Sachen Energienetze, wir brauchen Investitionen in die Verkehrsinfrastruktur der Industriezentren. Wir brauchen eine Reindustrialisierung Europas. Wir brauchen auch Investitionen im industrialn Bereich. Wir brauchen Investitionen in Sachen Forschung, Entwicklung, erneuerbare Energien. Erneuerbare Energien sind nicht das Spielfeld ökologischer Gutmenschen. Erneuerbare Energien und ihr Ausbau sind die Voraussetzung, dass das Europa von morgen wirklich dauerhaft best-ndige, nachhaltige Standortvorteile im Direktvergleich zu anderen Playern in der Welt hat. (Beifall) Ein sturker investierendes Europa ist ein Europa fàr mehr Wohlstand, es ist ein Europa fàr mehr Arbeitspletze. Investitionen sind der beste Verbendete der Arbeitslosen. Wir messen parallel dazu die Jugendgarantie ausbauen. Ich hàtte gerne, dass wir die Altersgrenze schrittweise von 25 auf 30 Jahre erh-hen. Investitionen sind nur dann zielorientiert zu gestalten, wenn wir in Sachen Bàrokratieabbau von der Stelle kommen, vor allem bez-glich der kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen. Mittelstundler sind keine Gro-kapitalisten. Mittelstundler arbeiten hart. Mittelstundler schaffen Arbeitspletze. Wir messen mehr for den Mittelstand tun, vor allem 'ber den Weg des resoluten Abbaus der bàrokratischen 'bertreibungen. Wir messen Ernst machen mit der Anwendung des Prinzips der Subsidiarity. Seit dem Maastrichter Vertrag reden wir 'ber die korrekte Anwendung of the Subsidiarit-tsprinzips. Wir tun is nur mangelhaft. Unsere Reden dauern lenger als die Anstrengungen, die wir leisten, um in Sachen Bàrokratieabbau von der Stelle zu kommen und um dafar Sorge zu tragen, dass die Europeische Kommission und die Europeische Union, statt sich in alle Details, Winkel und Ecken der Menschen einzumischen, sich um die wirklich gro-en europ-ischen Nicht jedes Problem, das es in Europa gibt, darf zum Problem der European Union werden. Wir sollen uns um die groeen Sachen kunmmern! (Beifall) All dies, Herr President, muss naturlich Stabilit-tspakt-konform in die Wege geleitet werden. Wir werden den Stabilitets- und Wachstumspakt in seinen Grundz-gen nicht verandern. Dies hat der European Rat festgestellt. Ich halte mich an diese Maegbe in den nechsten Jahren. Stabilitet war versprochen worden bei Einf-hrung der gemeinsamen Wàhrung. Stabilitet ist nicht nur ein Eintrittsgebot, sondern Stabilitet ist ein dauerhaftes Gebot. Stability war versprochen, Europa darf seine Versprechen nicht brechen! Ich werde sie nicht brechen! (Beifall) Aber der European Rat hat zu Recht festgestellt, dass wir die Flexibilit-tsmargen, die der 2005, 2011 reformierte Stabilit-tspakt enth-lt, auch nutzen, um die Dimension Wachstum des Stabilitàts- und Wachstumspaktes voll zur Geltung zu bringen. Das haben wir in der Vergangenheit auch getan, das werden wir in Zukunft verst-rkt tun - wobei es mir schon auf die Feststellung ankommt, Herr President, dass das, was wir in den vergangenen Jahren auf den Weg gebracht haben, das, was wir gele Ich war Vorsitzender der Euro-Gruppe und bin froh, es nicht mehr zu sein. Denn eine vergn-gungssteuerpflichtige Veranstaltung ist das nun wirklich nicht. Ob die Aufgabe, fer die ich mich heute bewerbe, angenehmer werden wird, wage ich im 'brigen zu bezweifeln. Aber wir haben w-hrend der Eurokrise - die keine Eurokrise war, sondern eine Schuldenkrise - ein brennendes Flugzeug im Flug reparieren messen. Das war nicht einfach, das entspricht nicht allen Anforderungen hoher Staatskunst, das entspricht nicht den Geboten ausgefeilter politischer.sthetik. Aber wir haben es geschafft, dass die Euro-Zone als Ganzes erhalten blieb. Vor etwas mehr als einem Jahr haben Spekulanten go Provenienz - und viele lachen da - darauf gewettet, dass die Euro-Zone in sich selbst zusammenfallen wurde. Sie ist es nicht! Es wurden auf vielen Finanzpl-tzen Wetten abgeschlossen, dass Griechenland aus der Eurozone ausscheiden wurde. Ich habe alles getan und ich bin stolz darauf, dass Griechenland, dieses t-chtige Volk, diese groe Nation, immer noch Mitglied der europeischen Wirtschafts- und Wàhrungsunion ist. (Starker Beifall) Aber, Herr President, wir haben auch Fehler gemacht. Ein brennendes Flugzeug im Flug zu reparieren, ist keine einfache Sache. Da verbrennt man sich schon von Zeit zu Zeit die Finger. Ich hàtte gerne in Zukunft, wenn es noch zu Anpassungsprogrammen kommt - ich sehe im 'brigen keine Notwendigkeit, dass es in den nechsten Jahren dazu kàme, dass, bevor ein Anpassungsprogramm zur Anwendung kommt, eine sehr minutise soziale Folgenabsch-tzungsstudie gemacht wird. Ich wesste gerne, wie sich Anpassungsprogramme im Leben der Menschen auswirken. Es wird in Zukunft keine Anpassungsprogramme ohne vorgeschaltete Analysis sozialer Impakte geben konnen. (Beifall) Und ich hàtte gerne, dass wir uns jedes Mal, wenn Anpassungsprogramme ins Haus stehen, einen Plan B zurechtlegen, einen Plan B, auf den wir uns dann beziehen kunnnen, wenn die makro-konomischen Voraussagen nicht stimmen. Wenn es weniger Wachstum in einem Land gibt, als dies Grundlage eines Anpassungsprogramms war, dann muss man auch die Anpassungsprogramme anpassen kunnen. Deshalb bin fer die parallele Aufstellung eines Plans B in all diesen Fullen. (Zwischenruf) It doesn't seem to convince you? Ich hette gerne, dass wir das Instrument der Troika neu nachdenken. Das Parlament hat in einschl-gigen Berichten dargelegt, dass es der Troika, so wie sie jetzt funktioniert, an demokratischer Substanz fehlt. Es fehlt ihr an demokratischer Substanz, es fehlt ihr eine parlamentarische Dimension. Wir messen die Troika neu ausrichten, sie demokratischer, parlamentarischer, politischer machen. Wir werden dies tun! (Beifall) We cannot spend money that we do not have. We have to replace deficits and debt with ideas. These ideas are there. We must better use the opportunities offered by digital technology, which does not know any borders. We must break down national silos of telecommunication regulations, of copyright and of data protection. We have to break down national silos as far as the management of radio waves is concerned, and so on. We must knock down these barriers, these hurdles to growth. Roaming charges in Europe have to disappear, and they will disappear. If we are successful in implementing a real digital single market, we can generate EUR 250 billion of additional growth in Europe, and we will do it. We need - as was so often said (mainly during the Ukraine crisis) - a resilient energy Union with a forward-looking climate-change policy. We have to reorganize Europe's energy policy into a new European energy union. We need to pool resources, combine infrastructures and unite our negotiating power vis-à-vis third countries. We need to diversify our energy sources and reduce the high energy dependence of several of our Member States. I think that the European energy union will become the world number one in renewables and will contribute to significantly-enhanced energy efficiency beyond the 2020 objective, notably when it comes to buildings. A binding 30% objective for energy efficiency by 2030 is, to me, the minimum if we want to be credible and forward-looking. We cannot pretend to be the leader as far as climate change policy is concerned if we do not become more efficient when it comes to energy efficiency. (Applause) The internal market has to be completed. If we are successful in this, we will add another EUR 200 billion of added value to the European economy. We have to do it. We have to complement the new European rules for banks with a capital markets union. To improve the financing of our economy, we should further develop and integrate capital markets. This would cut the cost of raising capital, mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Free movement of workers has always been one of the key looters of the internal market. I will defend that principle. Free movement is an opportunity, not a threat. The rules will not be changed. It will be up to national authorities to fight against abuse of fraudulent claims. I will initiate a targeted review of the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation. We have to fight social dumping, and we will do it. I will fight tax evasion and tax fraud. I am in favour of the adoption at EU level of the common consolidated corporate tax based on the Financial Transaction Tax. We have to fight against money laundering, and we will do it. (Applause) With regard to economic and monetary union, Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the crisis is not over. The crisis is not over. The crisis is not over as long as there are twenty-five thousand men and women who are unemployed. The crisis is over when full employment has been restored. To achieve this, we need to better coordinate our economic policies. We need to put in place an economic government, an economic governance, a kind of economic government. And we will.  We must remain demanding in terms of the necessary implementation of structural reforms which, in the medium term, will contribute to the growth of the European economy. If the Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union make special efforts, we will have to think about financial incentives that will accompany this process. In this context, it will be necessary we were thinking about establishing its own fiscal capacity for the euro area.  We must stop being ridiculous and be represented, as one of the strongest, by so many representatives who very often contradict each other. I would like the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro to be represented by a single chair, one place and one voice in the Bretton Woods institutions. (Applause) As I am in Bretton Woods, in the middle of the United States, I would like to say a word about the free trade agreement with the United States. I am in my united states. I believe that the two largest economic areas and the two largest democracies on the planet are joining forces in the interests of both Americans and Europeans. That said, the agreement will not be concluded at any price. We cannot abandon our health standards. We cannot abandon our social norms. We cannot abandon our data protection requirements. I do not want data protection to be part of the negotiation with our American friends. And I would not want us to set up secret parallel courts. We are spaces of law, and in the United States as in Europe, we apply the law and ensure that these negotiations are surrounded by maximum transparency. I say this: \"If we do not publish the relevant documents, I am not talking about the documents that deal with the negotiating strategy, this agreement will fail. It will fail in front of our public opinion, it will fail in this Parliament and it will fail in our national parliaments should there ever be a joint agreement. So let's be more transparent because we have nothing to hide. Let's not give the impression of having to hide something. Let's not hide anything, let's make the relevant documents transparent. (Applause) The European Union is a union of value. We are credible to the rest of the world if we are demanding inwardly in terms of fundamental values. I will appoint a commissioner who will be responsible for enforcing the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I would like the European Union to reach the members of the Council of Europe's European Convention on Human Rights as soon as possible.  The anti-discrimination directive will remain on the table and I will try to convince the Council to adopt it as soon as possible, at least in its broad outline.  Immigration and migration, legal immigration, illegal immigration are subjects that, almost on a daily basis, occupy our citizens. We need a common asylum policy and I will propose a common asylum policy.  (Applause) We need to reflect on the legal immigration that Europe, in the next five years, will sorely need. We do as well as the United States, Canada and Australia. We can do what they have always been able to do. (Protests) I thought there would be moments of excitement at this place of my speech and I had seen right... Let's protect our external borders, and fight against criminal gangs who make money with the misfortune of others. Let us help those who come to us before they take the boat across the Mediterranean and make sure that a better solidarity is established between the north and the south of Europe. Illegal immigration, the problem of refugees are not the problems of Malta, Cyprus, Italy and Greece, these are the problems of Europe as a whole. (Applause) Zur Auenpolitik, Herr President, mechte ich keine groen Worte verlieren. Aber Auenpolitik, eine gemeinsame Auen- und Sicherheitspolitik, brauchen wir dringend. Mir wre es recht - und ich werde dafar sorgen , dass der oder die Au-enbeauftragte nicht mehr von den europeischen Au-enministern ausgebremst wird. Eine gemeinsame Auenpolitik braucht auch eine einheitliche Darstellung nach auen. (Beifall) Der oder die Auenbeauftragte, die ein weites Arbeitsfeld ihr Eigen nennt, wird von anderen sektoriell zust-ndigen Kommissaren unterst-tzt werden. In Sachen Verteidigung geht es mir nicht darum, die European Union als Gegenentwurf zur NATO zu etablieren. Beide messen zusammen arbeiten und zusammen atmen. Aber im Verteidigungsbereich brauchen wir verst-rkte Zusammenarbeit, so wie der Lissabon-Vertrag dies ja auch vorsieht. Und wir brauchen vor allem in Sachen Beschaffungswesen mehr Zusammenarbeit, anstatt dass wir gegeneinander das beschaffen, was wir alle gemeinsam brauchen. Es wird in den nechsten fenf Jahren kein neues Mitglied zur European Union hinzustoen. Aus heutiger Sicht ist es unvorstellbar, dass eines der Kandidatenlander, mit denen wir verhandeln, die Beitrittskriterien allesamt und im Detail bis zum Jahr 2019 wird erf-llen kunnen. Aber die Verhandlungen werden weitergef-hrt. Und andere europeische Nationen, andere europeische Lunder, brauchen eine glaubw-rdige, ehrlich gemeinte europeische Perspektive. Dies gilt vor allem fer die Lunder of the westlichen Balkans, denn diese tragische Region Europas braucht die europeische Persepektive. Ansonsten werden die alten donmonen wieder wach. (Beifall) I would have liked to talk to you, Mr President, about the necessary industrial policy that we need to put in place in Europe to increase the relative share of industry in European GDP to a value of 20%. I would have to speak in more detail about Ukraine, which I would like to greet the people today and tell them that we believe that this people are European and that they have a place in Europe. (Applause) I would have liked to explain in detail why I think it is necessary for us in all the countries of the European Union to introduce minimum social wages and minimum incomes for integration or guaranteed minimum incomes. We will do that.  I would have liked to express my conviction that services of general interest and public services must be safeguarded and cannot be at the mercy of the whims of the time. Let's defend public service in Europe. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to have told you about Africa, this Africa so often unhappy and so often forgotten, but this resource-rich And, in particular, resource-rich Africa. Let us not forget Africa and ensure that this scandal, this tragedy, this tragedy every day repeated, that every six seconds a man starves and that we lose twenty-five thousand children a day because they are hungry. As long as twenty-five thousand children are starving every day, Europe has not completed its work. Europe is responsible for changing this situation. (Applause) Yes, Mr President, we will have to make a fresh start, we will have to hear from those who spoke to us on 25 May. But this is not the time for revolution and the time is not for counter-revolution either. If we want Europeans to fall in love with their Europe again, let us tell them that we are proud of Europe. Let us tell them that we are proud of many of the things we have achieved over the past decades. It is often said that the question between war and peace no longer arises. However, the unsealed dialogue between war and peace remains a European subject. We have just discovered on the periphery of the European Union that peace is not a permanent visitor to the European continent. Let us be proud of the generation of our fathers and mothers, the generation of our grandmothers and grandfathers who, back from the battlefields and concentration camps, have made this eternal post-war prayer \"never again war\", a political program that has so far had beneficial effects.  (Applause) We are indebted to our parents. (Great applause) Let us be proud of having been able, during the 1990s, to succeed in enlargement, to have reconciled European history and geography and to have put an end to this disastrous post-war decree which called for Europe to be divided into two parts forever. We have reunited the geography and European history without weapons but with conviction. So I would like to pay tribute to those who, in Central and Eastern Europe, one day decided to take history into their own hands, to no longer suffer history but to make history themselves. Let us cease to talk about old and new Member States. There are member states, neither new nor old. (Great applause) And let us be proud to have set up the single currency. The single currency does not divide Europe. The single currency protects Europe.  (Protests then covered by applause) Mr President, I was Finance Minister in my country for 20 years. Every six months, I had to go to Brussels to see monetary realignments. Every six months I experienced \"live and in colour\" how dangerous monetary disorder was for the European economy. I have experienced many times the loss of dignity of a state which, for lack of being competitive, had to devalue. I have witnessed with bitterness terrible scenes where those who had to increase the external value of their currency did not want it, because losing the markets, and where those who had to devalue did not dare to do so because fearing a massive incursion, a disorderly return of inflation. If during the events in Ukraine, if during the economic and financial crisis, which hit us and which made Europe the epicentre of a global battle, we were still in the European monetary system, Europe today would be in a monetary war. France versus Germany. Germany versus Italy. Italy against Portugal and Spain. All against all. The euro, its discipline and ambitions ensure that we know a monetary order that protects us. The euro protects Europe. (Exclamations: 'What about Greece?') Mr President, Greece did not want to leave the currency area and we did not want Greece to leave that area. (Great applause) (Interjection from the floor: 'And Spain?') What about Britain? I am defending the single currency because the single currency is protecting Europe, its economy and its citizens. (Applause) Mr President, if we had not done what we have done in the past decades, if we had not made Europe a continent of peace, if we had not reconciled European history and geography, if we had not set up the single currency and if we had not built the world's largest internal market in Europe. , what situation would we find ourselves in today?  (Exclamations) We'd be unengradable, unarmed. We'd be weakened. We would be unarmed today and Europe, thanks to the work and convictions of our predecessors, is a continent that ensures that those who live there can live in peace and relative well-being. (The President interrupts the speaker) (Great applause) Mr President, I do not want a Europe that occupies the stands of history. I do not want a Europe that observes others when they do, when they act and when they move forward. I would like a Europe that occupies the middle of the field, a Europe that plays forward, a Europe that wins, a Europe that protects, that exists, a Europe that is a model for others. To do so, let us draw inspiration from the principles and convictions bequeathed to us by the great Europeans who were there when we were not yet anywhere.  I want to pay tribute here to Jacques Delors, the great President of the Commission. (Vis applause) It is not Delors who wants, but Delors is my friend and my master and his work will inspire me every day. I want to pay tribute here to François Mitterrand, who said that nationalism leads to war. François Mitterrand was right. (Live applause and protests) I also want to pay tribute to Helmut Kohl who was in my lifetime the greatest European I have been fortunate enough to know. (Great applause) Let's do what they do. They had patience. They had courage. They had determination. Let's have the same courage, have the same determination, have the same patience. Let us have the patience, this courage, this determination imposed by long journeys and great ambitions.  We can do great things together for Europe, for its citizens, for the world, mr President, ladies and gentlemen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr Juncker, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for the work he has Today is a good day for Europe. The European institutions have shown in recent weeks that we are fully capable of acting. In the European elections, the citizens voted for the future of Europe, for more democracy, for reform, for growth. In the European Parliament, despite the social consequences of the great economic and financial crisis, we are relying on a majority of constructive forces to shape Europe's future. With this election, we have also made Europe a great deal more democratic. It is a historic day. For the first time, voters have been able to have a direct say in the top of the European Commission. Certainly not everyone has done that yet, but it is a first important start. One can find or criticize the concept of the leading candidates. But Democrats should agree on one thing: It is generally better to tell voters before the election where they want to go, what personnel they want to do with, than to say it after the election. (Applause) We have come a step closer to this principle. That is a good thing, and no one will be able to turn that back. Today is a good day for Europe, and as chairman of the group I can of course also say that it is a good day for my group and for my party. A candidate from the European People's Party is due to vote today. Let me remind you that all programme countries – Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland – are governed by the European People's Party. There were wage cuts, pension cuts, social benefits being cut back, taxes were increased. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has had to explain many unpleasant decisions to the citizens. We have demanded a lot from people. On the other hand, EPP governments – for example in Finland, Luxembourg or Germany – have had to explain to people the need for solidarity, the need for bailouts. During the election campaign, the difficult decisions of recent years were attacked by many. We – the European People's Party – and Jean-Claude Juncker have also defended these decisions and appealed to the people for their necessity. This has not been easy, and yet the European People's Party is once again the strongest group in the European Parliament. Jean-Claude Juncker won the election. He is the right man at the right time. (Applause) Jean-Claude Juncker is a candidate of the European People's Party, yes, but he is today seeking the approval of the entire European Parliament. We know that the principle of democracy is compromise. The ideas of the other constructive forces in the European Parliament must also be heard. Jean-Claude Juncker has been elected on his EPP programme, but Jean-Claude Juncker stands for consensus in this European Parliament. He also has the support of his group, the PPE-DE. There has been much talk of reform, of change, of departure. The tasks have been clearly defined. For the GROUP of European Democrats, the following four points are central: firstly, we need growth. Europe must become competitive. We need a reindustrialisation of our continent. Secondly, we must continue on the road to a stability union. Debt does not create a future, debt destroys the future. Thirdly, we need more respect for the national levels, especially our colleagues in the national parliaments. Fourthly, after the years of crisis, Europe must turn its attention to the outside world, on refugee policy or when it comes to partnership with our friends in Ukraine. Four priorities, which I would like to emphasise once again from the point of view of the PPE-DE. However, I do not want to use my speaking time to discuss this content in detail. We have plenty of opportunity to do so over the next five years. I would like to use my speaking time today to express two central ideas on culture and how to deal with our Europe. First of all, I would like to take up a thought by Jean-Claude Juncker and underline once again: we are talking about change and we must be aware that many people on our continent see change and reform as a threat rather than an opportunity, rather afraid when we talk about change. That is why it is important to win people over to this path of change on our continent. One thing is important to me: we must be aware that today we are living in a time when a plethora of fundamental changes are taking place at the same time. One 00 00 years ago, industrialization was a formative process, a great change that caused winners and losers in the society that changed the world at the time. Today, we live in a time when fundamental change is taking place in a diversity like never before. Think of the Demographics. Today, 15% of Europeans are over 65. By 2050, it will not be 15%, but 25%. More pensioners, less innovative power, will change our continent. Think of globalisation. Prosperity is being redistributed in this world at a breathtaking rate. Globalisation is making the states of Europe smaller. In 2040 – in 26 years' time – no European state is likely to be able to take a seat at the G7 summit, according to economic data. That says it all. Think of ecology, of climate change. Think about the question of digitization, how we keep in touch with friends, how we shop. Everything changes through digitalization. We see the advantages, but let us be honest: do we already have the disadvantages of this development under control? A plethora of fundamental changes is taking place at the same time. I think it is important that we explain this to the people, that we tell people that, because the prerequisite is that there is openness to change, to reform. Reforms are needed to preserve Europe's way of life, to upend our values, so that we can secure the extraordinary that makes Europe safe for future generations. And we must also make one thing clear: those who cling to existing structures, who are not prepared for change, will lose. This is also shown by a look at our Europe today. Where courageous politicians have carried out reforms, people are better off, there is a future. It is precisely in the Central and Eastern European Member States that we Europeans can learn this best. Since the collapse of totalitarian communism, much, enormous things have been turned around and changed there. You, ladies and gentlemen from these countries, know better than we from the West and southern Europe that stalemate and clinging means a step backwards. That is why I am advocating this understanding: clinging means regression, openness to reform, change means the future. Let us encourage people, let us make people want something new! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which I would like to introduce a second central idea: reform, objectivity – Europe must be thought pragmatically. That is what is currently being demanded on land, from now on. However, this has also made Europe more technical. People perceive a cold apparatus of Europe. Honestly, I don't just want to be pragmatic. I want to be able to have ideas for Europe again in the next few years. I would like to be able to rejoice in our Europe again in the coming years. I want to shape Europe's future. What do I mean by that? In my youth, when I began to be interested in politics, I read a lot about the European idea, about the founding fathers of Europe. On the rubble of the Second World War, there were people who said: I want to create a continent that creates peace. I want a continent that reaches out to the archenemy. I want a continent that defeats nationalism and totalitarianism, which is returning to its historical roots. Or I want a continent without border controls, a common market, a coexistence in diversity – on the rubble of world war II. A whole generation of politicians, from the left or the right, dreamed the unthinkable at the time. Today, one might say: what illusionists were they then? But they made the impossible possible, they won. And today? Ladies and gentlemen, today: Sixpack, Stabi Pact, MiFid Directive, Agricultural Reform and, and, and. All this is important. But is that enough? Europe has so much to offer! Britain, for example, is the motherland of parliamentary democracy. It gave us Europeans this idea. Today, the whole of Europe is proud of its parliamentary tradition. Or France: yesterday was national holiday – with the idea of freedom, equality, fraternity, developing human rights, especially equality between men and women. Developed in France, given to the entire continent. Today, we Europeans are proud of the Charter of Fundamental Rights that make us. In Germany: the Reformation, which enforced the separation of state and religion. Today European acquis. Greece, with its philosophy, Rome has given us the right. Without it, The culture of Europe would be unthinkable. And the great seafaring nations of Portugal and Spain have discovered the world. Each country has its own historical experience. And we have worked out a great deal together in Europe. Today, these achievements are a common European acquis. We Europeans have achieved this, each with his contribution and each depends on the other. Ladies and gentlemen, my vision of Europe refers precisely to these achievements. Globally, democracy, human rights and the separation of state and religion are not a matter of course. I always imagine when the world's big countries meet at the G20 summit and talk about world trade, for example: who raises his hand and says: yes, trade. But we must ban child labour, for example. Do the Indians do that? Does that make Brazil? No, we Europeans must do it. Who raises his hand when the question arises that we are fighting climate change? Does the US do that, does China do it? No, we Europeans must do it. And who, at these great summits, reminds the world that conflicts must first be resolved peacefully? Do the Russians do this, do the US do it? No, we Europeans must bring this in. That is my wish for today's young generation: a Europe that is proud of its great achievements in the history of the spirit, a Europe that ceases to wrestle with itself and is aware of its responsibilities in the world, a Europe that embodies this self-confidence and bears the commonground. If we live ideas today, then we should make people want to be Europeans! Anchored, rooted in the region in which one grew up, proud of one's own nation and aware that we Europeans have something to contribute to the development of the world. Europe, do not forget your task, this world needs the European contribution! Ladies and gentlemen, finally, can we perhaps love Europe, this continent, beyond the many contents, perhaps even a little bit? Europe with its landscapes: Wales, Tuscany, the Masuria. Europe with its proud cities: Rome, Athens, Budapest. Europe with its culture: the whole world visits our museums, our operas are performed all over the world, and today's European cultural scene is of richness and abundance like nowhere else. Europe is unspeakably rich, so diverse, so vibrant. I feel very comfortable on this continent as a Bavarian, as a German European. I like being European. And I believe that it is important to convey the emotional side to our citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, let us get to work, to kick off today, give Jean-Claude Juncker a strong mandate so that he can do his job! I and we in the Group of the European People's Party want us, together with him, to reduce the problems and concerns of the people of Europe, for Europe to do its job and simply to deliver it. And I want us to be able to have ideas beyond pragmatic everyday life, just as the founding generation did – ideas, a vision of the future of a united Europe in diversity, proud of its origins, proud of its nation, but also grateful to be Europeans.

There is war in Gaza, yet another war that causes thousands of civilian casualties. We must stop this war! No one can close their eyes or look somewhere else. The war re-emerges at Europe's borders: in Syria, a few kilometres from Cyprus; in Libya, in the south of Italy; in Gaza; but also in Ukraine in the heart of Europe. Well, the war we thought we'd exorcised forever is back and evokes ancient demons. It reminds us of Srebrenica, whose anniversary we are celebrating these days. But war, this war, is a mirror for us because it recalls the profound meaning – as Mr Weber has just said – of the profound meaning, the raison d' er of the European project. The European Union is certainly an economic and monetary union and also a banking union, but it is something more, it is a project of civilisation, peace and solidarity. As the first action of this new legislature we must work to impose a ceasefire and a humanitarian assistance plan for Gaza. Europe will not be itself unless it has found the message of peace for which it was born. My first thoughts are with the thousands of victims of the Gaza war. Mr President, five years ago José Manuel Barroso was in the same room. The crisis had begun a few months ago and many already foretold its end. Five years later – as you have honestly pointed out – the crisis is still there, Europe is mired in deep stagnation. There is a risk of deflation, unemployment and poverty have increased, a whole generation has lost hope in the future. Mr Juncker, you often speak – because you are a man of great culture – about the history of our European continent. I too believe that history is important and I believe that we must learn from the mistakes of recent years, from the mistakes that led us to this crisis. The first mistake is ancient, it is the same as the crisis of 1929 and it is called austerity. In the face of a demand crisis, we should have revived investment, which would create growth. Faced with the emergence of new poverty, we should have reformed and supported our social protection systems. Instead, in the name of an accounting vision, investment has been cut, social spending has been reduced and the growth potential of our economies has been reduced. No one wants to spread public spending indiscriminately, assistance. However, the right balance must be struck between consolidating public finances and supporting large-term investments. On the other hand, some people seem obsessed with the idea of tidying up public accounts. But I ask myself and I ask you: where is the order when one in two young people is unemployed? Where is the order when the poverty rate is growing at an exponential rate? Is the order of public accounts or the order of society, the order of our lives, more important? The great lesson of this crisis is that the rules – as you said in your report – all rules, including budgetary rules, must serve the lives of our citizens. The second lesson is that we in Europe are interdependent. Our societies and economies are linked to two strands, fibrillation in a financial market is quickly passed on to other markets. The immigrants arriving in Lampedusa today will probably be the marginalised in our suburbs, in the major European cities from Madrid to London, to Paris, to Berlin, to Rome. This interdependence imposes responsibility, solidarity and sharing on all of us. The third lesson is that we need more democracy. If we are mired in this crisis, it is also because – let us face it, Mr Juncker – dozens and dozens of intergovernmental summits have proved inconclusive and have produced confusing and ineffective decisions. We need a stronger democracy in the European Union. If we support you today, Mr Juncker, how do we support you? It is because we think that you have learned from these lessons, especially from the demand for more democracy. If you are here today, it is also because a small revolution has taken place in Europe in recent weeks. For the first time since the birth of the Union, the President of the Commission has been elected taking into account the votes of the citizens. This brand marks the advent of parliamentary democracy and is an irreversible step. If there had not been the obstinacy and tenacity of this Parliament, you, Mr Juncker, probably could not have become President of the European Commission. Our vote in favour of you today is not a blank cheque. We were very pleased with some of the references in his speech to the Social issues and the social market economy, which you have emphasized very much, belongs to the culture of European socialists, democrats and progressives. But we know that you are not a socialist and we do not ask you as a condition to become one – even if never say never in life. We did not win the elections, your party won, and it is right that you should be the candidate for president of the Commission. In the coming months, with the hearing of the Commissioners, we will check the compatibility between our programmes and those of the future Commission and we will be intransigent. Parliament's democratic control over the Commission will be strengthened, the debate on the state of the Union will no longer be an exercise in rhetoric, but will become an annual political review of the Commission's actions. Our support for you is not simply an obligatory homage to the new parliamentary democracy. In the last few days, as you know, we have negotiated and presented our priorities to you, as it should have been. We have called for more investment to create growth, a more social Europe, more solidarity with regard, above all, to immigration. You have given answers to our requests this morning, both in the document you have presented to us and in the report you have given us in your speech, which have convinced us. We asked you for figures and concrete commitments. You gave us the figures and also gave us a deadline. He said $300 billion for an investment plan that creates wealth, growth and new jobs and talked about starting in February 2015. You have cleared industrial policy, a word that has long been considered taboo by the liberal. Here, too, there are figures as it commits to bringing the weight of industry on European GDP to 20% by 2020. On social Europe, there are clear commitments to the fight against social dumping, through a revision of the posting of workers directive to establish the principle that the same work in the same place must be remunerated at the same wage. You are also committed to combating fiscal dumping, through the adoption at European level of a common corporate tax base and decisive support for the financial transaction tax. Your programme supports the overcoming of the troika which has done so badly to Greece and the countries subject to financial assistance. It also accepts our request to assess the social impact of national reform programmes and resumes our battle to adopt the anti-discrimination directive, which is currently covered up by unacceptable vetoes, as soon as possible. In his program there is also one of our workhorses: the refinancing and extension to as many girls and boys as possible of the Youth Guarantee. Before the negotiations these points were not in your programme and we are proud of these achievements and we are therefore voting for them. Much remains to be done on many other subjects. We would have liked more clarity on flexibility. You merely recall the Council's position on this matter. We welcome your approach to the likely appointment of a Socialist member as Ecofin Commissioner, but that is not enough. We will be intransigent on flexibility. We believe that those countries which promote ambitious reforms and invest in knowledge and knowledge should not be strangled by accountancy budgetary rules. We want the rules to be respected – let us be clear – but to be at the service of growth. We would have liked more courage on the directive on parental leave, because we need to put European women in a position to reconcile work and family life. We would have liked to see more reference to environmental sustainability in our development model, which must take charge of the care of the planet today. We would have liked to have paid more attention to human capital, knowledge and talent, which represent Europe's true riches. We're not going to let our guard down. We are loyal and demanding interlocutors, we have no right to error. If conservatism and inaction prevail, in five years' time we will be faced with an impoverished, afraid, divided and missionless Europe. That Europe would be doomed to decline. Instead, we can join forces and put Europe back, through our work, at the service of the message of solidarity, union and peace for which it was born. On this path we, from different positions and stories, extend your hand, we give you confidence. It is now up to you not to betray this confidence in the next five years. We will monitor you closely.

It needs leadership to drive it; leadership that looks forward, not back; leadership that recognises the challenges of the 2050s – not those of 1950s; leadership that understands the concerns of the people of Europe, who want a Europe of cooperation – not a Europe of centralisation. If you put forward an agenda that opens markets, tears down barriers and decentralises power, then we will stand with you. But if you espouse an old, tired, backward-looking agenda, we will simply offer constructive, positive alternatives. Many of us are looking for you to clarify your position, Mr Juncker. In last week’s hearings in the political groups on issues such as euro-federalism, maternity leave and budgetary rigour, you told the ECR one thing and seemed to tell the other groups another. We need the real Mr Junker to stand up and tell us what you really believe. But in reality, you know and we know that none of this really matters. The deal has been done; the spoils have been shared out. The election which was supposed to end all backroom deals has resulted in the mother of all backroom deals. You know, and we know, that you are likely to be the next President of the Commission. Mr Juncker, we wish you well, but members of my political group will not be able to vote for your today for two reasons: firstly we do not subscribe to the process that brought you here; we do not believe that you have an EU-wide mandate that stretches across all 28 Member States. Secondly, members of my group are not yet convinced that you are the right man to lead the charge for European reform. I hope that, over the next few years, you will prove us wrong. The question I want to put to you is this: do you want your Commission to be the last of an old era or the first of a new era? That is the crux of the leadership we would like to see. We need leadership to reform the budget for a new era, moving away from the idea that a bigger budget means a better budget. Instead, let us have a better budget, to invest – and facilitate investment – in infrastructure, technology and research. Let our children inherit a vibrant economy built for their future. They must not inherit the large debts built up in the past. Instead of focusing on how to raise money from our own resources, let us lead a debate towards how we spend taxpayers’ money better. That is why my group would like to see a dedicated commissioner for budgetary control. We need leadership to build a single market fit for the new era. Yet eight years since the Services Directive, a single market in services is still far from reality. Why do we not sit down with the digital entrepreneurs and ask them about the barriers they face – and then let us tear them down. It is time we delivered a single market for all. Let us look at the energy market and together identify and remove blockages in it; create incentives for consumers to promote energy efficiency, and ensure investment in energy security, new energy sources and more interconnectors to reduce our dependence on regimes in the Middle East and Russia. We need leadership to deliver trade and international development policies fit for a new era: more open, and yet more transparent trade agreements with fast growing economies, but also international development programmes to promote property rights, legal and financial systems, support for entrepreneurs in poorer countries to create wealth and jobs for local people in their countries.  We need leadership to promote better regulations that are fit for a new era; talk to businesses of all sizes directly and ask them what stops them from creating extra jobs, what stops them from creating that growth. We need leadership to address the underlying weaknesses in the eurozone; the significant productivity gaps that are inflicting job losses and crippling levels of youth unemployment in southern Europe. Now, with the euro, many Member States have lost the instrument of exchange rates to address these problems. As a result, we have seen burdens passed from banks to taxpayers, treaties broken and untold state intervention. (Scattered applause) We need leadership on immigration in order to restore people’s faith in both the principle of free movement of those workers who wish to work and contribute to their new host countries, as well as in controlled migration which respects the rights of all Member States – both those welcoming new workers, and those Member States who are losing their youngest and brightest talents to other countries. Mr Juncker, today I have only outlined a few examples of where leadership is needed to build an EU fit for a new era; to build an EU fit for the century ahead of us, not the century behind us; leadership to address the fears and suspicions of our voters towards the EU’s direction; leadership which seeks to fulfil people’s hopes and aspirations for the future. Sadly, Mr Juncker, members of my group do not feel able to vote for you today. But where you put forward an agenda which leads the EU towards the future – to the challenges of a new era – then you will be able to look to us for support in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I think that we can say that it is an historic day. Not because of all the rhetoric we have heard this morning, but because we stand here to elect the President of the Commission and not, as was the case until now, by mainly rubber-stamping the choice of the Council. We participated in that both of us, dear Jean-Claude. This time it is the voters in fact who have the last word and I think that by voting for Mr Juncker today – let us say it, let us say it openly, it is difficult for a certain part of this Parliament to accept it – but by doing so we establish once and for all real European democracy in which the voters are deciding what is happening … (Applause) … and it is not by accident that it is happening. It is the result of the long, long way that we have walked together, it is the result of the Convention we established in 2001 and – let me say it very openly – it is also the result of the perseverance of a number of parliamentarians, of at least two dedicated Europeans that I want to mention today in this debate: Andrew Duff and Elmar Brok, Andrew who is no longer here and Elmar who will always be here in my opinion. But I have to tell you for once he is not here. Normally he is always there – on 199 – but they are still fighting with each other about who in fact invented this proposal in the Convention to elect the Commission by the European Parliament. So my first message of today – I have to tell you, Jean-Claude – is not so much for you. My message today is for those Members, mainly in the big groups, who intend to vote against you. And I want to tell these people in these two big groups, and maybe in other groups, that by doing so what they are doing is intending to side with the anti-Europeans. In fact failing their voters, because what their voters are asking – that is their choice, and the choice made by them fell on Mr Juncker – should be followed. I find the irony of today is that today in fact the anti-Europeans like Mr Kamall would deny the choice of the voters and apparently prefer the old system of backroom deals which Mr Cameron likes so much. So today by voting for you we are giving a clear green light because you have taken on board a number of our proposals. The main proposal is that we have to stop this choice of what I call ‘austerity or growth’ – as though there was an opposition between them. Everybody knows that we need both of them and after five years I hope that you will lead a Commission doing both – that is fiscal discipline on the one hand and a growth pact on the other hand. Because we all know that without fiscal discipline, without respect for the Stability Pact, there is no growth possible in the medium term and we have to accept that. On the other hand we know also that if we want to have growth we have to go beyond the fiscal discipline and we have to have a growth package, as has been proposed now in your programme. The second reason, Mr Juncker, why we are pleased with your programme and we shall support you, is that you also say a number of things on migration, legal migration – finally we are talking about that; it was a forbidden area in the European Union until now – and also about values, and that you will entrust a Commissioner with specific responsibility for the rule of law. However, I have to contradict you on one thing, and that is, whatever the diversity of our constitutional systems or our cultural traditions, fundamental rights are fundamental. We cannot discuss them. If they are fundamental values everybody has to respect them, whatever the traditions are in the European Union.  And the third commitment that you are making, and it was an important point for us, is the fact that you will have a real gender-balanced Commission, and let us hope that you can also achieve that goal. Finally, Mr Juncker, I want to ask you three things because you will now be leading the Commission. Three things: first of all, return – you have said it yourself – to the Community method, because all the intergovernmental arrangements we have made in the last five years were not an example of good governance for Europe. Secondly, my most important point, please don’t do as your predecessor did: use your right of initiative. Don’t start to phone Berlin, Paris and then London and Rome before putting a legislative package on the table of the Council and the Parliament. Do it because your Commission is ready to do it, has the courage to do it and not because there is a decision of the European Council. And do not listen only to the European Council. From time to time – why not every day? – listen to the European Parliament too, because we are equal as an institution. And finally, create again a vision for Europe. That we need. You feel that when you see a number of people, they are lost in Europe, because the vision is no longer there. Create the vision that it is only by more integration of the European Union that we can emerge from the crisis, like we did in the 80s. And if you are doing that I can tell you that you will find us by your side all the way. All 68, Mr Commissioner.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, I would like to thank mr Juncker for his excellent work and for his excellent work. I am always reluctant to disagree. That's a bit of my guy. But to the general euphoria that we are dealing with a historic day today, I would like to pour at least a few drops into the wine, because I simply do not believe that. I think it has been a step to say: yes, the elections to the European Parliament should also influence who will lead the European Commission in the future. I say no, however, if it now suggests that this is the great victory of democracy. We are at the beginning. Above all, we are at the beginning because far too little has been done with this small first step in recent weeks and months in order to really credibly suggest a democratic development here in the European Union. It is said that a victory has been achieved, and at the same time democracy is reduced to a smattering of posts, to the structure of power between institutions, to the supremacy of the grand coalition. In my view, however, the facade democracy that Habermas spoke of is at best crumbling, and the facade does not collapse. What it takes is to really build democracy from the bottom up and develop it. We need to look more closely at the election result. It is not that the Conservatives won the election. More than three and a half times as many people in the European Union have not voted for the Conservatives – and I am really only talking about those who either did not go to the polls or who, because of the development of the European Union in recent years and the impact that this has had on their own lives, they choose not to promote a future of the European Union, but to say: back to the national answer, back to the national question, which, in my view, is very dangerous. All of us – and this is actually the truth – have lost this election, all those who believe and want the European Union to become a union of democracy, of social justice, of solidarity, for the European Union to be a real force for peace, for the European Union to play a different role in foreign policy, to actually live what was originally formulated as an ideal, as a vision, and that people do not always identify with it. But what happened after the 25th  May happened here is exactly the opposite. That is why I warn against too much euphoria. We have a great deal to do – and to do so as democrats – to ensure that the European Union actually has a vision for the future for the people, and for everyone. The message that was conveyed to the electorate during the election campaign, in the weeks, months, years before, also during the election campaign, was: there is no alternative – no alternative to the policy of market radicalism, the rigid cuts in public finances, the destruction of the developed social models in the EU, the privatisation of public services, the liberalisation, deregulation of social systems and also ecological standards, to subordination to the interests of the European and global organised economy. This is the revival of the former British Prime Minister's famous mantra of \"There is no alternative.\" However, the number of people who have been guided by other ideas – these very people have been pushed in the head, and more and more of them have also withdrawn – is the great challenge that we are facing and which you, Mr Juncker, are also facing and which we believe should be used really intensively. You should take advantage of the question of what caesura you stand for in the European Commission's policy. It cannot be a 'continuing like this' – but that is obviously also the image that is now being conveyed to us – in following the direction of development of the European Union to date. We expect clear answers from you on the changed role of the European Commission in the Troika. We are not content with your saying that the troika should become a democratic instrument. What does that mean? It cannot just be the participation of parliaments. Nor can it be a question of the troika continuing to carry out a policy by which it itself interferes with the constitutional reality of so-called programme states. This has nothing to do with democracy! When people destroy the realities of life, it has nothing to do with democracy! So how do you want to live up to this responsibility? What should come instead? It is not enough simply to say: 'The International Monetary Fund must get out'. What answers do you have – and therefore also with regard to the Commission's role in the troika – on the debt issue, on a debt audit, on the assessment of debt, on debt cuts? How do you want to deal with this? You have also talked a lot – and I am very open to you on this – about the fact that you will place a much greater emphasis on social priorities. We like to hear that, of course. But we have heard this too many times in recent years, we have heard it over and over again. We want to know specifically: how are you going to do this? You are talking about the minimum wage in the Member States. We think that is important. But is this a minimum wage that is poverty-friendly? Are these minimum standards, minimum social standards that are poverty-friendly and prevent poverty? That will be the crucial point. Before I conclude, perhaps one more comment: we have had you in our group. You have answered or not answered questions. However, as has been pointed out time and again, we expect you, as the head of the Commission, to be much more involved in the specific major problems within the European Union. I am thinking in particular, for example, of the situation in Cyprus. Who, if not you, must start talking to Turkey? I also expect this to be the same for the ukraine and Russia issue. You talked about not allowing Russia bashing - we will support you. We need a Europe that includes all states. We do not need new separations. Mr Juncker, we will not elect you as a group. They will not get our vote today. But we will measure what you do on a daily basis, and where you advocate for improved people's living conditions, we will support you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when twenty-seven million citizens, including six million young people, are not only unemployed, but have no prospect of employment. When 25% of Europeans, or one in four Europeans, are below the poverty line and social exclusion, when 10% of us own 60% of the collective wealth of Europeans, it is the very existence of our societies that is at stake. Dear friends, when the climate deteriorates to the point where we could envisage an increase in global temperatures of more than 6 degrees, when 30% of the world's non-renewable resources have been used in the last thirty years, when a third of the species still alive are threatened with extinction by 2050, it is the very existence of our societies that is threatened. Colleagues, when democratically elected governments are subjected to the daily blackmail of both financial markets and the dictatorship or permanent blackmail of financial institutions deemed too big to be allowed to go bankrupt; when increasingly unelected experts influence, or even write, directly the laws that will apply to all, when in the name of freedom or profit sometimes our privacy and freedoms are called into question, democracy is at stake.  I will say, dear friends, that time is running out. So, will Jean-Claude Juncker be the man? Will you be the man of a union, of a true fiscal union? Because there is no sustainable public finances without controlled spending or sustainable revenue. When a trillion euros escape the public treasury every year through the magic of tax competition, opacity and money laundering, clearly, the soundness of our public finances is at stake. There is no future for a single currency without financial solidarity within this monetary zone.  Will you be the man of a social union? A social union that replaces the dogma of competition between our social protection systems and replaces it with a convergence of our social protection systems? So let us start by setting up wages and minimum incomes across the European Union and finally abolish this initiative that many of you like here and which is called REFIT, which, under the guise of involvement and the elimination of bureaucracy, aims to reduce our social and environmental standards, and all without an American treaty.  Will you be the man of an energy union that is anything other than a gas-buying union, but which is truly the instrument of an industrial policy which, through renewables, energy efficiency and the networking of our energy distribution networks, makes Europe the world champion of greening the economy? Will you be the man of a Europe that, at last, speaks with one voice - and which is not the laughing stock of Vladimir Putin by his action in Ukraine or considered a negligible quantity by all parties and, unfortunately, there are many - to the multiple conflicts of the Middle East?  I will end with the question that seems fundamental to me: will you be the man of a re-democratisation not only of the European institutions but of Europe? Today, it is above all that is being questioned by our fellow citizens. It is about ensuring that our parliaments - not only the European Parliament but national parliaments - are really involved in political decision-making. It is a question of the social interlocutors being involved whenever it comes to matters that concern them. It is also about ensuring that our citizens are more and more directly involved. We have the European Citizens' Initiative, we need a much more participatory democracy. It is, of course, a matter of ensuring that lobbyists of all kinds are referred to their business, that is, the defence of their particular interests. It is not for them to write the laws. Will you be that man? We'd tend, if you'd listen to, to believe it. I sincerely say that. I knew you in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs; I followed you; we are not exactly the same age, but we would tend to believe you. But we also cannot forget who are the supporters of you today? I must note that the three main political families that support you today, in any case, who will support you, are also the political families that have been in power in Europe for decades. If they wanted to do something else, I think we would have seen it before. Besides, I can't help but make the connection with what I heard yesterday from Mario Draghi within Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. For his part, I have heard only one thing: structural reforms, cutting public spending, reducing taxes, increasing labour market flexibility. Obviously for this gentleman, the things that happened on May 25 have no meaning. In conclusion, I will tell you that we are divided. Because for many of us, the mechanism that brought you before us today is clearly a modest but real step towards a more democratic Europe. I will be careful - and Gabrielle Zimmer is right - to make it the democratic revolution that will, by magic, make Europe a democratic institution, but it is a step in that direction. And so for that a number of us want to support you. But it is true that another important part of our group does not trust, wonders when seeing who supports you today and wonders if you will be able to give flesh to the radical changes that Europe needs. In any event, whatever the outcome of the vote, Mr Juncker, know that every time your Commission tables in this House proposals that respond to the challenges of our time, which want to make Europe once again an area of shared prosperity, an area of sustainable prosperity and a democratic space, we will be by your side.

We are told that as a result of the European elections, Mr Juncker here is the nominee. Well I can tell you that absolutely nobody in the United Kingdom knew that when they voted in the European elections it had anything to do with the next nominee. The truth of it is that no voters in any of the countries actually realised what this process was. Mr Juncker’s name did not appear on any single ballot paper. The whole thing has been the most extraordinary stitch-up. The loser, Mr Schulz, gets the consolation prize of being an unprecedented second-term President in Parliament. It is all just a pretence that we are increasing democracy. Of course, I will be told ‘ah yes, but hang on a second, the European Parliament, the elected bit of the European institutions, did actually have a say and did decide whether Mr Juncker was to become Commission President or not’. Well, let us just have a think about the process we are about to engage in.  We are all going to be asked to vote – and we have got one candidate to vote for! It is like good old Soviet times, isn’t it? Surely, democracy means you get rather more of a choice than one. But far worse than that is that it is going to be a secret ballot. You really could not invent it, could you? Hard on the heels of European elections, our voters are not going to know how any of us have voted. I would say to you Mr Schulz, as President of the Parliament, that Parliament should not vote in secret. The whole point of being publicly-elected representatives is that we should be held accountable for our actions to our own voters. To be asked to vote in secret is a huge insult to voters.  (Applause) I would have thought that after the huge advances in the Eurosceptic vote, there might have been a rethink somewhere in Brussels, but clearly that was not to be. Mr Cameron had a brief go and tried to oppose Mr Juncker’s candidacy, but he was busy succeeding with reshuffles in Britain and failing with reshuffles here, and Mrs Merkel of course crushed him because what the German Chancellor says goes in the modern Europe.  So what of our nominee? On the plus side, Mr Juncker, you are a sociable cove with a very much better sense of humour than most people I have met in Brussels, and there is no question that you are a political operator. You have even managed over the last couple of weeks, as you have gone round the political groups, to change the mood music a bit. You have said that you do not believe in a united states of Europe, and that you do not believe in a common European identity, but I have to say I did not believe a word of it. Today you have proven that actually you are stuck back with the ideas of the old Europe. You talked about Mr Delors being a hero of yours. I can understand that from your perspective, but you also talked about Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl as being heroes of yours. I would have thought a wartime collaborator and somebody who left German politics under a huge cloud of a massive party-funding scandal should not be the kind of people that we should stand up as great models of virtue in modern Europe today. You talked about the need for a common foreign policy and security policy. You talked about the need for a common energy policy. What is clear is that you are going to carry on with the process of the centralisation of powers, which is not surprising because for 20 years you have been a key player in this whole process, which frankly has treated democracy with deliberate contempt. I think the best example is your quote about the French referendum on the constitution where you said if it is a ‘yes’ we will say ‘on we go’, and if it is a ‘no’ we will say ‘we continue’. How is that for belief in democracy? Your dedication to the project is unchallengeable. You have said before that when it becomes serious, you have to lie. So in many ways you are the perfect candidate for a lot of people in this House and I have no doubt that you will get the nomination, but we are being asked to vote for the ultimate Brussels insider, somebody who has always operated with dark backroom deals and stitch-ups, and I have to say that our group overwhelmingly will vote ‘no’. We do not want business as usual. We want real change.  You said at the end of your speech that this is not the time for a revolution. I put it to you that there has already been a revolution. There has effectively been a coup d’état on nation state democracies without people realising, without people realising what was being done to them. After these elections, the Eurosceptic may not yet have a majority in this House, but please do not think we are over, because the vast majority of European people do not want a European state, do not want a European Commission to be the executive, do not want that flag and do not want that anthem. So, you will get elected and we will enjoy doing battle over the course of the next year or two.

Many nations, particularly the France I represent in this House, have chosen to send a very clear message. (Various movements) Yes, don't displease you, my fellow citizens. They chose to send a very clear message: \"No to Europe in Brussels. No to the confiscation of democracy. No to the imbecility of recessive policies. No to decommissioning. No to organized mass immigration. No to diluting our identities. Yes to our nations.\" The European Union has become a crazy project, a deadly project, from which people are gradually turning away. But as soon as the ballot boxes were stripped, representatives of a political class of another age bowed to the defence of their privileges and obsessed with maintaining the system they defend, ready for all compromises - thank you for giving us proof even today - to defend the interests that are not those of our peoples, no doubt panicked by the result of the elections - it is understood - have chosen to turn their backs on the message democratically launched in the spring. The Conservatives and the Socialists - I am not talking about the liberals, they are the mercenaries - once again, according to their old and detestable habits, immediately distributed the posts, denying all of the desire for change and integrity expressed in the ballot box. Between the EPP and the PES, between the UMP and the PS - to talk about the French parties - this is the usual sharing of the cake. To you Parliament, to me the Commission. I'll get you to vote here, you'll get me to vote there. And do not make us believe that the peoples of Europe would have chosen Jean-Claude Juncker in the European elections rather than Martin Schulz as head of the Commission or vice versa, for that matter. Both are in the countries of the European Union complete strangers who represent nothing and embody nothing! (Applause) Mr Juncker, you have come to the head of an institution to which the patriots in France, but also in many other countries of the European Union, reject any legitimacy. You are not the chosen one of the people. You have not been chosen in any way by the French people, nor by any other for that matter. You have no basis for claiming to be in charge of the lives of our fellow citizens. Your immense and illegitimate power, you will hold it from treaties imposed on peoples despite their vote and from financial and commercial lobbies that make the headquarters of your institution to corrupt it every day more. From that moment on, you represent the archetype of the denial of democracy.  Mr Juncker, I remember one of your statements in December 1999 in a famous German newspaper. You said, \"We make the decisions. We put them into practice and wait a while to see what happens. If there is no howl and no revolt, the majority does not understand what has been decided, we continue as we go until there is no more possible return.\" What an admission! What cynicism! Are you replacing Barroso? Martin Schulz could have taken your place. I don't care. In any case, it is the same guidelines that will guide the Commission's deleterious action. It is the obsession with the end of the nation. A dangerous federalist utopia that will continue to dominate. This is the promise for the peoples of Europe and, in particular, for mine, the great French people, less democracy, more misery, more inequality and dilution of our national identity. After Mr Barroso, you will contribute to the misfortune of the peoples of Europe. You have been put in this position for that. You ran a tax haven, you are now the guardian of the European underworld. Congratulations, Mr Juncker! (Applause) Nice promotion! But your federalist utopia, your obsession with the end of nations, we will fight it, sir. We will fight it here and in our respective countries. We will fight it with all the more energy as we measure every day the progress we are making in our nations. In France and other countries too, patriots are now the most numerous. They are encouraged by their election result, poll after poll, and are waiting for only one thing: to be able to send your Commission and all this European technostructure into the oblivion of history.  In the meantime, we will vote against you. Know that we, elected patriots, will be the most scrupulous observers of your misdeeds, whom we will denounce to the peoples. I will constantly warn the French people of the harmful projects built in Brussels. You are being watched by the people, Mr Juncker. You are under surveillance like anyone who, like you, represents a system in disarray. You did not want to admit the result of the polls but we will be there with all the patriots of Europe to remind you constantly!

People forced to work illegally are insecure, vulnerable and live in poverty in their workplaces, both at work and in old age. The Italian Presidency has identified the fight against undeclared work as a key tool for promoting employment and growth in Europe. Do you not think that the fight against undeclared work should be declared one of the EU's strategic priorities for the next term? What specific measures does the Commission intend to take, and when, to step up the fight against illegal employment in the EU? Secondly, do you think that the European Union should not take responsibility in solidarity and set up a special solidarity mobility fund to compensate for the money invested in the education and training of emigrant workers in those countries, including Lithuania, from which most workers have left?

Given that preventing and tackling illegal immigration will help prevent the loss of migrants' lives, and that strengthening immigration policies should be an integral part of the Union's foreign and development policies, I would like to ask you the following question. Based on the overall approach to migration and mobility and applying the \"more incentives for more results\" principle, do you intend to consider redefining fiscal policy, especially for the southern Member States, which are also Europe's borders? It is well known that these countries, such as Greece and Italy, are under intense migratory pressures as a result of which they are unable to cope effectively with the new data in the field of migration flow management.

The activities of illegal armed separatist groups remain a source of great concern. Militants still occupy buildings and border posts, keep dozens of people hostage, and threaten the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine, as well as the security of its citizens. Innocent civilians, including women and children, are caught in the crossfire. We must do all we can to protect and support them. Each civilian killed is one too many. The increase in the numbers of displaced people is also of concern. It underlines the importance of supporting the work of humanitarian organisations. It is essential to provide protection and emergency assistance to all of the Ukrainian civilians who are in need of it – whoever and wherever they are.  There are worrying reports regarding respect for human rights – not only in eastern Ukraine, but also in Crimea, which remains illegally annexed by Russia. Crimea is where the most dramatic changes in the situation of minorities and in the enjoyment of human rights have taken place. Earlier this month, the leader of the elected Crimean Tatar assembly was refused entry to Crimea. This is a clear violation of international law and the European Convention of Human Rights. Allow me to stress that we have not forgotten about Crimea; it will always remain on the radar of our policy until international law is restored. The Ukrainian military campaign in the eastern Ukraine continues. It is every country’s right and obligation to uphold law and order on its territory and to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In these extremely difficult circumstances, we encourage the Ukrainian authorities to maintain a measured approach. This is not about fighting the popular movement in part of eastern Ukraine at a time when the Ukrainian authorities offer discussions about decentralisation and other democratic changes. It is about fighting highly trained and equipped paramilitary forces that have hardly any regard for the needs of the local population. This is exactly the reason why we need to put the protection and well-being of local civilians at the heart of our policy. Diplomatic efforts towards peace in eastern Ukraine must continue. There is an urgent need for all parties to agree on a genuine and sustainable cease-fire in order to create the necessary conditions for the implementation of President Poroshenko’s peace plan. President Putin supported the peace plan in principle; the Federation Council has revoked the authorisation to use military force on Ukrainian soil. However, Russia has not stopped the flow of weapons, equipment and militants across the border; nor has it used its influence over illegally armed groups in eastern Ukraine to stop the violence and get them to lay down their arms. So it is now urgent that Russia takes concrete steps in this direction. We welcome the diplomatic efforts launched in Normandy on 6 June by Ukraine, the Russian Federation, France and Germany, and we hope that this process – as well as the joint Berlin Declaration of 2 July – will contribute to de-escalation and to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Diplomatic efforts will only be successful if all players show genuine commitment to the process. The European Union welcomes the trilateral efforts of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, which could lead to de-escalation and a peaceful resolution, including an agreement on a cease-fire, the release of all hostages, border security, and the effective monitoring of border crossings by the OSCE. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Tomorrow in Brussels, the Heads of State and Government will again assess the situation on the ground against the conditions put forward by the last European Council and, should it be required, adopt the necessary decisions. In parallel, the European Union supports Ukraine where it can. In March, the European Commission proposed a support package of over EUR 11 billion for the next couple of years. The Commission has also decided to create a Support Group to ensure that the Ukrainian authorities have all the assistance they need to implement reforms. Last week,  The European Union also actively supports the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and stands ready to further assist the organisation in supporting a cease-fire and border monitoring. At the end of this month, we are also planning to launch a common security and defence policy mission to assist Ukraine in the important areas of civilian security sector reform, police and the rule of law. 26 June 2014 was a historic day for Ukraine and for the European Union. After years of negotiations and hard work, the remaining provisions of the Association Agreement – with its deep and comprehensive Free Trade Area – were signed. This achievement is a powerful symbol of the Ukrainian people’s aspirations to get closer to the European Union, and of the European Union’s commitment towards Ukraine. The Agreement will help to drive reforms and boost growth by offering Ukraine access to the world’s largest market. We now look forward to its swift ratification and subsequent provisional application, so that Ukrainian citizens and businesses can benefit as soon as possible from the new opportunities that the Agreement opens.  Needless to say in this House, the Agreement is not meant to replace Ukraine’s relations with any neighbour; Ukraine can perfectly well have free trade agreements with Russia and the European Union at the same time. The European Union has engaged with Russia in order to dispel any possible misunderstandings in this regard. Last Friday, trilateral talks were held by Commissioner De Gucht with Ukraine and Russia at ministerial level on the effects on Russia’s economy of the implementation of the Association Agreement. An agreement was reached to launch a consultation mechanism with a focus on regulations and standard procedures arising from the implementation of this Agreement. The purpose is to reduce unnecessary tensions by filtering out misunderstandings and by focusing discussions on possible solutions for any remaining concrete issues. Experts will produce a preliminary report no later than 1 September 2014, and a new ministerial meeting will take place in that month. Russia’s threats to take unilateral ʽpreventiveʼ safeguard measures are unacceptable and legally unfounded. We now hope that Russia will refrain from taking any such unprovoked, restrictive measures. Finally, he Association Agreement does not constitute the final goal of European Union-Ukraine cooperation. On the contrary, it provides new opportunities and is an important step in the European Union’s commitment to support Ukraine along the road of transforming this country into a stable and prosperous European democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 39, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI", "mepid": "28297", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, in reaction to what the Commissioner has said, I would say that we should give Ukraine a chance.

The extremist vote was very small and this was a very good election result, given also the fact that Crimea was under Russian rule and Russian was intervening in the eastern part of Ukraine. So let us salute the Ukrainian people and their new democratically elected President. Secondly, President Poroshenko has his 15-point programme and we should support him in this because he wants to talk with all sections of Ukrainian society. He wants to talk about decentralisation within one Ukraine – the Ukraine we have all recognised, including Crimea and including, of course, the east – and President Putin should now do what he sometimes talks about. He sometimes speaks words of conciliation but his actions are different. If he really wants peace, President Putin needs to stop all help to the separatists – all help. He should patrol his border and he should come to a free and fair agreement with Ukraine on oil and gas. He should also accept international law, and that means that Crimea is not a part of Russia. Putin now has to accept international law.

However, I would like to emphasize that serious negotiations should have started much earlier, ie before the conclusion of the Association Agreement, ie before November 2013. The Association Agreement is one of the basic factors that contributed to the open military conflict and the civil war. The European Union, especially its Commissioners, and the European Parliament, which did not intervene in time, played a major role in exacerbating the situation. In any case, we had to monitor the situation, take objective positions and also send observers in time to objectively assess the situation. We are currently facing war on the European continent, at a time when we are remembering 100 years since the beginning of the First World War. At the same time, we are confronted with fascism and a humanitarian catastrophe. Among other things, the unfortunate policy of the Eastern Partnership has driven half a million Ukrainian citizens to seek security and refuge in the Russian Federation. It would be good to ask these people how they want Ukraine. Against this background, I believe that the European Union should set up a commission to investigate crimes committed, such as the shooting of snipers in Kiev's Chreshchatyk, the killings in Odessa and, last but not least, the disproportionate use of force in south-eastern Ukraine. I consider it necessary for the European Parliament to call on the Ukrainian authorities to implement a constitutional reform that respects the historical specificities of each region. The European Parliament must insist on avoiding the ethnic cleansing that unfortunately can be expected. Let me also express my fundamental disagreement with the impending ban on a parliamentary party such as the Communist Party of Ukraine.

At this point I would like to emphasize once again - also for Russian citizens, who should perhaps also have to hear this debate unfiltered - that the association agreement that we signed with Ukraine was never directed against Russia. That was not aggression against Russia, it was a treaty that we wanted to conclude for the benefit of better democratic and economic development in Ukraine. I am delighted that the association agreements with Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine have now been signed. In view of the meeting last week between Ukraine, Russia and the EU in Brussels, I would say again: you can talk about trade, but the European Union must not allow Russia to veto these agreements, because that would promote the ideas of democratic development actually undermined. I have to tell you, from week to week I am more appalled at how successful Russia’s strategy is to undermine the democratic process in Ukraine through tolerance and now through the increasingly active support of the self-proclaimed separatists, some of whom are criminals. in eastern Ukraine. That is not acceptable. That simply speaks against normal relations with Russia. We don't have to change our relations with Russia. Russia is changing its relations and the way it deals with Ukraine, including us. I want to talk again about the sanctions: we have talked about them so often. When the sanctions started to work - capital flight is a big problem, the ruble has gone down - when you felt the effects, there was a parliamentary resolution in Russia and you have this 100% announcement: We will defend all Russians outside of Russia, if need be, withdrawn. This decision was withdrawn under the pressure of economic conditions. But then the European Union began, through individual member states, to contradict itself and the idea of ​​sanctions. I find it unbearable that weapons are still being exported, that Russian soldiers are being trained in France. This can not be! (Applause) I also find it unbearable that Austria and our Council Presidency in Italy are suddenly pushing South Stream forwards, because this is not a project for energy security, it is a project that is strategically directed against Ukraine!

That is why the common position of all European countries and coordinated action to stop military action in Ukraine and to find a peaceful solution is so important today. Our common and determined position is important not only for Ukraine and the integrity of its territory, but also for our states, the citizens of our states. Therefore, let us be united and act decisively together today, because tomorrow may be late.

Please remember what happened on the Maidan, how a supposed democracy movement, which was supported by the European Union, suddenly handled assault rifles and machine guns and subsequently a government was pushed away, not with the required quorum in the Kiev Roda of 75% that would have been necessary, but below it. Here, too, people closed their eyes to this wrong decision of a coup. As a result, people closed their eyes when suddenly 400 Blackwater mercenaries from the US administration were discovered in the Ukraine - according to a report by the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\". I ask the European Union not to take the American position unilaterally, but, on the contrary, to assume a neutral role, to enable a tripolar negotiation - the Russians, the Ukrainians and the Europeans on the other hand.

That is to say, people who have obviously understood democracy, while your arguments are supporting the Putin regime, which is not free. You should be ashamed to take up such positions here! What is clear is that the people in Ukraine made a decision in the presidential election: their friends like the fascists together got less than 10%. A decision was made in favor of democracy and freedom for the West. The decision has to be made in Kiev, in Ukraine, not in Brussels, not in Washington and not in Moscow. We only want that: The Ukrainian people must have the freedom of choice! We make an offer of an association agreement. Each country is free to decide whether it wants that. We will ratify this quickly as a parliament - as we did with Georgia and Moldova. But I would like to make it clear: this is not directed against Russia. This has no trade-policy disadvantages for Russia. The disadvantages arise only from Russia, which is imposing unilateral punitive measures in trade policy against countries that are not politically compliant. This is unacceptable! That must be rejected! And about what's going on in eastern Ukraine: As long as there are Russian arms deliveries, as long as you have rockets with which you can shoot down planes over six kilometers high - this is not just that of rioters - we have to say: as long as Russia pursues this policy , Russia must also expect that sanctions can be imposed. I think it must be clear: every people must be free to make their own decisions. We should help the Ukrainians - perhaps with OSCE groups, the observers - so that control of the Russian-Ukrainian border can be regained so that this border cannot be abused by arms shipments into Ukraine.

Do you not realise that much of Europe is dependent on Russian gas for winter warmth and that most of the constituents I represent are already struggling to pay their energy bills each month, without the added cost of increased wholesale prices? Are you all so arrogant and out of touch as to think that the EU’s actions to-date have done nothing more than to throw fuel onto the flames of conflict, an especially dangerous act in a situation that threatens to take us back to the bad old days of the Cold War?

Another conflict is the last thing the United Kingdom needs, coming on the back of over 20 years of the Labour Party’s wars and at a time of savage Tory cuts to our already overstretched armed forces. In UKIP we do not subscribe to the Clausewitzean theory of war being merely the continuation of politics by other means. War is never desirable. UKIP wish to see peace between all peoples brought through democracy, diplomacy and meaningful dialogue.

What happened in Ukraine is very likely to happen in any country of the European Union where there are religious and ethnic minorities. That is why the European Union must pay special attention to the sensitive issue of minorities. It must not be indifferent when their rights are violated, but also its policy must not incite, provoke and incite minorities to revolt, because then there is a risk that a third country outside the European Union will intervene and create problems in the European Union.

All of these facts need to be remembered - you did well to do it. This deliberate strategy of Moscow is obviously also based on the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is also based - and this is very serious and we often forget to recall it - on Russia's international and multilateral commitments signed in 1994 in the Budapest memorandum. So obviously in the light of all these elements, one can still wonder why the European Union does not finally adopt the policy of firmness that it declaims at length of advice and finally adopts this third measure concerning sanctions. However, alongside these elements on the ground, there is still a political and diplomatic process that exists. I agree with what my colleague Preda said earlier. We have legitimate authorities in Ukraine, which are also recognized as legitimate by Moscow. This is a big step forward. We have a dialogue with Moscow, which exists, particularly in terms of trade measures. You recalled the existence of these high-level discussions.

Without the tanks and rocket launchers and the fighters who cross the border there every day, there would be no violence there. Putin is escalating the situation every day instead of de-escalating. He's testing us to see how far he can go. We need a strengthening of the international presence at the borders. The OSCE must finally be present there with a major mission. Then Russia too has to be opposed to what is happening there. I think the EU must also stand by its decisions. It had already been decided to implement the third level of sanctions if it does not stop its destabilization. Then there were only eleven people who were also put on the black list, who do not come to visit us anyway.

Maybe looking to the right, to see whether there is still the same number of people as at the beginning, when they claimed that they were here just to express how much they care about Ukraine. Catherine Ashton is in Vienna. She is holding and participating in extremely important discussions about Iranian nuclear programmes. It is a time-consuming programme. It is about an issue which poses a lot of important questions concerning European security. She would like to be here, but it is the success of those very important negotiations, with her personal participation, which has kept her from coming to this august body. A second short remark, before I make my two or three points: I have heard a lot of expressions about solidarity in this House and not only in this House but elsewhere. It is interesting how many different meanings we sometimes attribute to the word solidarity, but I think the most important meaning of the word solidarity is that we are not thinking only about ourselves but also about others who are in need of assistance and help. I will find a way to reply in a concrete and written way to one of the last questions here. Another short reply refers to the terrible crime that has happened in Odessa. Other crimes are happening at the Maidan in Kiev and elsewhere. Together with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe we have been discussing these issues for a long time and he had my and the EU’s full support when he called in December for the international advisory panel to be set up.  This panel is being chaired by the former President of the European Court of Human Rights. It has one member from the Ukrainian Government and one member from the Ukrainian opposition. The panel is not there to investigate all those crimes, because that is ultimately up to the Ukrainian authorities, but this panel is to oversee and make absolutely clear that, in pursuing that work, the Ukrainian authorities are also pursuing European principles and standards when putting together the facts and drawing the necessary conclusions from them.  I think it is also important to state, although I do not know whether I will change the minds of some of the honourable Members, what happened and what did not happen at the end of February. What some now think of as a coup d’état was actually a sincere effort to stop the bloodshed that was going on in the streets of Ukraine, as some of you might still remember. There was a plan that was also elaborated with US assistance, and Russia also participated and contributed in an important way.  It was President Yanukovych who at that time decided not to deliver on the part that was his responsibility. He fled Kiev and later also the country. It was not a different country in which Mr Poroshenko was elected President in the first round, and not just in a part of Ukraine but throughout Ukraine. Many of you called for solutions rather than rhetoric. Actually, in my opening statement, which was a little bit more than nine minutes long, I tried to provide you – on Catherine Ashton’s instructions – with not only as objective an assessment as possible, but also clearly defining what we believe are those important steps which need to be taken to bring a peaceful solution. Let me not repeat it – I am on the record and my statement is at your disposal, if you are interested – but let me make three remarks, by way of a reaction to the number of arguments I have heard.  I am Czech. I was born in the Czech Republic. And I would not be standing here if this institution, this Parliament and Member States of the European Union, were indifferent to the calls of my compatriots to join the European Union. I would not be here if our choice to join the European Union and also to join NATO had been ignored by the very institutions we wanted to join. And it was not just for the sake of being a member of something – we had been a member of something for a long period of time before that – but because we believed in the values and principles of the organisation we wanted to be part of; because we believed that, if it had not been for the coup d’état in 1948, we would have been part of that Europe since the end of the Second World War.  It is sad for me to see that the UK, which was one of the most active proponents of EU enlargement, as far as not only the Czech Republic but also other Central European countries were concerned, now through its representatives in the European Parliament voices a little bit different – let me be politically correct – opinion. Let me make one more thing very clear. Has our relationship with Russia actually become a victim of our membership of the European Union and NATO? My answer is very clear: no. They are free of those emotions which relate back to 1968, and not only 1968. They are very pragmatic. We have never had such good and pragmatic relations with Russia as we have had since joining the European Union and NATO.  My second remark is about the importance of this institution and the discussions between one part of this House and the second part of this House about a number of important issues. I am going to talk about the bigger picture; but I am not going to talk about the bigger picture being defined by President Putin saying in 2008 that Ukraine is an artificial country or the very same President saying that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century. I am going to define this bigger picture a bit differently because, whether you like it or not, whether or not you have a different opinion, whether February this year was a coup d’état or not, it is this Parliament which will have to face the issue of the consequences of the Crimea and its illegal annexation for European security. You will have to look at the issue of what has happened with the Helsinki Final Act and to what next extent European security is still based on the principles we have been working on for decades.  Secondly, this House will have to tackle the issue of the relationship between the European Union and the Eurasian Union, which is in the making. It is this bigger picture within which the issue we have been debating for almost two hours is taking place and there are some important decisions to be made, to focus on making sure that the regulatory framework between the EU and Eurasian Union is compatible, because here our responsibility and the responsibility of our partners working on the Eurasian Union is huge because if we fail on this one we might not recreate an Iron Curtain, but we might create a big trade and economic divide throughout the European continent. This House is also going to discuss the issue of the future of the Eastern Partnership, which from the very beginning was put together as a transparent, coherent and predictable policy vis-à-vis our partners, making sure that it does not offer a straightjacket, but a differentiated policy tailored to the different ambition of our partners. And it is about the ambitions of our partners, not the ambitions of some bureaucrats in Brussels, as some of you might think. And whether you like it or not, you will have to tackle the issue of propaganda, the propaganda which, as I already said in the previous House, is essentially more dangerous than that which I know from the time of the Cold War, because this one mobilises people, this one calls for mobilisation and it does not stop at what was yesterday the Iron Curtain. This one spreads throughout the European continent.  Point number three, the final point, is that we started seven-and-a-half years ago – seven-and-a-half years ago! – to negotiate the Association Agreement with Ukraine and we have been saying since the very beginning that this is not a policy that will force our partners into making a choice between Moscow or Brussels. No. That was our policy seven-and-a-half years ago and that is our policy today. The Association Agreement is not about making our partners make choices at the expense of their traditional ties. The Association Agreement and the deep and comprehensive free trade area actually strengthened our partners’ sovereignty. This is the only right thing we can do, because in the end it is up to them and their ambitions to make the choice, as it is up to us, also, to find the most adequate and most effective response to their ambitions.  Let me make my very last comment. There is no doubt that we take Russia seriously. There is no doubt about us considering Russia – despite the Crimea, despite not stopping the flow of heavy equipment across the border –as a strategic partner, and no doubt that we were sincere when we started, when my colleague Günther Oettinger started the discussion on the price of gas and my colleague Karel De Gucht held the trilateral discussions on the implementation of the Association Agreement with Ukraine and Russia. And we also take them seriously when addressing the number of issues facing those who would like to build the South Stream and to make it an EU-compatible project – and I am not talking about politics, I am talking about the legislation – and to hold these consultations with the Russians, despite them taking us to the WTO on the third energy package. This is how we in the best way and in practice show what we mean, that our policies do contribute to security on the European continent. Our policy is not divisive. Our policy is a win-win and not a zero-sum game.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 110, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "To close the debate, 7 motions for resolutions have been tabled in accordance with Article 123 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday, July 17, 2014, at 11:00 am.Written statements (Article 162 of the Regulations)", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 111, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Zigmantas BALČYTIS", "mepid": "96680", "text": "in writing. - The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine are a matter of great concern and concern.

At the gates of Donetsk, there is a legitimate battle to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and to curb neo-Soviet expansionism, which forces the re-Bolshevism of the East and the return of Europe to the twentieth century - conflicts and violations of citizens' options and rights. We owe it to ourselves to show more effective solidarity with this fight for the values ​​on which the European Union is founded. I propose to include in tomorrow's European Parliament resolution a request to the European Council to redefine the EU's involvement in defending the integrity of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, boosting diplomatic dialogue and concretely supporting Ukraine's peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 114, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Andrey KOVATCHEV", "mepid": "97968", "text": "In written form. - Ukraine has a peace plan - that of President Poroshenko.

You have a very serious responsibility as it will ultimately fall to you to vote on what will have been negotiated. Your thumbs up or down will make or break TTIP. Given the wide spectrum of opinion in this Parliament, disagreement is unavoidable, but I hope the debate will be based on facts and logic. We cannot afford to let it be controlled by irrational fears or false information. Let me focus on three themes that have been at the forefront of the criticism levied against TTIP: the alleged lack of transparency, the alleged risk of lowering the regulatory standards which underpin our way of life and ISDS. Many people have alleged that the negotiations have been conducted so far in secrecy. It is true that when I meet my counterpart, Ambassador Froman, we prefer to do it without TV cameras being present. If you want to build confidence you also need a certain degree of confidentiality. It is also true that the Commission historically has conducted negotiations without that much media attention, not because we wanted to keep them secret but because the interest was much lower. TTIP has completely changed that. The Commission has worked hard to accommodate that new reality. To give one example: recently some media reported that leaked secret documents revealed that Europe is trying to get access to oil and gas via TTIP. But it was not much of a revelation. As a matter of fact position papers have been available for a long time on our dedicated TTIP website, clearly stating that we want the US to remove export restrictions in the energy field. Tomorrow, in the middle of the sixth negotiating round, the chief negotiators will take a break to interact directly with stakeholders. As in every single negotiating round, there will be scores of presentations from all kinds of parties with a stake in the negotiations and they will be given direct access to the two chief negotiators for questions and answers. When each negotiation round is over, we will publish written summaries of the outcome. We have also put in place an advisory group, consisting of experts carefully selected to represent a broad array of interests from civil society, including unions, consumer organisations and relevant business sectors. We have also persuaded the US to allow us to share negotiation documents with Member States and Parliament in reading rooms. But that does not mean that we cannot do even more. In fact, I wish we could. But the US only gives access to the Parliament on a reading room basis, so you can imagine that it is particularly difficult to convince my American counterpart to go any further with our Members of Parliament than they do with theirs. One of the sources of confusion is the fact that the negotiating directives given by the Council to the Commission have not been made officially public. I am deeply convinced we should change that. The negotiation guidelines summarise the EU objectives in the negotiations and could reassure citizens that there is nothing dangerous in TTIP. In May I called on the Council to declassify them and today I hereby call on them again to publish the negotiating directives. In addition, I will continue to be fully at your disposal to answer all questions you may have. I am ready to consider any other specific ideas on how we can further improve transparency. One of the loudest arguments against TTIP that is often raised is that the agreement will force Europe to lower its high standards for protection: protection of the environment, of consumers and of workers. The argument is that our European model is much better than the American one and if we try to tear down trade barriers between the two continents we will also automatically tear down the high European standards. Some are tempted to turn this into a Kulturkampf, claiming that TTIP threatens to Americanise our way of life. The Commission does not share this line of reasoning. First, it appears to suggest that the US is not interested in protecting the environment or its consumers or workers. Actually, sometimes protection in the US is higher than here. To illustrate: US courts are much more likely than European ones to award high damages to consumers if they have been harmed by a product they have purchased. The air and water quality legislation in the US is not softer than ours. We do approach many areas in a different way from that in the US and sometimes our rules here are stricter than in the US but we share the same objectives of quality and protection and, even where we differ, our values and concerns are more similar than with any other parts of the world. That is why President Obama flatly stated in Brussels that he would not agree to any deal if it lowered the standards of protection. Neither would the Commission. Secondly, it is also a wrong argument as a matter of logic. There are plenty of barriers to trade that can be removed without lowering standards. Take the internal market. The internal market is low on barriers to trade and high on standards of protection. The same philosophy underpins the TTIP negotiations. We should remove protectionism but keep protection. Does it really make sense for an inspector from the US to fly over here to inspect our pharmaceutical production sites and repeat exactly the same work already done by a European colleague. If we agree that the American inspector can stay at home and just rely on a copy of the inspection report we have already made, there is no lowering of any standards anywhere. The only thing that is lowered is the amount of red tape. And where the gap in approach between the EU and the US is too wide, we just will not change our rules. We will not import any meat that is treated with hormones. We will not give a blanket approval of imports of GMOs. On the other hand it is not because the US makes a claim that it must be wrong by definition. We should rely on the opinions of our own scientists in EFSA and not on ideology. Finally, I know that many EU citizens are afraid of including ISDS in the agreement. The feeling is that this will open a way for large American corporations through arbitration to undermine policy space for our democratically elected parliaments. One often-cited example is the ongoing lawsuit by Philip Morris against Australia for introducing plain packaging for cigarettes. We have suspended negotiations with the US on this issue while we conduct a public consultation. We will draw the conclusions from it in due course. We need the debate to be about the ISDS provisions we are considering including and not some imaginary alternative. The Commission’s current ideas are available, black on white, in the consultation document. They have been carefully drafted to ensure that damage claims can only be raised for very clear violations or very fundamental principles of investor protection and that the policy space is fully preserved. Contrary to what is alleged by some scaremongers, a US multinational will not be able to successfully sue for damages for lost future profit just because a parliament introduces a new law with the legitimate aim of protecting the environment or public health. The terms of this debate should not be ISDS or not ISDS. ISDS is already a feature in investment treaties between some of our Member States and the US. The core question is: what sort of ISDS do we want for investment protection vis-à-vis the US but also any other third country? There is also a question of consistency to keep in mind. I think it would be difficult one day to claim that we must avoid ISDS provisions with the US because they are dangerous and then the next day insist on including the same kind of provisions in agreements with others, such as China. The provisions we propose in the consultation represent a very substantial improvement over most of the ISDS provisions in the 1 400 bilateral investment treaties that currently bind our Member States.

It gives us the chance to listen, but it also gives us the chance to get better information. I think it is great that Commissioner De Gucht has now given us negotiating documents. I would be happy if the Council finally had some understanding and made the negotiating mandate public. Because it is important that we inform the public, on the Commission's homepage, but also here, what it is about and what it is not about. It's about growth and jobs, and it's not about lowering standards or protecting consumers. It is about better market access for our companies - large and small - and it is not about the forced privatization of the water supply. It's about removing tariffs on trucks, cars, shoes or clothes / clothes, but it's not about the deterioration of workers' rights. It is about solving the problem that foreign investors are still often disadvantaged, and not about restricting political leeway or disempowering national courts.

We in the Socialist and Democratic Group believe that TTIP does have the potential to be a significant catalyst for jobs and growth, and we know that this could be the EU’s last chance to be a setter of global standards. If we do nothing we will be relegated from leaders to followers; it will be China, India, and Brazil who will set the global standards, putting our industries at a significant disadvantage.  As well as regulatory cooperation, we want to see the United States open up to European investment its transport sector and its public procurement, to level the playing field for our industries. We want to see quality European products such as Parma ham and Feta cheese given strong geographic protection against genetic products and misleading marketing, and we want to give our small and medium-sized enterprises the same opportunities as multinationals currently enjoy in easy access to the US market. We do accept that this agreement could and should benefit consumers, and that is why we welcome the fact that the Commission has involved consumer groups, NGOs and trade unions in the European discussion on priorities. For all of these reasons the Socialists were proud to be at the birth of TTIP, and we do not want to have to be its assassins. I want to tell the Commission clearly now, though, that if we have to be, we will be, and that is why we want the Commission to listen carefully to our concerns, such as those over food safety. Regulatory convergence must not lead to chlorinated chickens, hormone-treated beef or GMOs getting access to the European Union market. We have had assurances from the Commission on this but I want to tell you that we will keep reminding you of this and we will keep watching you throughout the whole of the negotiations. Similarly with our concerns over investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS): we do not believe that this consultation is the end of the process. We want to ensure that the Commission listens carefully to public opinion on this issue and that ISDS does not become a backdoor route for a corporate power grab. We also have concerns about public services; again we have had some assurances from the Commission, but we want to make sure that our public services remain of the highest standard and receive the highest possible protection. We want to make sure that in this trade agreement there is no ratchet effect and there is no ability to prevent Member States returning health, education and other vital services to public control if they have been privatised. So we will keep scrutinising TTIP to make sure that the quality of our services remains high, that corporate power is not increased unnecessarily, that our high levels of protection are retained. But we have to say to the Commission: we recognise that a good TTIP would be good for Europe, and the pledge we give to the Commission and to the Member States is that we will watch the outcome of this agreement and, if we think it benefits Europe, benefits European jobs and European standards of living, we will vote for it. If we think it damages our concerns we will vote against it. We will make up our mind at the end; unlike some groups we have not made up our mind one way and unlike other groups we have not made up our mind the other way. We will judge this agreement on its merits at the end of the process.

It is vital that we keep in mind just how important a deal this is for the EU. We must grasp this opportunity: a free trade deal is good for growth and jobs, but this is particularly true of one of this scale. In the long term, we can expect it to boost the EU economy by as much as a hundred billion pounds annually, and this does not even take into account the benefits arising from the dynamic productivity gains which could be realised from a comprehensive deal.  For the individual man or woman on both sides of the pond, they will notice that they have more products to choose from – products which are of a better standard and at a cheaper price. But we must also ensure that the deal benefits businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, irrespective of size. We can help our smallest businesses by eliminating tariffs, by aligning customs processes at borders, and by increasing regulatory coherence between the EU and the US. If we take these steps, we can aspire to one day having a truly transatlantic market. There are, of course, concerns amongst a wider European public about this deal, particularly when it comes to food standards and investor-to-state dispute settlement. EU negotiators have ruled out the inclusion of hormone beef and chlorinated chicken, so I hope that this scaremongering will stop. While the ISDS will be there to act as a safeguard for investors, I am pleased that the Commission has recognised concerns by launching a consultation with stakeholders on its provisions. Commissioner De Gucht, I urge you to keep your foot on the gas – to use an American phrase – with this deal until the end of your term. It is crucial that we build momentum with this deal, and for that we need renewed political support on both sides. At the same time –and as important as this deal is – let us remember that we must maintain and develop our existing trade relationships, which we have worked hard to build up over a number of years.

But those days, when Vice-President Biden liked to talk about finishing the deal on one tank of gas, seem a little bit far behind us at this moment, one-and-a half years down the road. It seems as though the Americans have chosen an exceptionally environmentally friendly car to drive in. In any case, I think that they and maybe all of us should step on the gas to keep the very important momentum that started these negotiations. For our group, jobs and growth without government investment, the opportunity to set global standards and meet competition from emerging economies, and eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, remain the essential points on the horizon. We have to find ways to preserve our cherished standards when it comes to food safety and the environment, as well as fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy.  These are points which are being raised by people all over the EU, and I think it is good to have an active debate. Transparency and active engagement are essential to acquiring consent at the end of the day. So, Commissioner, my question is: how will you help dispel the feeling that quite a few people have that there is not enough clarity on where the process of negotiation stands, and that there may not be enough space to participate while there may be enough space for corporations to have access? Now the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) consultation seems to show that there is great interest. I have heard a number of rumours about the amount of consultation submissions which were received. Perhaps you could also say something about the amount of responses that came in, as well as when you expect an initial assessment or final assessment. Do you believe that TTIP is possible, from the American point of view, without ISDS? Is this a negotiable point from their side? But with all these challenges, we might almost forget that there are also non-controversial issues and opportunities, such as procurement.  For the EU, it is crystal clear that the US market should open up for our businesses, to end explicit protectionism through the ‘Buy American’ and ‘Buy America’ Acts, as well as implicit protectionism through national security clauses, as seen in the Jones Act, which restricts access for European ship builders and operators, as well as domestic flights by European airliners.

The public's criticism of the TTIP negotiations is growing ever stronger. You can also see this in the result of the European elections and the success of my group.

You conducted a consultation on ISDS and Ambassador O‘Sullivan announced yesterday that it had received more than 115,000 responses. The population does not want ISDS - neither in TTIP nor in the agreement with Canada. So draw a line, because instruments of the 20th century don't have to be right in the 21st century. So why don't you ask the public for their opinion on other chapters of free trade policy? That would be an innovative approach! Do you think that farmers and consumers want further liberalization in the trade in agricultural products? I assure you: it is not. - Incidentally, not only in the EU, but also in the many states of the USA, people don't want that. So do not represent the interests of the corporations, but those of the population!

These are societal choices on the environment, on health, on social law, on public services, on intellectual property, on agriculture, on food and today these social choices are negotiated in total opacity on the sole basis of their commodification. It is a deep problem. We are being told today that it would be good for Europe. No! We can see that today, what Europe needs is to define its project, to strengthen its project with an industrial policy, with a specificity of sustainability and what this negotiation offers us, it is to dilute the European project in a large transatlantic market. So, Commissioner, you explained to us how much the European Commission was making efforts on transparency. Since yesterday, the consolidated negotiation texts - that is to say the heart of the negotiation, which is really being played out today - have been placed in reading rooms. Reading material for member states means going to the American embassy if they want to know what is in these negotiating texts. For MEPs, this means going to a reading room located at the European Parliament in Brussels or at the European Commission. How can we imagine, today, that social choices are reduced to consultations without a telephone, without the means to take notes in reading rooms. The transparency that you are offering us, Commissioner, is an artifice. It is totally contradictory with the democracy that European citizens expect, with the control that European citizens want to exercise over European institutions. Pardon me, Commissioner, but the environmental group today considers the way in which the European Parliament and the governments are informed of the holding of the follow-up to the negotiations - either by means of reading documents - is contrary to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union is contrary to Article 218 (10) of that Treaty. MEPs have the right to follow these negotiations and to be fully informed. This is the text on which the European Court of Justice has already ruled. This negotiation led by the European Commission is already illegal. And this is also why the environmental group supports the European citizens' initiative which is launched today by dozens of organizations to ask you, the European Commission, to put an end to this negotiation as well as to refuse the adoption of the treaty with Canada. Finally, on ISDS, Commissioner, that's good, you continue to promote it. You can see that groups which, until now, have always supported this negotiation after the European elections are starting to squirm a little and the new President of the Commission has, at least, made the gesture of saying that national courts are enough , that it would be unacceptable to transfer democratic sovereignty from citizens to multinationals.

This is not a simple free trade agreement. Moreover, the duties between Europe and the United States are already very low. Instead, it is a tool for removing barriers to free trade. These barriers are: the rights our workers have acquired after generations of struggles; environmental regulations that limit pollution; the rules on food safety, the same rules that protect us from GM food and from meat treated with hormones; European laws prohibiting harmful chemicals and finally our privacy, the protection of our personal data. Commissioner, the Commission has repeated several times that the negotiation process is transparent and open. Even now it is being discussed, there is no secret. Well, Commissioner, you couldn't find me more in agreement: it is true, there is no secret. But there is no secret for lobbyist groups and lawyers for large multinationals. On the other hand, real access to documents is impossible for European citizens, it is impossible for parliamentarians and it is also impossible for me as a member of the Committee on International Trade. I ask once again why these documents are kept secret and why a process, which should have been inclusive from its inception, is instead becoming increasingly exclusive and secret. Gentlemen, what is at stake here is not just an economic agreement but the very concept of democracy. I wonder what is the idea of ​​democracy and inclusion that Europe wants to achieve. Is this the same idea that inspired most of the political parties that sit in this Parliament when they turned down any presidency and vice-presidency for the members of my political group, thus excluding more than 10 million citizens from key roles in Parliament?

And whatever you say about ISDS, we must ensure that our investors are protected and that all of our public policies in the social, environmental and health fields cannot be called into question by foreign multinationals. So that ISDS is not an additional weapon in the hands of multinationals, we also demand that it be really accessible to SMEs in a simple and inexpensive way, and according to a transparent procedure. This is why, for lack of sufficient guarantees on these points, we must question whether this mechanism will be maintained in the current discussions. Commissioner, we are emerging from a difficult electoral campaign: Europe is not seen as being close to the citizens. Questions about this agreement have come up over and over again in the discussions. As representatives of European citizens, we therefore want these negotiations to be conducted with firmness and transparency in order to avoid misunderstandings and political exploitation.

It is quite obvious that many people associate worries and hardships with this agreement. I believe it is time to take these worries and fears seriously and not to put them off. This primarily includes transparency. You have to admit that it has been a very slow process to get more transparency into the negotiations and I am still not satisfied with it. I find it unbearable that the Council - which is not here again today - is preventing the negotiating mandate and the fundamental documents from being published. It is a scandal and I appeal to the governments to finally give up this situation so that the citizens of Europe can really participate in the discussion and know what is going on. I also appeal to the United States to abandon its policy of foreclosure. It's an absurd situation: on the one hand there are NSAs, spies and whatever, and the US is trying to get all the information. And when it comes to documents, they prevent their own negotiating documents from being published and ensure that consolidated texts are only accessible in a reading room. The USA, for example, presented a paper on the liberalization of education in the private sector - an exciting question, everything that has to do with adult education. I want to know what the United States is asking for there. I cannot see this document. It can not go on like that. When we negotiate, there must also be transparency in all the documents that are on the table. Otherwise one side is clearly disadvantaged. I just want to be able to sign something that has been negotiated transparently. I also have the feeling that when it comes to ISDS, people's worries and needs are now very, very strong - by the way, also on the other side of the Atlantic. More than 150,000 entries during the consultation showed that. So we should draw the line and say: Yes, we want trade agreements, but without ISDS, that is the perspective. The United States, by the way, has a trade agreement with Australia - even without ISDS. In this respect, we should clearly take the concerns here seriously and forego them. Commissioner, if you are serious about investment protection mechanisms beyond court situations, then I ask myself: why did you not take an activity to set up an international court for investment protection at the WTO instead of enforcing something like that in bilateral agreements? Incidentally, the old member states of the European Union do not have such an agreement with any OECD country. In the end we decide, and I think we do it very consciously and rationally, as we showed in the ACTA case. The Commission should therefore take the signals seriously.

There is a saying that means: “Well meant is the opposite of good”. I think that happened here. These negotiations may have been well-intentioned, but they went terribly wrong. There are many examples of what went wrong. Many colleagues have already mentioned a few things. But I would like to address these investment protection clauses again and perhaps to put it in a very simplified way: a common citizen who buys a diesel car, for example because diesel is cheaper and is less taxed, cannot go to a special court that is sitting in London when a democratically elected government suddenly increases taxes on diesel. But these investors could do it. That's unfair. Why are there special rights for large investors? We live in a democratic legal system - both in Europe and in the United States - and there is no need for either side to do that. When investors struggle, there are proper courts. Otherwise, in my opinion, this agreement cannot be approved. Then this gossip about secrecy! I once believed that too. It has been explained to me that if you negotiate with the Americans, you cannot open all negotiating positions. I understand that already. But we have now come to the conclusion: Americans already know our secrets before we even know them because they eavesdrop on us. You have to take that into account.

In a situation where in 2013 the average gas price in the United States was three times lower than in the EU, maintaining this state in the long term means moving energy-intensive factories from the EU to the United States on a massive scale, and this in turn means the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe. The second issue, extremely important from the point of view of the entire EU and Poland, which will be resolved in this agreement, is the liberalization of trade in food products, including, unfortunately, genetically modified food, as well as meat with growth hormones. This issue probably cannot be excluded from the agreement, and therefore immediate action is needed in the Union to clearly label such food so that consumers in all EU countries have an authentic choice on store shelves.

I appeal here for European farmers not to be taken hostage to a potential agreement.

The risk is even greater for small-scale agricultural economies, as is the case for example in the Azores and exactly in relation to these sectors. Still, in my country, among others, the tomato sector may suffer such an impact as to lead to the abandonment of production. I therefore reinforce the call to the European Commission to pay particular attention to the interests of European farmers in negotiating the terms of the agreement with the United States and to establish the necessary balances for the preservation and dynamization of agricultural practice in Europe, especially where agricultural activity acquires a special preponderance that is hardly substitutable as an economic activity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 204, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Marian HARKIN", "mepid": "28116", "text": "   Madam President, there are many positive and negative aspects to TTIP but in my one minute I shall just deal with just one issue, and that is the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS) in the agreement.

It seems to me that several debates are mixed up: the debate on whether or not you are in favour of trade; the debate on whether or not you consider the United States to be a fair partner; and the debate on whether or not negotiations are sufficiently transparent. Let me start with the first one: for or against trade. I realise after this debate – and I have to say also before the debate – there are a number of Members in this Parliament that I will never persuade that trade makes sense. I will never convince them because they are against trade so what can I change about that? I could reply with a question: can you give me an example, be it by the Far Left or the Far Right (which by the way has disappeared – they are not there any more, they have left in peace) of a country, of a society that has been able to develop without trade? If you give me some of those examples then I am ready to discuss further with you. Secondly, the United States: I already mentioned in my introduction that this looks a little bit to me like a Kulturkampf, for or against the United States. I find this a rather strange debate, because obviously we differ on a number of issues with the United States – as I do myself as well, and I largely prefer the European way of life to the American way of life – but is that what it is about? I thought it was about trying to work together so that we can create jobs and growth in our own countries. I thought that was what it was about. I do not want to be the same as the United States’ citizens, and most of them do not want to be like Europeans either, or at least like some of us. It is about finding solutions together, to grow, to have more impetus in our economy. That is what it is about; it is not about changing American society, it is not about changing our society. We are different and we want to be different, but does it mean we cannot work together? If we cannot work together with the United States, with whom then can we work together? They are different from us but are all the rest then closer to us? The agreement with Canada has also been mentioned today, which is in fact ready apart from a couple of lines, maybe not even that. That agreement too is now called into question. We have made an agreement with Singapore. Are we going to relinquish it? Last week we initialled the economic partnership agreement with ECOWAS, with the West of Africa. Can we still speak with them? Today the EPA agreement with SADC has been initialled. Do we refuse to even discuss that because they are not the same as we are? What is the sense of that? It is about working together; it is not about being identical. Please! Then there is the discussion on transparency. There has never been a trade agreement conducted in as much transparency as this one – never! For a number of reasons: it is only since the Treaty of Lisbon that this Parliament has the competence to ratify agreements. As long as you did not have that competence obviously that was different, and now we have to adapt to that new situation, but I would claim that we have been doing this with a lot of diligence. Our positions, the positions of the Commission, you can read them on our website. If you read them all you are going to spoil your summer holidays you can be sure of that, because there are thousands and thousands of pages there. At the start of this Commission we agreed that all the documents that we give to the Member States and to the European Council, we would also give to the European Parliament. That has never happened before, you know, and again with TTIP negotiations we have been doing that in a very diligent way. Now there are of course a number of difficult problems in this. For example the Council – and I am pleased that they are finally are present – refused to make the mandate public. I asked – no, let me start a little bit earlier. Madame Bricq, the former French Minister of Trade, wrote me a letter some time ago saying: why don't you make the mandate public? It was their mandate, it is not mine. It is a Council document. It is not a parliamentary document. And again in May we had the discussion at my request with the Council, a very long discussion by the way, to make the mandate public. Again there was no majority for doing that. Now it seems that finally they have come to the conclusion that maybe it is not such a bad idea to make it public. By the way, everybody has it. It is on the Internet. So what are you talking about? It is on the Internet. You are questioning me on the basis of texts that you have, but that obviously you have not read, because if you had read those texts you will see that we are not going to change the phytosanitary norms, the norms for the protection of the environment, for labour rights and whatever. It is explicitly in the mandate that you all have, or at least you should have read before starting this debate. On the problem of the reading rooms: I am against reading rooms. I do not like them. What is the problem with this? The problem with this is that the United States – which is also a big economy, they are also negotiating a lot of trade agreements, for example the trans-Pacific partnership with a lot of countries in Asia – the way that they inform their Members of Parliament is by inviting them to a reading room, having the documents at their disposal. They can read them, they get information about it, they can ask questions about it, they cannot take copies and hopefully they leave happy. That is the practice on the Hill in Washington. You should understand from me that it is rather difficult to convince the Americans to give to us more than they give to their own Members of Parliament about their text. Because our texts are known, our positions are known. It is about their positions. If they give us a document saying: ‘You can only make it available to your parliamentarians the way we make it available to our parliamentarians’, I cannot change much about that. But can you call that secrecy? Really, anybody who wants to follow what happens – I hope he or she does not get bored, that is something else – can amuse themselves every day with it. Every day there is something new about this. It must be fascinating, because so many people are interested in knowing something that does not yet exist. Because everybody is against this agreement to my knowledge – and I should know – but there is no agreement yet. We started the negotiations a year ago; we have six rounds of negotiations, the sixth one is ongoing at the moment. We have had two political stock-takes. We are making progress on a number of issues but we still have an enormous number of difficulties: with respect to market taxes for example, where we say that we need much more market access for public procurement, much more; where we say that not all tariffs will disappear, that there will be a number of sensitive agricultural products where the tariffs as such will not disappear. Probably there will be a system of what they call TRQs, tariff rated quotas, but we are not going to give that up. We are not negotiating about lowering standards in these negotiations. For example, we are negotiating how we could make a number of regulations more compatible by sticking to the levels of protection that we presently have in the European Union. That is what we are doing, with a lot of time and effort, with dozens of people continuously working on it. And yes, making progress, but also realising that this will be a very difficult agreement, because we have a lot of offensive interests in this agreement, on everything: on market taxes, on tariffs, on services, on public procurement, on investment, on regulations. But we have also defensives on almost everything, and you can imagine that this is not the most comfortable position when you are a negotiator. So these are difficult negotiations and we are working hard on it but please, as a lot of Members have been saying at the end of the intervention, judge on the result. Do not forecast a result that I do not have the faintest idea about myself, because we are in this process of negotiation. There has been a specific question and maybe I should say something about it, about national parliaments. Will the national parliaments have to pronounce on this? I think so, for the very simple reason that this will be a mixed agreement. If it comes about it will be a mixed agreement, and if it is a mixed agreement then national parliaments also have to pronounce. But we are not making those rules, read the Lisbon Treaty and you will see that for a pure trade agreement you only need the agreement, the ratification by the European Parliament. If it is mixed, it is also the national parliaments, and we comply with the rules that exist and that we respect. Yes, we will continue to make initiatives to get more transparency into the process. I can tell you that over the last months I have spoken, I do not know how many times exactly but certainly more than 100 times, about TTIP in all kinds of places that I had never been before. On ISDS, please give me a little bit of time to respond to about 50 interventions that have been made, because if not, they will say afterwards that I have not been transparent. We received 150 000 replies to our consultation on ISDS: 150 000, that is a lot. But tens of thousands of these replies are identical because it is obvious that there are people in Europe that are very good at working with all these tools and obviously they have found a way of entering a reply without getting into the system. Normally you have to get into the system and then you have to read 12 questions and you have to answer 12 questions and then you have to send your reply. A way has been found to circumvent this and give replies without getting into the system, with the result that tens of thousands of these replies are identical. So we will now analyse all this very scrupulously, qualitatively and quantitatively, and we will see what is in it. Once we have that we will make a report on it, and once that report is ready it will be at everybody’s disposal, yours first of all, and then we will discuss this with Member States in the Council of Ministers and with the European Parliament, and then the Commission – probably the next one – will make up its mind about what they will do with ISDS with the rest of the negotiation. That is the process that we will follow. It will take time. It will take a lot of time and I think some officials in the Commission can forget about their summer holidays. Let me just tackle one more issue that has been mentioned – it is very interesting for the climate in which all this is happening – and that is geographical indications (GIs). We get attacked because maybe GIs will not be protected, and this would be terrible. By the way, this European Commission has been doing more than anybody else to protect GIs. In all the agreements that we have been concluding – with Canada, with Singapore – there is now a full protection of GIs in the EPAs, so we have really fostered that idea. Whatever we get in this agreement with the United States on GIs, it will be more than we presently have. Do not start from the assumption that at present GIs are protected in the United States. What we will try to do is protect them in the United States and we will make sure that it happens, but presently this is not the case, so you should rather be in favour of TTIP if you are for the protection of GIs. Let me finish, Madam President, because I see that you are going to interrupt me very soon and I have a lot of understanding for that. Let us try to be a little bit more rational in this whole discussion. I have participated in the European elections not in an active way but in a passive way, and I am very happy to say that today, finally, I can also participate in an active election campaign meeting. But that is what a Parliament is for. What Parliament is also for is looking at the arguments, listening to the arguments and discussing on the basis of arguments, and then of course in all freedom, in full sovereignty, voting on what the Commission finally, sooner or later, will propose to you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0,

The EU industry is also likely to benefit from the agreement - the estimated revenue for the EU is around 120 billion a year. For consumers, the contract means cheaper products, especially electronic equipment, which are still so eagerly imported from the USA. However, the opening of markets carries the risk of lowering EU standards in terms of consumer safety and employment conditions. TTIP is also often compared to ACTA, due to the high risk of insufficient protection of personal data for EU citizens. The mechanism known as \"investor-state dispute settlement\" (ISDS) raises the most doubts, i.e. a provision contained in international trade agreements, which gives the investor the right to initiate proceedings against the state in which he conducts business.

That is why the Council has made this one of its priorities since 2008, when the European Commission presented its proposal. The European Parliament, given the importance of this issue, has also done a very important job. The negotiations in the Council were an important negotiation, a negotiation that was also very difficult. It is very difficult because of the distance of positions within the Council and the considerable distance between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. What are the biggest points of difficulty? Differences in substance have emerged between the different national social systems in this area. Very significant differences in substance which reflect a considerable diversity between social systems at national level in the various Member States. Cost difficulties have arisen, difficulties which should not be underestimated in general terms but which should not be underestimated, especially in times of considerable pressure on public budgets. Finally, difficulties applied to subsidiarity have arisen because of the very different traditions and practices between the different Member States. With regard to differences in substance, I would like to cite, for example, the issue of the duration and timetable of the compulsory period of leave, on which there are strong differences and also strong differences of view between the various Member States in the Council. As far as costs are concerned, no agreement has certainly been possible and I think it is very difficult even in a possible subsequent negotiation on the European Parliament's request for a minimum of twenty weeks with regard to leave. This is a request on which there has been no advanced and in-depth discussion and certainly no agreement in the Council.  In terms of subsidiarity, Let me give other examples. Some Member States have raised the fact that some of the rules covered by the legislative proposal are already included in national legislation. I am thinking of free time for breastfeeding, special working arrangements for parents of disabled children or additional maternity leave in certain cases. The Council considered that the detailed provisions, including those implementing the minimum standards, were therefore a more a matter for the Member States. More generally, however, the Member States have reaffirmed their commitment to the safety and health of pregnant workers and those who have given birth or are breastfeeding, and there is strong recognition in the Council of the importance of reconciling work and private life. However, on the question of improving the current rules on the protection of pregnant workers and promoting a better work-life balance, we must find the appropriate instruments in the right policy area. It would be difficult for the Council to accept these proposals from the European Parliament in the context of health and safety legislation. However, this in no way restores the valuable contribution made by this Parliament to the debate on this issue. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the discussions that I have simply summarised in my speech have therefore revealed very concrete and substantial differences between the views in the Council and the position of the European Parliament at first reading, and it is in the light of these strong contrasts and major differences that the Commission has concluded that it must consider withdrawing its proposal. This is certainly a prerogative which the Treaties grant the Commission. The Commission certainly has the opportunity at all times to present and withdraw its legislative proposals. It is therefore institutional assessments which are the responsibility of the Commission and which only the Commission can make. These are assessments related to the proper functioning of legislative activity and the implementation of the Refit rules, which are also entrusted to the evaluation of the European Commission. And then there are assessments of political opportunity and of these, in particular, I would like to talk to you in the conclusion. We believe as the rotating Presidency that the issue of the protection of pregnant workers at European level is of the utmost importance and of the utmost importance in view of the wider social dimension that we must develop in the internal market and is also of the utmost importance as a subject of social rights. So as far as it concerns the presidency-in-office, we can try again, it is worth trying again, and we are also ready, if we start from a new political basis and start from a new beginning, to look again at the proposal in the Council and in Parliament. We are prepared to see if the conditions are in place, working with the new rapporteur, to restart, to try to prevent the proposal from reaching a dead track. It is clear that if we want to make progress and really want to reopen the issue, we need to make progress on both sides. Therefore, it is certainly necessary to see whether the political conditions are in place, starting with relations between Parliament and the Council, to restart legislative negotiations by listening to each other's reasons. The Presidency is prepared, if it is equally willing to make a fresh start on different political bases, to consider whether this debate can be reopened in the Council of Ministers, given the importance we attach to this dossier, but without concealing all the difficulties and obstacles that I have on time with examples given in my introduction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 227, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Siim Kallas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is committed to helping EU citizens, men and women, to better combine work and family life. The fact that the maternity leave proposal has been identified in the REFIT communication of June 2014 as a candidate for withdrawal does not change that. Since 2008, when the proposal was presented, the Commission has sought its adoption. The Commission has acted as an honest broker between Parliament and the Council to find common ground. This has proven to be difficult. The Commission’s proposal on the Maternity Leave Directive has not been discussed for more than two and a half years despite numerous attempts by the Commission to reinvigorate negotiations between co-legislators. The proposal has been effectively blocked in the legislative process for too long, with no progress at all for almost three years. In spite of considerable efforts it has been impossible to break this stalemate and engage in any serious negotiations. As you know, one of the intentions of the REFIT exercise is to withdraw proposals where no negotiations have taken place for a significant period of time and which lack any prospects for adoption. It does not mean that the Commission does not believe anymore in its initial objectives. On the contrary it could allow for a fresh, new start on the subject to the greater benefit of EU citizens with a more modern text that would notably include in its scope paternity leave, as requested by Parliament. The Commission remains committed through its Europe 2020 Strategy to helping women to stay in the labour market rather than being excluded from it because they chose to have children.

Women and men should have the same right and opportunity to work. Having children should not be an obstacle for women in working life. Stronger protection must be given to working parents, but the solution going forward is not to legislate from Brussels. That is why I welcome the Commission's withdrawal of the Maternity Leave Directive. Family policy should be decided at national level. There are big differences in Europe and I understand the challenges in some countries, but we cannot have a solution that suits everyone in the EU. In Sweden, for example. we have come a long way. Of a total of 1.5 years per child, at least 2 months must be taken out by each parent, and the mother and father can receive a bonus if they share more equally. Therefore, the directive would be a real step backwards for the entire Nordic region. It is incomprehensible that the Swedish Social Democrats, who are EU skeptics, are now pushing to force Swedish women to stay at home - whatever they want. Implementing a work ban for women giving birth from Brussels is not the way forward for gender equality. Maternity leave, Madam President, should be parental leave. The proposal gives the wrong signal by only mentioning women as parents and thus solely responsible for the children. It is shared parental leave that is real equality. We will encourage both parents to take care of their children and spend time with them. It is a decision that must be made by the parents themselves and not top-down by politicians. Of course, women should not have to give up their career ambitions, and it is important that employers give women the opportunity to return to working life without discrimination.

The legislature that has just started gives us a great chance, that of making these five years the years in which Europe gets back on its feet and once again becomes a beacon of civilization and growth. We have a great responsibility: to restore hope to European citizens, not by virtue of a Europe to be saved but of a new Europe to be built. To do this, however, to build a Europe of hope, capable of looking to the future with optimism, women must be given the opportunity to have a profound impact on our economies, without having to choose between having a job or having a child, between building present or imagine the future, and there must be a sign of great discontinuity with the past, that of having succeeded in having here in the Chamber a clear commitment on our part to the directive on maternity leave. After all, how could we explain, how would we explain to European citizens that after years of discussion, after six years of organizing workshops, seminars, conferences and debates on this directive, the best solution we had found was to postpone everything once again to date to be decided? We cannot wait any longer. Europe must also change direction in response times to social and economic emergencies, such as that of female employment and the gender pay gap, emergencies directly connected to the reconciliation of times between motherhood and work. The Europe that invests in women and their work is a Europe that grows economically. There is no change if in Europe women, for the same job, are still paid 25% less than men. But there will also be no developed Europe as long as the typical manager of a public or private company is a man of over fifty. A country where women undertake, invest and create wealth is a country destined to grow and renew itself continuously, because when women work it is the entire economy that smiles with them. I am a woman and like many women I care much more about concrete results than ideological foreclosures. I am happy that the new Commission President Juncker has explicitly declared his commitment to the Maternity Leave Directive and I am proud that this legislature has opened with the Presidency of the Council chaired by the Italian government, which has made gender balance the priority of its political and pedagogical action. So let's get around a table and get the discussion going as quickly as possible because it is the citizens of Europe who ask us. As rapporteur on this topic, together with the FEMM commission and together with all of you, I will do a careful work of listening and mediation because it is clear that in the European context the sensitivities, traditions and starting positions of the individual countries are very different, but I deeply believe that the time is ripe for a cultural revolution that will translate into points of GDP, all those that women will produce when they are no longer forced to choose between work and children.

I very much welcome the fact that the EU Commission is withdrawing the Maternity Protection Directive. I would like to say three brief reasons for this. First: the less the EU regulates, the better, in principle. Let us not forget that every member state has a democratically elected parliament and a democratically legitimized government. Let them take care of it. The head of government of the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, said here today in Parliament that the EU is not such a democracy. He explicitly said that he would not serve Parliament, and he said that Parliament has a right to ask questions - a right to ask questions! - and this right to ask questions will not be curtailed for now. We are of course very grateful to Mr Juncker for that, but that is not democratic in that sense. Second, maternity protection is not a competence of the European Union. The European Union claims responsibility for labor rights and labor market policy, the European Union is expressly not responsible for family policy. That is not even claimed by the EU. But let's look at the Maternity Protection Policy. The basic question arises: what is this directive about? Is a pregnant woman about the protection of an employee or an expectant mother? A pregnant woman must be protected - yes, of course. An expectant mother is the core of a new family. And that is why the protection of an expectant mother is the special protection of a family and thus family policy, for which the member states are responsible and not EU labor market policy. This brings me to my third point: Because the protection of mothers is so important, we should send a signal from this Parliament to the national parliaments: You, the national parliaments, protect mothers, raise your voice for it! With the mothers you protect the children, and with the children you protect the future!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 235, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Marian HARKIN", "mepid": "28116", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE group. – Madam President, as we start a new term with Parliament and the Commission we are faced with an impasse from the last Parliament and we have a responsibility to find a solution. We simply must find compromise with the Council and, equally, the Council must find compromise with Parliament otherwise we have a dysfunctional system. Furthermore just as we Members of the European Parliament nailed our colours to the mast when we voted either for or against this directive, I believe Member States who are part of the blocking minority need to explain to their citizens, both women and men, why they are blocking a Maternity Leave Directive that would help guarantee equality of treatment for mothers and babies across the EU. I totally oppose the withdrawal of this directive and I am pleased that the Council will work to ensure its adoption. Personally I support the proposal for 20 weeks’ paid leave. After all, that is the norm in this Parliament. Are we saying that other women deserve less? Indeed this directive will support many women who are lower paid and not in permanent and pensionable jobs. This directive also protects pregnant women against discrimination and helps to ensure the health and safety of mothers and newborns. It also makes a huge contribution to achieving a core principle of EU policy: that is the achievement of gender equality and the elimination of the gender pay gap. But as I said earlier, we need to find compromises. Perhaps there could be some flexibility in the 20-week period of leave, only in that there could be some interchange between maternity and paternity leave to cater for national preferences, and perhaps some flexibility as to the time taken before and after birth. Also, perhaps some lead time towards a 20-week fully paid maternity leave. But there should be no question that this directive would lower standards in Member States that already have higher standards.  It is crucial that we achieve compromises on these issues, otherwise it languishes in a sort of limbo and many pregnant women in the EU will not have the possibility of a reasonable time frame of paid maternity leave and strong protection in their jobs when pregnant or breastfeeding.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 236, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Inês Cristina ZUBER", "mepid": "111589", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, it is curious that today, in a Portuguese newspaper, there was a news on the front page: more and more pregnant women or mothers who have recently arrived in the emergency room of hungry hospitals, including women who are workers and who live in poverty, although they have a job. And it is also curious that it is precisely now, at this time when women need it most, that the European Commission is in a hurry to make the possibility of guaranteeing the 20 weeks of maternity leave and 2 weeks of paternity paid in full disappear. It is significant that the European Council is always on the same page about cuts in wages and workers' rights - that is no longer a problem - but it cannot find a consensus to strengthen the rights of working families and mothers.

For example, I welcome the statements made by the Commission to include paternity leave in a new formulation of the directive, but I wonder why the Commission has not given any signals in this direction so far.

The original wording of the 2008 text was limited to improving the working conditions of pregnant and breastfeeding women in paid work. But in this House, the text has begun to change in a substantial way. The requirement for gender mainstreaming put in place by the Commission has led to the extension of the scope of the directive to paternity leave, adopted children and other requirements. Finally, Parliament approved a position that went well beyond the original scope of the amendment, despite the fact that it was clear that Member States would never support such a text. For example, also because women's income during maternity leave is defined differently in each Member State and can come from different sources: the insurance company, the employer or directly from the state. The amount of this income also varies and it is basically impossible to find a working European compromise. The significant extension of this directive in the European Parliament has ultimately failed to raise the existing European standard for the protection of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the labor market. For this reason, I will support it if the Commission decides to withdraw the proposal and recast it. Let this be a lesson for us in the future that the documents we receive should remain true to their title. I am in favor of introducing a compulsory maternity leave of 6 weeks in the European Union, as recommended by the World Health Organization.

For me and for us, maternity leave is an important building block of a social Europe. Even employed women want and must be able to have children. We must do everything we can to protect and support them. The International Labor Organization and the World Health Organization show us the necessary standards. This ensures the health of children and mothers in Europe. For example, children can be breastfed longer. In this way, many secondary diseases are avoided, and the risk of mothers developing secondary diseases is also reduced. If some people here and outside talk about costs: These are also costs that will no longer be incurred in the future if sickness periods are avoided, if health costs are avoided.

You just have to take note - the President-in-Office of the Council described it in detail: There are different regulations on maternity protection in 28 Member States. That relates to the length of maternity leave, that relates to the financing systems, that relates to the various social partners that are involved in this maternity protection issue. In short, it just doesn't work to believe that one model can solve all problems. In my country, in Germany, we have a combination of maternity and parental leave models - wonderful, but that didn't work with the approach proposed by the Commission. I am happy that the Commission is now taking note of the facts: if there are no majorities in the European Council and together with Parliament, then one must also draw the conclusions and withdraw a directive that has been submitted. Each of us is for maternity protection, each of us is for maternity protection. In my country, I've done that for many years.

Therefore, I ask the Italian Presidency to make the effort that it has put forward in this plenary session to open the debate and to make it possible for there to be a movement in order to be able to negotiate a common position that, then, makes possible the debate with the European Parliament, because we are talking about policies that benefit the health of working women, but we are also talking about other important issues, such as labor rights. The European Parliament proposed in this Directive that it be prohibited to dismiss pregnant women or women who have given birth in the last six months, issues of labor rights that are necessary today more than ever, because we have gone back light years in what is the defense of workers' rights in the European Union. Therefore, we talk about labor rights, mothers' health, reconciliation between family and work life, and also the need to advance this paternity leave so that men can assume responsibility for the care of their children. children, in order to favor that conciliation. Much remains to be done: we cannot remain impassive. We cannot convey to European citizens that we are not capable of advancing in this social Europe of rights and citizens.

One thing is very clear: we have - Ms. Niebler mentioned it - different concepts for parental leave, different concepts for maternity protection in the European Union. But maternity protection - namely proper conditions for maternity protection, good minimum standards for maternity protection - these are really the absolute basics, the little multiplication tables that we have for the European welfare state. We should therefore continue this commitment now and not bury our heads in the sand. Crisis or not - it's about protecting women workers, who are of course particularly vulnerable. Pregnant women, as many have said before me, should be protected. The health of the child and mother should be respected. Not in spite of, but especially in the crisis, we need particularly high standards, because the pressure on the labor market is increasing and affects women particularly hard. I would like to refer to the REFIT communication, because here a particularly large number of areas that are important from the employee's point of view are called into question for cost reasons.

Let us not forget also that today the pregnant woman or the young mother are both the most vulnerable workers and the crisis has not. only worsens the situation of these workers.

Mrs Mann, Mrs Šuica, Mrs Ansip and Mrs Corazza Bildt raised the danger of working, if necessary, or reopening a debate, reopening work on one-size-scale solutions. Of course, no one wants one-size-size-will solutions and, in my speech, I raised one of the issues that was the subject of negotiations in the Council, which is the issue of subsidiarity. However, it is clear that we are based on a 1992 directive and it is therefore clear that the European Union has competence in this matter. It will be a question of seeing the degree of legislative intervention, but not of whether or not the European Union has competence in this area. Of course, this is a very important subject, on which there are very strong national sensitivities, and so it is certainly necessary to find, if work is reopened, a balance between the different traditions and we also need to reconcile social values, sometimes the different social values which, as has emerged in the debate in the Council but also today, are linked to the family. Mr Moretti gave a very interesting indication to the Presidency, because he has shown as a new rapporteur a clear commitment to moving the debate forward if we start – and I will cite it – from new political bases on which we need – I would add – a commitment that the rotating Presidency confirms, but which is also necessary on the part of the new European Parliament. I agree with Mrs Harkin on the need to find a compromise. As Vice-President Kallas said, a compromise is certainly much better than a blockade, because blocking legislation is of no use to anyone. However, a compromise requires flexibility, a magic word at this beginning of the parliamentary term, and we need flexibility. And flexibility and flexibility, when there are two authorities that have to decide, must be demonstrated by both sides. It must be shown that there is a commitment to see the possibilities on the part of the rotating Presidency, but it must also be demonstrated by the new European Parliament. I would therefore also like to reassure Mr Zuber that we would like to work towards a consensus on the substance, because we share social concerns on the substance. There is certainly a will on the substance, during the work of our Presidency and in any case as our position, to work also on possible minimum standards that are acceptable to all. We therefore also want to acknowledge the important work that this institution has done during the last parliamentary term and also the efforts that previous presidencies have made on this issue. However, it is clear that, given the different positions still far between our two institutions, the only possibility that we are prepared to make, on which we are prepared to work to make further progress, is that these positions on both sides, on both sides, evolve considerably in substance. Therefore, as I said in my introductory remarks, if there were a concrete political sign from both legislators of significant movements, the Italian Presidency would be more than happy to take the opportunity to see if further progress could be made. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Steinruch, Mrs Vallina, Mr Urtasun, Mrs Ludvigsonn and Mrs Honeyball, who have referred differently to the fact that this directive has been blocked for four years. If they know and have followed four years of negotiations, they are also aware of the obstacles in these negotiations. There is not four years left by chance, there are four years left because there are very strong obstacles in the Council. So, without modification it is difficult to advance after four years of deadlock. I would like to thank Mr Costa, Mr Arena, Mr Regner, Mr García Pérez and Mrs Bilbao on their confidence in the Italian Presidency. I confirm our commitment to developing a social dimension and I confirm our commitment to them too, to starting well with cooperation between the two institutions in legislative matters, perhaps seeing if it is possible to open this dossier again. Serious work has been done by the European Parliament and has been done by the Council of Ministers. Despite the seriousness of the work done by the Council of Ministers and Parliament, the positions are a long way off. Mr Rodrigues, no disrespect to your institution but, as Mr Tarabella rightly pointed out, can we work on a median way of compromise? If there is the political will of the European Parliament and the Council to work on a median compromise route, the Presidency is at your side in working on this path. And this would, in my view, be the best way, in our view, to have that fresh new start, that new beginning which I was pleased to hear vice-president Kallas mention and which, as you know, is the motto of the Italian Presidency-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 266, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "The debate is closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 267, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "signed up. - Mr President, in 2010, the European Parliament gave a very clear signal of the need for a European Directive on pregnant workers.

This practice is regressive and threatens women's rights and gender equality. It is very sad that even in the 21st century, women are punished for childbirth by their employers, instead of creating the right conditions for them. I am clearly in favor of extending maternity leave from the current 14 weeks to 20, and I also think that employers should guarantee mothers a return to their previous job. I do not understand the EC procedure, because the vast majority of large multinationals are not opposed to this increase in maternity leave.

The operation to destroy chemical weapons in the Syrian arsenal has already produced results. Results that resulted in the removal of chemical weapons components from Syria. We as the Rotating Presidency of the European Union are speaking for information purposes, because the Union has contributed to the budget, but it is an operation that has been carried out by 28 European States, which are also members of the European Union, and not, as far as most of the decisions on operations are concerned, by the European Union as such. However, it is certainly very important to discuss and inform you this evening of this issue. It is certainly also important because it is a fundamental objective to ensure security in our neighbourhood as the European Union. The plan for the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons that we are talking about has been drawn up, wanted, outlined under the control of the Oganisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons and the United Nations, and the World Health Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme have also contributed to the operation. Of course, the 28 Member States of the European Union have been actively involved in the decisions of the operations. Joint planning by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations concluded that hydrolysis of chemical weapons on board the American ship Cape Ray was the best solution under the circumstances. The American ship is simply used as a platform, where hydrolysis operations must take place. It's a process that basically consists of dissolving chemical components through various salts, and it's a method that has been used by the United States for many years to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. The planning was made public, as were the decisions of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons through the Executive Committee. A mission between the Organisation and the United Nations has also organised two major information events, including on board the ship Cape Ray, to explain to major environmental non-governmental organisations and international media how operations to remove Syrian chemical weapons first from Syria and then destroy Syrian chemical weapons were carried out in full compliance with national laws and international regulations. It is a process that has also been successfully used previously in the case of Libya. All the measures taken by the two organisations to ensure the safety of operations and to ensure environmental safety have also been indicated. The European Union, for its part, is aware of the international importance of this effort. It was at the forefront of this operation from the outset, however much it could contribute, and it did so in the initial stages through a contribution of EUR 5 million to start the activities of the joint mission and subsequently also contributed to the Special Trust Fund of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons with a further EUR 12 million, precisely intended to finance the destruction of weapons. These are the only legal contributions made by the European Union as such. Of course, many other Member States of the European Union have also made important financial contributions and also important contributions in kind, which I would like to mention. A particular appreciation of the Presidency of the Council goes to Denmark, which, together with Norway, has contributed commercial vessels to the operations and also to Denmark and the United Kingdom for having also given the military supplies necessary for arms removal operations.  Italy, for its part, has made available the port of Gioia Tauro to carry a part, the most important and most important part of these chemicals, the so-called \"priority 1\", on board the American ship Cape Ray. This has been an essential part of the process of destruction. Three other Member States – Finland, Germany and the United Kingdom – have also confirmed that they are willing to contribute and can contribute to the destruction of further chemical weapons by making their civilian facilities available. We would also like to express our thanks and appreciation to the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and to the United Nations Special Coordinator and their teams for the truly outstanding work and commitment they have shown throughout this operation.  We think it was only natural that the Organization for the Prohibition of Arms In 2013, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to world security and peace. The operations will soon be completed and so the Member States of the Union and also, at least in part, the Union itself will have made an important and practical contribution to reducing some of the suffering in Syria and to contributing to a potential peace on which we certainly still have a great deal to do in the days and weeks ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 278, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Massimiliano SALINI", "mepid": "125670", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Undersecretary Gozi's request that he goes in the direction of obtaining that clarification, that transparency to which the communities of the member countries are entitled in terms of information.

We Greens fully support both the production and destruction of all chemical weapons in the area - on the road to a Middle East completely free of chemical weapons. That in itself is a goal that all states in the Non-Proliferation Treaty are behind. But destroying them is not easy and it is not risk-free and it must be done under the greatest possible safety. Transporting weapons long distances by air is not an option. Since no country in the immediate area has offered to deal with the destruction within its territory, the least bad model has been chosen. This means that they are first destroyed on board the Cape Ray on the high seas and then transported to a number of countries with special capacity to incinerate the toxic waste. For maximum safety, the boat should be in a place where it is protected from severe weather and wind conditions, but no state has agreed to that.

So where are the procedures in case of an accident? What are the evacuation plans in the event of an environmental emergency? Why hasn't the population been made aware of all this? I say this because, in this case, the Greek people and the people of Southern Italy are running the above risks - as usual - with particular reference to Calabria, Puglia and Sicily. All these peoples are already united by a common state of extreme poverty. All these people are also united by exposure to a myriad of other risk factors deriving from the legal and illegal disposal of toxic waste, from the dissemination of landfills of various types on the territory, from all forms of licit and illicit incineration, from extraction practices of oil and methane gas both offshore and on land.

Certainly the debate was an important and welcome debate because there is a need to inform. There is a need to inform the honorable parliamentarians, there is a need to inform, through this debate and the action that individual governments must also take, the communities involved and also explain all the important security measures that have been taken and inform also of operations during the whole duration of the dismantling process. So, from this point of view, it is certainly good that there is this debate, it is good that there is this dialogue between the current Presidency, representing the High Representative, and Parliament. There were some specific points that deserve a more specific answer. First of all, I confirm that this is an operation that operates within the framework of a UN resolution and also under the supervision of the UN. Secondly, why couldn't these operations be carried out in Syria? Because due to the conflict, due to the situation of insecurity, it was absolutely impossible to undertake such an important initiative in the midst of the Syrian conflict. Because hydrolysis in the sea was asking, it seems to me, Mr Pedicini, also invoking history - I would not invoke recent history, because it could lead to results different from those you were referring to. Because there was no possibility of doing it on earth. There was no possibility of doing it on land because no country in the region agreed to land its operation due to the negative reactions of public opinion. It is about Syrian chemical weapons. In the first phase of the Syrian conflict, the whole world was asking to intervene to stop the use of chemical weapons and to work for an action to destroy chemical weapons. I believe that the fact that this operation is now underway should be widely appreciated, because at the time international, European and Italian public opinion asked all governments to intervene precisely to prevent the terrible suffering of the Syrian people from being added to the inadmissible and hateful use of chemical weapons. And this is the operation that is responding to that request of citizens, to that request of public opinion. It has been said that hydrolysis is experimental. It has been in use, according to the information I have been given, in the United States for many years for the destruction of their chemical weapons stocks. As regards the questions of material related to chemical weapons, the object of these operations will be stowed in the Cape Ray ship and will be transferred, as was also mentioned by one of the honorable Members, to Germany and Finland to burn it. Therefore, during this operation, they will not be missions either at sea or in the air. Again in reply to Mr Grammatikakis and Mr Pedicini, I inform that all measures have been taken by the staff of the Cape Ray vessel who have been trained to respond to any problems that may arise during this process. Lastly, there was talk of hypocrisy with regard to what I said about the European Union. But this is not hypocrisy - Mr Sakorafa is no longer there but I will answer you anyway. The European Union is simply not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, it is not a member of it, it is not even an observer member, and therefore the European Union as such does not participate in the executive council that takes the decisions of this organization. As I said, 28 European states participate, which are also European Union member states. In conclusion, Madam President, we are convinced that the Syrian chemical weapons destruction program has been a success and must continue because it is a very important commitment that the international community has made and that must continue and it is essential to also prevent the reuse of these illegal weapons. against the Syrian people to whom we must not add further suffering to what it is already suffering. We have received, as I said, specific information, which I have shared with you in this debate, regarding the reasons why this operation takes place on the American ship and also the modalities. In conclusion, I can confirm the pacifying nature of this operation to Mr Salini. I have no doubt that this operation is a contribution to peace, which has been preceded and which will have to be followed by many other contributions, because we are talking about a situation in which a real humanitarian tragedy is taking place.

Lithuania becomes 19th member of the euro zone.

Parliament gives the green light for this accession: yesterday in the ECON committee with a large majority, tomorrow in plenary and on 23 July in the Council. Welcome, Lithuania, to the euro zone! The government and parliament in Lithuania have worked hard since 2006 and met all the criteria: a stable exchange rate, low inflation despite increased energy dependency due to the shutdown of two nuclear power plants in Ignalina in 2006 and 2009, low interest rates on national debt, low national debt, a limited deficit. All of this has been achieved in spite of the huge financial market crisis, the economic downturn and a tendency among young people to move outside, even a wave of emigration, if you will. The signs now point to economic recovery, solid finances and a reliable political framework. We welcome Lithuania as the nineteenth member of the euro area, and I hope others will follow - perhaps sooner than expected when I think of the discussion in Poland. The euro itself is stable internally and externally with low inflation rates, a high exchange rate against the dollar - the world's most important currency - and has established itself as the second world reserve currency. But to those who see the euro only as an economic project, as a unit of account, one has to say: the euro is a political project. That is why judgments that overlook the political dimension and blame only econometric models for the success or failure of the euro are wrong and short-sighted. Despite many attacks, the euro has held its own against speculators and financial market turbulence, especially against individual members. I am thinking of those who have been in trouble and in some cases still are, such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland or Cyprus. The Stability and Growth Pact is of course correct, but it was violated ten years ago by the two largest Member States, Germany and France. In the meantime we have made the regulations more flexible, strengthened them, and given the pact new teeth. The Commission and the Member States are called upon to keep their promises that we made in the two-pack, six-pack and the budget semester. Politicians have struck the right balance between reforms and solidarity, with guarantees and without major demands on taxpayers for the stabilization of the euro zone. That is the truth, ladies and gentlemen, and it is the responsibility of the European Central Bank, which has made full use of its monetary policy space within the framework of its mandate.

After the vote in this Parliament, it is envisaged that the Council will adopt final legislative proposals on adoption of the euro in Lithuania on 23 July to give Lithuania sufficient time to prepare for the 1 January 2015 changeover.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 292, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Burkhard BALZ", "mepid": "96997", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President! First of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur Werner Langen and his shadow rapporteurs very warmly for their work. Under enormous time pressure, also due to the start of the new legislative period, you submitted a very good, balanced report. This leaves no doubt that Lithuania is ready to adopt the euro. Lithuania, like its Baltic neighbors Estonia and Latvia, has made remarkable economic progress. I was personally impressed that the Lithuanian government, despite a failed attempt in 2006, did not allow itself to be dissuaded from its path. Comprehensive reforms and austerity measures have paid off. The numbers speak for themselves. Both the Commission recommendation and the ECB recommendation and the ECON report make it clear that the Maastricht criteria are clearly met. It is now important to maintain the efforts made so far in order to guarantee a sustainable positive development of the economy, also with regard to the convergence criteria. The committee voted clearly yesterday: 46 to 8 with one abstention. The positive result of the vote of the ECON members of the seventh legislative period on April 7, 2014 was thus impressively confirmed. I would therefore like to take the opportunity to speak out very clearly in favor of Lithuania joining the euro. Like Latvia's accession this year, it is another strong signal for the euro zone. The euro remains attractive as a currency. I am convinced that in Lithuania we will have another important and even reliable partner in the euro zone. Finally, I should like to say that, as rapporteur for Latvia’s introduction of the euro, I was very annoyed that we were not allowed to have a debate here. I am therefore all the more pleased that we can now hold this debate here in Parliament on such an important issue as Lithuania's accession to the euro.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 293, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Paul TANG", "mepid": "125020", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate the Lithuanian Government for the commitment it has shown to integrating into the eurozone, and its government for fulfilling all the criteria for entering into the eurozone.

The European Conservatives and Reformists Group, of course, have very different views on membership of the euro: there are representatives of the Member States who do not even consider membership of the euro, there are countries that have joined the eurozone even during the crisis. And I want to say that the ECR always respects the choice of the Member States, because it consists of so many aspects of why one country or another joined or did not join the eurozone. I myself am pleased that the three Baltic States are the only countries to have joined the eurozone during the crisis. And this, in my opinion, is an extremely important step with Lithuania's membership in the eurozone from the beginning of next year. Moreover, this year, it seems to me that the eurozone also includes a geopolitical aspect, at least in countries such as the Baltic States, because the national currency in a small country with an aggressive initiator is a certain threat. So I congratulate my Lithuanian colleagues and I would like to say that all the criteria of the convergence report are met, but I would like to say in two words about the gods aspects, which are also mentioned in the rapporteur's explanations. Firstly, on the financial sector. I am pleased that the Lithuanian financial sector is still less dependent on the cash flows of non-residents from third countries, as is unfortunately the case in some other countries, such as my own, Latvia. And the second position is on the energy sector in Lithuania, where I would also like to pay tribute to the last Lithuanian governments, which have made it possible to diversify gas supplies to the Lithuanian energy sector in the near future, which I believe is an extremely important achievement for the future.

The question is: why is there time pressure? We have the stress tests of the European banking system ahead of us; the results are not yet available. We have four years behind us in which the financial crisis was particularly severe because banks were unable to withstand a stressful situation. What is the reason for creating time pressure? Why not wait until the results of the stress test are also available for the Lithuanian banking system? There was a convergence test, a convergence report by the European Central Bank, in which the European Central Bank pointed out that the criterion of price stability was not met. The inflation rate in Lithuania is very volatile, recently it was double digits, it is now almost on the verge of deflation. Prices are threatening to fall. Prices that are not stable indicate severe macroeconomic imbalances. And these macroeconomic imbalances have to be balanced out through real adjustments, through unemployment, through loss of income, through tax increases or whatever, when there is no longer any exchange rate flexibility, when there is no longer any autonomous monetary policy. These burdens are borne by the population. And then you ask yourself: why is the population not being asked?

In my view, Lithuania’s successful participation in the euro area will depend on five factors. Firstly, on the quality of its preparation. Lithuania is much better prepared than Greece was 14 years ago. To give you an example, Lithuania’s public debt is less than 40% of GDP, whereas in Greece, my country, it was more than 100 %.  Secondly, Lithuania seems to be in a position to use the period following the adoption of the euro to solve its particular economic problems and catch up with the most advanced members of the euro area in terms of competitiveness. Thirdly, the euro area has developed a sophisticated control system and therefore the systemic risk has been greatly reduced. Fourthly, Lithuania has put its finances and its economy in order. It now needs more development opportunities and a better financed banking system. Finally, Lithuania has to cope with a somewhat unstable international environment but the most probable scenario is that there will not be a major crisis which could deny the country its successful participation in the euro area.

But it is also a sign that there is change going on in the Baltic region where some of the most modern, competitive and stable economies are emerging, not only in the Baltic area but also around the Baltic Sea, with the German economy, Finland, the three Baltic states. I know that some colleagues are suspicious of everything here but let us look at the big picture – Lithuania now firmly rooted in the European economy. But it is also a sign that you can make the changes. I think that those of you over there should worry much more about those countries which are not carrying out reforms, not making changes; not those that are showing that you can achieve a fundamental stability by the policies you need. I think you should be much more critical of those which are not trying to be in. From my point of view, from my Swedish perspective, what we now see is a new sign in the Nordic and Baltic region where I think it is even more important for Sweden to enter.  I congratulate Lithuania but I think we can also congratulate Europeans because now we know that you can make a change.

This is clearly illustrated by the fact that Lithuania fulfills all the Maastricht criteria and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 January 2015. The introduction of the euro in Lithuania, similarly to Latvia, will promote economic growth and increase prosperity. First, it will ensure lower interest rates on public and private borrowing, as the exchange rate risk between the litas and the euro will disappear. Financial markets and the membership of the international credit rating agency in the euro area are also perceived as positive news about the country's financial stability. Secondly, the currency conversion costs between the litas and the euro will disappear. In small and open economies such as the Baltic States, this is a significant cost factor. Third, the introduction of the euro will make the country more attractive to foreign direct investment, as it will be safer and more understandable for investors to work with the euro than with various small national currencies. The introduction of the euro in Lithuania is positive news for all the Baltic States. It reaffirms the achievements of the Baltic States in ensuring financial stability and economic growth, as well as demonstrates the region's attractiveness for attracting investment. With Lithuania's accession to the eurozone, the last currency barrier between the Baltic states will disappear, which will undoubtedly facilitate trade in the region.

I must make some remarks concerning the debate. First of all the Euro Group and Ecofin have both discussed the Lithuanian accession to the euro area and adoption of the euro and unanimously welcomed the results achieved by the Lithuanian people – and this was with the participation of the European Central Bank – so there was no doubt about the performance of the Republic of Lithuania. So it is very clear that the convergence evidence is very solid. It has been taken very seriously by all institutions including the European Commission and the European Central Bank. The inflation rate today is more or less coherent with the inflation rate all over the European Union. If you compare it with the inflation rate of 2008, that was a completely different time; you cannot say that this was a volatile time and make some kind of conclusion based on the evidence of 2008. Some Members of the European Parliament have advocated an autonomous monetary policy which can help to solve some social and economic problems, but I must say that Lithuania has abandoned its autonomous monetary policy – since 2002, if I am correct – so from that year there has been a fixed exchange rate. Lithuania joined the exchange rate mechanism a couple of years later, so it has already been in the system of the European monetary policy, and in this sense there is no change.  What I would also like to say is that people who cannot see the virtues, the positive signs of exchange rate stability should look back at the history of the European Union. From the beginning – 1957, throughout the 1960s – the economic policy of the European Union was poisoned by the constant quarrelling about exchange rates between the Member States. Some Member States changed their exchange rates without warning and this created a real feeling of urgency that if we want to have single functioning market we must also have a functioning and harmonised monetary environment, which means a single currency.  I would, of course, like to say as well that from the Commission’s viewpoint all the necessary procedures have been followed, and the Commission has no doubts about the democratic nature of the decision. As a Member from Lithuania said, all Member States who joined the European Union from 1 May 2004 have actually had referendums which contained this question. So it was already decided then; we had referendums in the Baltic countries and this was a part of our accession negotiations and our agreement on how to develop our economic policies further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 330, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Werner LANGEN", "mepid": "1928", "text": "Rapporteur. - Madam President! I wonder: all these critics who have spoken here, from the right and left, have disappeared. Not a single one listened to the arguments. This is not serious work! It's forgotten about history and irresponsible! The speeches here today did not reflect the election result of the European elections, nor did the opinion-making in the European Parliament. Let me start with one point: it is a legitimate choice. The Lithuanian government unanimously decided to join the euro. Parliament approved the law in April with 81 percent - 87 for, 7 against and 13 abstentions. That is a clear democratic majority. Anyone who now claims that this is not legitimate, that a referendum must be made, also does not want to acknowledge that after the most recent polls - all of which are quoted here from May 2013 - opinion has changed. The majority are now in favor of the euro and the number will continue to grow. When I hear politicians here who say that you have to surrender sovereignty - of course, joining the European Union is a surrender of sovereignty, of course! And the Lithuanian government, the parliament, have made efforts that are not only honorable, but from which the critics can learn a bit here. That is why we are convinced that Lithuania will join as soon as possible. More will follow: Sweden, Poland and more. I am absolutely convinced that the statements made by Mr Landsbergis and Mr Dombrovskis and by the former Romanian Prime Minister are true, that it is a successful project and that we support it with all our might. In any case, I am looking forward to Lithuania as the 19th member and hope that we will vote on the 20th and 21st next year. There was no question of time pressure. The only reason the report is made like this is that it has always been like this. I have been on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in this Parliament for 20 years. It has always been decided on the basis of the latest figures from June.

In such a situation, Lithuania's accession to the single currency area would be a mistake. Its own currency provides a good enough protection against the negative effects of the economic and financial crisis. In turn, the rapid introduction of the euro will immediately cause our country the problems currently facing the countries involved in monetary union, including the requirement to allocate large sums to bail out failing states. The euro does not unite, but deepens divisions, even between those countries that have adopted the single currency. The euro does not strengthen, but exhausts the European Union as the only region in the world that has fallen so badly into recession. Today, Lithuania should ask itself whether the euro is a reliable currency and whether it would not be better to keep its currency, at least until the situation in the euro area is clear and predictable. In the current situation, postponing the introduction of the euro seems to be the best solution. And, most importantly, it would be safe for the Lithuanian population, as it would protect them from a drastic increase in the prices of goods and services after a possible accession to the euro area, as was the case in almost all countries adopting the euro. We cannot allow the burden of the introduction of the euro to fall on ordinary Lithuanians, who have been struggling with the crisis for several years already. Lithuania must preserve its currency, because only an independent monetary policy will allow it to react flexibly to the economic situation in Europe and the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 333, "date": "2014-07-15.json", "name": "Miguel VIEGAS", "mepid": "125100", "text": "in writing. - Lithuania's preparation process for joining the euro is a painful exercise in forced austerity through which the people of Lithuania have been subjected to drastic measures with high social and economic costs. Contrary to what is said in the report that supports this accession, this process was far from being a success. It is no coincidence that this accession was rejected by the majority of the population in a referendum in May 2013. Indeed, Lithuania has in recent years gone through a period of great recession, with a strong contraction of the national economy, loss of power to purchase of workers, very high unemployment rates and forced emigration of a significant part of their youth. We continue to believe that the process of joining the euro represents an intolerable interference in national sovereignties, which thus lose an important instrument of economic policy and are subject to a single monetary policy at the service of the great powers of central Europe, an interference that is even more evident when it comes to a decision that ignored the will of the Lithuanian people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
