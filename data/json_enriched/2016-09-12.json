On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to begin by thanking the Italian civil protection, the fire brigade, the medical workers, the local authorities and all the volunteers: all those who helped to save lives, to provide protection and to guarantee primary care. The European Union will stand by the people in full solidarity. The earthquake caused severe material destruction. The villages that have been razed to the ground by these blows are not only Italian, they are also European cultural heritage. But the material damage disappears in the face of the human catastrophe and the pain of the families of the nearly 300 people who died. The houses, palaces and churches can be rebuilt and will certainly be rebuilt, but the emptiness left by the dead cannot be filled.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the future design of the energy market is, of course, a secondary issue in terms of the liberation of Vienna.  Today we are discussing the report presented by the Committee on Industry and trade in the matter, which was adopted by a good, large majority, with a view to the Commission's proposal of July 2015. Three policy objectives have been set for the future electricity market: firstly, to create an EU-wide electricity market with clear price signals for new investment. Secondly, a European approach to energy security should be established and, thirdly, regional cooperation in energy policy, in particular in investment in new energy generation plants, should be considerably strengthened.  As a result of the draft report, we have voted on a total of 590 amendments, which have been incorporated into a total of 36 compromises. The report covers the most important issues, that is, the question of the future design of capacity mechanisms, the promotion of renewable energies, the debate on price zones and distribution system operators, and the role of the European Energy Agency ACER.  The report sets out the direction for the legislative proposal to be presented by the Commission by the end of the year for a redesign of the energy market. Since the compromises have been largely broadly supported, it is quite possible to say that the most important steps towards harmonising the European internal energy market are included.  I would like to make a few brief comments as rapporteur on what the Committee on Industry has decided on: firstly, capacity mechanisms, which are paragraphs 25 and 24. Unnecessary or ill-designed mechanisms of this kind can lead to distortions of competition, to an impact on cross-border trade and to excessive electricity prices. The line adopted in committee provides that capacity mechanisms should continue to be possible if an EU-wide harmonised and transparent analysis of security of supply at regional level has shown that there is a need. This was not entirely uncontroversial, but we agreed on a wording that almost everyone could support.  The second issue is renewable energy , paragraphs 49 and 54. The Committee considers that the permanent subsidisation of renewable energies is no longer up-to-date. They, too, must respond to market signals in the new energy system. The report provides for a gradual phase-out of subsidies for mature renewable energies. It also highlights the risk of distortions caused by improper subsidies. Operators of renewable energy plants – and we know the intensive use of wind energy in the Nordic countries, including In Germany – must bear the consistent responsibility for the balance sheet. Priority network access will remain in place, but will be reviewed once the revamped energy market has been implemented.  Thirdly, the abolition of regulated prices and the debate on price zones, paragraph - 22. For the energy-only market to function properly, price spikes must generally be allowed, so that market price signals can also lead to investment and prices reflect the real energy shortage. This is not the case today, as can be seen from wholesale prices. Different price zones within a Member State must also be possible as an ultima ratio to reflect the actual energy shortage. And if we now see what diversions the electricity generated in northern Europe has to make in order to reach the consumer in the south, then that is an important issue.  The fourth point is that national responsibility for the energy mix, as laid down in the Treaties, should be maintained. Paragraph 47 refers to the Paris agreement on climate change, which takes account of the objective of gradual decarbonisation.  I added another two minutes for my group – a total of six minutes, Mr President!  Paragraph 53 rightly warns against the interlinking of supply targets with climate policy objectives. Separate votes have been requested here.  The fifth point is that distribution system operators, paragraphs 61 to 64. The report does not call for further unbundling beyond the third energy package. Distribution system operators should be neutral intermediaries, to whom a greater role is given.  Finally, the role of ACER, the European authority. It should be given decision-making powers in the coordination of cross-border issues, but not comprehensive monitoring of the energy market. can make a change.  Finally, I would like to thank all those who have contributed, especially the shadow rapporteurs – and now we have six minutes and two seconds of thanks!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Adam GIEREK", "mepid": "28379", "text": "  Rapporteur. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Heating and cooling affects the processing of around 40% of total primary energy – a major energy problem – into around 50% of total usable energy in the form of heat.  While electricity generation can be harmonised in the single energy market, heating and cooling require local solutions. However, heating and cooling depend on the energy market, which, for example, on a local scale, can use cogeneration for both electricity and heat or cold production. The diversity of the need to ensure thermal comfort for Union citizens is demonstrated by the fact that the annual energy consumption span per square metre of heated area varies from around 60 to even 300 kWh in the Member States. The largest reserves of efficient use of heat are in the thermomodernization of about two-thirds of the so-called old substance of residential, public and commercial buildings, as the simplest, fastest way to use energy most efficiently, reduce CO2 emissions and create numerous jobs. This means that public funding and existing limits should be increased for this priority, e.g. in the Regional Development Fund, especially when it comes to entire settlements built in big plate technology, for example. Unfortunately, this issue has been marginalised by us in the past. It was a mistake. We lost a lot of time. Next, it becomes necessary to replace outdated district heating plants with so-called system heat from high-performance combined heat and power plants. It is necessary to eliminate outdated small, non-organic district heating plants and switch to heat from high-performance cogeneration systems. This may be facilitated, for example, by a temporary shift away from the use of ETS in these heat and power production systems.  Account must also be taken of the difference between the West and the East of the Union in the use of more efficient gas for heating purposes. This amount is many times higher in the EU's Western European countries, while in Central and Eastern Europe for heating purposes it has so far been mainly based on coal, which requires a gradual reduction in its inefficient combustion. This efficiency needs to be improved. The bane of the agglomeration of this region of Europe is low emissions, i.e. emissions into the atmosphere of incomplete combustion of organic pyrolytic gases, including aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides and soot, as well as fly ash.  In southern European Member States, the problem of seasonal cooling is on the rise due to global warming, which involves around 5% of the energy from the total amount of energy for heating and cooling. The issue discussed today requires the use of many comprehensive forward-looking solutions, including: architectural and urban; use of natural heat and cooling sources. It requires the urgent development of innovative research and the creation of an entire industry of new thermal insulation materials and sustainable technologies for ecological heating and cooling with a particular focus on solar panels and reverse heat pumps.  In the future, the thermal comfort of the people of the European Union will depend primarily on zero-emission thermomodernization and on the optimal use of renewable energy sources for the whole climate zone.  Colleagues, priorities are known, but they should also be prioritised and implemented, according to a different hierarchy of importance in different Member States, because this will guarantee us the optimisation of the solutions achieved and the fight against energy poverty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by thanking this House, and in particular the two rapporteurs, for their supportive work on these two important files. Starting with the Langen report, I am very glad that this House shares our commitment to promoting a more market—oriented, flexible and decentralised energy system providing the right investment signals for the energy transition. Ultimately we need a system that puts prosperity and the decarbonisation of our economy at its very heart, and our review of market design rules will be key to that end. On the one hand, thanks to the three consecutive legislative packages, we have introduced competition to varying degrees in different markets and more cross-border flows of electricity. But, on the other hand, we have not yet managed to adapt our market framework sufficiently to the challenges that decarbonisation, and in particular the massive roll-out of variable renewable generation, have brought along. Adapting our energy system to the new challenges will require action on at least four fronts. First, we have to ensure that the new market design will work for consumers by making them more active market participants. Innovative and smart technologies are available but they are not properly used in many cases because the right regulatory framework is not there. Wholesale and retail markets must be more closely linked, giving consumers access to a wider choice of products, and consumers must be able to market their flexibility by removing obstacles for aggregators to enter the market. Second, we need electricity markets to give the right investment incentives for a successful energy transition by strengthening price signals. This means the price must be able to rise when demand is high or generation is scarce. Constraints on pricing must be removed, as a matter of the first order, so as to reward flexibility. It is in this context that our reforms will be aimed at promoting shorter markets. The integration of the European Union—wide intraday and cross—border balancing markets must be significantly accelerated. Third, a more integrated energy market will also require us to find new ways of deepening our cooperation across borders on all levels. But full market integration will also require the seamless cooperation of transmission system operators (TSOs) at operational level, and we will need to look at ways of strengthening regional TSO cooperation based on existing approaches. Likewise, more cooperation between regulators will be needed to match closer TSO cooperation and this includes reviewing the role of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). Lastly, while the aim of this exercise is to strengthen the internal market, public policy interventions are likely to remain a part of the reality. We will therefore need a stronger framework to ensure that such measures are compatible with the internal market. The most urgent issue is dealing with the generation adequacy policies that we see emerging in a number of Member States. In many cases these follow a purely national logic and focus exclusively on introducing measures to remunerate national generation capacities, without taking account of the benefits of market integration. This is not a viable approach and, if left untouched, it seriously risks distorting the internal energy market. That is why we will propose a European or regional framework for capacity remuneration mechanisms. The main purpose of such a framework will be offer a common approach to assess the adequacy of energy systems. From the Commission’s point of view, it is crucial that such an assessment takes into account the contribution of capacity across the border to security of supply. Likewise, when a capacity mechanism is introduced, such cross-border capacity, as well as demand response, must be able to participate. As a principle, this is already the case but with our proposals it must become a reality. Last but not least, let me pick up on another key point mentioned in the report. It is all well and good to update our market design, but we must absolutely commit ourselves to ensuring the effective implementation of the system legislation. That will continue to be a priority for the Commission. We will of course look at the report in detail as we prepare our proposals and I look forward to coming back to this House to present them later this year. Turning now to the Gierek report on heating and cooling, this report highlights the fact that this sector could be an absolute game changer when it comes to energy security, economic growth and reaching our energy and climate targets. The report places emphasis on the ‘energy efficiency first’ principle and the push for renewables to replace fossil fuels. It focuses on building renovation and the deployment of modern and smart technologies and systems, and highlights the need to reinforce the capacities of citizens, industries and public authorities through better information, awareness, training and education, research and innovation and targeted capacity—building initiatives. These all go in the direction of the Commission. Let me remind you that heating and cooling in our buildings and industry account for half of European Union energy consumption and are largely powered by fossil fuels. Seventy-five percent of our buildings are energy inefficient and are mostly fitted with old boilers with low efficiency rates. That is why our study focused on removing barriers to decarbonisation in buildings and industry. We need to link up heating and cooling to electricity networks and to renewable energy more effectively. That will reduce costs for consumers and provide storage for valuable energy. Our market design proposals will provide the flexibility and demand response to make that happen, and our upcoming review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive will prepare the ground for making buildings smart and ready for the new solutions. Under the revised Renewable Energies Directive, we will be aiming at further integrating renewable energies of all types in this sector, but we also need to speed up renovation rates. Our implementation work, combined with the upcoming review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive, will strengthen the drive to replace inefficient boilers faster and incentivise renovations in multi—apartment buildings. To do that we also need to make the right financing available. The good news is that we have started to do that through the European Fund for Strategic Investments and we will back that up with an initiative to help facilitate access to new innovative funding mechanisms. Both of these reports highlight how important it is that we get on with building the energy union that this House has supported since day one. The reports in our debate here today are a solid basis from which we can get to work on the whole range of legislative files that are coming up in the next weeks and months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Christofer FJELLNER", "mepid": "28126", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr In the climate policy debate, we usually talk about emissions from industries, electricity production or traffic, but the fact is that one of the biggest sources of emissions is heating and cooling. Almost 50% of the energy we use in europe is spent on just that, and 75% of it comes from fossil sources. To get to grips with this, district heating is an unbeatable tool – something that Sweden also happens to be an excellent example of. Although it is a large and sparsely populated country, 90 percent of all apartment buildings are connected to district heating, and completely without fossil sources. However, as we heard in the debate, the conditions are incredibly different in different parts of Europe.

For the first time, heating and cooling is being talked about as a separate energy sector, which is, by the way, one of the largest, consuming about 50 percent of the energy produced. I would like to congratulate the Commission on the preparation of such a comprehensive and detailed study. The action plan presented will help to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, integrate advanced technologies and renewable energy sources. Member States' heating and cooling needs vary according to climate, building stands or heat farms. Strategies must therefore be flexible and each country must find the most appropriate way to achieve optimal efficiency in the heating sector. Local and regional authorities, the real implementers of the strategy, play an important role. When I work on this report, I have heard on a number of occasions that one of the main problems is that cities do not have enough specialists and experience to help them fully assess and plan heat farm efficiently. Often waste heat from the industry is not used because of bureaucracy, renovation is single, not complex, so the existing potential is not exploited. Measures and favourable conditions need to be developed to help this level to make appropriate, economically sustainable, long-term solutions. The added value of the European Commission here is obvious. It has a general view of the sector and expertise. I am convinced that the Commission should develop a harmonised and comprehensive set of urban energy planning measures to assess the potential of local heating and cooling energy, optimise and integrated renovation of buildings and the development of heating and cooling infrastructure. I think it is equally important to concentrate efforts both on accelerating the renovation of buildings and on the renewal of heating and cooling systems.

We have moved from centralist energy production to more flexible models, organised on decentralised production, on the integration of technologies from renewable sources, with the aim of overcoming national protectionism that risks undermining the construction of the European Energy Union.  Today, the aim is to update the market rules: a commitment that is not easy because it means getting to the regulatory framework of the European energy sector and at the same time putting our finger in the energy dynamics of the Member States.  I would like to make three points which I consider to be important in the Langen report. The first is an approach that integrates production from renewable sources at all stages of the market – production, networking, storage, distribution, opening up to new markets of small producers. A concrete commitment, therefore, towards the energy transition towards a decarbonised development model, in line with the objectives of last December's Framework Resolution on the Energy Union.  Secondly, a market vision that looks at technological and management innovation in a European way, in order to increase the potential of storage, for the virtuous management of supply and demand, for investments in transmission, for overcoming market bottlenecks, those that tend to confine energy potential all within their respective Member States. Each Member State will therefore have to pursue the security objectives individually, but the European legislator will indicate a forward-looking path for the energy market, which will no longer be the sum of different national experiences, but an organic and credible design.  In this regard, I welcome the parts that go into the distorting aspects of the electricity market and that we must overcome in the future: it is capacity mechanisms and technology support schemes. The former must guarantee certain capacities and can no longer be designed on a national basis, but must be transnational in nature. The latter, renewable energy support schemes, have played an important role, but they need to be reviewed on the basis of the degree of maturity of their renewable technologies.

From the ECR group's perspective, there are many positive elements, in particular the call for the marketisation of renewable energy sources and, in the long term, the end of subsidies. This subsidy is becoming an increasingly distortive element of the market, it is becoming increasingly absurd, and I think that is the element that needs to be emphasised in this report.  However, the pursuit of a common electricity market should not serve as a pretext for the Union to take responsibility for shaping the energy mixes of individual countries. The choice of energy sources must remain the responsibility of EU countries. Unfortunately, this element has not been duly emphasised in the rapporteur's report, although, as the rapporteur mentioned, it has been taken into account.  Another, even more important problem of this report is the rapporteur's sceptical attitude towards the so-called power markets. Capacity markets are crucial when it comes to securing electricity supply in individual Member States. In addition, capacity markets provide the necessary support for renewable sources (renewable energy), which will have to be insured for a long time by traditional forms of energy generation. Capacity markets are therefore necessary to change the situation, guarantee stability for investors and secure supplies.

Why? because we are confronted with extreme over—capacities in most of the markets. Why do we have these extreme over-capacities? Because of the failure of the EU CO2 trading regime. With CO2 prices of EUR 7 or 8 per tonne, and no prospect of that changing with the actual proposals on the table, coal power stations which, politically, Europe decided to phase out when it adopted its climate package in 2008, will stay in the market.  So what do we do in that situation? What are we saying in the Langen report? The first thing is, do not go for capacity payments. It would be completely counter-productive. Why should we pay the coal power stations to stay alive?  Commissioner, when you say that you want consumer orientation, in Denmark there has been a very detailed analysis which says that a strategic reserve – so just keeping some power plants in reserve for an extreme moment, but outside the market – is ten times cheaper for consumers than capacity payments. Why should we go for capacity payments if, firstly, they keep the old, dirty power plants in the market and, secondly, they are more expensive for the consumer?  The very clear message which we are giving – and this is also thanks to the Socialist Group – is that we want to keep priority access and dispatch for renewable energy. Why is that important? Because when you have over—capacity in a market, there will be situations where you have to curtail, where you have to decide whether it is a coal power plant running, or whether it is renewable energy running. So you, Commissioner, who was a champion in Paris, how could you penalise renewals by taking away priority access and dispatch? Because if we take priority access and dispatch away, then we will have a purely economic merit order of curtailment, and renewables will be the first to be shut down. Do we want a market where renewable investments are penalised? I do not think so. Look at our report, and think again; no capacity payments.

It is perhaps no coincidence that the report also sets out the objectives of 'climate and energy' – when it comes to the electricity market. And perhaps it is no coincidence that the Commissioner for the Energy Union, Šefčovič, does not represent the Commission in this matter. Of course, I also believe that the objectives of the Paris meeting must be met. But many are setting more ambitious targets - they do not take security of supply into account. It means that renewable energies have fluctuating performance and therefore have a limited share of renewable energies within a system. They don't take affordability into account. Not all countries are as rich as Germany to pay a huge sum to take over renewable energy. And among low-carbon technologies, they only talk about renewables – when there is nuclear power, which is clean energy.

There is no doubt that both reports play an important role in bringing about more sustainable development together. There is a need to create a better internal energy market. There is a need to use the energy at our disposal much better. Not least when we talk about heating and cooling there are good opportunities to do better. As you know, we import much more energy into Europe than is necessary. Cooling and heating is an area where we can do extremely better in terms of using the energy that is available. We are wasting billions of euros on importing gas and oil from Russia and the Middle East respectively. The money could be used much better if we prioritised energy efficiency higher. When we talk about energy efficiency, it is of course a common thread that I would like to see go through the proposals that lie ahead, and I hope that it can be implemented in the forthcoming legislation. Investing more in energy efficiency is also the best way to reduce CO2. At the same time as making savings, we are also giving the industry behind it a much greater opportunity to innovate and create new products that can compete on the world market. There are many places other than Europe that require change in this area, and this will enable us to sell good products.

By the end of this year, the Commission will come up with new legislation on energy efficiency, energy market organisation and energy performance of buildings - legislative proposals with a major role in achieving the objectives of the Energy Union and with the impact that we want positively on jobs and the industry of the European Union. I believe that we need to insist and take more care of jobs and industry, without which the European Union cannot be competitive. It is clear that we need a forward-looking reorganisation of the energy market that takes into account new energy realities: the need to incorporate renewable energies into the grid, wider tariff areas, short-term trading markets and, of course, the physical infrastructure to enable all of this. With regard to capacity mechanisms, they should be used as a last resort to balance the network, as they would put too much financial pressure on consumers.  Since heating and cooling account for around half of the European Union's final energy demand, it is important that the sector becomes more efficient, in order to reduce dependence on energy imports, to help reduce emissions, and to reduce costs for consumers, especially those at risk of energy poverty.

I think that is very important. On the road to a European internal market, we simply need integration within the framework of regional markets. Secondly, with regard to the development of renewable energies, I think it is right and proper that the report states that we do not want permanent subsidisation of renewable energy systems and that we must move towards a market economy in the direction of feed-in tariff systems. Perhaps at some point we will come to a European feed-in tariff system. In the meantime, however, it is important to support the market economy accordingly. Incidentally, I was also pleased that this report also mentioned hydropower. My third point is that electricity storage is a very central and essential part of the report. That has not been mentioned today; I think that is fundamental. The more we develop renewables, the more important this issue becomes and the more we have to invest in research and development in the field. And last area: capacity markets.

Thus it was possible that a special tax was imposed on solar panels, and thus the unique thing that happened was that wind farms were actually banned in Hungary recently.

I was mayor of a municipality that was the first to be declared the most energy-efficient municipality in Slovenia, and from my own experience I can tell you how many things can be arranged at the local level. In the case of renewable energy sources, it is also necessary to talk about water potential. Again in Slovenia, in the country from which I come from, we have placed five hydroelectric power plants in the regional environment, which now produce 7% of electricity in Slovenia. Green energy, jobs and, at the same time, flood protection. So in these reports, as we say in Slovenia, there is a lot of salt, so it is right to take them seriously, take them at European level and on the principle of subsidiarity, taking on their share of the responsibility of the state as well as the local community.

I am very glad that broadly, we are following the same line towards achieving our 2030 and COP 21 targets. Here in the debate I think there is full support for the two reports in the House. Naturally, some points have been raised on which there are elements of divergence, mainly in relation to capacity support schemes: this is an extremely difficult issue and it will be one of the most important elements of the package that the Commission will propose. The electricity market design proposal is one of the key pieces of legislation in the Union action plan, and probably the most difficult to engineer. We have a unique opportunity, we have made progress with the previous packages but here we have an opportunity in a different scenario because, as Mr Kelly pointed out, in COP 21, in Paris, we assumed very ambitious objectives. The European Union has a very ambitious renewables target and to achieve that we have to change absolutely the functioning of our market and the integration of renewables and, as Mr Turmes says, it is a big challenge. We can discuss many of the elements, but the main purpose of the new package will be to put the consumers in the centre: consumers must be at the centre of the market design because they are prosumers, they redistribute the generation, and this is about the use of renewables. It is a different market from the old decentralised market, and the current market is not fit for purpose. So it is a very challenging exercise and I appreciate all the comments made here. For sure, the Commission is going to present a package. It is not only about market design, it covers energy efficiency, the energy performance of buildings and a renewables directive. And on all of these proposals we must follow the same logic. The logic is that we have to follow a pattern of decarbonisation of our economies: that is the message from Paris. Renewables have come to stay, and we have to develop them, and we have to make the market fit for purpose. So, as I stated earlier, and as I can confirm again, both reports and the rich debate we have just had constitute a very solid basis from which we can get to work on the whole range of issues that will be coming up in the next weeks and months. In the context of decarbonising of our economies, there is no doubt that the heating and cooling sector is an absolute game changer when it comes to security, economic growth and reaching our climate and energy targets. We have to dedicate lots of time to this sector, and it is very important that work in this sector – work on energy efficiency, making the best use of the EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) and the future EPC that is also coming – will be one of the priorities of the Commission. I also note with satisfaction that this House as a whole is committed to achieving a truly integrated and flexible market, providing the right signals for investment where they are most needed. The market does not currently give signals for investment in the right places – that is for sure – and Mr Turmes is right to point out the problem, but probably I have more trust than he does in the reform of the emission trading system, and the emission trading system is before this House. At the moment you are discussing it, and I think that the changes that have been introduced will be effective in the future. I am not as pessimistic as Mr Turmes is. I count on all of you to back these reports because they are excellent reports and they give a solid basis for the work the Commission has to do in the coming months. We want to deliver the whole package this year, as set out in the action plan. Next year we will come along with targets for CO2 emissions: we will have, I am sure, a very fruitful discussion with this Parliament, and I am sure, when I see the spirit and the concerns of the MEPs who have intervened, that there will be a high degree of consensus between the Commission and Parliament on developing a market that functions , a market which is fit for the targets we have in our climate policy, and a market which brings us affordable, secure and clean energy.

When I listen to these speeches from my colleagues, I must say that I am afraid not to make a two-way error. Namely, the electricity market is a market linked to the fact that electricity, or electricity, can be transferred over long distances, that is, it can be a single market. On the other hand, when it comes to heat, these heat transfer distances are much smaller, i.e. we can talk about local markets here. It can be a few, a dozen or even a few dozen kilometres, although not too far away, that is, we can talk about local markets, and I would ask you to take these issues into account here with these laws, so as not to treat these markets equally.  On the other hand, with regard to the issue of heating and cooling, I must admit that, indeed, when it comes to the Paris issue of protecting our climate, COP 21, I believe that the largest reserves (although this is probably immolable, because this is not in the ESA) are in the thermomodernisation of buildings – that is two thirds. Just take to the streets in Brussels and see how poorly this isolated city is, let alone talk about the many settlements and cities in Central and Eastern Europe. These are the largest reserves that can be used as soon as possible. One more thing I have to say, also in terms of renewable energy, is the fastest way to put it in there and use it, in the thermomodernization of buildings, by warming buildings, but new solutions, further technical solutions are needed. We are talking at other meetings here about reindustrialisation.

The European Union spends 59% of its total natural gas consumption and 12% of its oil consumption on heating and cooling, while every 1% increase in energy efficiency reduces natural gas imports by 2.6%. The EU will therefore pay particular attention to the development of a heating and cooling strategy in order to achieve the climate targets set and reduce its dependence on energy suppliers.  The heating and cooling of our buildings consumes nearly 35% of our total energy consumption, but with serious renovation work this could be significantly reduced. The stock of walls and single-layer windows with no proper insulation remains high. To this end, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive has been established, which sets mandatory minimum energy efficiency criteria for new investments. In the case of industry, lower emissions can be achieved by insulation and efficiency gains, as heating to the right temperature is often an integral part of the production process. Nevertheless, the aim is to decarbonise processes as fully as possible. At the same time, in the case of processes at really high temperatures, heating with electricity from renewables cannot be the solution, so fossil fuels are needed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members and shadow rapporteurs with whom I worked productively during the negotiations.  The report that we adopted in the REGI Committee is an implementation report, aimed at analysing 'holistically' the various aspects relating to the implementation of Thematic Objective 3, namely the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises in the new programming.  As many as 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe (i.e. companies with fewer than 250 employees) account for around 99% of all enterprises, making a fundamental contribution to development, social cohesion, innovation and the creation of high-quality jobs and producing over 100 million jobs and income. In Europe, small and medium-sized enterprises are very diverse: the number of micro-enterprises (i.e. less than ten employees) operating both in traditional sectors and at start-up level is increasing. Today they are 93% of over 22 million small and medium-sized enterprises. In the current programming, the funds have doubled compared with the old one, but the large amount of funding – EUR 64 billion to be 140 billion – is a necessary but not sufficient condition for dealing with the many difficulties faced by our businesses on a daily basis.   First of all, we must say that the economic crisis and austerity policies have stifled domestic demand. Secondly, the bureaucratic and regulatory environment is a real jungle that actually makes it impossible to invest.  In the report we have stressed the importance of public procurement being organised in a transparent and innovative way. I therefore welcome the procurement directive and the single European tender document, which should considerably reduce the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.  At the same time, we must be vigilant, and I call on the Commission and the Member States to be vigilant, both on the backlog of payments and on whether the late payment directive is properly implemented. We absolutely cannot afford our small and medium-sized enterprises to be discouraged from participating in projects and programmes because of a lack of confidence in the system.

The risk is to put a worse piece of the hole if financial engineering is used to provide them with high-risk products.

An integrated regional and European policy process, focusing on specific sectors, such as manufacturing, new technologies, sustainable construction, green vehicles and smart grids. We must, while respecting the territorial specificity of each region, promote the principles of the circular economic package, with the objective of sustainable economic development and paying particular attention to the promotion of green jobs.   A greener value chain, including refrabrication, repair, maintenance, recycling and eco-design, can offer considerable business opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises.  The supply of energy at low cost is essential: European companies have the highest energy cost in the world and a decisive process of decarbonisation and self-production of energy must be proposed.

The Commission at the time launched a tool based on so-called strategies for smart special planning. But what is this about smart specialization strategies? You will see: they consist of the application of innovation, technological development and also research to the economic and productive reality of the regions, once they have been able to identify their strengths and also their weaknesses. The so-called RIS3s are therefore designed on the basis of operational programmes, which, on the other hand, obliges regions to develop their ex ante strategies, because otherwise it would be entirely impossible for them, the regions, to be able to access the funds. In addition, we will also say that these strategies have a marked participatory character. They involve citizens, companies, universities and, of course, public administrations. We in Parliament and in the Committee on Regional Development draw up a report which aims, inter alia, to encourage the Commission to continue forward with these strategies.

We will also say that the development of it has had the proposal of various associations, many of them, specialized in this sector, as well as with a very broad consensus of the members of the Commission, already referred to, of Regional Development; because I will tell you that at the time it was presented, the vote yielded the following result: 33 votes in favour, only 3 against and, in addition to all this, the same report has been enriched through a series — important in its number but, above all, important in its content — of amendments, up to a total of 20. I would like to stress about the content of this report, on the one hand, the need for the European Union to intensify all possible efforts to achieve that economic growth, which is smart, sustainable and also inclusive. I would also like to stress the importance of research, technological development and innovation being one of the investment priorities for the Regional Development Fund to make them the real basis from which to strengthen competitiveness and also quality job creation. There is also a need for analysis of the capacities, assets, competences, of each region and that new business opportunities can be opened up in this way. I would also like to stress that greater cooperation between regional authorities, as well as between transnational cooperation programmes, is needed to avoid duplication , I conclude, Mr President - as well as the establishment of a national observatory that can ensure stronger indicators. And I conclude by asking, and taking advantage of the Commissioner's presence, what problems have been encountered in relation to these strategies, not only in relation to their design and implementation, but also in relation to their evaluation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 84, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Iskra MIHAYLOVA", "mepid": "125128", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Mr President, Honourable Commissioner, today I present the discussion approved by the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy on one of the two objectives of cohesion policy– European territorial cooperation or well-known INTERREG programmes. The report covers several key themes: good practices, including innovative contributions to the Europe 2020 strategy and territorial cohesion, simplification of the implementation of territorial programmes and future development recommendations. In this context, I would like to point out that cross-border and transnational cooperation has achieved over the years good practices in the field of better connectivity and accessibility, knowledge transfer and innovation, tackling environmental challenges, increasing administrative capacity in health, education, employment and labour mobility, and creating new partnerships. At the same time, the report points out that interreg's budget of around EUR 10 billion represents only two per cent and eight-tenths of the cohesion policy budget and unfortunately does not meet the major challenges facing European territorial cooperation. The report notes with concern the late adoption of interreg programmes and urges the Commission and the Member States to mobilise their efforts to implement them successfully. The Commission, the Member States and the managing authorities are called upon to establish structural and appropriately organised monitoring systems and evaluation plans with a view to better assessing and disseminating knowledge of interreg's achievements. The report encourages the use of INTERREG programmes in response to the challenges of overcoming the refugee crisis, as well as the exchange of good practices between local and regional authorities in border areas, including third countries, through macro-regional strategies.  The report also notes the important role played by INTERREG programmes in enhancing the innovation potential of regions by promoting synergies between smart specialisation strategies and the development of innovation networks. The need to establish joint research programmes, joint research infrastructure, partnerships and cooperation networks is underlined. Calls for synergies between Horizon 2020, the European Fund for Strategic Investments and the European Structural Investment Funds to focus on increasing the quantity, quality and impact of research and innovation investments. Financial instruments must be an integral part of INTERREG programmes by complementing grants. The report also notes the role of European territorial cooperation groups in promoting European territorial cooperation. Calls on the committees and the Member States to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by INTERREG in order to facilitate cross-border labour mobility by adapting, if necessary, the administrative and social regulatory framework. Interreg programmes should, while respecting agreed priorities as well as complementing other appropriate funding, support migration challenges and promote effective integration policies.  In this regard, the report underlines the possibilities of European territorial cooperation and its potential, which can be developed in future territorial cooperation programmes and underpin future cohesion policy based on the needs of the specific territory.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 85, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Mercedes BRESSO", "mepid": "28346", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, cohesion policy, which we are debating today with these 4 reports, is one of the few instruments that are firmly on the side of citizens, students, workers and businesses. The resources at its disposal are resources that fall entirely on the territories and remain today one of the few sources of investment throughout the European Union, particularly at local level. The role of the regions and local authorities is important for cohesion policy, just as it is fundamental in the strategy for the Alpine macro-region, which my report, in particular, refers to.  The EUSALP strategy offers the countries of the region – from this very large region – an opportunity to invest in joint projects with a European impact, not only regional, and also to develop new forms of multi-level governance, originating from the regions and implemented with the help of the European institutions. I am therefore convinced that the role of regions and local authorities must be strengthened in the strategy. As I wrote in the report we voted on: the regions and local authorities will have to be fully involved in the management of the strategy if we are to achieve results. We also know how important it is that this strategy should not overlap with existing interregional and cross-border cooperation, but that it should be able to provide added value and complement the experiences that have already been undertaken. Above all, it is a question of addressing objectives common to the entire Alpine and Pre-Alpine area, but with repercussions for the whole of Europe – this is the great area of rebalancing in southern Europe. What is happening in this region is important, as we know, for the whole Union.  In line with the major European objectives of Europe 2020 – in the areas of sustainable development, the environment and energy – the design and implementation of projects with a macro-regional dimension should also be facilitated through this strategy. The EUSALP strategy really wants to be a useful tool for this.  It will therefore be important for the strategy to serve as a new support tool for economic development, growth and employment in these areas, not only in traditional sectors such as tourism and food and wine – which nevertheless remain fundamental – but also and above all in more innovative sectors. What will be important will be the interaction between large urban areas, peri-urban and rural areas with mountain areas, which will make it possible to determine the success of this strategy, but above all the economic recovery of these areas.  There are unused or poorly used resources just waiting to be revitalized. One of our proposals is to create an investment platform for the entire Alpine and Alpine region, which will enable public and private funding to be mobilised, including through the EIB, the opportunities offered not only by cohesion policy but also by EFSI.  However, we cannot think about the development of these territories until we are able to connect them to the rest of the world. There are still too many dark areas in these regions, in particular, where the Internet connection is weak or, moreover, absent. We need new solutions which, combined with the traditional ones, will enable those who really want to do business or simply contribute to the development of these areas, to be able to do so on an equal footing with competition.  In essence, we must make these areas attractive, a pole of attraction for young people, with opportunities and tools. We also reiterate in the report that the majority of the major infrastructures provided for in the TEN-T plan, these axes, will then have to be linked to widespread, efficient and sustainable local infrastructure. In short, it will not be the solution to all problems on its own, but it is a unique opportunity for the macro region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, hello, I am very happy to be with you again today in plenary. I would like to begin by warmly thanking the rapporteurs: Mrs Mihaylova, Mrs D'Amato, Mrs Bresso and Mr Valcárcel, and, of course, the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development for these four excellent reports which bring to the heart of our discussion both the support of cohesion policy for smart growth and territorial cooperation and for the strategy for the Alpine region. Given that, as you know, I only have five minutes to talk about these broad topics, I'm going to try to get right to the point. With regard to Mrs D'Amato's report on improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Commission welcomes and shares the European Parliament's vision that operational programmes are currently much more focused on strategic priorities and, especially when aiming at innovation, they play a key role in creating high-quality jobs. Support for small and medium-sized enterprises, including start-ups, must indeed consider support mechanisms for entrepreneurial skills, as well as a range of external services for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises in order to relaunch, develop and innovate in many regions. At the same time, I agree with you that we need to ensure that these mechanisms are easily accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why, as you know, we have taken a number of measures to simplify the rules, and the results of the Working Party on Simplification, which is considering the support of small and medium-sized enterprises, will be seen at the end of September. We are trying to introduce some recommendations from this financial cycle, in particular, on e-cohesion and simplified costs, to make the lives of beneficiaries much easier. You know very well that it is not easy for us to find this balance between the need to simplify the rules and the need to know and have effective control over how European taxpayers' money is spent. The European Commission also notes the proposal to create a participatory platform to ensure the dissemination of the results of small and medium-sized enterprises' projects. I would like to point out that there is already a special page on the European Commission's Open Data Platform website where all projects financed by European money, including those of small and medium-sized enterprises in each country and in each region, are presented. With regard to Mr Valcárcel's report on research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation, I would, of course, welcome the European Parliament's strong support for smart specialisation in cohesion policy. I thank Mr Valcárcel for his presentation, as well as for your specific question. Indeed, the most powerful challenges are when it comes to implementation. Our challenge now is to ensure the implementation of these strategies on the ground, and I fully agree with your report, which underlines the need for better coordination of programmes and to establish collaborative platforms and partnerships, as well as to promote collaboration at all levels: intra-regional, inter-regional, cross-border and transnational. The Commission will continue to support these processes, for example through the Smart Specialisation Platform which provides extremely valuable support to the regions in the development and implementation of these strategies. From this point of view Spain, through the Seville Institute, makes an important contribution to the Member States and the regions. In addition, of course we will ensure that European regions take advantage of the potential to combine cohesion policy funding with other European Union instruments, such as Horizon 2020 and the investment plan, the strategic investment fund, what we already call, generically, the Juncker plan. In this respect, as you know, we have already published a guide to support those who wish to use these funds in a complementary way. Of course we will not stop here, we intend to develop other guides if necessary. These will be followed by exchanges of best practices in which I believe very much. It is a reality of life, after all, that some Member States and regions are more advanced, have more experience and more administrative capacity, and other Member States are still at the beginning of the road and I think we always have to learn from each other. With regard to Mrs Mihaylova's report on European territorial cooperation, this is a which is in my personal attention and DG REGIO. I would like to point out that, thanks to investment through the INTERREG programmes, we are now indeed seeing a real change for the better in terms of cross-border cooperation from research to transport and environmental protection. Basically, I visited 25 countries during my two years in office and tried to visit a lot of objectives concerning cross-border cooperation. Of course, this tool can still be optimised and needs to be optimised in a constantly changing environment. I therefore very much appreciate this report on its own initiative. I want to congratulate you on this idea. In particular, I agree with your recommendations that encourage the joint establishment of integrated and sustainable territorial development strategies in border areas. A common strategy is essential for the efficient use of the two specific instruments, namely integrated territorial investment and community-led local development, which can play an important role in this. Unfortunately, we have some cross-border programmes blocked and we will certainly try together with those countries to unlock them in order to start these cross-border programmes. But, of course, on the other hand, we have cross-border regions that have made full use of this common development potential. I believe that your support is essential. I assure you that for me personally, at a time when many Member States want to build borders again, for me it is a priority to raise administrative barriers between Member States. With regard to Mrs Bresso's report on the European Union's strategy for the Alpine region, I would like to welcome the balanced and well-developed approach, which takes into account the effort and contribution of several specialised committees in the European Parliament. We have had the opportunity, as you know, to talk on several occasions about this strategy bringing together advanced countries, some of the most advanced countries in the European Union, but also non-member countries and poorer regions, as you have also pointed out. I fully agree with you that it is necessary to promote and align, coordinate the financing of cohesion policy, as well as other European Union funds and financial instruments. In addition, the launch of projects and actions at regional macro level is extremely important in order to fully exploit possible funding options and synergies within the strategy. As you know, the Commission has adapted the legal framework of cohesion policy so that programmes take into account the objectives and projects of macro-regional strategies. I would, however, like to point out that the Alpine strategy, like all other regional macro strategies (the Danube strategy, the Baltic area strategy, the Adriatic-Ionian strategy), this Alpine strategy belongs primarily to the Member States and, moreover, it was adopted as a result of the requests of these Member States. The European Commission will retain its role as facilitator. I welcome your idea of having this investment platform. We are partners in this idea of seeing to what extent we can combine European funds, structural funds with strategic funds for infrastructure projects, but also for less developed areas. The Commission retains this active role and we will be here if our work will bring added value, but, of course, we cannot do so as the Commission without an active partnership with the participating Member States and regions. I'm sorry I'm out of time, there are four reports.

I have tried to highlight in this report for advice, with my colleagues, the peculiarities of the Alpine region and to make concrete proposals on employment. Above all, it is essential that our strategy focuses on strategic sectors and, to this end, we propose, among other things, the creation of regional research hubs by involving companies.  We must also encourage multi-training and training in line with the labour market. In particular, we can imagine specific training centres and a multilingual regional online employment centre.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, environmental issues are transversal to many disciplines.

In the macro-region, more attention needs to be paid to mountain areas, which are often neglected than urban areas, by reconciling the environment and economic and social development in the Alpine air, an area rich in natural resources, culture and traditions. The fight against climate change has positive repercussions in the Alpine areas because today we are unfortunately witnessing the reduction of glaciers and the torrential rains that cause landslides and floods. It is essential to fight the abandonment of the territory because the garrison is an important tool against hydrogeological failure.  In this area, and not only, Europe should show greater flexibility, not least because bureaucratic rigidities are not adapted to these small realities.

The Committee on Transport had also requested that infrastructure which involves an avoidable and disproportionate risk to the environment, natural resources or public health should not be financed.

European territorial cooperation is, in my opinion, the essence of what the European Union is. The history of European territorial cooperation is a success for all who demonstrate the value of working together across borders. This is a success for the beneficiaries, who have left behind thousands of projects and good practices.  Cross-border programmes are particularly important. They are proof of the importance of impact on the border areas of the European Union, as well as in third countries. It is still in the border areas that we need to build an adequate level of trust and partnership on each side of the border.

It fosters economic integration in the countries of the European Union and allows for the improvement of the competitive position of regional economies by providing European public goods that the market cannot provide. Each European territory has its own role and can and must become a source of development in itself through a fair distribution of economic activities. Recent economic analyses confirm this approach through numerous studies demonstrating that geography matters and that regional policy can change things. An essential element for success is the involvement of national, regional and local governments in fundamental strategies and in the creation of networks that go beyond national physical and political boundaries. Even if there is no universal recipe for this cooperation and for regional development policy, principles such as partnership, transparency, subsidiarity and civil society participation combine harmoniously, and strengthening partnerships between the public and private sectors makes it possible to make decentralisation and active involvement of the whole society more efficient. On the other hand, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises which have generated 58 % of the added value in the sector should be emphasised.  In this context, I consider it essential to have effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States to support entrepreneurial training projects among rural women and young people, SMEs that will contribute to job creation, the development of new services, as well as increasing incomes and avoiding depopulation of these areas. On the other hand, we must not forget that Europe's regions have to adapt to the pressures of the global economy. Climate change poses a threat to some sectors and an opportunity for others, and demographic change and an ageing population require new policies in the labour market. As long as the European Union has aspirations, it must also have an adequate cohesion policy to enable them to be fulfilled. One of the things we all aspire to is common progress in a reunified Europe. After all, it is our regions, areas and cities that make investments, implement national and Community policies and apply legislation in the European Union.

I have never heard of a politician who is against the growth of competitiveness, but the vast majority of them, with their ideas and moves, impede this process, because they place too much tax and administrative burden on entrepreneurs.  The over-regulation of the market to which it often resorts and this home can only impede small and medium-sized enterprises from growing them, just as high taxes from which oversized or even completely unnecessary public policies are financed. SMEs will be more competitive if the policy interferes less with their work and frees up space for them with a regulatory guillotine and a reduction in the tax burden. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the REFIT program, which so far successfully removes regulatory barriers. Unfortunately, the establishment of the single market has not eliminated them in itself, but in many industries we have only added the European one to national regulation and thus actually increased the regulatory burden. I agree that we need to increase the absorption of funds, but we must bear in mind that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, especially from newer Member States, often do not have the necessary capacity.

Think that only depopulation in those territories over the last ten to fifteen years is 40%.  It is an area which, if we do not have the attention due to the active infrastructure that produces wealth, well-being and development in the north and south of the Alps, attention to the environment, to everything we are introducing, those same infrastructures, when they cross that fragile region, become passive structures.  And where depopulation is due to a land that is difficult to work with, an area that is very difficult to develop – but at the same time a very important area – we find ourselves having to guarantee an income for those territories, so that in the future there is population, not depopulation.

Base them on the region's own specific forces and own specific needs. Secondly, smart specialisations can really give a huge boost to new innovations and economic growth in the regions.

One of the principles of the European Union is freedom of movement – borders are no longer physically accessible to people, that is a good thing. They can come together, they can work together, and it is precisely in the border regions, which are often among the less developed regions within a Member State, that can be an advantage. The European Union has been supporting this for 25 years with the Interreg programme, but European territorial cooperation goes further.  There is a separate regulation for this, there are means for it, and we have also created the possibility, with the legal instrument of the European Association for Territorial Cooperation, for institutional cooperation to be carried out across existing national borders. Unfortunately, we have to note that often from the capitals, out of national selfishness, this work is blocked in the border regions, that one's own legal system, which is often not yet aligned with that of neighbouring countries, is held higher than territorial cooperation.

I certainly welcome these reports we are discussing this evening and I want to concentrate on the reports on research and innovation and SMEs. Traditionally, we have focused our investment in cohesion funds on infrastructure, training and job creation, but we should not neglect the opportunities to also invest in research and development. One way of doing this would be to use structural funds and Horizon 2020 funds together. This does happen, but of course that are many obstacles in the way. We should be looking to make it easier to use those funds together; I think our own regulations can help in terms of improving simplification and bringing the regulations of the two funds closer together.  We should also be making it easier for SMEs to access structural funds. I am sure we have all heard complaints from SMEs in our own regions. Many SMEs do benefit from structural funds, through capital investments and through training programmes, etc., but again I believe we can do even more on this. Once again, our own regulations can help with that.

Cohesion policy is intended for the first time for countries and regions with development backlogs to eliminate these development backlogs, secondly, to steer the development of new technologies, to make a development breakthrough in countries, and, thirdly, to bring countries together and people all over Europe. The reports also relate to these areas. Let me touch two. First of all, we report around smart specialisation: we have a very large deficit in Europe, so that we do not know how to establish effective cooperation between the economy and science, research, innovation. This is why Europe is now in a development behind. I fear that the introduction of smart specialisation in some countries is also lagging behind, because the actors do not understand this importance.

It is therefore essential to create conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises at Member State level as large enterprises. They must have equal access to State aid, the interest rates on their financing must be equal. Equating them with large enterprises would be a crucial element for modernising, developing services, knowledge and creating new jobs.

In the Alpine region there are very developed regions and, besides, often very underdeveloped regions, and therefore a common strategy is very right. A common transport strategy and the transfer of transport to rail is also the right thing to do, and this requires major investment, both at the Brenner, where I come from, on the Fréjus line and on the Turin-Lyon line, and that is why I am absolutely opposed to the amendments that have been tabled here.

Two of them: bureaucracy and access to credit. As the report rightly emphasises, small and medium-sized enterprises still face too many barriers because of the complexity of the programming system at all stages.

Rampant corruption is the biggest cancer of any EU cohesion programme or financial assistance programme. This kind of news comes from a whole range of EU Member States. Unfortunately, the worst examples come from my country, Hungary. Where there has been almost no day in the last few years when the press has not discovered a corruption case linked to a politician in the government or to financiers or oligarchs associated with it. The real problem, however, is that these corruption cases are not followed by criminal proceedings and end in punishment. Indeed, there are Member States, Hungary, where the public prosecutor's office is reluctant to act on corruption cases involving pro-government politicians. It is no coincidence that it is always the Member States who are most afraid that their own politicians and their own environment may be involved in these matters that are most likely to refuse to set up a Common European Public Prosecutor's Office. That's an admission. If a member state government does not want to set up a joint EU public prosecutor's office to investigate these types of corruption, it is actually saying that it does not want these corruption cases to be investigated or investigated.

I will refer to three simple measures: the abolition of bureaucratic barriers to the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises by establishing a pan-European model, a directive applicable by all Member States to create a favourable environment in two directions: the transition to a low-carbon circular economy and the promotion of green products and services, the combination of the Structural Funds with other resources that will promote bank lending for small and medium-sized enterprises; , finally, the development of a single tax practice for small and medium-sized enterprises that will allow taxation after a certain grace period or impose uniform tax scales from all Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 127, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission.– Thank you very much, thank you, first of all, for this very interesting discussion and for your contribution, for the very useful ideas put forward by the representatives of the European Parliament's specialised committees.  As regards what has been said here in relation to SMEs, it has been as a milkmotiv for all the discussions, I agree that support from cohesion policy is essential to boost the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, which is, as has been said here, on numerous occasions, the backbone of the European economy.  As a general remark, I would like to say that I am very pleased that most speakers have stressed the importance of cohesion policy, despite what really needs to be improved. I believe that cohesion policy is the most visible policy by which people's daily lives practically improve, have a considerable impact in all regions of the European Union, in all Member States, whether developed or less developed.  As far as small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned, EUR 90 billion is available by 2020 and we are doing everything in our power to make the most of these opportunities. In particular, I believe that we have made significant efforts together to reduce red tape in support of programme beneficiaries, and I believe that we should have a closer dialogue with the CONT Commission, because you know very well that there is a point of view in the Committee on Regional Policy and a completely different point of view in the Committee on Budgetary Control , where, indeed, the question of control of taxpayers' money, how this money is invested is raised. With regard to Mr Valcárcel's report, of course we want a successful cohesion policy. We need very good smart specialisation strategies. To this end, I believe that, as you said, we must ensure that all stakeholders, in particular local and regional authorities, universities, academia, research institutions, socio-economic partners, small and medium-sized enterprises, have the means to exploit the potential of smart specialisation strategies.  As mentioned, we have set up a smart specialised strategy platform, we have also created a series of thematic platforms that already provide specific support in areas such as energy, food industry, agri-food, digital or the circular economy depending on the specialisation chosen by each region. You know very well, my position is that every region is unique, not every region can be Silicon Valley, so every region has to find its strengths to lean on. And of course we will continue to provide assistance, and I hope that this assistance will be useful in making the best use of the various funds available. With regard to Mrs Iskra Mihaylova's own-initiative report on European territorial cooperation, I welcome once again the European Parliament's strong support for territorial cooperation. I believe that INTERREG has proven to be a laboratory of European integration.  Border regions are, in fact, the places where we can best show what Europe means and can do. 25% of Europe's population lives around borders. I believe that we need to give new impetus to this cross-border cooperation. As I was saying, we are working to lift administrative barriers.  I welcome, for example, the very good cooperation that exists between Germany and Poland, but, for example, between Belgium and France, although language is not an obstacle, we cannot have the same cooperation because the legislation is not aligned. So I think it is very important to lift all these barriers, especially at this time, when the temporary reintroduction of border controls increases the difficulties faced by these regions.  I believe that political action aimed at promoting prosperity in these regions is more than necessary. With regard to the INTERREG timetable, we are in the process of implementing INTERREG 5 in the period 2014-2020 and we are already seeing the beneficial effects of simplification and we are working on this cross-border cross-border review, which will be a useful basis for the development of the next programme cycle, INTERREG 6. With regard to mrs Mercedes Bresso's report, the Alpine region, the Alpine strategy, as pointed out here, as Mrs Bresso also pointed out, I believe that the Alpine strategy should be an essential component of future territorial cooperation.  In December, the Commission will present the half-yearly report on the processes recorded in the conduct of all macro-regional strategies, as requested in the report, and, sure ly, this report will provide a first assessment of the Union strategy European Union for the Alpine region, as well as an overview of how territorial cooperation should look in the future in order to better serve European citizens and, in particular, those living in border areas, in less developed areas. As conclusions, these are the main issues i would like to discuss at this stage. Unfortunately, the rules governing the time allocated to interventions do not allow me to respond to the many problems that you have raised in the four reports, but I would like, if I may, to say two things. I find it absolutely unfair, and Mr Fontous from Greece has left, as a country that has benefited from billions of euros in recent years, since 1981, when he became a member of the European Union, to talk about the fact that cohesion policy exists only in the aisles of the European Union. I would like to invite all Greek parliamentarians, maybe go together to see to what extent Greece has benefited, and I would like to thank you, Members of the European Parliament, for taking exceptional measures for an exceptional situation, and I do not think it is right that a country that now benefits from 100% co-financing, as no other country benefits , I do not think it is right to come and attack this cohesion policy!  Let us look: would the Athens metro have been without 90% co-financing from the European Union? We are now waiting to build the Thessaloniki metro! Would there have been thousands of schools and hospitals across Greece? Would there have been thousands of miles of highway? What did Greece look like before 1981, when it entered the European Union? So, as Mr Papadimoulis said, I believe that cohesion policy has contributed massively to improving the situation in which Greece has been on numerous occasions and, as a man who has fought both with the European Commission and here in the European Parliament, together with you, in the Committee on Regional Development to facilitate and help Greece, I find it absolutely unfair and even an insult to your work and the Commission in finding solutions to save and improve people's lives in Greece. So, from this point of view, I wanted to make this statement, because it is absolutely unfair. With regard to what happened in Madeira, in Italy, this summer, Of course, I personally express my solidarity. We have already spoken, the Italian authorities have until mid-November to apply for the solidarity fund.  Unfortunately, Italy is the country that has benefited the most, more than EUR 1.3 billion for this prevention of calamities. A significant amount of money went to Italy in 2009 on the occasion of the Aquila cutrem. Another significant amount of money for earthquake prevention went to Italy in 2012 on the occasion of the cutrem in the Emilia Romagna region. Let's see what happened to all these disaster prevention plans. And we are ready, and this time, to contribute, we are ready to change the operational-regional programme, if it requires it, but I think we need to see to what extent the amounts that have been allocated during these disasters in recent years in Italy, because indeed, as you say, the apennine area, which is the backbone of Italy, is subject to these massive attempts, to invest this money as best we can.  And in Madeira I will be pleased to come to the annual meeting of the outermost regions on 22 September this month, and, of course, how we can help Madeira together with the solidarity fund will be one of the topics that we will address together with the authorities in this region. You know very well that for me the outermost regions are a special subject and we will once again have the opportunity to meet again, members of the European Parliament from these regions who, in my opinion, require special treatment.  Thank you very much.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this debate, I wanted to highlight a few aspects that are fundamental to me: the economic crisis, yes, but above all austerity policies have stifled domestic demand and so have businesses and our small and medium-sized enterprises. These must be helped in access to credit. To this end, we must ensure that the relationship between the banking system and small businesses is improved and changed. The financial instruments currently have very high risk profiles, and we do not yet have any evidence to suggest that they should be used favoured more favourfully than subsidies.  The Capital Market Union is also a very important initiative and we do not share the optimism regardless of the Commission. What we need to invest in is administrative capacity, transparency, greater transparency in the use of funds, the higher rate of participation of all local authorities, civil society actors and entrepreneurs in the process of defining the requirements for submitting project proposals in order to respond more specifically to the needs of the final beneficiaries. We must apply the partnership principle rigidly and prevent cohesion policy from being perceived as further imposition from above. Cohesion policy can be highly improved, but as the European Union's main investment instrument it must be vigorously defended. In this respect, the Member States, and especially those of southern Europe, which have so far been the main users, bear a huge responsibility. Among these states, many have not yet expressed a clear position in the face of this threat.  In fact, faced with the pressure of other leaner European funding programmes, such as Horizon 2020, cohesion policy and its programmes are perceived as retrograde, but we therefore do not understand that the rationale of these real policies is completely different.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your speeches and thank the Commissioner for the interesting announcements she has made to us on the future development of macro-regional strategies and ours in particular.  The challenge of this strategy, as I said earlier, will be to keep together such a complex and diverse area: there are highly developed areas economically, others uncontaminated, others in serious economic difficulties. It is the first strategy that does not involve capital cities but areas that are considered marginal by all their countries; Mountains, of course, but also plains, cities of international scope, which have always been characterised by dynamism and capacity for innovation, and these can help mountain areas to develop new projects so that there are no second-class and second-class citizens.  New technologies can come to our rescue, for example with e-health, teleworking, the new opportunities of the sharing economy – think of an Uber in the Alps, which would be very welcome because taxis are not found here at all – and therefore distance learning: in short, many innovative solutions can make it possible to better address the needs of such a complex area as that of the Alps.  There have been a number of interventions with regard to Turin-Lyon. I repeat: the Turin-Lyons opinion is not about this opinion, it is a work that has already been decided and is in progress.

There is a general shift from infrastructure developments to developments supporting the knowledge-based economy, but it should be bearing in mind that infrastructure development cannot continue to be overshadowed because infrastructure is often deficient in more developed Member States, development cannot always be solved on a market basis, and proper infrastructure interconnection is also a prerequisite for the functioning of the single internal market. Over the period 2014-2020, the proportion of financial instruments has increased significantly at the expense of grants, and this trend is expected to continue to strengthen. I think it is important to stress that, although financial instruments can be useful, they cannot always provide a feasible solution, since many developments have significant social value but do not result in direct financial gain. It is therefore necessary to carry out a thorough analysis of the results of their cohesion policy contribution before increasing the proportion of financial instruments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Norbert ERDŐS", "mepid": "124711", "text": "  Writing. – I voted in favour of the adoption of the Bresso report.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the title of the report we are debating today may suggest distant problems, but in reality it deals with issues that are very close to the citizens of Europe and of absolute topicality. The Africa Trust Fund is an extremely sensitive instrument that must be well planned, made to function effectively and finally communicated properly.  Today, Europe is at a crossroads: it has the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of millions of people, or it can be guided by national fear and selfishness and thus fail in its objectives. The Trust Fund for Africa is designed to respond to the need to eradicate the root causes of migration through interventions aimed at creating development in those countries that are the scene of mass migration.  In order to make the Fund effective, it is necessary: 1) to operate in the long term in a defined and programmatic way, thus avoiding intervening only in an emergency key; 2) pay particular attention to the least developed countries, making the appropriate differences between the different contexts; 3) invest in education, health, training and essential public services; 4) involve NGOs and local civil society in the planning and implementation of all projects on the ground; (5) provide for regular monitoring and monitoring by this Parliament of the use of funds; (6) to make provision for transparency, information and dissemination of results which are easily verifiable by citizens; (7) to require States to keep their promises on additional funding.  For these reasons, the report I am presenting in this House seeks to make it clear that we agree both on putting together more resources in order to intervene at the base of the problem and on the nature of an instrument that allows rapid action to be taken in the face of urgent situations, just as we agree to restore the necessary budget units.  At the same time, however, we cannot fail to point out that there are still some concerns. The acceding states, for example, are making a great effort – as we saw at the Valletta summit last November – but then, in the spotlight off, they forget their promises and commitments. In addition, we must point out the real risk that development funds could be diverted to other areas, such as border control of the countries involved. This type of intervention has nothing to do with development and will never solve the root of the problem.  I will conclude by emphasising that all these issues have been the focus of a constructive debate between the political parties, which has continued even at the stage of the amendments and after the vote in the Committee on Development. Similarly, thanks to the instruments of online democratic participation that we use as the 5-Star Movement, such as the Rousseau system, many citizens have had the opportunity to get to know the draft report and to express their opinion, and some of these observations have been transformed into amendments signed by me and have been included in the text voted on in committee.

The EU Trust Fund for Africa was created as a swift and flexible implementing tool to, inter alia, better manage migration and deliver quick results. The Trust Fund reduces the risk of aid fragmentation and provides a platform for political visibility and engagement with countries of origin, transit and destination.  In the three regions concerned – the Sahel and Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa and the North of Africa – the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration are diverse, complex and often inter-related. They thus require a holistic and integrated approach.  I have personally witnessed this in my visits to Mali, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and lately in the last few months to Niger and Chad. I saw the situation on the ground and I strongly believe that the EU Trust Fund is definitely supporting programmes aimed at creating employment opportunities in local communities of origin and return, with a focus on vocational training and the creation of micro and small enterprises. It also supports actions aimed at strengthening access to basic services across a variety of resilience programmes. It particularly targets young people and women as well as other vulnerable groups.  The EU Trust Fund for Africa complements existing EU instruments, national and regional frameworks as well as bilateral programmes of EU Member States. Development cooperation addresses migration issues in two ways: firstly, by helping partner countries to improve migration governance, tapping into the development potential of migration; and secondly, by addressing political, economic and social instability, development cooperation addresses the causes of irregular migration and forced displacement, in order to help ensure that migration takes place in an orderly and safe manner. The Trust Fund supports programmes aiming at better migration management, including affording international protection, offering long-term solutions to displaced people and facilitating the safe, and also dignified and sustainable, return of migrants. This is in line with the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and these are clearly development objectives. In the design and implementation of activities, the Commission follows three key principles. Firstly, the need for a strong human rights focus, especially in actions in support of law enforcement and border management; secondly, the need for continuous monitoring to ensure that European Union support is used for its intended purpose and is delivering the expected results; and thirdly, the need to be transparent and inclusive with EU Member States, African partners, and relevant international organisations and civil society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. As shadow rapporteur for the EPP Group, I would like to thank Mr Corrao for his cooperation in this motion for a resolution. The Trust Fund for Africa is a new instrument aimed at addressing the root causes of destabilisation of forced displacement and irregular immigration. However, it must not replace effective border management and control and must be subject to transparency rules not only in terms of its implementation, but also in terms of funding.  The regions of the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin and the North Africa covered are among the most fragile in the context of the current migration and refugee crisis, and therefore the Fund will only deliver results if faster and more flexible spending is linked to long-term development objectives, namely the provision of peace and the rule of law and the implementation of good governance practices by beneficiary countries.  The political will of partner countries is crucial, as the Fund is also intended to strengthen their local capacity for ownership and responsibility. It is difficult to expect that such ad hoc support will have immediate effects, and therefore the Fund should be seen as a complementary action 11. European Development Fund. A coherent development policy and the principle of complementarity between all instruments and actors in development aid must also be respected in this case. We must place great emphasis on the need to increase member states' involvement and meet not only the commitments on contributions to the Trust Fund, but also more broadly to ODA, especially in the context of reducing Member States' contributions to this year's Union budget thanks to the EUR 1.3 billion surplus of 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Arne LIETZ", "mepid": "124839", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Good evening, Commissioner. As shadow rapporteur for the S&amp;D Group, I would like to draw particular attention to two aspects of this fund. Firstly, the aim of the Trust Fund is to respond quickly and concretely to emergencies in the following regions. It concerns the Sahel, the region around Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa and North Africa. Economic development projects are intended above all to help combat the causes of flight and – i agree with you, Commissioner – that is all right and proper.  Unfortunately, however, this also includes border security projects. And the Socialists and Democrats say quite clearly that border controls do not combat the causes of flight and that border security actually exacerbates the problem even more. If someone wants to flee and is entitled to an asylum procedure in Europe, they must not be prevented from doing so. Increased border controls mean that smugglers come up with even more daring strategies and put people fleeing hardship at risk.  That is why we must pay close attention to what the money is spent on in the regions. And in planning projects and in monitoring, the EU Parliament – that is, us – as a democratically elected institution should have greater influence.  The second point concerns the financing of projects through the trust funds. It must not lead to long-term projects enabling real development being jeopardised in favour of short-term programmes.  Most of the trust fund is financed by the European Development Fund, which is outside the EU budget. However, the use of financial instruments outside the EU budget is unsustainable. The reason for this is that the Member States can voluntarily contribute their contributions and set the sums themselves. With this fund – and this has been said many times this evening by my colleagues – it was envisaged that the Member States, like the Commission, should also contribute EUR 1.8 billion. So far, only a little over EUR 81 million has been raised. – that is, only a fraction that is supposed to supply several regions of Africa at the same time. This is a disgrace which calls the whole fund into question on the part of the Member States.  Perhaps, therefore, in the long term, we should consider what we Social Democrats have been calling for for a long time, namely that the European Development Fund should be fully integrated into the EU budget in the near future.

We will receive information from your Directorate-General every six months, but we do not have the tools to be able to carry out this work. On the other hand, Parliament is not represented on the strategic council, even though a good amount of the total budget comes, as I said, from the European Development Fund.

Because we are concerned that the Trust Fund constitutes yet another attempt to divert the diminishing development funds towards aims related to protecting Europe from people fleeing war and poverty – and this is not acceptable. We cannot be sure that the internationally agreed principles of development effectiveness are fulfilled. Parliament has extremely limited rights of scrutiny and, as already mentioned by colleagues, if we look at how this fund was put together, we can conclude that, despite the expectation that Member States would be eager to contribute to it, the contributions by Member States to complement EU development funding, mainly from the European Development Fund (EDF), have been extremely limited – to my knowledge around EUR 69 million.

The EU Trust Fund aims to prevent displacement but we have to go further and we need a clear strategy. I would like a really clear strategy on protecting vulnerable communities in their homeland. Without a common European strategy we cannot overcome the challenges of irregular migration. If you look at Africa, displacement is often driven by religious hatred. Europe is responsible for these people, whose basic rights are in danger. We need to join forces in relief activities, and the EU Trust Fund that we have discussed today strongly promotes this idea. Let me make a serious suggestion here: EU action will be more effective if we bring religious organisations on board as well. They manage efficiently functioning local relief networks. The efficiency of organised church bodies often exceeds that of public aid. It would be a failure to ignore their local experience as they have a significant impact on creating social stability. Without this cooperation, negative impacts will increase in the future. We need a new level of comprehensive support in this situation: we are helping them and they are showing up in Europe.

However, we have a situation where the African Trust Fund is currently short of EUR 1.7 billion due to lack of Member States’ contributions.  Now how is this gap to be plugged?

It is therefore important to provide financial support to the countries of Africa, because this is the only way to avoid the mass exodus of its populations caused by impoverishment and lack of prospects. Sincere support is therefore needed for the economies most struggling to cope with economic globalisation.

My experience on the ground has already convinced me that without dealing with the root causes there is no possibility to overcome and to see specific results on the ground. Please give me the chance before concluding to report on progress achieved so far by the EU Trust Fund. In approximately six months, 59 programmes have been approved across the three regions, for a total of EUR 927 million. We are now concluding a great number of contracts with implementers to start activities on the ground. Let me underline that funding in the countries of Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea, is given only to partners, not to the governments. This is an important feature of our assistance. Migration issues are an integral part of our dialogue with African partners. In line with the new partnership framework endorsed by the European Council, the European Union is engaged in the process of developing comprehensive partnership ‘compacts’ with a limited number of initial countries of origin and transit. In addition to the nearly EUR two billion committed at Valletta, the Commission is ready to provide an additional EUR 500 million from the European Development Fund to finance actions in support of the new partnership approach, and calls upon EU Member States and other donors to match this additional contribution. So this is our initiative, and these are our activities making up the comprehensive approach in this very difficult area.

Having achieved the situation where women and men are equal earners and equal carers, there is a need for strong action at European, local and national levels for legislative measures, combined with non—legislative measures, in order to allow men and women to better reconcile work, caring for and spending time with family and friends and time for leisure and personal development. A labour market unable to provide flexible working arrangements and adequate-level schemes is a matter of everyday concern for a very high proportion of the population. The EU has to urgently adopt work-life balance policies – today’s reality – by taking into account the needs of an increasingly diverse society. In the report we call on the Commission to put forward a number of legislative proposals on family and care—related types of leave, namely a revised maternity leave directive, a paternity leave directive and a carers’ leave directive. Furthermore, Member States are in particular called upon to provide for accessible, available and affordable, high-quality care services for children, older relatives, family members with disabilities or those with illnesses. A specific part of the report is dedicated to the quality of employment. The crisis has also led to an increase in the numbers of the working poor throughout Europe, causing people to have to work more and longer hours, even combining several jobs, in order to earn a decent income. It is therefore important to ensure an inadequate wage for all workers and provide worker-oriented flexible working arrangements that do not cause an additional burden for the personal and family situation of both women and men.  Finally, labour market conditions favourable for work-life balance can only be created if quality of life is supported within and outside work. This means ensuring people have enough time outside work for personal development and leisure, and combating inequalities in society as a whole. We the co-rapporteurs are very satisfied with the outcome of the vote on the draft report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. We regret, and are extremely anxious about, the large number of requests for split votes. We have all received the joint statement of 11 networks of NGOs – that is the text – who have been working together since 2012 in order to raise awareness about the daily challenges faced by women and men across the EU in reconciling their work, family and private life. These 11 networks of NGOs are calling on us to adopt this report in full to avoid undermining its comprehensive and coherent nature.

First of all, I thank the co-rapporteurs, Tatyana Ždanokai, and all the shadow rapporteurs for our joint work, because in fact this report is a contribution from the European Parliament, a reaction to the Commission's action plan on solutions to reconcile private life and work, especially for those families who raise children, and this is also a contribution to the public consultation and consultation with the social partners published by the Commission.  The issue is indeed very important, and we hope to receive legislative proposals from the Commission, because this is also a very topical topic in the Member States, because it affects every citizen of our country. In June this year, the Council adopted conclusions on gender equality, in which it stressed the need to adopt and strengthen legislative measures that would actually enable women and men to reconcile work, private and family life. I am pleased that we all want and pursue a common goal in this area. In the report, we therefore call on the Commission to present as soon as possible a new ambitious proposal for the Maternity Leave Directive, as well as the Carers' Leave Directive, which would allow family members to look after their dependent family members, people with disabilities or elderly family members and to ensure a certain level of social protection for them.  We also call on the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a Paternity Leave Directive providing for at least two weeks of fully paid parental leave, and finally we call for a revision of the Parental Leave Directive and for the minimum paid leave to be extended from four to six months, as women actually have to participate in the labour market, since the integration of women into the labour market is a key tool in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. However, if we encourage women to work and stay on the labour market for as long as possible, we must also provide all the conditions for equalising work and private life.  It is also important to stress that better coordination, co-ordination and access to different holidays in the Member States would certainly increase employment. We must also appreciate the rapid ageing of Europe, the facilitation of reconciling work and private life to enable parents to pay more attention to their families, while at the same time stimulating the birth rate. It is often the case that if families, especially women, fail to reconcile their professional activities with childcare, they are hesitant to have more children or decide not to have them at all. It is therefore not surprising that the European Union is facing the problem of a decline in birth rates.  It is therefore essential that a family-friendly environment is created in the workplace and that employers guarantee flexible working relationships for families with children and provide additional social guarantees. We need to ensure gender equality and a fair distribution of family responsibilities. Unfortunately, there is still a settled view that the problem of reconciliation between work and family is more often highlighted as a problem for women, as they bear the greatest burden of family care. We also really call on the Commission to introduce, during the semester, certain targeted monitoring indicators for the elderly and other dependants, similar to the Barcelona targets, and, in order for this process to take place, we call on Eurostat and Eurofound to collect relevant data and carry out studies in this area. Thus, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to reconcile work, personal and family life and we need to strike the right balance for every person to meet the professional, personal and family needs. Dear colleagues, I very much hope that tomorrow in the European Parliament there will be understanding and support for this report from all the political groups, and we must certainly send a message to the citizens of the European Union tomorrow that we are not blind to their problems. I very much ask for support in tomorrow's vote in favour of this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Madam President, I thank my colleagues for submitting their report.

Madam President, the initiatives taken so far, both at European and national level, to balance work and personal life have not brought the desired results. In fact, discrimination in the workplace between the sexes makes this harmonisation even more difficult for women. The types of leave linked to family reasons continue to be discriminatory despite existing legislation and, in countries such as Greece, the sharp wage differences and unemployment rates of 28.7% among women make them economically vulnerable. It is therefore necessary for the Union to take political action in order to address the socio-economic challenges created in the Member States of the European Union.

The Commission shares many of your analyses and conclusions.  Parenting – and caring more generally – is no longer only the role of women. To care is to be human, and anyone can become a carer. In fact, many men would like to spend more time with their families, but do not have the possibility or are somehow discouraged from doing so. But the Commission believes that, if a woman wants to be more active on the labour market, making the most of her high level of educational attainment, she should have the possibility to do so, even when she has children or when relatives get older or ill. And the same is valid for a working man who wants to be more present at home to be with his young children or care for his relatives. This report comes at the right moment: it supports our ongoing initiative to improve work-life balance for working parents and caregivers. We welcome very much the work and effort of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to draw attention to these important challenges and to suggest interesting options.  The Commission’s aim now is to present a more holistic approach to addressing the challenges of work-life balance. We have an existing EU legal framework in this field and policy instruments such as policy guidance, benchmarks and monitoring. But these are not enough. Both the legal instruments and the policy measures need to be modernised and updated. First, to enable both women and men to realise their potential in the labour market. Second, to support employers to have the skills they need. Third, to combat discrimination, and fourth, to reduce the gender-based exposure to poverty and achieve gender equality.  We are envisaging a comprehensive package with both legislative and non-legislative elements to support working families and businesses. The challenges for working parents start with the arrival of a new baby and continue into childhood and the teenage years. There needs to be a decent level of childcare and care services infrastructure in place to give people a meaningful choice. And we must not forget the challenges of caring for elderly or infirm dependants faced by today’s ‘sandwich generation’.   We want to propose up-to-date solutions to meet real needs. We are now running the second consultation with social partners, seeking their views on possible avenues for EU legislative action. We also held a broad public consultation which ended in February this year.  The views expressed by experts and key stakeholders point to the need for developing and implementing a range of non-legislative EU measures such as policy guidance, improved monitoring, better utilisation of EU funds and knowledge-sharing activities. Subject to the social partners’ prerogative to negotiate, it is the Commission’s intention to accompany this process. If the social partners decide not to enter into negotiation, the Commission intends to explore all avenues leading to the establishment of an effective legislative and policy framework. You have seen this commitment in our work programme, and we are pleased to have your support in this endeavour. We will tackle these challenges together, for working men and women across Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 189, "date": "2016-09-12.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

However, it is very complex and touches on cultural issues, which requires the European Union to be extremely careful in the selection of instruments and in shaping legislation. Nevertheless, we must bear in mind that there are now some objective processes, which some experts call the second demographic transition. We are dealing with a redefinition of the family model and a radical decline in fertility. The so-called nuclear family goes down in history. In order to continue to grow economically, the Union needs to adapt to the new times and, above all, to stem the negative demographic trend. However, as the rapporteurs rightly points out, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in all Member States.  Nevertheless, decisive action is needed, including, above all, family-friendly policies. Therefore, while I agree that a review of the Maternity Directive is needed, I believe that a certain sensitivity is needed in the preparation of legislative proposals, given the cultural differences in paternity and carers' leave.

This has a negative impact on the quality of life of families, but also often on fertility, as families struggle to decide on offspring, which threatens demographic collapse. That is why employee guarantees are so important, especially for mothers who want to return to work after having a child. It is therefore pleased that the report adopted by the Committee on Employment and the Committee on Women's Rights draws attention in several places to the need to preserve the right of return to work, as well as other facilities particularly important for young mothers, i.e. flexible working hours, provided that they arise from the needs of the worker and are adapted to his or her abilities.

Work-life balance policies must be well designed, as they are essential to improve the working environment that consequently generates good working conditions and social and business well-being.

Madam President, the recent negative decision of the Committee on Petitions on Germany's debts to Greece is morally unacceptable and politically completely biased. It is a disgrace to the European Union itself, which is washing its hands like a young Pontius Pilate on the issue of German war reparations. It is a historic challenge to the Greek fighters of the National Resistance but also to the peoples of Europe who did not bow their heads to the Nazi beast. It is a great demonstration that the European Union has now turned into a German Europe that is trying to change even history itself.
