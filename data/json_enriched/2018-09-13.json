I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the European Commission and, in particular, the European Parliament's research service. It was an excellent job, we worked on this thing for more than half a year. We have become accustomed to saying that the European pesticide approval system is the strictest in the world. Yes, that's right, the system does. However, when we first reviewed its implementation, we found that, unfortunately, this system is being devalued by disrespect, circumvention, abuse, little transparency, both at our level, at EU level and at Member State level. Unfortunately, the regulation on pesticides is not fully implemented and the precautionary principle is often ignored, the current situation could easily pose a threat to the health of Europeans as well as a threat to species diversity, ecosystem or soil.  Just a few facts that this research has shown us. There are a number of products on the EU market that have not been re-evaluated for more than 15 years. The European Commission is also taking quite substantial steps in this regard, I believe that its work will be successful. Emergency authorisations, to be strictly used only in cases where plant production is at risk, are regularly misused by Member States to circumvent the classical authorisation process with potentially far-reaching health consequences. The case of neonicotinoids, which we have temporarily banned because of the health of bees at EU level, and the ban did not come into force at all in many countries because they were allowed in this way, speaks for all.  At our European level, the so-called confirmatory procedure is sometimes abused, unfortunately we get products on the market for which research is not completed, for which we do not know exactly what the consequences are, there is insufficient data. Among other things, thanks to this, we now have many herbicides on the market, the active ingredient of which is the same substance as it was in the infamous Agent Orange. For many pesticides, we do not know the long-term effects on biodiversity, we do not adequately evaluate the effect on soil, soil macro-organisms and microorganisms. We can't deal with the cocktail effect, we can't deal with long-term exposure of organisms to these substances and these consequences. However, even if everything goes perfectly, at the end of this process we have a Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, which is more or less anonymous and does not have to be guided in principle by anything or science at all. This message is an implementation message, nothing more, nothing less. We tried to stick to the conclusions of the research study, I am a little sorry for some somewhat emotional and unfortunately false amendments. An example for all of them is the amendment of the European People's Party, which has been backed by other right-wing factions and which says that the number of pesticides available on the European market is decreasing. This is not true, the European Commission is doing a really good job in this regard and, according to the European Commission's public database, there are now twice as many products authorised in Europe as there were in 2009. This report is very well timed, its conclusions, research results and proposals can be adopted by the PEST Special Committee, which is to propose improvements to our European pesticide authorisation system. I also used its results to work on a proposal for a regulation on transparency and sustainability of risk assessments in the food supply chain. Unfortunately, this Parliament does not have a separate legislative initiative and I hope that the European Commission will help us to propose the necessary legislative amendments. Some of the shortcomings identified are already being corrected by the European Commission's proposals, and we will wait for others to be rectified. However, this report will in any case help in all other planned steps to improve this legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "Peter JAHR", "mepid": "96772", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been a member of the European Union. Sometimes it's like writing an essay: the subject is so interesting, there's so much to say, and then you write and write, and sometimes you can't even recognize the original core theme and the core problem.  I would like to remind you of the real issue. The real problem was: does the European authorisation and authorisation procedure meet the self-righteous objectives? And from our point of view, I have to say: three times no. It should become less bureaucratic: the objective should not be achieved. A Europe-wide zonal authorisation should be established: target not achieved. And it should become more transparent and cheaper: even since the target has not been achieved.  The main problem remains that, although we have cross-border zonal authorisation, there is still no mutual recognition of the Member States. In practice, this means that a means may be used on one side of the river in Austria, and on the other side of the river in Germany, the national authorisation is still pending with several years of delay. Here, too, we must overcome a certain national arrogance of authorisation. I simply ask that, in the rage of the debate and the issue of this key issue, we do not forget about this issue in the political debate of the day.

Your own—initiative report will make a valuable contribution to our ongoing work on this important topic. I want to start by stressing that we share common concerns and common goals: first of all, to protect citizens’ and animal health; second, to safeguard the environment; and third, to maintain food safety. All three goals are common to all of us. We share these with Europeans, who are increasingly interested and engaged in how we produce food and want to ensure this is done in a sustainable way. This is very much the debate at the moment. In response, Europeans expect – and rightly so – policy—making to be more open, more inclusive and more transparent. We can only meet these expectations if we work together, learn together from recent challenges, and move forward together.   I also want to underline, with these expectations in mind, that the European Union has one of the strictest regulatory systems for pesticides in the world, as was just mentioned, but we see a lot of implementation difficulties. The system is based on science and requires a scientific evaluation of every active substance. The Commission has removed and will continue to remove active substances from the market if they are not safe. Let me stress that since the Plant Protection Products Regulation entered into force in 2011, 22 non-approval or non-renewal decisions have been taken, based on scientific evaluation. In fact, approval criteria are so strict that companies sometimes decide not to submit their substances for renewal because they do not expect them to pass this test. Substances expected to fall under the cut-off criteria see a particularly low rate of applications for renewal. This is a fact. The Commission does not hesitate, either, to restrict the use of certain substances – when justified – to protect non-target organisms like bees, as was just mentioned. The recent decision to ban outdoor use of three neonicotinoid substances is a good example.   This, I hope, demonstrates the Commission’s commitment – and my personal commitment – but also some of the difficulties that the Commission faces. These decisions are often challenged and sometimes do not receive the support of a qualified majority of Member States. That is true. Before the summer, the Commission proposed a ban or restriction on the use of four substances. However, none of them received the necessary support from Member States. I want to be clear that the legislation adopted by Parliament and the Council is very strict. At the same time, there is no such thing as a perfect system, so we should always look to refine it and incorporate lessons learned. I am pleased to read this own-initiative report and see it focuses on the same issues as the Commission’s ongoing Regulatory Fitness and Performance (REFIT) evaluation, which should be finalised in the first half of 2019. We are on the path to finishing our job. Another important report will be the Special committee on the Union’s authorisation procedure for pesticides (PEST Committee) report, which will be voted on in committee on 6 December and will also feed into the Commission’s analysis as we move ahead. I am waiting for the PEST Committee report. I will actually be very eager to carefully collect and actually look at all contributions on the matter, including those from various stakeholders, academia and NGOs in the first place, and the report from the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM). One point I need to be clear about, however, is that it is premature to envisage specific measures now. The evaluation needs to be finalised first before it can provide a solid evidence base for an appropriate course of action. This is not the only area we are working on. Both the fitness check on the General Food Law and last year’s European Citizens’ Initiative on glyphosate called for greater transparency in EU risk assessment in the food chain and greater sustainability. I have proposed that the European Union General Food Law be revised with these goals in mind. They touch on several recommendations that you make in the implementation report. The proposal also aims to increase transparency and strengthen risk communication. This is correct. I am confident that it will result in significant benefits and improve citizens’ trust and confidence. Trust in science is very important now. There is no doubt that transparency is fundamental and I am very proud to have delivered on this. I was actually recently thanked and reminded of this on this occasion by a voice in this debate. A very active leader was Mr Burtscher-Schaden. He said this sentence to me: ‘in March 2016, you stated that all studies should be disclosed because of an overriding public interest and two years after, in March 2018, you came with a strong legal proposal’. Thanks a lot. In other words, I promised and I delivered. Now it is up to all of us to move forward with our proposal. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) Committee has begun work on our proposal and the first draft report was published in July. I am pleased that the file is being handled quickly. I call on all of you to support this so that the legislative process can be finished within the current legislative term. From my point of view, it would help us to move in the right direction.  Beyond this, we are investing via research in a more sustainable future. To support the development of low-risk products of biological origin, the Commission has identified research areas under the Seventh Framework Programme and the Horizon 2020 programmes and has funded – or will fund – several projects on integrated pest management and biological control. No doubt this will take time. There is also the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive, which seeks to reduce the risk of pesticides to health and the environment. I know that Ms Jytte Guteland is also preparing a report in this respect and we will await its final conclusions. Last year, a Commission report found wide variations between different national action plans linked to this Directive. This needs to change for all of us. Member States are currently reviewing these plans and must include clear, measurable goals and timetables. I call on you to lead focused debates on national action plans in your own individual Member States. This would be very helpful. Thank you once again for your engagement and your report. I will follow your vote later today closely and I can assure you that your conclusions will be carefully considered in our REFIT evaluation. I look forward to continuing our joint work to improve transparency, trust and the overall sustainability of our food safety system.

We are all concerned about those, Commissioner, so that’s a point we took into account when we were looking at this legislation. We are also grateful to our own parliamentary research services for this rather large tome of a document, which is an impact assessment of legislation which is world class. I think we all agree with that: we have good legislation. What this report is about is making sure it’s being implemented effectively. Other colleagues have spoken about where the problems are in implementation, and they are at Member State level – a lack of coordination, perhaps a lack of trust – and they are things which can be rectified. I hope that the work of our rapporteur and colleagues in this Chamber will allow that to happen because it is really important. I know that when this legislation was first being discussed there were a lot of concerns amongst farmers because they felt they would be left with no products to keep their plants healthy, to improve yields, or whatever. And I would point out that when we say we should ban this product or that product, without saying what the alternatives are and what the consequences are, it doesn’t make us look good as legislators. So I would ask us to be very conscious of our language because – clearly, Commissioner, you are right – where a product has a problem it should not be used, but we also need to make sure that we have sufficient replacement products or systems so that farmers can manage their plant health, look after diseases and control weeds, in a way which is sustainable.

Colleagues who know me and my work from both the Committee on Health and Agriculture know that it is important to me that citizens can rely on compliance with the hazard-based approach that underpins this law when approving plant protection products. In addition, this risk-based approach was extended some time ago by another principle, the precautionary principle. In view of the fact that we want to promote sustainable agriculture within the Union and to support it accordingly in legislation and financial terms, it is important to me to create the appropriate framework conditions in the area of authorisation and use of plant protection products as well.  We boast that we have the best and safest authorisation procedure, which is also confirmed time and again in the context of the work in the Special Committee on the AUTHORISATION procedure for eu pesticides, and yet shows massive weaknesses: for example, the numerous derogations granted in the Member States under Article 53 of the opposite regulation are extremely worrying.

Mr President, Commissioner, whatever we do and whatever agricultural model we use, the production of food is a natural thing to do. And it has an environmental impact. It is our job and the job of the sector to minimise that environmental impact.  That is why an integrated crop protection approach is so important. We need to put a lot more effort into preventing a plague from breaking out than healing. How do we do that? First of all, by breeding, to digest crops that are more resistant to diseases. By focusing more on soil quality. With ecological innovations, such as the use of insects and microorganisms, but at the same time technological innovations, such as precision agriculture, but as a last resort to ensure that the harvest is not lost. To reduce food waste, chemical agents are sometimes needed.  What is important to realise is that the admission procedure we have here in Europe for resources is the strictest in the world. What I want to go to is that the search for alternatives, low-risk resources and biological resources is accelerated, that the admissions system has specialized people for that and that there is more manpower and more money to do this. This, for example, for small crops, which do not yet have such a last resort, also makes certain resources available.

Mr President, this report deals with plant protection products. And that's a really crazy name for substances that aren't so much meant to protect, but especially to kill.  The Commission has a duty to ensure that only products that are not harmful to humans, animals or the environment are approved. However, the European Ombudsman concluded that the Commission is far too lenient, leaving many substances on the market unjustly. According to food watchdog Foodwatch, the Commission has been keeping hundreds of toxins on the market for years without a scientific assessment or evaluation. As a result, even a number of substances are still on the market that are proven to be harmful to health. Agricultural poison with glyphosate as a symbol shows what is wrong in Europe. Multinationals are above the environment and money, above health. The Special Committee of Inquiry into the authorisation of pesticides could put an end to this failing policy. Unfortunately, as with the Commission, the results of this investigation are not expected in this Parliament. A missed opportunity. Just as the content of this report is a missed opportunity.  Parliament had the opportunity to close back doors. Parliament had the opportunity to change an old course of action. It had the chance to stop the many gruesome animal experiments for agricultural poison. But Parliament has failed to pass up these opportunities at the expense of animals, people and the environment. The future of our planet is at stake. I therefore find it incomprehensible that Parliament has not taken these opportunities.

I listened very carefully to your proposals and suggestions, especially in relation to trade. When we are discussing our trade agreements with third countries, we are very much involved in debates about the use of pesticides which are banned in the EU. It is and will always be on our agenda. Ms McGuinness rightly mentioned a less ideological approach in our debates. I was in Carcassonne a few weeks ago and had a meeting with organic farmers who were producing organic wine, and we have debates, which are not easy, about copper. Sometimes, too, I see how some are vocal about a ban on glyphosate, for example, knowing that a scientific assessment was done transparently. This is excluding the Monsanto Papers, which are always mentioned. It is not about the Monsanto Papers: it is about the possibility of really assessing the situation from an evidence-based point of view, from the precautionary principle, and about having arguments in our hands. Look, ban glyphosate and copper, and what about organic farming? What can we do? Ms McGuinness has very rightly raised questions. We need to understand the complexity of the issues and to see how we can achieve proper enforcement, implementation, control and integrated management. All this should, of course, be done in a proper manner. About the use of derogations: yes, we sent letters to those Member States because we asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to assess once again all the issues related to the use of such derogations in the area of neonicotinoids. We assess the situation and then we inform governments once again, especially those who use them without evidence. We are doing our job. We are not scapegoating, which is always bad, bad, bad. No! For me, as a medical doctor, there is no doubt that health is a priority, but if I am using medicines in animal health or plant health, or using medicines in treating people, I know what this means. We need to have a very balanced approach. I am, of course, ready to work together with you. We all share the same belief in achieving the goals regarding health, the environment and food safety. We need to work together to maintain and reinforce the European Union’s very stringent regulatory system for pesticides. Enforcement and implementation are the key. I assure you that we are committed to working towards greater transparency, increased trust and more a sustainable system of food production. Once again, thank you for your engagement and for your own—initiative report.

Seven years after the European Commission's reply that there are different taste and price preferences in different countries, that the food is safe, so what is it. Colleagues, this is nothing less than the very essence of the functioning of the internal market. In 2013, the previous Parliament called on the Commission to look into the subject, to carry out a Pan-European survey and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing legislation. But it is only after another five years of persuasion and proof, various surveys, that there is a report on the dual quality and a clear position of the European Parliament. I would like to thank all my colleagues who have advocated over the past years that we take this highly political and symbolic issue, which speaks volumes about equality, fairness and fairness of the European internal market, seriously in the European Union. I thank all those who have helped explain the substance here, in the Commission and at the Council: that it is really not normal for a product that looks the same to consumers to have a different composition without the consumer knowing about it at first sight. That it is not a duel between lavender and violets, but a smaller content of meat or its substitutes, poorer quality of raw materials, their different quality and ratio, more different additives and so on.  What we want is for consumers not to be misled and to have the right to products of the same quality. What's weird about the requirement: Mark what's the same and different, what's different. In short: don't make consumers, excuse me for the expression, fools. Personal experience with the dual quality not only of food, but also of non-food goods has many people in our countries. That these are taste preferences? Even in infant formula? Comes. Even the direct price versus quality ratio is far from true here. I am glad that the European Commission has also rocked after Juncker's State of the Union address last year. We have interpretive recommendations on the table, a common testing methodology, money to gather more evidence. More tests are planned in the Member States. But watch out. We already have hard data, test results in laboratories of renowned universities, such as in the case of the Czech survey, in which I myself participated. It is certainly good to collect data at Union level. But that's not enough after so many years of consumer frustration. Especially when some countries where double quality has been revealed refuse to participate in a Pan-European survey.  Ladies and gentlemen, many of you will surely tell me that it is not the job of politicians to prescribe to producers what and how to produce. The aim is not to unify products, to invent a kind of uniform euro flavor. However, consumer preference must no longer serve as a pretext for quality reduction. Most consumers do not even know that products of the same brand can be adapted to different markets. If the manufacturer wants to offer the customer a regional treatment, what prevents him from proudly signing up for it on the packaging? I want accurate and easy-to-understand information about the composition of the product. That's the basis. Member States must also introduce a regulation on the cooperation of national consumer protection supervisory authorities. They must share data, point out to each other non-complying products and possible misleading consumers. The role of consumer organisations is also important. I really appreciate their daily work in monitoring the market and educating consumers. But we can't expect miracles from them.  What is most important from my point of view: there is a lack of regulation at EU level. A regulation that clearly and without the possibility of different interpretations sets out what is double quality. That selling products on the internal market that the consumer can easily perceive as identical to deliberately different compositions is misleading the consumer. A regulation that will also bring legal certainty to supervisory authorities that will not fear costly legal battles with multinational supranational companies. Not so that your favorite drink tastes the same everywhere, but so that dishonest people feel a real possibility of punishment if they don't act fairly.  Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in the honesty of most manufacturers. Yet, where they are missing, there are legislators here to support their citizens, wherever they live in Europe.

We have worked with the Member State authorities and have provided concrete guidance on the relevant legislation, as well as co-funding for tests and enforcement capacities. The Commission’s Joint Research Centre, in close cooperation with all the stakeholders concerned, has developed a harmonised testing methodology, which is now being implemented in an EU-wide testing campaign. The majority of the Member States beyond those that have initiated and carried out tests at national level have agreed to participate in this exercise, which will provide us for the first time with authoritative and comparable evidence regarding the scope and dimension of the problem. The Commission is confident that the initial results, which will be obtained by the end of the year, will help us to define our methodology and to determine what is a significant difference noticeable to consumers when they are faced with products marketed as identical.

However, we are discussing today's report because there have been and are cases where this is not the case. And there aren't many. I am therefore pleased that this report has been created in the European Parliament and that it also has support in the European Commission. I see the solution, together with other colleagues, particularly in the single methodology, in assessing the dual quality of products as an unfair commercial practice and in empowering consumer organisations. Even when dealing with this subject, we do not need new institutions, but better use of existing institutions. We do not need new regulations, but greater cooperation between European and national leaders, and we do not need populism, but, above all, clear compliance with the rules. The relevant budget for testing suspicious products and better information to distinguish honest from fraudsters is also important. We cannot throw everyone in one bag, and it is also important to consider each individual case. If someone is acting dishonestly, we need to know throughout the Union. I believe that the present report is a good step towards eliminating the dual quality of products in our common market, and I would therefore like to ask for your support as approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

In fact, there is no legislation on dual quality at European level, and the European Commission's guidelines and other documents are not clear and often diverge in conclusions. While the European Commission also says that dual quality does not endanger citizens' health, it is confirmed that the individual ingredients in products in the central, eastern or southern European markets often contain less healthy alternatives, more sugar, fat or salt.

Thank you for this opportunity to pick out another example. It took me a long time to understand that detergents of a certain brand in Germany and France are based on completely different formulations, because in France ammonia traditionally plays a role as a chemical of cleanliness in people's noses and in Germany chlorine.

If it is possible to unify the designs in the premises of bathrooms and toilets and if ammonia and chlorine can somehow be brought together, then I would have no problem with that.

I agree with Parliament's position that equal access to high-quality goods in a non-discriminatory manner in the single market should be a real right for all European citizens. If this is not the case, the essential functioning of the single market and consumer confidence in the single market may be seriously undermined. In addition, consumers should be informed in a clear and transparent manner that the product they have purchased or is aware of in another Member State is different in order to avoid confusion between the consumer and his misconception of the product being purchased. It is also important to raise consumer awareness of products, their characteristics and composition. It should be noted that the marketing of products of a purposefully different composition in different parts of the EU, which the consumer can easily consider identical, is unfair practice and should therefore not be acceptable.

This is a deliberate misrepresentation of consumers in the hope of greater benefit. Unfortunately, this is usually done at the expense of eastern European consumers. In many cases, manufacturers explained the differences in product components with different local tastes. However, research has shown that the quality of not only food, but also other consumer products such as detergents is poorer.

I think that it is important for me to say a few words on the system that we have built together to assess human rights violations and ensure accountability, and bring perpetrators to justice. Today the existence of the International Criminal Court is being questioned. And I think it important to say formally and clearly in this Chamber that it is not being questioned by the European Union and that we will continue to strongly and fully support the ICC and its work. I know that this is the strong position of this Parliament, and of all our Member States. We remember very well when, 20 years ago in Rome, the Statute of the ICC was finally ratified. We remember very well that, after Rwanda and the war in the Balkans, the world needed real change and we all know that the International Criminal Court has brought that change. It has strengthened universal justice beyond power politics and beyond geopolitical interests. It has made it clear that justice is not an enemy of reconciliation, but, on the contrary, the basis for reconciliation, for it is when the victims feel powerless, when crimes are met with impunity, that reconciliation is much harder to achieve. Accountability is essential to build the foundations for peace. So the court may not be perfect, but the best way forward for us is not to dismantle our global institutions. The way forward for us is to make them stronger and to build a strong, more effective multilateral system. That is why, once again – I want to say so very clearly and very strongly in this room – that is why the European Union will continue to be a strong supporter of the ICC, and I am counting on your support in the work that lies ahead of us. Coming to the issue that we are discussing in this item of the agenda, on 13 August, as most of you have mentioned, at least 35 people were arrested in the Arua District in the north—west of Uganda immediately before a local by—election. Among the people arrested were four Members of Parliament belonging to the opposition, and in the following days various Ugandan sources reported that security forces had inflicted brutal treatment on the detainees, including the Members of Parliament. The European Union delegation and Member Statesʼ ambassadors on the ground followed the situation extremely closely and issued a joint statement on 17 August, calling upon all forces in Uganda to respect the rule of law and individual rights. We got the authorisation from the military authorities. Our delegation and European ambassadors were able to visit two of the Members of Parliament, Bobi Wine in the military barracks where he was being detained and Francis Zaake in the hospital where he was undergoing treatment. Both of them had several wounds and needed extensive medical treatment. They were eventually authorised to leave the country at the beginning of September. However, they are still facing treason charges. An investigation into the alleged abuses has been launched by the police. The Speaker of Parliament decided to set up an another committee to deal with this issue. Finally, a report is also expected from the Ugandan Human Rights Commission. We will wait for the conclusions of these investigations, but let me state very clearly once again that security forces have a duty to respect everyone’s freedom to peacefully demonstrate in support of their opinions. The allegations of torture are serious. If they are confirmed, perpetrators must be prosecuted and victims must obtain redress. Uganda has, unfortunately, a long history of violence and conflict, and we know very well that its people deserve some peace and the right to peacefully express their opinion. We’ve made this position very clear to the Ugandan Government and we will continue to engage with it so that responsibilities can be established and perpetrators are brought to justice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 90, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  I close the debate.

With this resolution, Parliament is not just urging the authorities in Myanmar to release immediately and unconditionally the two journalists, but also urging the High Representative and the Commission to ensure that wherever we have harassment of journalists we take action in terms of our trade agreements, and that we take action in this case. I think it’s important that in Myanmar we actually have a review of the archaic laws that facilitate these attacks.

At the time of their arrest they were working on an investigation into the killing of ten Rohingya men in a village in Rakhine State. We have been following this case very closely from the beginning, almost one year ago. Following their arrest on 18 December last year we requested their immediate release. Our delegation to Myanmar has observed all relevant court hearings, and, together with Member States, we continuously raise the issue with the Myanmar Government. When the court decided to press charges against the two journalists last year on 7 July we again reacted publicly. Many observers saw this trial as a test of media freedom, democracy and the rule of law. It is pretty clear that the test was failed, and we made this clear in our statements released right after the sentence, which will also intimidate other journalists, who could fear undue arrest or prosecution for doing their job.  Throughout the years, we’ve always accompanied Myanmar on its path towards democracy and I still have hope that Myanmar can go back to that path and become an inclusive and free country for all its citizens.  So we ask once again that the prison sentences be reviewed and that the two journalists be released immediately and unconditionally.  The report that they were working on, published almost a year ago, shed light on what was happening in Rakhine State. It contains the same kind of stories, exactly the same kind of stories, that I heard myself from Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Those stories have also led to the preliminary report from the United Nations fact-finding mission. The UN report confirms the need for pressure and engagement to make the situation change as soon as possible, and this is exactly what we’ve been doing so far as the European Union. As you know, we were one of the strongest voices calling for a fact-finding mission in 2017 and we are now sponsoring a resolution at the ongoing session of the Human Rights Council to support the recommendations and conclusions of the fact-finding mission. So, for those of you who asked us to do that, we are currently doing it.  The resolution will aim in particular to establish an international accountability mechanism. I discussed the issue with all my interlocutors at the ASEAN regional forum last month in Singapore, in particular with Bangladesh and also with China and Indonesia. We will also discuss the situation when we meet at the upcoming Asia-Europe meeting that we will host next month in Brussels, and of course I will use the UN General Assembly Ministerial Week 10 days from now to discuss how to improve the situation with all the relevant interlocutors, not only in the region, but also in the UN system. There are some urgent measures to be taken. First and foremost guaranteeing full and immediate humanitarian access inside Rakhine State. We are already among the largest humanitarian donors for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, but it is vital that aid reaches those in need inside Myanmar. To address these kinds of issues, as well as to improve the overall human rights situation and address the lack of accountability for those who have committed crimes, we are putting pressure on relevant individuals and institutions in Myanmar. We have put in place restrictive measures against seven senior army and police officers associated with serious human rights violations in Rakhine State. In light of the UN report we are considering strengthening these restrictive measures.  We’ve also made it clear to the Myanmar authorities that our trade preferences with Myanmar are linked to clear conditions on human rights and democracy and that to preserve our current trade arrangements we need to see decisive action to improve the situation.  Finally, we’re working closely with the civilian Government of Myanmar to address the root causes of conflict in accordance with the Annan report. The people of Myanmar have asked to turn the page, to go towards a democratic system and country, and they deserve better than this. They deserve a country where journalists are free to do their job and keep the state institutions accountable for their actions and they deserve a country where all citizens, all of them, have the same rights, whatever their faith or the background.  So we will continue to put pressure and to engage so that the country can advance again on its path towards democracy. Thank you very much, and especially I would like to thank all of you who are engaging strongly and closely with the country: parliamentary diplomacy – as always, but especially in this case – is key.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Thank you to you, Mrs Mogherini, for your statement, which was generally very supportive of the International Criminal Court.  On Cambodia, the elections in Cambodia were neither free nor fair and, as a result, have made the country an autocratic one-party state. The price was high: the largest opposition party in the country was virtually eliminated, independent journalists and human rights defenders intimidated and imprisoned. We demand that the government immediately drop the charges against opposition leader Kem Sokha and other opposition politicians, reverse the dissolution of the CNRP and seek dialogue with the opposition.  We also call on the government to stop the persecution and crackdown on human rights defenders and organisations. It is also necessary to extend the agreement with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which expires in December.

What reminds us of the slide towards a single party, the cult of the leader's personality, repression and obsession with any kind of opposition? It reminds me of Pol Pot and the terrible Khmer Rouge dictatorship, during which every single rule was aimed at destroying, torturing and rooting out anyone who was even suspected of not being aligned with the regime. Do we want to remember that Prime Minister Hun Sen and two senior officers are former members of the Khmer Rouge? How much difference do we find today between the Cambodian People's Party and Pol Pot's Communist Party of Kampuchea? The hunt for the dissident has remained practically the same.

One-party rule, authoritarian tendencies that have gained more ground in the country, and the space for political opposition and civil society has not so much shrunk as simply closed. At the general election in July following the enforced dissolution of the main opposition party, the ruling party won all seats in the National Assembly. The election took place in a highly restrictive environment and it was clearly not representative of the democratic will of the Cambodian citizens. Last February, at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council, we stressed that the Cambodian electoral process could not be considered legitimate after the arbitrary exclusion of the main opposition party, and so we suspended the European Union financial assistance to the Cambodian National Election Committee and we declined to observe the July elections. Over the last year the legal system has increasingly been used by the authorities in the country to suppress critical voices, not only from the opposition but also from civil society and the media, and at the Foreign Affairs Council in February, we stated that we may consider specific targeted measures if the situation had not improved. So, the situation has not improved and we are now considering the possibility of further measures that, as you know, would require the Council to take a unanimous decision. We also recall that the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including labour rights, is essential for maintaining EU trade preferences. For this reason we sent already in July a fact-finding mission to Cambodia to evaluate the situation on the ground, and the decisions on any further steps will be based on the information gathered during this mission. The European Union has been working with and for the people of Cambodia since the end of the war. At first we helped rebuild the country. We helped clear it of landmines and restart fundamental economic activities. Today we support job-creation and vocational training and we would like this partnership to continue, in order to continue to benefit the people of Cambodia. But it is clear that the Cambodian Government must reverse the current trend, otherwise this would not be possible. The recent release on bail of opposition leader Kem Sokha is a positive first step, even though he was released under very restrictive conditions. We now expect the dropping of all charges and the removal of all restrictions placed upon him and we invite the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition to start a dialogue on the way forward. We urge the Cambodian authorities to drop all remaining politically motivated charges against activists and lift the ban on the political activity of 118 senior opposition members. Local councillors from the opposition who were elected in June last year should be reinstated. We also call on the Cambodian Government to guarantee the safe return of all exiled opposition politicians, civil society activists and human rights defenders who have fled the country to avoid arrest. The laws and regulations that have been used to restrict opposition and civil society must be reviewed and amended. At the 1991 Paris Peace Accords the Cambodian Government agreed to a legally binding obligation to maintain a pluralistic and democratic system, so we now expect the Cambodian authorities to restore free political debate and competition, and to respect the space for a free and independent civil society. If we continue to see this negative trend without any changes, as I said, we are ready in the Council to take appropriate measures.

Mr President, I feel honoured and more than happy to have received your invitation and I want to express my gratitude for your warm welcome. For our Macedonian people, this is a historic moment. This is the first time that a Prime Minister of our country has addressed the European Parliament in their own language, but yet I have the feeling that I am at home. I feel so good. It is so natural to be here in the home that we belong to, in the home of our European family, to feel invited and to feel welcome. As you surely know, the people in our country are facing yet another historic crossroads. In the lead-up to this new historic challenge, we have received in recent weeks a great deal of encouragement from you. Many Members of the European Parliament, leaders of the Council and the Commission visited our country to demonstrate their support for the referendum on 30 September when the Macedonian people will decide on the agreement with Greece signed in Prespa. Citizens know what decision they need to make. This is not an easy decision. We will be a ‘Republic of North Macedonia’, but with recognition for the Macedonian people and the Macedonian language. We all know what benefits derive from this decision and we know that this is the best opportunity our country has been given thus far. We know that it is a once in a lifetime opportunity and we will not miss that opportunity. We will seize it because this is our ticket for entering the European Union and NATO.  Only a few days ago we celebrated our Independence Day. On 8 September 1991, the vast majority of our citizens voted in favour of a free, independent and sovereign state. This impressive result was based on a wide consensus. People placed the fate of their country before everything. They rose above their political differences. This consensus involved all ethnic and social groups that dreamed of a better life in an independent country. I was 17 years old at that historic time in 1991. I was yet another of the many young people living and dreaming of life in a free society: dreaming of their future in an open society, aiming for progress. We didn’t want to stay any longer in the remnants of the former Yugoslavia that was turning into a regime. We did not want to be isolated from the rest of the world. We wanted to create a democratic country of opportunities, a union of prosperity where the rule of law guarantees justice and where we would be full of hope. We deeply believed in the opportunity we had. We believed in the end of political repression and an end to poverty. We believed in a better life in an independent republic. We were certain that the next generation would have more than we had ever dreamed of. We dreamed of being part of the European family. We belong here geographically, historically and culturally, and we share European values. We see our future as part of the European Union. The perspective for EU membership is a mobilising factor bringing together all the stakeholders in society to work for the successful implementation of the reforms and to deal with challenges on that path. Our people have worked very hard to accomplish their dreams and to reach their goals. Yes, we have made progress but this is not enough: 27 years later some of our dreams have still not become reality, and I am not satisfied because I know that we can do better. We are struggling with internal political conflicts. We are fighting not be isolated from the rest of the world, and we did have conflicts with our neighbours. As a small country and a young democracy, we are still facing great challenges, but we have never lost our vision and we have never stopped fighting for a better future. We will certainly not stop now. We believe that we are in our rightful place and we strongly believe in a better future. We believe in our future as a respected member of the international community and this proud European family. Joining this family will bringer greater stability for all of us and greater prosperity on the home front. As Prime Minister, I assure you that we are doing everything possible to reach the standards of the European Union. We know the recommendations. They are our priorities: independent and democratic institutions, the rule of law, the fight against corruption, a professional, service-oriented public administration. We know there is a long road ahead of us. However, your warm welcome and your encouragement strongly motivate us and give us the strength to continue implementing our reform agenda. The European idea is the guiding force and an inspiration in settling burning open issues in the region. The Republic of Macedonia is a case in point. Our strong faith in the European future was the key motive in reaching the historic agreements with Greece and with Bulgaria. We are proud of both agreements. I would like to thank my friends Boyko Borisov and Alexis Tsipras. We are a European success story, being an authentic model of a functional multi—ethnic democracy. We are a microcosm of Europe. We are living day by day the European motto, ‘united in diversity’ with all its advantages and challenges. The political crisis we have overcome was, in fact, a fight for values, the kind of fight that can be seen in Europe, in the European and global setting: the fight for liberal values, the rule of law, human rights and freedoms, democratic governance, and an open economy as opposed to authoritarian nationalism. Our citizens have made their choice. They have committed themselves to European values and to a European Macedonia. We want to serve as an example and an inspiration for settling all bilateral issues in the Western Balkans and we strongly support finding sustainable solutions, founded on European values and international law, that will lastingly stabilise the region and will prepare the region for its integration into the European Union. One of the most important issues that we needed to resolve was the name difference with Greece because this is a condition for starting negotiations for our accession to the EU and NATO. The strong motivation, and the model in the search for the solution of this difference with Greece, came precisely from the European Union, as the most successful peace project in the world: a model that has resolved great historical conflict situations, turning them into sustainable communities of friendship and trust. We share these European values. With the help of our European friends we have transformed our political misunderstanding with the Hellenic Republic within a community of good and friendly neighbours. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friend Alexis Tsipras, knowing that it is not easy for him either. We had delicate, sensitive talks. This is what responsible leaders need to do. We both made concessions but we are getting so much more in the interests of our peoples and in the name of our future. We have put an end to a difference that was an obstacle for our country for a full 25 years. We have laid the foundations for new friendly relations and for a partnership that will enhance stability, security and the economy in our region. We have reached an agreement about our respective, specific identity features once and for all and I believe we will make the right choice. I believe that we have a good respectful agreement that affirms our identity and guarantees our future – the future of both peoples and states. The Prespa agreement is an excellent model for settling sensitive identity issues and it can be applied in other regions worldwide. The Prespa agreement is a compromise to shift from the status quo and move forward to the future. Now we have the opportunity to leave our past behind and take this step to the future. It is up to the citizens of our two countries to decide whether they will take this step across the threshold to the future. For Macedonia it is an opportunity that we have been awaiting for so long. In 1991, we voted for independence in a referendum and, again in a referendum, we need to take the next step, to create a realistic possibility of becoming the 30th member of NATO and closing, chapter by chapter, the process for our pending membership of the EU and of the European family. The referendum on 30 September is much more than just a referendum on the Prespa agreement. This is a referendum for our future. This is a referendum on our second independence, a referendum of historic proportions, on a par with 1991. We know that our freedom and independence as a small country is only guaranteed as a member of the international community, as a member of the EU and NATO. This is not only for the Republic of Macedonia: all our neighbours will have a better future when we act as an alliance and a family. The integration of the Balkan countries in the EU will bring about even greater stability around Europe. There can be no strong Europe without a successful Balkans region, and the Balkans can be successful only when integrated into the EU. This vision motivated us to take this historic step and encourage the process of reconciliation – building a community and an alliance in the region. The consolidation of the EU can – and should – take place along with the European consolidation of the Balkans. The benefits are multiple for the Union: strengthening stability in Europe; contributing to nurturing European values; more successfully handling security risks, migration and the fight against terrorism; preventing the influence of third parties; and enhancing the role of the EU on the international stage. Indeed, it was addressing security challenges and risks during the migration crisis that showed that we need to work together and that we can be trustworthy partners and allies. The European integration of the Balkans is a geostrategic investment in a stable, strong and united Europe based on common values and standards. Membership of the EU will bring a lot of benefits and new opportunites for the people of the Republic of Macedonia. The EU and NATO will allow us to strengthen our economy. Even now we can see it: the economy is on an upward trend; growth rates rise by the month; foreign investments are a reality now, and we know that there is more to come. The EU and NATO are a chance for a better living standard for the coming generations. Membership of the EU and NATO is a guarantee for our independence, freedom and democracy, better education, better health care, and better infrastructure. These are the chances that we are getting and this is the responsibility that we need to take. I know that it is up to us. We also know what we can give back to our European family. We can give our loyalty, as we have already proved on many an occasion. We can give back true passion for the European idea. For us, Europe is much more than just a union, much more than just growth and economic security. For us, Europe means living in a modern, equal and open society with clear democratic standards, with the rule of law, solidarity, better courts and equal justice for all. We are a multi-ethnic country. We know and respect the benefits of community, we cherish the concept of a single society for all and we know that strength in society comes from unity. This is why we have a broad consensus in our country for entry into the EU and NATO. This consensus unites Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, the Roma, Serbs, Bosniaks the Vlachs, Egyptians, Bulgarians and everyone else living in Macedonia. When it comes to the strategic interests of our country, I also wish us to be united, and to be united in politics as well. More than three—quarters of our population support membership of the EU and European values. Yes, our people want to be part of this family. They feel European and they belong to Europe. In 1991 I was 17 and this was everything I ever dreamed of: to be part of the European family and have a European future. The young in our country still dream about this today.  Twenty—seven years later, I am the Prime Minister and I am addressing the European Parliament on behalf of the citizens of my country in my own Macedonian mother tongue. It is now for us to decide on our future and we are grateful for this historic moment. We are proud that our beloved country finally has a chance to take membership of the EU and NATO full circle. I can feel this right now. I can feel how close we are to accomplishing this dream for the European Macedonia. This is why I believe that the referendum will be a success and that our citizens will vote for Europe. The referendum on 30 September is our stake in and our contribution to a stronger Europe: to unity and greater stability in the region. We consider today’s event and this invitation to address you, as support by the European Parliament for our European future and for taking the right path.

The Lord was born in Sarajevo, in a multiethnic environment. He lives in Zagreb. I don't know him personally, but I was delighted with his idea when he just came out on May 9th of this year with an initiative on this social network and said that in fact The Day of Europe should become a national holiday in the member states, that is, that Europe should have its own national holiday because it is the foundations of a united Europe that emerge after World War II and all that suffering we had.  I was just blown away by the idea. I replied that I fantasizeed a lot about how Europe Day would become a holiday in all member states and how I would really like to see all member states have a big holiday on Europe Day, not just having defile in Moscow and celebrating Victory Day in one spectacular way every time. I think we should have that in this part of the European continent, not only in the far east and I believe that this initiative can be that one small mosaic in creating a desire to make Europe Day, victory day, a national holiday in all member states. What I want to emphasize is certainly the need to remember that on May 9th it was the day of Europe to commemorate the declaration presented by Robert Schuman that day in 1950. This date has traditionally been considered the beginning of the construction of today's European Union. On the one hand, this day serves to highlight that the European Union is based on the principles of the rule of law and democracy and to recall how people's lives are changing for the better thanks to the European Union. On the other hand, Europe Day is an opportunity to bring citizens of different countries closer to each other, to overcome the growing sense of distance between citizens and european institutions and even to counter the negative mood against the European Union that exists, we must be completely objective, in some parts of the European Union.  Taking this into account, I would like to ask the Commission the following questions: - Would the Commission encourage Member States to mark Europe Day as a public holiday? And if so, how can he do it?  - Secondly, can the Commission indicate what measures have already been adopted to share the common values of the European Union between citizens and the European institutions, and that 9 May would not only be a celebration of the statement that laid the foundations of European integration, but also an opportunity to reflect on the main challenges, for example today in the areas of migration, security and the economy?  - And thirdly, is the Commission currently taking any measures to promote Europe Day as a day of commemoration of the values of EU citizens? I may be able to answer some questions myself, but I deliberately want to ask them institutionally because I know that in the European Parliament itself we mark The Day of Europe in such a way that the doors of the European Parliament are open and I participate in it every 9 May. However, I don't think that's enough. It is not enough because it is a closure in our institution, instead of going with our institution among the citizens and that we really promote European values together at such moments and such moments, because with all the flaws that the European Union has, there is no alternative. Because there are flaws, there are mistakes, there are misjudgments and wrong decisions, but there is no alternative.  And that is why I am convinced that just as there are public holidays of all member states, which we rightly celebrate in every state, we mark the independence of our states, the independence of our states, I think it is a great time to jointly consider and decide to establish europe's day as a true holiday of Europe, a true holiday of democracy, freedom, humanity and closeness between the peoples and citizens of the European Union. That is why I call on the Commission to come out with such an initiative and I call on member states to also accept such an initiative.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 153, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Jakovčić for bringing this question forward. As stated in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union: ‘The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.’ These common values are the backdrop of our national democracies and a reflection of who we are. There are worrying signs that the necessary knowledge of our common values and of the role of national and European democracy is not embedded enough. This risks leading to their erosion and it challenges the cohesion of our societies. Citizens need to be aware of their European Union citizenship rights in order fully to benefit from them. While some rights are well known to citizens, such as the right to free movement, gaps and misunderstandings remain. For example, awareness of the right to vote in European elections remains low.  The proportion of Europeans wanting to know more about their EU rights continues to increase – slowly, but it is increasing. The Commission will thus continue its efforts in this regard. Europe Day is a fantastic occasion to do exactly that. It is a landmark date in the calendar of the European Union when the Commission celebrates the European project and the common values it is founded on. Every year on 9 May the representations of the Commission organise a whole string of events in the Member States, often in cooperation with the European Parliament, national authorities and many other partners, NGOs and civil society. We open our doors to the public, encouraging visitors to experience how our everyday work allows European citizens to lead a better life. The array of activities organised on 9 May is conducive to creating ever-stronger awareness of the European Union, its values and actions. By way of example, let me mention just some of the activities the Commission organises to celebrate European Day and share the Union’s common values. First, we promote citizens’ visits to projects financed by the EU, in the context of the ‘EU in my Region’ campaign, which is organised in cooperation with Member States. Second, in 2018 more than 220 events have taken place focusing on awareness raising about European Union achievements, and reflecting on challenges for the European Union. This year, specific emphasis has been placed on European values, as well citizens’ rights, through the ‘EUandME campaign’. Furthermore, precisely on 9 May the Commission launched an online public consultation on the future of the EU. This ambitious debate runs in parallel with the ongoing Citizens’ Dialogues organised in the Member States, which have so far reached more than 320 238 citizens. This is the context of the Council recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education and the European dimension of teaching. The Commission recommends that Member States promote an annual celebration – of course on a voluntary basis – of a Day of the European Union in schools. This recommended Day of the European Union in schools would not constitute a public holiday, but would be an occasion to stimulate reflection among young people on the European Union and its values.  Against this background, the Commission does not deem it necessary to have 9 May established as a Europe-wide public holiday. However, they would welcome any decision in this direction taken by individual Member States at national level. Let me also say a few words about what we do to promote European values through our programmes and policies. Firstly, a specific part of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme is devoted to promoting the rights deriving from Union citizenship. It aims to promote awareness of European citizenship rights, as well as to foster inclusion and democratic participation by mobile European Union citizens living in other EU Member States, and by under-represented groups, including women and young people. We intend to continue and further to develop these activities under a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund after 2020. We intend to continue to promote measures in the field of education in order to share and promote EU values, especially among young people. In fact, high-quality, inclusive education and training is essential not only in terms of offering our citizens knowledge and skills to succeed in the labour market but also in promoting the competences of critical thinking and deeper understanding of our common values.  The Council Recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education and the European dimension of teaching, which was adopted on 22 May 2018, focuses on four objectives: first, promoting common values at all levels of education; second, fostering more inclusive education; third, encouraging a European dimension of teaching; and, fourth, supporting teachers and teaching. In order to achieve the aims of the Council Recommendation, the Commission supports and works together with Member States. It is taking steps to enhance a sense of European identity among young people through initiatives such as: firstly, boosting school mobility under the Erasmus+ Programme; secondly, increasing virtual exchanges among schools, notably through the eTwinning network; thirdly, supporting teaching, learning, research and debates on European integration issues in all fields of education and training under the ‘Jean Monnet’ measures; fourthly, supporting numerous mutual learning initiatives between Member State authorities and stakeholders within the European Framework for cooperation in education and training; and, fifthly, the European Solidarity Corps and DiscoverEU.  Lastly, the European structural and investment funds can also be used to support teacher training or fund infrastructure to implement the recommendation. I am now looking forward to our debate, and we will continue to reach out to the Member States through our communication efforts. I know that I can count on you in these joint efforts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 154, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, first of all I’d like to compliment Mr Jakovčić on his initiative. I think it is well worth considering having a public holiday for Europe Day. Europe Day was first introduced in 1985. The date commemorates the Schuman Declaration of May 1950, which proposed a pooling of the French and West German coal and steel industries, leading to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, established in 1952. Following the foundation of the European Union in 1993, observance of Europe Day by national and regional authorities increased significantly. Germany, in particular, has gone beyond celebrating just the day, and since 1995 has extended the observance to an entire Europe Week. In Poland, the Schuman Foundation, a Polish organisation advocating European integration, established in 1991, first organised a ‘Schuman parade’ on Europe Day 1999, at the time advocating the accession of Poland to the EU. The European Parliament formally recognised Europe Day in October 2008. The EU is one of the most successful political projects in human history. It brought an end to war in Europe, creating a dynamic for peace and cooperation. My country joined in 1973. We have benefitted hugely from the customs union, the single market, free trade and the common agricultural policy. All these things have been very positive for us. Also, EU membership led to the abolition of the marriage ban and to establishing the principle of equal pay for equal work. Celebrating Europe Day to me makes a lot of sense. It will also counteract some of the negativity that we were talking about this week, with Prime Minister Orbán using anti—EU rhetoric in Hungary to win re-election. So I think we should look to formalise it. The Commissioner mentioned schools, but if the schools were free on that day they could do all the celebrating that week, in line with Germany. And also, if we had a Europe Day, MEPs could be back in their constituencies to celebrate it, because we are not available when the celebrations go ahead here in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 155, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would say to the honourable Commissioner, my friend and real socialist Mr Andriukaitis, that Europe Day on 9 May is a big event for us. It has great salience for us here in the European Parliament and for all those who work in the European institutions. It is evident that we try to fill this day with the strongest meaning, but it is not the same for many ordinary European citizens to whom the European institutions still seem quite distant and irrelevant.  I am in favour of making Europe Day a public holiday in all the EU Member States, and I support my colleague, Ivan Jakovčić, in this claim. Holidays are traditionally connected to great family events or to the celebration of big historical dates. I think that Europe Day is both a historical date and a family holiday. This is something that makes people feel that their nation is part of a big family and it makes them turn back in time and imagine how this family started. This celebration certainly contributes to a positive vision of the EU, and to major awareness of what the EU actually is. But as information about the EU grows, do the expectations of the citizens of the EU grow? It is important that we make the citizens feel part of a secure, stable and prosperous Union, able to stand up for its interests in the international arena.  We don’t want to see people feeling part of a Union with an opaque decision—making system, disengaged from minority issues and subject to the will of the other great powers. Europe Day is a way to approach the hearts of the people. I know this personally, because for several years I have been participating in activities in my country, Latvia, on 9 May. I know that people come to the celebration with the hope of a better Europe. It is extremely important that we do not destroy these fragile feelings by adopting measures that go against the fundamental rights of people and their personal development. I am speaking in particular about the Copyright Directive on which a majority of MEPs voted in favour here in this Chamber. I consider it a failure of the democratic process and as subjugation to pressure by lobbyists. I really don’t know how these MEPs will explain to their constituencies, to their voters, after the entry into force of the Directive, the reason why they voted for the computer filtering of social media, putting every piece they publish into a copyright panopticon. In my opinion what we as MEPs cannot afford is to be deceptive with our voters – otherwise we just won’t have the moral right to go to the Europe Day celebration and pretend to work for the sake of Europeans. The EU is a great power, or even better, it is a great power in the making. I think that we still need to show to our partners how strong we feel about our values and how essential it is to adopt a multilateral approach when adopting even the smallest agreement.  Europe Day is also a message to the international community. We are a union, and we celebrate it like any country celebrates its national day. We all know well that foreign countries will try to use any cohesion gap, any deficits, any weakness and incompleteness of the European Union to their benefit. There is no other way to dissuade our partners from an opportunistic approach than to show our unity at every occasion. That is why I think the celebration of Europe Day must be held in all corners of the world where there are EU representations, missions, offices, embassies and so on. Another point I would like to raise is the legitimacy of the European Union. We have many symbols – an anthem, a flag, a motto and Europe Day, and then the euro as a single currency became our symbol. But we need to be cautious about what message we transmit with our symbols. We must ensure that when the EU flag is flown in other countries it is there to bring only our peace and democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "Urszula KRUPA", "mepid": "28334", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by On 9 May, Robert Schuman made a declaration regarded as the beginning of the Process of European Integration, saying that Europe would not be created immediately or entirely, but that it would be created by concrete implementations, first creating real solidarity. The establishment of 9 May as Europe Day would aim at improving integration between citizens and institutions, with the promotion of European values – which is of course very important – and this information could be provided on a European day.  But before such a holiday is established, it would be necessary to start actually building European solidarity, respecting the sovereign Member States. On May 9, poland organizes various celebrations with Schuman parades, also in the mass media a lot of time is devoted to summarizing the country's membership of the Union. However, such actions will not eliminate the growing sense of distance between citizens and the European institutions until the Union itself respects the values adopted in the Treaties.  Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union states that it is based, inter alia, on respect for freedom, equality and solidarity. And it is only in reference to these words that questions arise about the double standards prevailing within the Structures of the Union, which concern, for example, the non-respect of the results of free elections in some Member States, the favouritism of 'old 15' farmers in the common agricultural policy compared to central European farmers, the pressure to take in refugees and even the poorer quality of products sent to Central Europe.  Citizens of the Member States of the European Union see a shift away from the values presented by the founders and, in particular, a non-respect of Christian values. It seems that until the Union returns to the values represented by the founding leaders of the 'Europe of Homelands', the celebration of 9 May would be merely a reminder and celebration of the founding declaration far from the idea behind the founders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "IND/DEM", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 157, "date": "2018-09-13.json", "name": "André ELISSEN", "mepid": "188445", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF Group. – We are talking today about declaring 9 May a public holiday to promote the European Union. This is part of the European promotional machine, a machine that is running at full speed. A striking example of this propaganda is the Jean Monet programme. Every year, many hundreds of millions of euros are spent on education. One would expect that this education consists of carefully highlighting all sides of a story. But no, only positive stories about the union's supposedly phenomenal performance are eligible for funding. Critical sounds can whistle to a contribution. I have asked the European Commission about this, because this cannot and must not be true. And, as we could see this week, democratically elected leaders, such as the Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr Orbán, are insulted in this parliament and almost r lgbt and rs. This is because he stands up for his own country. Other countries, such as Poland, can also prepare for the moral superiority of the Union.  As long as you do exactly what the European elite demands, you will be welcomed with open arms. But anyone who dares to criticise will have to deal with the Europhiles. Criticism of borderless migration is directly punished by the elite here. He thinks it has to decide for itself what is good for Hungary and the Hungarians.  To think that the talks on Turkey's accession have still not stopped. This Islamic dictatorship is being tackled with velvet gloves, while a democratic prime minister is being expelled from a democratic country like a tyrant. It's hypocritical. That's double standards.

It is clear that we do not see anything in an official day off to promote the European Union. Moreover, it is rather cynical that parliamentarians, of all people, are calling for an extra day off. If one group of people already has more than enough days off, or rather takes days off, it is the Members of the European Parliament! Take a look around you in this painfully empty room. Of the 751 Parliamentarians, at most, a handful have bothered to attend this important debate.  Normal people are stuck in traffic in the morning and evening rush hour. The only chance that a parliamentarian ends up in traffic jams is if he or she wants to sign up to be able to collect the daily allowance, and then leave parliament as soon as possible. Advocating for an extra day off is a slap in the face to all hard-working citizens. As far as we are concerned, there is nothing to celebrate.

I would like to thank the European Parliament, and especially Ivan Jakovčić, for driving forward the dialogue both here and with European citizens. I also thank those visitors who are here and who are listening to our debates, promoting and sharing our common values, as well as fostering discussions on topical European policy issues that are indeed essential for European citizens to reflect on, and on the European project, and becoming aware of their European identity. Such discussions are particularly important in the run-up to the European elections next May, as democratic participation is key to the European project. I would like to send this message here to all of us. The Commission will continue to use Europe Day as an occasion to inform European citizens about the EU in general, and our common values in particular. The Commission is truly committed to engaging in open dialogue with our citizens on societal issues, and we will use all our resources to do so. Today we have heard different opinions. I am proud that we have had a good opportunity to listen to each other and to hear various opinions. Of course, having a European Day would create such an opportunity on a much broader scale. Some speakers mentioned ‘democratically elected people’, but sometimes democratically elected people do not act in line with democratic process, the rule of law or democratic values. What can we do when we see that democracy has vanished? That is a question for all of us. It will be very important to continue our debates and to send the message to our citizens that they need more citizens’ dialogue. It would be good to ask citizens to take initiatives, to use the EU Citizens Initiative, and to debate interests in a broader sense, asking Member State parliaments and governments too to express their opinion. Personally, I very much like the idea of having such a day. However, as a Commission, we should respect all the complexities and ask the citizens – here in this room and everywhere. Let’s start our debates together and then, maybe at election campaign time, we can use the possibility really to move forward – once again opening doors for all views, whether from the National Front or any other quarter.
