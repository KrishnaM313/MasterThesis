Taking over from the long-standing and well-respected Mr Diamandouros was definitely a great challenge for Ms O’Reilly. Thanks to her great experience as an Irish Ombudsman, the newly-elected European Ombudsman started her work efficiently from the very beginning of her mandate. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their valuable input during all stages of preparing this report: our cooperation was very fruitful and I tried to accommodate most of their ideas. I think we all share the view that the Ombudsman has taken up her duties with admirable commitment and has managed to accomplish a lot, considering her short time in office in 2013. I would like once again to congratulate the European Ombudsman on her efforts to make the institution accessible and user-friendly. An example of this was demonstrated in the preparation of the annual report. It is divided into two parts: the first includes the most important statistics and the second a more detailed examination of cases of 2013. Topics at the top of the list of the Ombudsman’s inquiries in 2013 included transparency-related issues and other key topics such as ethical issues, citizens’ participation in EU decision-making and fundamental rights. In my opinion, it is crucial for the work of the Ombudsman, and the European institutions as well, to observe the tendencies regarding the complaints. I appreciate the fact that the number of complaints about the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) more than halved in 2013, and the volume of complaints against Parliament also significantly declined. On the other hand, it is important for the Ombudsman to examine the significant rise in inquiries based on complaints against the Commission – and the same applies to complaints against EU agencies – and especially to monitor developments and indicate the reasons why complaints were lodged. I would like to stress that the European Ombudsman took a very proactive attitude during the preparation of this report. Her report mentioned the statistics on incoming complaints and, on the basis of 100 exemplary ones, indicated the next steps. This is an interesting way to explain the process but, in my view, including raw data is also crucial so that it is easier to spot the tendencies over the years. This recommendation was taken into consideration and full data will be incorporated in 2014. Moreover, I think it is important for the European Ombudsman to strike a balance between the traditional and digital communication channels. It is still possible to address a letter just with the title ‘The European Ombudsman’ and it will reach her office. At the same time it is crucial to further develop social media strategy. From what I recall, the official Twitter account has tripled and now has over 9 000 followers. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the services of the Ombudsman are available in 24 official languages, which is quite impressive considering that her office consists of 67 posts. Last, but not least, as a PPE Group coordinator on the Committee on Petitions, I have a special interest in improving the timeframe for processing complaints. Therefore I am fond of a mechanism that is used by the European Ombudsman., namely the interactive guide, which enables her to answer requests successfully. I hope we will achieve similar goals in our committee. To sum up, I am very content with the propositions of Madam Ombudsman and I wish her all the best in her future work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-01-15.json", "name": "Emily O’Reilly", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Ombudsman. - Mr President, I would like to start by putting on record my deep appreciation for the overwhelming vote of support I received in this Chamber for my re-election last month. It is a huge source of support for me personally, for my strategy and for my colleagues, who work hard on a daily basis to implement that strategy. Such wide parliamentary support is crucial to the success of any ombudsman, and I promise to build on that support by continuing to work closely with this Parliament. I cannot operate without your support, and equally I work to ensure that the people you represent will have access to an independent source of investigation and redress if they feel they have been unfairly treated by an EU institution. Our work is complementary. Thank you, Mr Wałęsa, and all the shadow rapporteurs, for your work over the past months on the report before us today. The report shows a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the Office of the European Ombudsman as we attempt to keep pace with the evolving expectations placed upon us by European citizens. And, as their directly elected representatives, you know how fast the hopes, expectations and concerns of people in Europe today are changing. Honourable Members, this is my first time addressing you in plenary. However, since coming into office in October 2013, I have addressed you in committee a total of eight times, including before the Committee on Petitions, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Each time I have benefited from your expertise, your advice and support, and from that of the staff who support your work. These committee hearings and our many one-on-one meetings have strengthened my understanding of our work together at European level and have fed directly into the strategy I have developed for my office. My task as the third European Ombudsman is to take the office to the next level and make sure it continues to succeed and to thrive. My work at the end of 2013, when I took office, and over the past year of 2014 has been about putting those words into action. Recently, I published our five-year strategy entitled ‘Towards 2019’, which you refer to in paragraph 21 of today’s report. My strategy is to combine three objectives – to ensure relevance, to increase visibility and so to achieve greater positive impact. To begin executing this strategy, I first undertook, as promised, an internal audit of the procedures and practices of the Ombudsman’s Office. This involved consulting with staff at every level and is leading to a number of internal changes, including the introduction of a modern complaint-handling system, a process begun by my predecessor, which will enable us to achieve greater internal efficiencies in complaint handling; a review of how we draft our case decisions to make them more citizen-focused; a review of our key performance indicators; and a review of our complaint inquiry processes, which will allow us to identify the key cases early and to prioritise them. These changes will, I believe, lead to an overall better service to citizens. With an office of around 70 staff, I see it as my duty to use the resources at my disposal to the maximum possible effect. To ensure our work becomes more relevant to the major concerns of ordinary European citizens and residents, I have made greater use of my power to launch inquiries in the public interest without necessarily a specific complaint as basis. To that end, I appointed an Own Initiative Investigation Coordinator, whose job is to drive the own-initiative inquiries in collaboration with her colleagues and to ensure that the outcomes are both speedy and effective. Last year we opened own-initiative inquiries into the transparency and balance of Commission Expert Groups, the transparency of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations, the way in which EU institutions are implementing the new rules on protecting whistle-blowers, the Commission’s handling of the European Citizens Initiative, the way in which fundamental rights are protected in the EU cohesion fund programmes, and how Frontex ensures compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its important and difficult work. Two other major ongoing inquiries of significant relevance concern how the Commission manages potential conflict of interest when EU officials leave for employment elsewhere – the so-called ‘revolving doors’ issue – and an ongoing inquiry into how the European Medicines Agency supports the transparency demands of Parliament in relation to clinical trial studies for medicines in the EU. I appreciate the fact that the Committee on Petitions welcomes these inquiries in point 24 of its report. To achieve greater visibility, I have focused on ensuring that our work is better communicated to you, the elected representatives, to our stakeholders and to the public. Media commentary and media monitoring suggest that that strategy is having a significant impact, with details of our cases and other work now regularly featuring in the Brussels media outlets and also in mainstream Member State media and further afield. In addition, I now send you, the Members, a digest of our work, and I hope I have demonstrated my willingness to have ongoing dialogue with you on subjects of mutual concern. We have also focused on our social media outreach and have trebled our Twitter followers in one year. I hope many of you have seen our new-format annual report, which uses many new media technologies to make it more readable and attractive. I believe the new strategy has already had a positive impact and I am very grateful to all of the officials in the institutions I have dealt with for their largely positive engagement with my office. In December 2013 we had a positive response from the Commission in two major cases. One concerned an unreasonable delay in relation to a state aid investigation into certain professional football clubs; the other concerned an alleged conflict of interest for the former chair of the Ad-Hoc Ethics Committee for Commissioners. The chair stepped down after my intervention, and the Commission has since made the work of the Ad-Hoc Ethics Committee more transparent, which I welcome. In relation to the European Medicines Agency, I believe the intervention of my Office, together with concerned Members of Parliament and civil society, helped to make sure that their new transparency policy was not rolled back, as it had appeared it would be when details of the new policy were announced in 2014. Following, again, the strong intervention of a coalition of concerned Members of Parliament and civil society and an inquiry by my office into the lack of transparency around the TTIP negotiations, the Council released the mandate for wider public scrutiny, which I welcome. The Commission, as you know, has also announced other steps forward on transparency. Recently we made further constructive suggestions, and I expect the Commission’s response to those suggestions in March. In recent weeks I have also listened to the new Juncker Commission. I have been heartened by the commitments on, and the real progress made toward, greater transparency, openness and accountability, particularly by Vice-President Timmermans on my right here today, and I pledge to work as collaboratively as possible with the Commission at all levels to help them achieve those goals. Indeed, the Commission is actually leading on many issues of good administration in the EU today, and for that they deserve our recognition. To conclude, can I put on record again how impressed I am by the high standards of the European civil service, the thousands of dedicated people who work in the EU institutions and agencies all over Europe? The vast majority work hard to achieve high standards in their work and display a true ethic of public service. However, as we know, trust in both the EU and national levels of governance is not always very high at the moment in Europe. There are reasons to hope that we are slowly beginning to emerge from the painful recession and banking crisis. The people of Europe will regain trust in their governing administrations when they begin to see, for their families and in their daily lives, positive changes deriving from the decisions made. However, unlike most nation states in Europe which are largely legitimate in the eyes of their citizens, the EU administration has not yet achieved the high levels of popular legitimacy which, in the eyes of many Europeans, it should enjoy. Today’s report correctly recognises, in paragraph 3, that ‘wide gap’. This is why it is so important for the EU administration to be not only of the highest possible quality, but indeed to be the ‘gold standard’ in ethics, transparency, accountability and effectiveness. My task as European Ombudsman is to work with the institutions and agencies to help make that happen. As you, the Members of the European Parliament, have recently trusted me to continue as European Ombudsman, I promise to do my best to continue working to fulfil that task. Finally, let me conclude by again thanking the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, their staff and the secretariats for all the work on the report, and I look forward to listening to your contributions and questions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-01-15.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "  First Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I want to thank Mr Wałęsa for his report. I congratulate him on the excellent work he has done on behalf of your Parliament. Secondly, of course, congratulations are due to Ombudsman Mrs O’Reilly for being re-elected by your Parliament. You appreciate her work and so does the Commission, and I look forward to working with her along the same lines as she has just expressed. I am really very proud to be part of the leadership of what I would call one of the best administrations public service has in the world. But I am also committed to improving the way it works, to making sure that we work more transparently, that we are more accountable and that we also change the situation when the situation is not up to the standards both Parliament and the Commission want. We have examined the Wałęsa report with great interest. Transparency, openness, access to information, respect for the rights of citizens, high ethical standards: essential building blocks for creating greater support for European institutions at large. I fully concur with what Mrs O’Reilly just said, namely that the level of quality of our institutions is not reflected in the level of support from European citizens, and we need to work on that if we are to get the mandate from our constituents to do what needs to be done to create more prosperity and to create more jobs and to create more security for European citizens. I also note, and Mr Wałęsa referred to it, that the share of complaints against the Commission has risen, and I have listened carefully to his call that we should reduce that, and I agree with him. I just want to, very briefly, tell you that in actual numbers, complaints between 2012 and 2013 have gone down. It is the share that has gone up – and this is unacceptable, so we will work on that – but just to make sure we do not misunderstand that there is actually, in numbers, a reduction in complaints. I would just like to point out that if you compare the institutions, the highest compliance – 84% – by institutions with the Ombudsman’s recommendations is by the Commission, and let me just note very briefly that 100% compliance will for legal reasons probably never be possible. But I strive to have the highest possible compliance. I also want to salute and welcome the approach of the Ombudsman to focus on strategic investigations, because strategic investigations can discern patterns, and patterns are the things we need to change if we want to improve the way we run our administration. I will support her and work with her very closely to make a success of her recommendations emanating from these strategic investigations. I also note that Mr Wałęsa calls for common binding rules and principles on administrative procedure, and I just want to reiterate what I said at my hearing: that we will discuss the best possible way of implementing that. I know that a European law on administrative procedure is one of the options that could work there, but let us work between the Commission and Parliament on that to see what would be the best possible solutions. I have noted also the conclusion that the percentage of complaints concerning EU agencies has almost doubled. Here again I offer cooperation, within the possibilities we have legally, to improve that on the boards of these agencies etc., and there again I would like to work closely with the Ombudsman and with Parliament to ensure improvement. Finally, the complaints against EPSO have indeed decreased significantly, and I think I would echo Mr Wałęsa’s conclusion that this is to be applauded. Once again, I look forward to working closely with Mrs O’Reilly and her team. She has an outstanding team. They have a strong dedication to improving the quality of our administration and to answering enquiries and complaints from European citizens, and it is in all our interests to make sure that her work is successful. I will certainly guarantee you my personal commitment to making that happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-01-15.json", "name": "Peter JAHR", "mepid": "96772", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman once again on her election last December.

Secondly, I look forward to working very well with her in the future, for example on the subject of children's rights. We have many complaints in the Committee on Petitions, particularly on the subject of custody. Mrs O'Reilly has already assured us that, from her point of view and with her responsibility, she would also like to address this issue.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time of difficulty, it is obvious to say that Europe needs More Europe. To this end, we know that it is crucial that citizens are or feel within the heart of Europe and to do so they have to feel at the heart of their institutions. Ensuring the proper functioning of the European institutions is of paramount importance and that is the cardinal function of the Ombudsman's own office, as well as the Committee on Petitions, the role of which we must also recall. And it is because citizens must feel us, as I say, close and really consider that their problems are our demands and our task. In this regard, I have nothing more to congratulate and say that this is a good report because the work of the Ombudsman's office has been good. Although I want to say that this should not be a sign of complacency, but a new impetus in this work and in this line of work. Indeed, as regards the report in particular, as regards the functioning of the institutions, I have to say that the launch of the website in twenty-four languages is welcome, although I regret that the report is not available in all languages, but only in English. I must congratulate the fact that access to people with disabilities has begun to be improved, although I also hope that it will be done for children or that it be done for gender equality, improving their language. I must also congratulate the fact that the European Network of Ombudsmans has been launched, as well as that work has been done on the transparency of the European institutions, although I would like to demand that all those bodies, formal or informal, which take decisions affecting the rights of citizens be included in this improvement of transparency , either the troika or the Eurogroup itself. I have to demand, as Mr Wassa has done, the need to set deadlines and guarantees in the response by the European institutions to all citizens' requests, in order to reduce political interference.

Mr President, we welcome the presence here of the European Ombudsman, Mrs O'Reilly, and congratulate her on her solemn re-election. The European Ombudsman's annual activity report in 2013 highlights the important action of this Institution in ensuring good administration and protecting citizens' rights. We believe in the cooperation of the European institutions and attach the utmost importance to the Ombudsman's control of cases of maladministration of the institutions and bodies of the European Union, especially at this time when the economic crisis has led to the questioning of the European institutions themselves. Citizens now call for strengthening accountability and transparency institutions at European Union level, including FRONTEX, the Troika and the Eurogroup, in order to improve the quality of democracy. At the same time, the millions of poor citizens of the countries put into budgetary adjustment programmes, i.e. memoranda, consider it necessary for the European Ombudsman to carry out an investigation into compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union by the Troika.  Also, following the decision of the plenary of the European Parliament in March 2014 on the disastrous role of the Troika, the European Ombudsman must investigate the conflict of interest in the European Commission between its role in the Troika and its responsibility as guardian of the Treaties of Community law.  Finally, the Ombudsman must examine the conflict of interest between the role of the European Central Bank in the Troika, where she participates as technical adviser and creditor of the Memorandum States, and the mandate it has under the Treaty. That is why, and in closing, Mr President, I call on colleagues to vote in favour of the relevant amendments that I have tabled.

Congratulations, Mrs. O'Reilly, on your re-election. On behalf of the ALDE Group and the Committee on Petitions, I would like to expressly thank the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, for the excellent work done in the term of office and the precision and self-demand reflected in her report.  It is a great example of how to develop rigorous institutional work, with a proactive and ongoing approach to operational efficiency, teamwork and accountability.  As this report reflects, most citizens' complaints clearly point to a shortfall in transparency in the European institutions and that is the area of improvement that we must highlight the most.  In this regard, I would like to recall the investigations initiated from the Ombudsman's Office, such as those relating to transparency in the TTIP negotiations, the reporting of irregularities in the institutions of the European Union and the cases of 'revolving doors', the requirement of transparency in clinical trials of new medicines and also, of course, tireless work in the defence of fundamental rights in cohesion policy and support for improvement of the European Citizens' Initiative.  The Ombudsman's main priority is to ensure full respect for citizens' rights. We must review the concept of 'good administration' on the understanding that the objective is a 'better administration', understood as a process of continuous improvement, as the gold standard to which Mrs O'Reilly refers, which is already under way and is based on an excellent civil service. This requires not only compliance with legal obligations, but also that we act willingly to serve by en ensure that citizens are treated correctly and can fully exercise their rights. Mrs O'Reilly, the first woman elected to the post of European Ombudsman, has also expressed her willingness to work for excellence through her 'Towards 2019' strategy, based on three fundamental pillars which I enthusiastically endorse: Impact, Relevance and Visibility. I would like from here to endorse all support for the work of this institution which, together with the Committee on Petitions, embodies the main channel for the participation of European citizens. That is the area where they can express their concerns openly and directly.

This report that we are going to vote on is clearly unsatisfactory for us because, when we do not make up reality, what we do is directly ignore it. To give an example, I miss the fact that there is no talk of 'revolving doors', which is one of the issues highlighted by the Ombudsman in her report because of the very high number of complaints made. And, by the way, in Spain, thanks to pp and PSOE, we know a lot about all this. However, we prefer to ignore it, and I wonder why it causes them so much allergy and they prefer to ignore it when the Ombudsman herself approaches it? I miss the Ombudsman's role in investigating Frontex's investigation of the violation of fundamental rights. An investigation, at the Ombudsman's own initiative, while a stark reality is being buried in beautiful words that thousands of people, especially immigrants, with no solution other than to play their lives at the gates of our borders, suffer in their flesh. Why do we put on, again, this veil of hypocrisy? I miss the public report that the TTE negotiation is one of the most shameful in the history of the European Union. And you don't have to remember that we can't even access the reading room of the documents with a pen. But it may seem normal to the rapporteur of this report that the negotiation of an agreement of this magnitude , which will undoubtedly impoverish us all more , should take place as in the worst times of the war. Needless to say, I also miss mentioning cuts, austericide policies, which attack people's right to a dignified life. It is no coincidence, ladies and gentlemen, that most complaints come to the Commission. Barroso or Juncker. It doesn't matter what we call them, because, in the end, they're exactly the same.

Mr President! First of all, thank you to Jarosław Wałęsa for a good report and a very good cooperation, where we have met good will to get as much from all of us as possible, and I can also feel here how united we stand, also in our thanks to Emily O'Reilley for a very nice piece of work. She has continued to work on the work of Nikiforos Diamandouro and, I think, in the happy situation in the European Union, we have a real Ombudsman. In particular, we have been pleased with the emphasis on the fight for openness, which we saw to make a powerful impact on the demands of the TTIP negotiations, where the Commission had been completely closed down. We also look forward to working on the Ombudsman's special report on Frontex.  After all, when we have tabled a number of amendments, it is mainly because we think we need to get even more force behind the demand for a proper regulation of good administration. We have promised the citizens. It is stated in the Charter in Article 41. It is in Article 298 of the Treaty. It is time we started to get this legal! Thank you to Mr Saunders. Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Timmermans here today, so that we are so clearly agreeing that we are actually strengthening the work of ensuring good governance in all the EU institutions. Let me call here for us to have the service principle at the heart of it, where it is the citizens who must be protected, not the officials, and that we have a true fight against conflicts of interest, that is, against incapacity. It is difficult in all our countries - including Denmark - to get a proper understanding of what capability is and to have it respected. In addition, I would like to mention, since Mr Schroeder has also mentioned the need for a more Mr Wałęsa said: 'Of course we would like to have a good working relationship with the Ombudsman and the Commission. But we must have more resources! I think our resources should match those of the Ombudsman. Not that her resources should be cut, but we need more. We cannot handle all our many complaints by simply stifling as many of them as possible, and I think i can sometimes sense that this is happening, not least on the part of the EPP. If we can strangle them, it'll be quicker - that's clear! Finally, let me say, and it was also mentioned by Peter Jahr, that I find it rather shameful to find that this Parliament did not give O'Reilly a proper welcome. Many of the big old countries do not even know what an Ombudsman is. They don't have any. The Scandinavian countries have, it has England, it has Ireland, it has the Netherlands - and happily many of the new Member States too. You have experienced what a real, independent, qualified Ombudsman is. That is why I would like to thank Wałęsa again for having strengthened us in the fact that we have made it work, and I would like to call on the Presidency to come together and to ensure that we are given a better welcome and that we never again see a President who shuts down access to information about who has recommended the Ombudsman. It is baroquely contrary to the whole ombudsman's work that members are suddenly protected from standing by who they have recommended. So let's get a good welcome.

I would also like to thank Mr Wałęsa for his report, but I would like to make a few comments on a fact that I found very important: some 68 of the 100 requests that come to the European Ombudsman do not fall within the scope of his competences.  This fact perhaps tells us that the accessibility and publicity of the European Ombudsman must be improved, using every means that new technologies make available to us both to promote the very figure of the Ombudsman – not known to most – and to raise citizens' awareness of their rights and no less important to clarify what the real competences of the European Ombudsman are.  In this respect, I would also like to address my own country in order unfortunately to recall some records that it sadly holds: Italy is the only State that has not established the figure of the National Ombudsman, it is among the very few that does not even have a parliamentary committee on petitions. As if that were not enough, to point out the lack of attention that our institutions have towards the protection of citizens, I would like to point out that the 2010 Finance Act also cut a very important figure, which is that of the municipal ombudsman, thus depriving citizens of the closest territorial references they had.  I hope that Italy too will be seriously urged to remedy this situation, as, moreover, following the recommendations in the 2012 annual report of the Committee on Petitions aimed at establishing a network of committees on petitions that includes all those present in the Member States.

This requires not only enforcing the law, but also that there is a will to serve, so that it is ensured that citizens have an immediate response and for citizens to be treated correctly. It is a unique opportunity for the institutions of the European Union to be effective and beneficial to citizens and to regain confidence in each and every one of them: in short, to be open and effective institutions. Looking at the report, the main issues of concern to citizens are issues around transparency, access to information — an important issue — ethical issues, \"revolving doors\" that may be – a problem closely linked to the issue of transparency – and also the commission's management as guardian of the Treaties, fundamental rights and all projects and programmes of the European Union.

As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, It is, of course, a great pleasure for me to congratulate the Ombudsman today on the renewed confidence. I look forward to continued good cooperation. The role of the Ombudsman is a very important part of creating a European Union that can enjoy respect and bring confidence back to our citizens. As Mr Wałęsa writes in the report which I hope we will adopt by the widest possible majority very soon in this plenary, transparent decision-making processes and accountability of those who have power and responsibility are a very important cornerstone and cornerstone and one of the most important aspects of modern democracy. In this context, I thought that I would once again address the demand that Parliament has made several times to the Commission, namely that it should present a full, effective administrative law for the European Union. Such a law would easily and clearly regulate not only our institutions, but also how all eu authorities should act in relation to the citizens of our Member States. Only with the legal basis introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon did this become possible. However, it has been possible for a number of years now. I think it is high time that you made use of this opportunity, because it could help to facilitate the ombudsman's work as well. That is why I am now addressing you with confidence, Commissioner Timmermans, and asking you to get to grips with this matter as a matter of urgency, which is about a European effective administrative law.

It is important to stress that the European Ombudsman's institution is a key institution for strengthening EU democracy. During the elections, we promised EU citizens a more humane Europe, and strengthening and respecting EU civil rights is essential to achieve this promise. The ultimate goal is to strengthen confidence in the European Union, and if we succeed, we have all succeeded. And if, in the course of his work, the Ombudsman achieves that the Eu institutions become more efficient and citizen-friendly, we will all be able to see it as a success, and, dear Ombudsman, you can, of course, count on the support of all of us on this journey. I also welcome the fact that the concept of 'visibility' is one of the pillars of the Ombudsman's strategy for 2019. As a Central European MEP, I see this as one of the biggest challenges: to make EU rights visible and visible, including the role of the European Ombudsman. We must do everything we can to ensure that our message reaches the citizens. For example, it is important to make documents available in multiple languages. We must also continue down this path, my dear Ombudsman, and I say this not to increase the workload of you and your office, but to make the European Union a community of consciously active, informed citizens.

As a member of the Committee on Petitions of this European Parliament, I would like to emphasise that we in Europe can be proud that we have an institution such as the European Ombudsman – as the direct point of contact for all 500 million European citizens. Complaints about the functioning of public authorities and administrations have been demonstrably and successfully investigated, and control has been exercised and improvements and changes have been demonstrated in the results in the EU.

And it is good that you are not a lawyer. There was also a second allegation that there are tens of thousands of cases under consideration in France. You have only informed a few hundred of those under consideration. Firstly, you cannot order thousands to influence and justify your existence.

The proper functioning of public administration is not only a fundamental pillar of a democratic system, as a right of our citizens and the fact that more than 23 000 citizens have addressed the Ombudsman is revealing not only of this importance, but also of the trust they place in it. In 2013 I saw very much the special report on Frontex, which should be encouraged by the systemic approach you want to print in certain surveys. Moreover, I look forward to the results of your strategy towards 2019.  However, transparency issues dominated 2013. We have recently seen with Europol that these problems persisted in 2014. I therefore hope that your future action will be intensely dedicated to this subject.

I would like to make two recommendations. First of all, I would like to call on the Ombudsman's office to deepen its cooperation with the European Ombudsmen within the European Network of Ombudsmen. I believe that the exchange of experience and successful practices between Mrs O'Reilly, national and regional ombudsmen will inevitably contribute to improving the quality of the services of national administrations in different countries and the European institutions. Secondly, I would like to encourage her to devote even more effort to protecting the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensuring that the Administration of the European Union is aware of its responsibilities with regard to these rights. I believe that the role of the European Ombudsman is central to the newly established European Union network to monitor the implementation of Article 33(2) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I believe that it is also our duty as European legislators to ensure that people with disabilities can enjoy their rights and freedoms of European citizens with dignity and full dignity.  My last recommendation to you is to pay particular attention to the application of European legislation on the treatment of animals in the Member States and, in particular, to examine whether the European Commission and the Member States are complying with their obligations under the Zoos Directive, the Regulation on the protection of animals during their transport, and the Wildlife Protection Regulation.

No institution of the European Union can be successful without the strong, hardworking and charismatic personality that you have demonstrated during your mandate and during the hearing.  Of course, the Ombudsman has a number of tasks ahead of her that need to be implemented as quickly as possible in order to make her institution more accessible to European citizens in particular. As guardians of transparency, Mrs O'Reilly and her office should also be more involved in transparency in the negotiation of basic directives, such as the TTIP example.

Specific measures should be developed to inform these communities, which account for 8% of European citizens, about the work of the Ombudsman. Their rights as enshrined in the EU Charter and the Council documents, and especially their vulnerability, should be kept in mind. I therefore call on Ms O’Reilly to undertake an own-initiative inquiry on the subject of persons belonging to traditional minority communities and their access to information provided by the European institutions, along the same lines as a past own-initiative inquiry that focused on people with disabilities.

It began in March 2011, when three billion was destroyed, and resumed last year with the destruction of a further one billion in two tranches of 500 million each. This obscenity is the legacy of the bail-out in 2010 of the failed institutional investors in two failed non-systematic Irish banks. It served its purpose, bought some time for the euro, prevented the onset of the feared contagion had those banks been allowed to fail. There was a fall-out, however. The insistence by the ECB that, because the Irish Central Bank printed that money, that must now be taken back into circulation. So you have this obscene situation where a broke, hugely indebted country, where the austerity programme has already wrought havoc, especially among those who can least afford it, is forced to borrow thousands of millions to destroy. The social repercussions of the bank bail-out cost in Ireland have been horrendous: record numbers lying on trolleys; growing numbers suffering from depression; growing numbers taking their own lives; a quarter of a million emigrating.

First of all, this Commission is strongly committed to improving transparency and accountability. We have taken measures to that effect in the first weeks of coming into office. Obviously this is not reflected in the report about 2013, which is now two years ago. So, if you want to hold us accountable, also hold us accountable on our actions. I am glad to be accountable in that respect, and I would actually urge this Parliament to follow the example the Commission has set on transparency – for instance, on contacts with lobbyists. This is something on which Parliament could follow suit, and that would be my suggestion. Secondly, I note that we still need to do much to improve our situation. I would not agree with those of you who have argued that the situation in national administrations is better than at European level. There are many Member States where the levels of transparency and accountability are not the same as in the Commission and the other EU institutions, but still I do acknowledge that we need to improve the situation and I will work very closely with the Ombudsman to that effect. I also want to point to the fact that, in relation to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, we did exactly what the Ombudsman required, and I thank her as well as Mr Wałęsa for acknowledging that. I also acknowledge that most complaints are about the Commission, and that is because most of the legislation and decisions affecting citizens directly are indeed acts taken by the Commission. So there is a correlation with the fact that we are the biggest institution and that we have the most effect on citizens: citizens will then complain. I want to try and increase, as much as I can, the level of compliance with the Ombudsman’s recommendations. As pointed out before, we are at 84%, which is the highest level among the institutions. I will try to get it even higher, with the proviso that, in certain cases and for legal reasons, we may not always be able to implement the recommendations of the Ombudsman. In conclusion, let me say that I am very much looking forward to working closely with Ms O’Reilly and her team. They are making a strong contribution to creating a more accountable Europe, a more transparent Europe and a Europe that is closer to its citizens.

I take everything that you say on board. I take the compliments, obviously, but I also take the criticism because, without feedback from you, who are even closer to the people than I am, I cannot really know what their true concerns are. I see you as a very valuable resource in relation to that. There were many issues raised, and obviously I cannot deal on an individual basis with all of them, although of course you are more than welcome to come to me as individual MEPs and discuss any matter that you want. But there are a number of general issues that I want to discuss. A lot of you talked about the visibility of the office. I hope that I am demonstrating that this is certainly a priority for me and that, if people do not know that I am here, the service that I can provide for them is fairly redundant. I have made a very big effort to make the office more visible through a number of techniques. What is also very important – and some of you have alluded to this – is your own national ombudsmen, Member State ombudsmen, the Petitions Committee or regional ombudsmen and the work that I can do to improve that. As you probably know, as European Ombudsman, I chair the European Network of Ombudsmen, and just yesterday I had a strategy meeting in relation to how they can help me. Equally I can also help them with their own situations. Two of the things I am doing include, for the first time next year, producing an annual report on the work of the Network, in which I will highlight not just my own work but also the work of the Member State ombudsmen. Hopefully, if they agree with this, then they too can present that alongside their annual reports to their respective parliaments. I am also just about to start for the first time a joint investigation with a number of Member State ombudsmen in relation to Frontex, on one particular element of their work which is bringing people back, i.e. deporting people from countries. We are going to be looking at how Frontex deals with human rights issues that arise in the context of those flights. So for the first time, the European Ombudsman is working with Member State ombudsmen, we are pooling our resources in our respective jurisdictions in order to make an even bigger impact on that. I will be looking for more areas in which to work on that. Some of you have challenged me and my office in relation to compliance, and also challenged the Commission and the agencies. I set my own challenges as well. Right from the start, I have said that the compliance rate of 80% + is not high enough, because in many Member States, including my own – Ireland – the compliance rate for the recommendations of the Ombudsman is often as high as 95% or even 100%. That is a very high target, but it is one that I will strive to achieve. In relation to effectiveness, a lot of you have pointed to the fact that many of the complaints that come before me are outside of my remit. Obviously most complaints that European citizens have are with their Member States, but one of the functions of the office is to be as helpful as possible and to direct anybody who comes to us to where they can have their problem resolved. But this is partly why I have begun to focus very intensively on the own-initiative investigations, to see what systemic issues I can deal with which my office and the resources that I have can add greatest value to. I suppose my overall ambition for the office is simply to be useful – more useful to the citizen, more useful to Parliament, more useful to the Commission and so on. To do that, I need to collaborate with you. You have to support me if you find that my recommendations are rational and that you wish to support them, because without your help I cannot succeed as I might. I also need to collaborate well with the Commission and with the agencies. They have to trust me, just as the citizens have to trust me. So I thank you all for your contributions. I will take them on board. I just want to make one point about the Troika. Many people have come to me over the last year to see what I can do to investigate the Troika. The Troika is not an EU body per se, even though the ECB and the EU Commission are critical parts of it. What I have said to individual MEPs is that, if they wish to work with me and if there is a particular issue or facet of the work of the Troika, as it relates to an EU institution, that they feel I could legitimately investigate, then that is something that I would be very happy to do. At the moment, as the Irish Members know, there is an investigation into the banking collapse and the financial crisis in Ireland. They are trying to get the ECB over to explain itself to the Irish people, and we will see how that evolves.

Every time we discuss a case of human rights problems or a lack of the rule of law in Russia, we hope and wish that it will be the last such case we need to discuss in this Chamber. In this case too I hope it will be the last one, but I am very much afraid that our hopes will be betrayed yet again. The case itself is very clear. Alexei Navalny was accused and tried on trumped-up charges for no other reason than because he dared to expose corruption at high levels of the Russian state apparatus; for no other reason than the fact that he dared to run for office in opposition to Putin’s rule and Putin’s Government. His brother, Oleg Navalny, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for no other reason than that of being the brother of Alexei Navalny. So, as I say, the case is clear, and I am sure that my colleagues could list a number of similar cases, as we do in fact in the resolution. Threatening and intimidating political opposition through persecution and harassment of family members is one of the oldest tricks in the handbook of autocrats. It can work from time to time, but I am absolutely sure it is not going to work for all time, because it is a practice that violates our most basic sense of justice. An autocratic government running on an extreme nationalistic ticket will most likely present all these charges as being basically anti-Russian. This is far from the truth. I know that there are many of us in this Chamber who love and admire the achievements of the Russian people and who wish for Russia the sort of future in which such cases will never be mentioned in this Chamber again because there will be no need to be looking for human rights violations in Russia.

The case of Alexei Navalny reminds us, however, of the internal problems that Russia also faces and of the increasingly authoritarian regime over which President Putin presides. As one of the faces of the opposition movement at the forefront of many of the mass demonstrations recently seen in Moscow, Navalny’s placement under house arrest since February of last year on the basis of trumped-up and spurious charges is seen as a way to silence one of Putin’s most outspoken critics. The arrest and sentencing of Navalny’s brother is even more shameful, bearing in mind that he has no role in the protest movements and has been implicated by association, a tactic that we more familiarly associate with totalitarian regimes like North Korea rather than with a full member of the Council of Europe.

After, for example, the Sakharov Prize was handed over here in the European Parliament, the Russian authorities placed the Sakharov Centre, which deals with human rights, on the list of foreign agents, and twenty other organisations.  It should not be forgotten that, for example, the St. Petersburg Soldier's Mother's Organization is, in the opinion of the Russian authorities, a foreign agent.

Let me thank this Chamber for the opportunity not only to focus, as we did yesterday, on the external or foreign policy implications of Russia’s behaviour but also on the internal dimension as well. On 30 December Moscow courts delivered a verdict against Alexei Navalny and his brother Oleg, giving him a suspended sentence and jailing his brother. This new court case against Navalny, an opposition leader and anti-corruption activist, as you mentioned, is illustrative of the flaws which persist in the judiciary in Russia. Procedural irregularities were plentiful from the moment the case was built until the verdict, which was announced in the absence of most press and international observers. I reacted publicly and immediately when the verdict was announced. I stressed that judicial decisions should be free from political interference, independent and in full compliance with the rule of law. For years, through our Partnership for Modernisation, the European Union worked on ways to professionalise and reform Russia’s judiciary, notably by the establishment of an appeal system. On what Mr Verhofstadt referred to – and I would like us to refer not to leaks from newspapers or from the media but to what we say in this official place – it is a fact that we also need to work and focus on the human rights dimension and on the rule of law dimension in our dialogue with Russia. In fact, in the paper that we will discuss with the ministers on Monday – and again I would invite you not to refer to leaks in the media but to what we do and what we actually say in official places – there is an option of a partial resumption of these forms of cooperation to promote the rule of law. This is mentioned in the paper that has been leaked – and let me mention also that leaking official documents or issuing papers that are intended to contribute to a discussion of ministers is possibly not the best way of having a serious political discussion. But I think that we need to have, as we are having this morning, a serious discussion about, for example, the ways in which we could think of partially restoring options and instruments for cooperation on the rule of law and the judiciary in Russia, because this obviously affects the internal situation of many people in Russia and the respect for basic human rights. In recent years in too many instances, from the Magnitsky case to the Bolotnaya convicts, from the Kosenko case to Pussy Riot, we have witnessed serious violations of basic human rights, which courts were unable to redress – which they even rubber-stamped. We call upon the Russian authorities to uphold human rights. We will also extend available financial means to Russian NGOs which keep working in that endeavour, as this House has repeatedly asked, even this morning. Russia’s membership of the Council of Europe, which was mentioned by the last speaker, carries a number of obligations. It is our duty, as the European Union, to hold Russia accountable when it ignores those obligations. On Tuesday I discussed with Secretary-General Jagland the ways in which the European Union can provide more and better support for the Council of Europe in these efforts. All relevant instruments should be fully mobilised to respond to human rights violations. We will be looking forward to forthcoming European Court of Human Rights rulings involving Russia, notably on the case of Mr Navalny and, I should also say, on the case of Mr Magnitsky. The conviction of Mr Navalny; the wave of harassment against civil society, labelling as foreign agents 30 organisations such as Memorial or the Sakharov Centre, which was mentioned; and the threats against human rights defenders dealing with Chechnya are the most recent instances to which we firmly reacted, all of this happening over less than a month. Human rights are core elements of our policies and our relationships in all countries in the world, and we should always react firmly, as this House did today, when abuses take place, and we should take measures on this.

Basic freedoms of its citizens are constantly challenged. This time, the target is Alexej Navalny. His biggest ‘guilt’ and ‘fault’ is that he is someone gaining in popularity, possibly endangering the political dominance exerted by President Putin and his allies.

First of all, there is the fact that the attack was deliberately against children – boys and girls. But it was also an attack against the right to education for every boy and girl. As many of you said, not only the Sakharov Prize but also the Nobel Peace Prize going to Malala Yousafzai was a strong reaction to that. Let me say that the best news we have had, in reaction to what happened, was the re-opening of the school in Peshawar this week. I think this is the strongest sign of the fact that the right to education of girls and boys cannot be stopped by such terrible attacks. The second thing that this attack reminded us of – and someone mentioned this – is the fact that the first victims of terrorists are Muslims. Yesterday we discussed Nigeria and today we are discussing Pakistan. I think part of our counter-terrorist measures is the narrative and the awareness that it is not only us we care about, but it is also about all others. Pakistan has paid a high price to terrorism and extremism, with up to 50 000 people killed by terrorists since 2001. A new Comprehensive National Action Plan has been approved. Key elements include regulating madrasas, blocking financing mechanisms of terrorist organisations, and measures against religious persecution. We have set up a specific EU-Pakistan political dialogue on counter-terrorism, the priorities of which are the rule of law and anti-radicalisation. The EU, through a number of different projects, already supports the Pakistani Government’s counter-terrorism activities aimed at reducing the threat from militant groups operating in the territory. This includes support for capacity-building of law enforcement, community policing, promoting dialogue between different communities and strengthening resilience to violence. But, as many of you have said today, counter-terrorism alone does not stand. We have to start from the root causes and from prevention. In 2008 Pakistan started its transition from military rule to democracy. In 2013 the country experienced its first ever handing-over of power from one democratically-elected government to another. The EU has consistently supported the democratisation process. Our election observation missions were in Pakistan in 2008 and 2013. The transition to civilian democracy led to closer EU cooperation with Pakistan in different fields and to a more structured partnership, including political dialogue on sensitive and complicated issues like human rights and counter-terrorism. Let me stress this, because it is also a coherent part of our work on security, disarmament and non-proliferation, especially in a region crucial for peace and security. The key priorities in our human rights engagement and dialogue with Pakistan – and let me remind you that the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, made his first ever visit to Pakistan this year – include freedom of religion and belief, women’s rights, the death penalty and the rule of law and access to justice. The issue of religious minorities remains a central aspect of our human rights dialogue. Freedom of religion and expression are constitutional rights in Pakistan, but discrimination remains, severely affecting, for instance, Shias and Ahmadis, but also Christians and other minorities. The use of the blasphemy law has become a reason for particular concern. The overwhelming majority of cases are filed against Muslims, but Christians are also targeted – such as in the case of Asia Bibi, which I know this Parliament has been following particularly closely. Let me say that I am following it closely with you. Pakistan needs to strengthen civilian courts and institutions. The judicial system has to be adequately resourced, trained and equipped, in order to deal effectively with terrorism. Harsher punishments or the temporary expansion of the jurisdiction of military courts do not address a weak judicial system. Developing an effective, efficient, professional, independent and credible civilian legal system remains a key priority for Pakistan, and the EU is ready to support and train police, prosecutors, defence lawyers and judges. After Peshawar – as some of you mentioned – Pakistan also lifted the de facto moratorium on executions that had been in place since 2008. Let me conclude by saying that the European Union remains – and will remain – opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. The death penalty is not an effective tool in the fight against terrorism, and I sincerely hope that the moratorium will be re-established.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 98, "date": "2015-01-15.json", "name": "Adina-Ioana VĂLEAN", "mepid": "37324", "text": "   The debate is closed.

I acknowledge the recent positive change in Pakistan’s Constitution establishing the right for children to access free, compulsory education. In my opinion, ensuring this right even in emergencies, such as during a conflict, should be done not only within the individual state’s responsibilities, but should also be addressed within the framework of our international cooperation.

From here, I would like to strongly appeal to all Heads of State or Government not to hesitate to take all possible preventive measures and measures to exclude the emergence of similar mass carnage of children.

It also decriminalised male homosexuality in 1998, and these are positive things that we respect in the resolution we have prepared. But we also know that the situation is still very difficult. The Human Rights Watch report in January 2014 found widespread violence by police against LGBT people. There are, time and again, political and religious leaders who speak out against same-sex relations, against lesbians and gays. And now on 15 October, the Kyrgyz Parliament has passed, at first reading, a draft bill which contains amendments to the criminal code, the code of administrative responsibility, the law on peaceful assembly and the law on mass media, aimed at prohibiting the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations in an open or indirect way and providing for up to one year of imprisonment. That means they are prohibiting talking about facts of human life. This will have huge consequences: for journalists – if they write about the existence of lesbians and gays they might go to prison for one year; for human rights NGOs; for the fight against HIV and AIDS; and of course, specifically for lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people, who will face more discrimination and violence, as we have seen in other countries where similar bills have been passed. I would like to say here, from the European Parliament, to Kyrgyz MPs: people fall in love with whoever they fall in love with. You do not decide on that. It can happen to your daughter, to your son. It happens in families, in parliaments, in ministries, in sports associations, so please do not put lesbians and gays into jail for living a life that has been happening all over this world in all cultures, in all regions. Please respect your own constitution, and respect the recommendations of the Council of Europe’s Partner for Democracy status that you have, which clearly call for non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

I was told that urgency debates on human rights are normally not attended by the High Representative. I think it is my duty and also in my interest to be here, as human rights are a crucial part of foreign policy. I said that and I meant that. (Applause) Let me also say that we will have to work on the coherence of our internal policies on human rights, because today we are debating something extremely important concerning countries that are not our own Member States, and in our internal work on human rights, and in particular on LGBTI, we have to be coherent internally also. The Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic is working on legislation that would discriminate against the LGBTI community, and we regret that the draft law has been approved at the first of the three readings necessary for final adoption. This draft legislation, if adopted, would restrict freedom of expression and association. The title of the law – ‘on the promotion of a positive attitude towards non-traditional sexual relations’ – is totally misleading. In reality, it is designed to undermine efforts by human rights NGOs, including LGBTI organisations, to advocate equal treatment for LGBTI people. Since this legislative initiative was initially proposed in March last year, the European Union has raised its concern about the draft law and insisted on the principle of non-discrimination, including in the Human Rights Dialogue in April 2014, and in subsequent high-level discussions with the parliament and government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The EU has reminded the Kyrgyz authorities of the guarantees for freedom of expression and non-discrimination in the Kyrgyz Constitution, as was mentioned before, and of the Kyrgyz Republic’s international commitments. A joint letter from the Heads of Missions and EU Ambassadors was sent to the Speaker of the Kyrgyz Parliament in June, and during the Cooperation Council meeting last November the point was raised. During the Cooperation Council meeting, the Kyrgyz Foreign Minister stressed that the presentation of the draft laws by members of parliament was a democratic right and asserted that the government was not favourable to these draft laws. The EU has also recalled that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, when it granted Partner for Democracy status to the Kyrgyz Parliament earlier this year, expressly stated that this should not be followed up. In line with the Human Rights guidelines of the European Union to promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by LGBTI persons, I will personally continue to use all possible means to warn against the risks of adopting the draft resolution and I will coordinate my work with that of Vice-President Timmermans to make sure that we adopt coherent measures internally to protect the enjoyment of all human rights by all LGBTI persons, including in Europe.

Its manifestation is the law prohibiting the propaganda of homosexuality. Although I see it as a step backwards, I would like to make two comments.  First of all, I recommend balance sheet. While we must heed the universality of human rights, the road to understanding LGBT rights (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) has been complex and long everywhere. It was only in the 1970's that the West became asserted that homosexuality was not a mental disorder. It wasn't until 1993 that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of disorders. Moreover, we must not forget that European colonialism has also complicated many in the world. The infamous section 377 of the Criminal Code, for example, Since the 1960s, India, as well as other former British colonies, has criminalized sexual activities that are \"against the order of nature.\" According to available data, 80 UN member states criminalise homosexuality, and in six countries it is a capital crime. Kyrgyzstan is not exactly an example of the greatest injustice against LGBT people. The second point concerns the very promotion of homosexuality. While I defend everyone's rights to freedom of expression, I consider sexual exhibitionism of any kind to be a non-cultural expression of freedom.

A significant proportion of complaints during this period concerned the refusal of access to documents and information, as well as the lack of transparency in the functioning of the Union institutions and agencies. This is an extremely important problem that has not been solved for years.  It is important to be aware that it is impossible to build trust in the Union without increasing its openness and transparency. The decrease in support for the integration project is, among other things, the result of citizens not knowing on the basis of what conditions decisions are taken directly concerning them.

The Ombudsman gives EU citizens the opportunity to complain about infringements by European institutions, but unfortunately many more infringements occur in member states' institutions. When state institutions violate human rights and the rule of law, EU citizens must contact the Council of Europe institution, the Strasbourg court. The EU cannot help them.

The EU must adopt a decisive, coherent and comprehensive response in favour of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders, which will therefore result in a new strategy towards Russia.

The current government has been able to achieve some success; however, the situation is difficult and the integrity and enduring sovereignty of the State are still not sufficiently guaranteed. Changes in the state should primarily concern constitutional reform and the pursuit of decentralisation, judicial reform, changes in the electoral law and improving the business climate and making it more transparent. Ukraine seeks and receives EU support, both financially, humanely and politically. However, the country's needs are much greater than the aid it receives, as Ukraine is weakened not only by the ongoing conflict, but also by the actions of the Russian Federation from the period before the current insuchation of relations.

I believe our citizens deserve strong EU action that delivers growth, quality jobs and progress on tackling climate change. 25 million people in the EU do not have a job, over 224 000 of whom live in my region of the West Midlands. If we really want to address this, we need to kick-start action on tackling tax havens and develop a truly integrated strategy for job creation.

The exceptional number of detained journalists and journalists awaiting trial, following detention warrants based on scarce and untransparent information, indicates that a set of provisions of the Turkish legal framework and their interpretation by judges obstruct freedom of expression and the media, calling into question respect for the rule of law and freedom of the press , which is a core principle of democracy, at the heart of EU values.

Although Turkey has taken many steps over the last decade to improve its democracy and the state of human rights protection, it is currently aware of a significant shift back from the standards already reached.

Three years ago, the European Federation of Journalists drew attention to the fact that up to 100 journalists are imprisoned for an alleged coup attempt, and writers and intellectuals who have decided to publicly express their critical political views are also being persecuted. Despite a number of mobilisation campaigns and warnings from Western countries, the situation in Turkey in this area has not improved in any way in recent years. Also in the past year, many journalists have been persecuted and detained in connection with reporting on the involvement of senior political officials in a major corruption scandal. In doing so, the public authority did not invoke the veracity or falseness of journalistic claims, but the injunction to provide any information about this corruption case in relation to the politicians in question. Such a practice, when journalists (acting in accordance with the public interest) are intimidated, their computers are seized, databases when they are not allowed to write freely is unacceptable, and I therefore fully support the resolution condemning this situation and calling on Turkish government officials to establish genuine freedom of speech and freedom of the media.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1053, "date": "2015-01-15.json", "name": "Inês Cristina ZUBER", "mepid": "111589", "text": "  in writing. — Once again, we express our concern at the arrests and campaigns against journalists, writers and editors and other critics of the government, including the opposition, secular, progressive and left-wing sectors, and call for their release, as well as all political prisoners.

The recent arrests of journalists in Turkey constitute an undemocratic interference with one of the fundamental human rights, namely the right to freedom of speech and expression. A government that does not nurture these rights is a government that acts contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union. It is worrying that, in addition to the violence against representatives of the seventh force, the issue of independence and impartiality of the Turkish justice system also arises in the part of the Turkish public. However, the European Union, more specifically its full member Slovenia, also has major difficulties with the functioning of the judicial system and with the guarantee of fundamental human rights. Only 25% of people trust the judiciary, and in the last 10 years, courts have violated human rights and fundamental freedoms in as many as 422 cases. The most famous example is the case of political prisoner and SDS President Janez Janše, when the court convicted him of being unsecified on an unsheed day, in an unshealed communication mode and an unsupersonal place, accepting an uns found promise of reward. His wrong-law was only suspended by the Constitutional Court at the end of 2014. The European Union must help all countries, and especially its members.
