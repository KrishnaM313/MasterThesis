I would remind you that, pursuant to Rule 14(2) of the Rules of Procedure, under the chairmanship of the outgoing President, no debate may take place whose subject matter is unrelated to the election of the President or the verification of credentials. All documents concerning the proclamation of the election of Members will be forwarded to the committee responsible for the verification of credentials, which must be set up pursuant to Rule 196 of the Rules of Procedure. Pursuant to Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Procedure, until such time as a Member's powers have been verified or a decision has been taken on any dispute, the Member shall sit with full rights in Parliament and its bodies, provided that he has previously made the declaration of non-incompatibility. In accordance with Article 7 of the Act concerning the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, Members who perform functions incompatible with the mandate of a Member of the European Parliament may not sit in Parliament. The three Members who have not yet signed the declaration of incompatibility and who do not yet have full rights are invited to do so immediately at the bench outside the entrance to the Chamber, otherwise they will not be able to vote. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, before we move on to our agenda, I would like to express my great honour, even before my pleasure, to have the opportunity to open the work of this new parliamentary term as interim President of the European Parliament. My wish to myself first and to each of you is to live up to the expectations of so many citizens who, through their votes, have sent out a clear message about the need for change. The hope is that in five years' time we will be able to say with our heads held high that we have made a real contribution through our work to a better, fairer Europe that is closer to the needs of our citizens. In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, we must elect the President this morning. Pursuant to Rule 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure, nominations for the office of President of the European Parliament must be submitted, with the consent of those concerned, by a political group or at least forty Members. Instructions on the election of the President have been distributed to you. Mr Iglesias Turri√≥n, Mr Karim, Mr Lunacek and Mr Schulz have received the following nominations to the Presidency of the European Parliament under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure. 409 votes. The candidates have informed me that they accept their respective nominations. Pursuant to Rule 16(1) of the Rules of Procedure, I would remind you that, in order to be elected, a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast in the first three ballots. Blank or void ballotpapers shall not be taken into account for the purpose of counting the votes cast.

This Parliament is called to represent Europe's sovereignty and we must, ladies and gentlemen, live up to what this means today.  Europe's dream has been buried many times, but it always managed to wake up again. This is how it happened almost seventy years ago: Europe again awoke in the resistance of its peoples against fascism, in the survivors of the death camps, in whom they gave their lives for justice and freedom. Thousands of my compatriots who had fought defending democracy in Spain participated in that struggle and in that dream of justice. You can't imagine the pride it gives me as Spanish that the first tanks that entered to liberate Paris were led by Spanish fighters. Today, when intolerance and xenophobia threaten us again, I would like to vindicate the European memory of anti-economics and that of all peoples who love freedom and democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, the best of our continent and our common history was forged in the revolutions that made the people subject to rights, above kings, gods, nobles and great owners. Europe's best heritage is the will of its citizens to be free and not to be servants of anyone. Don't be anybody's servants, ladies and gentlemen! That's democracy. That is why today I must tell you that the peoples to which we owe freedoms and social rights did not fight for a Europe in which their people live in fear of poverty, exclusion, unemployment, homelessness in the face of disease. The expropriation of sovereignty and the submission to government of financial elites threaten Europe's present and future. They threaten our dignity; threaten equality, freedom and fraternity; threaten our lives in common.  The creation of new supranational bodies does not have to be paid at the price of incapacitating citizens. Our peoples are not minors, nor colonies of any investment fund; they did not conquer or defend their freedom to give it to a financial oligarchy. These are not abstract terms, ladies and gentlemen, you all know the problem well. It is scandalous how easily lobbies move here in the service of large corporations, as well as the \"revolving doors\" that turn citizen representatives into millionaires on the payroll of large companies. Let's say it loud and clear. This way of functioning undermines the sovereignty of peoples, undermines democracy and turns political representatives into caste. Ladies and gentlemen, democracy in Europe has been the victim of an authoritarian drift. On the European periphery the situation is tragic: our countries have become almost protectorate, in new colonies, where powers that no one has chosen are destroying social rights and threatening the social and political cohesion of our societies. From Latin America we learned that external debt is designed to be unpayable and that the countries that have grown the most did so with a substantial takeover and a public audit of their debt. Everyone in this House knows the debt forgiven not so long ago to Germany. It is not just a question of justice: it has to do with European integration and democracy. Debt is now a mechanism of command and looting of the peoples of the south.  That is what is happening in countries that with marked racism some call \"PIGS\". But I suppose you are aware that there is no Europe without its peoples in the south, as there is no Europe without its eastern peoples, also subjected to harsh conditions of the Troika, whose course threatens to destroy the European project leaving a trail of misery, poverty and violence.  But there is another way, there is an alternative to policies of impoverishment and the hijacking of sovereignty. This Parliament, at this critical hour for Europe, must live up to it. It must show sensitivity and become the epicentre of a democratic shock in the European Union, a jolt that curbs the authoritarian drift of the Troika. This Parliament must express the democratic legitimacy of origin that brings us all together: the voice of citizens, not the arrangements between elites. Parliament cannot be a consolation prize or a golden retirement.  Ladies and gentlemen, today I am not addressing a House of five, six or seven parliamentary groups. I'm not going to party machines either. I address you, ladies and gentlemen, to the European Parliament, because you have a political responsibility contract signed with your peoples. I address the Democrats and their consciences. Our first fidelity, to which all others must be subjected, is to the citizens who have chosen us. They are not in the corridors of this building, nor in the hotels surrounding this House, but remember, they are the sovereigns and, sooner or later, they will be held accountable for what has been done on their behalf.  I also address, and especially my MEPs from the countries of southern Europe. You have seen the real consequences of the policies imposed by the Troika. You know that austerity policies have failed: our countries are now poorer, with economies destroyed, with societies hurt with injustice and institutions ranked by corruption and discredit. You know it's time to help our countries and get back on your feet. I ask you, at least today, to vote as Greeks, as Irish, as Portuguese, as Italians, as Czechs, as Poles, as Romanians, as Spaniards. Not only so they can look people in the face when they return home, but because they will be defending Europe. I ask your vote, aware that many of you do not share this abduction of democracy, knowing that many of you are sincerely committed to the well-being of your peoples. I ask you to vote to stop the grand coalition that imposes austerity and financial totalitarianism.  I would like to address my last words to the citizens and peoples of southern Europe who have taken to the streets these years to defend social justice and democracy. To the millions who have said 'enough! in the European squares, I want to tell you that you are pride, the democratic heart of Europe. The peoples of Europe have been through worse situations and we have shaken the despots. I do not know if today we will be able to take the presidency of this Parliament from the grand coalition, but if you continue to push us, I assure you that we will win.

Like so many of you arriving here today for the first time, I came in 2004 with great hope and celebration: we were reunifying our continent after decades of division. But today, colleagues, if we choose to listen there is a message for us to hear, a message which requires us to change our ways. I am told this election is a foregone conclusion, that the deal has been done before a single vote has been cast, and that I and you should simply bow to the inevitable. Colleagues, there is nothing more sacred in the world of democratic politics than the right to vote: to cast a ballot for beliefs sincerely held, to express a choice that reflects the interests of all those who we have been elected to serve, to give a voice to cherished ideals and principles. But is that what we are being invited by some to do here today? What have we become if the Presidency of this House ‚Äì an office that should rise above partisan politics and ordinary political ambition ‚Äì is reduced to nothing more than a bargaining chip, a counter in a game, a consolation prize for failing to get a consolation prize, Plan D in a political life where Plans A, B, and C have failed? We were told in the recent election that this time it would be different, that transparency would prevail over secrecy, that principle would override expediency, that honest, democratic politics would triumph over the backward-looking backroom deal. But sadly, just a few weeks after the European elections, we are being invited to endorse a cosy consensus brokered behind closed doors. This is a shoddy, shabby, shameful vision of our Union. This is not a vision I could possibly share. It is a mandate to carry on exactly as before, a deaf ear to the message conveyed by the majority who felt compelled to stay away from the ballot and the millions who felt compelled to demonstrate in the only way left to them by turning to the extremes. As a former Commissioner once said, it is hard to respect a Parliament that does not respect itself. Well, I respect this Parliament. It embodies so many hopes for the future. I did not come into politics to defend the status quo or to secure high offices for the select few. I am sure you did not either. All my political life, I have espoused the vision of Europeans cooperating together in open, democratic and fair institutions. I am sure many of you also share this vision, in which one nation alone does not shape our paths and priorities, but we fight our battles and accept the results. We see this happening among our national leaders who, late last week, did not all agree but who have come together again to cooperate, as we too must do in order to respect the wishes of the electorate and deliver the change and opportunity they call for. Of course, while we share hopes for the future, we have many different views about the route to be chosen to fulfil these aspirations. Our institutions should not, however, be snared by one political faction or another or traded for control elsewhere. I believe that the President of Parliament should not use his office to express personal opinions or promote his personal interests or to advance his personal career. No, I have a more noble vision for the office of President of our House. The President should reflect the diversity of this House, as this House reflects the diversity of the peoples of Europe. The President should be fair to all, open to all, attentive to all. The President should represent this House with honour and dignity throughout Europe and indeed the world. That is the kind of President I aspire to be. I do not want to play politics: I want to enhance the reputation of our shared institution. I do not want to look after my interests, I want to look after yours. I do not want to return to the politics of backroom deals of years gone by, I want to reach out to all those Europeans who look to our institution with hope for the future. This is my dream for the European Parliament, but such dreams will not become reality if we allow the better angels of our nature to be defeated by political calculation or personal ambition. When you are about to cast your ballot this morning, and you stand alone with your beliefs and conscience in making your democratic choice, will you vote for the backroom deal, or will you vote for a Europe of openness, transparency, democracy and hope? I humbly ask for your support for my vision of a Presidency worthy of this House and worthy of the peoples of Europe.

An Austrian journalist said to me this morning in an interview on Austrian radio that the European Parliament has been strengthened by these elections, because we were the ones who took the procedure of the nomination and election of the Commission President into our hands and out of those of the Council. That is why we are standing here strengthened. But we need to be aware that we should not put this new strength that we have gained at risk by being less democratic internally than we should be.  That is why I now stand here running for President, because I, and my political group, and so many others here, simply did not find it acceptable that the Council could tell us about ten days ago who to vote for as the President of this Parliament. That is our choice, and that is why my group, which originally nominated me as a Vice-President of this Parliament, also asked me to run for President ‚Äì because that is what elections are all about, including internally. The European Parliament is the voice of European citizens, not the secretary of EU governments. As Parliamentarians who are directly elected, each and every one of us, we should not simply be presented with a pre-cooked deal to just rubber stamp.  Everybody who knows me ‚Äì and that means quite a lot of you ‚Äì knows that the struggle for democracy is close to my heart inside the EU and inside this Parliament, but also outside the EU. I will say this now in the four languages that I speak: democracy is about choices; la d√©mocratie est une affaire de choix; democracia consiste en elegir; Demokratie braucht Alternativen. That is why I also think that these elections signal change. That is why, as your President, I would try to give citizens an answer to what they wanted from these elections. One thing was to end austerity. We simply cannot have a continent with more and more poverty, especially among young people, where people do not see Europe as a promise anymore, but sometimes even as a threat. That needs to change, and I would want to invest in that as part of this European Parliament and as your President. Investing in jobs ‚Äì green jobs ‚Äì, renewables and energy efficiency is important, but the European Parliament also needs to be credible on the inside. We need to lead by example on energy issues, such as by making these buildings more energy efficient, and also on transparency. In this House we have a code of conduct that is not always monitored and implemented. We need a legislative footprint to make sure that it is clear who is influencing which law and that nobody can try to buy a law. We need to tell European citizens that we are serious about that.  We also need a single seat. We Parliamentarians ‚Äì and not the Council any more ‚Äì need to decide where we meet. That is also something I want to change. The majority in this Parliament has voted that it should be we who decide in the future where to go. It is also clear that we must not fall into the trap of pandering to populism, inter-governmentalism or ‚Äì worst of all ‚Äì nationalism and extremism. The European Parliament has long been a champion of fundamental human rights and citizens‚Äô rights, and this must continue. We must face down the knee-jerk trend to intolerance, disrespect and second-class treatment of women, but also of minorities, whether racial, sexual, social or otherwise. The European Parliament can and must do more to defend core values on which this European Union is founded, and the next  Parliamentary term will be decisive for Europe‚Äôs future. If we do not get it right now, there will ‚Äì with reference to the football championship going on at the moment ‚Äì be no extra time and no replay. That is what citizens demanded from us in these elections, and it is also a question of democracy.  I would like to end by sharing something with you that I deeply share with Mr Schulz, who will be speaking after me, so I will switch to German for that.  Demokratie braucht Alternativen.

We are a unique institution. The 751 Members who are here together ‚Äì we, ladies and gentlemen ‚Äì represent the peoples of 28 sovereign states. We are a legislative chamber that legislates for 507 million people in 28 different states. There is only one time in the world. This Parliament is unique! It is unique in its existence and it is unique in its task. The fact that 750 men and women, who, if I am properly informed, represent some 300 parties representing the nations and 28 sovereign states here, the fact that we can sit together and discuss which of us should be placed at the head of this Chamber, this fact alone, ladies and gentlemen, is not a matter of course. It is one of the greatest historical achievements that this continent has ever achieved. We should be proud of this, and we should make that the basis of our work! (Applause) Whoever comes to the top of this Chamber has a duty, namely to work for the benefit of these people in the 28 States precisely out of this task I have just described. There can be very different views on how to do this. And the different currents are represented here in this House. We have a duty in the composition of this House to work together across the borders of political groups. None of us alone has a majority. This may be regrettable, but that is the will of the electorate. That is why transnational cooperation, which is the basis of the European Union, is also cooperation across the borders of political currents. That is why the debate that the candidates are having here is a debate across the currents. We are free in the polling booth. There is no group constraint here. Here, everyone can decide how he or she wants to decide. The darkness of the polling booth is the guarantor of democracy. That is why I am applying to all of you for your trust. I have been able to be president of this House for the last two and a half years. This has been the greatest honour in my life for me, and I would like to make it clear to you that what we have achieved in this last parliamentary term is that there is no longer any hierarchy in the institutions. When I was elected here, they still existed. There were the members of the Council who said' 'Well, the European Parliament', there were the Commissioners who said' 'there is only one institution, that is us'. Today, we are in a situation where no one in the European Union, no one at national level and no one at European level can pass by this Parliament, this unique institution, no one in the European Union. Today, we are the source of democratic legitimacy in Europe. (Applause) This great democratic progress, that executive power must come from democratic parliamentary will- is what we have achieved. This is one of the greatest political turning points that have taken place in the history of the European Union. I am proud of the fact that I was able to participate in this. Now I'm applying again. Many Members who see me here for the first time as newly elected Members do not know what the experience of my fellow Members in the last parliamentary term has been. I would say a lot of good ones ‚Äì but certainly people also make mistakes. I am the very last person who considers myself to be flawless. Quite the opposite. I am a person with his strengths and weaknesses. I would ask all those who are new here to have an advance of confidence, and those who elected me last time, I ask for a renewed vote of confidence in me to continue to represent this Parliament with dignity for the next two and a half years and to continue to represent it as a democratic place for the debate on the future of Europe.

Thank you for your trust. I hope to be able to win the trust of those who have not chosen me today. Thank you, Mr Iglesias Turrien, thank you, Mrs Lunacek, and also you, Mr Karim, for this competition. I thank those who voted for me. I would like to say to you that, as the first President re-elected in his office, I am aware of this extraordinary honour. I am aware that this first time in this House gives rise to a special obligation for me, and I want to face up to that commitment, I take it very seriously. Our Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, is the heart of democracy in the European Union. The role played by our fellow Members at national level is our role at EU level, namely to appoint the executive after an election, to entrust it in its work through legislation, and to monitor the implementation of that work. What was considered normal and self-evident at national level was missing at European level. An overwhelming majority in this House criticised this before the European elections and concluded that only someone who had previously presented himself as a candidate among the citizens and applied for a mandate should come to the top of the next Commission. In my language, such a person is called the leading candidate. Astonishingly, this word has also found its way into many other European languages, and it has become a European word. One of these leading candidates was nominated by the European Council last weekend as President-designate of the Commission as a result of this process and will have to face a vote of confidence here on 15 July. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a major step towards strengthening Parliament and parliamentarianism in the EU. It is a success of which we, as Members of this House, can be proud! (Applause) I believe that this is a process that will bring about profound change in Europe. However, ladies and gentlemen, we still face major challenges. The dramatic youth unemployment, especially among young men and women under the age of 25, creates a sense of hopelessness and despair that threatens our democracy. Inequality between countries, between groups in the population, in society, and above all the still existing inequality between women and men, must not leave us to rest. Completing the reforms in the banking and tax system will require our strong commitment to further legislation. Negotiations with the United States of America on a free trade agreement will certainly be extensive and difficult. And I believe that we agree across all group boundaries that we need a Charter of Fundamental Digital Rights in the 21st century. We need a humane migration and asylum policy that helps to ensure that the tragedies we have experienced in the Mediterranean are not repeated. (Applause) We need justice for people and for businesses in the internal market. We need an energy policy that makes us independent, but which also keeps energy affordable and which secures our energy supply. Let me make this very clear, also in view of the really short-term needs: the fight for the protection of our natural resources and against threatening climate change remains our permanent task, including as legislators, during this parliamentary term. There is a long list of tasks, ladies and gentlemen, which we must tackle together, and the 396 newly elected Members ‚Äì including many young men and women who are here for the first time ‚Äì will certainly bring a breath of fresh air to our Chamber of Deputies. I would like to say one thing to you, the newly elected Members, whom I would like to welcome in a special way: do not worry, you will find a lot of work in the European Parliament. Great challenges await us! A Parliament with 751 Members from 28 sovereign states with Members representing regions from the Azores to the Belarusian border, from the north of Lapland to Malta, is already, by its very existence, a place where the continental problems we have become visible in everyday life. An institution in which the very different concerns and threats are felt. That is why we in this House also need a serious debate on the EU's international role and our role as a Parliament in this debate and on the international strategies that the European Union has. A directional discussion. We have been very busy with ourselves within the European Union in recent years because of the serious crises. These crises are continuing. But dramatic things are happening around us! For example, the civil war in Syria and the refugee flows it is triggering. That challenges us, every day. The disintegration of Iraq, the radicalisation that is taking place in the neighbouring regions of the European Union, the disintegration of entire states. We must not underestimate this. And we therefore need not only a debate on refugee flows and how we regulate the refugee issue, above all ‚Äì and I say this with a view to the revision of the financial perspective ‚Äì we need more money for development policy, and we need a consistent debate on the arms trade. We will only solve the issues if we solve the problems in the regions where the problems arise. This House, ladies and gentlemen, dealt with Ukraine in the last parliamentary term in I do not know how many debates. What is happening there, every day, and what has happened in recent months, has meant that, 100 years after the start of the First World War and 75 years after the start of the Second World War, people in Europe ‚Äì as you all felt during the election campaign ‚Äì are actually afraid of war. I do not think that this should be the case in Europe, that people are very afraid of war. If we are serious about the EU as a force of peace, then the economic power that we have must be used politically in such a way that those who want to trade with us accept the rule of law and do not practice the law of the strongest. That is why all those who suffer from these strategies are those who are particularly in need of our solidarity from the European Parliament. In this way, we also regain the trust of people. When people feel that the European Union is there for them, it protects them and it strengthens them. The basis of the rule of law, ladies and gentlemen, is respect for human dignity. To live every single person, regardless of gender, origin, skin color, faith or form. I firmly believe that a democracy can only be built on this basic rule, on the basic rule of respect and human dignity. The guarantee of mutual respect and human dignity must therefore be the guiding principle of our actions. And here we must make them the basis of our work, in this House and through this Parliament in the internal processes of the EU and through the EU in international politics. I know that the overwhelming majority of Members of this House support this position. However, I would also say when I took office as President of the European Parliament that anyone who questions the rules of mutual respect and human dignity will meet with my strong opposition. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot of work ahead of us. Let us tackle the work in a collegial spirit, in controversial but constructive discussions, let us get to work! And let me once again thank you very personally for this extraordinary confidence. I hope I will be worthy of your trust.

Then the machine registers your vote. You can then delete everything. Then you did not vote. This is then considered not valid. You have the option of refusing to vote. This corresponds to the situation if you cast an empty ballot paper in a postal ballot or an election, which is also considered invalid. I have to correct myself. I have just been made aware of a mistake concerning Mr Rehn. That was a mistake on my part. I have read an incorrect number here. Mr Rehn had 304 votes, not 384. I apologise. Accordingly, he was not elected. Mr Rehn is now listed as a candidate in this third round. I don't know why. It was a human error of mine. I suppose I read the wrong number here. Mr Rehn, I apologise. Unfortunately, you will then have to apply again in the third round. Mr Caspary, thank you very much for this point. The ballot can now be opened. The names are displayed. I am opening the third round. The ballot is closed. I will announce to you the outcome of the third round of elections for the office of Vice-President of the European Parliament.
