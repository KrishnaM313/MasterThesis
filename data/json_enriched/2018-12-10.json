The declaration represented a turning point in the history of mankind, introducing principles and rights that are now indispensable points of reference. The declaration inspired our founding fathers, who had experienced the atrocities and the abyss to which contempt for human rights leads. Our Europe is founded on respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual, the guarantor of liberal democracy and the rule of law. These values are the essence of our European identity and have guaranteed seventy years of peace and mutual respect. The European Parliament has always been at the forefront of defending these values. For thirty years, with the Sakharov Prize, this Parliament has been paying tribute and supporting those who are fighting for human rights, often at a very high price. Five Sakharov Prize winners also received the Nobel Peace Prize and just today, in Oslo, Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad received this prestigious award. All our congratulations go to them. I would also like to express our condolences for the death of Lyudmila Alexeyeva, a pioneer of the human rights movement in the former Soviet Union. This Parliament awarded it the Sakharov Prize in 2009 as a member of the Memorial Association. I would remind you that on Wednesday, in this House, we will award the Sakharov Prize 2019 to the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, a symbol of the fight for the rights of political prisoners throughout the world. But today I would also like to mention the first human rights watchdogs, journalists, who risk their lives everywhere in the world for our freedom. My thoughts turn to Daphne Caruana Galizia, Ján Kuciak and Jamal Khashoggi, who were killed in the search for the truth, but also to all the journalists who are unjustly imprisoned in the world.

We don’t have a lot of silence yet, but let me start by thanking all shadow rapporteurs for their wonderful cooperation; we had very smooth negotiations in order to find compromises. So let me start by thanking them for that.  Secondly, I would like to thank the European Commission for its strong proposal for the prolongment of the LIFE financial instrument, which is – let’s face it – the most successful financial instrument that we have in Europe. It is very effective, it’s very efficient, and it’s extremely relevant. It’s loved in Brussels, but also in the Member States by industry and by civil society. I think it’s an example of how European financial instruments should work. It plays a wonderful catalytic role to initiate, expand and accelerate sustainability, and its main success factor is that it’s quality—driven. It is not spoilt by politics. That sounds a bit strange in this political arena, but it’s quality—driven. As far as I’m concerned, as rapporteur – and I found quite some support for that among the shadow rapporteurs – we should continue to keep it quality—driven. Of course, even a successful programme can be improved, and there are two elements that I would like to highlight here. First of all, the original fund is far too small: we have EUR 5 billion. That’s why this Parliament already, in an earlier plenary resolution, asked for an increase to EUR 7 billion – very important.  The second point is that it should have more coherence with the other EU funds. LIFE is very successful, but too many other European funds are going against the interests of biodiversity, nature and the environment, and especially the strategic integrated projects under the LIFE programme play a very important role here.  I would like to highlight two more political elements that were also discussed in this House. The first is that this LIFE budget can only be relatively small if all other EU budget funds are not going against the interests of the environment. That is a very crucial point, also made in all the impact assessments by the Commission and in the introduction to the LIFE programme by the Commission. It can only have this limited amount of money if the other EU funds are not going against it, and it’s very important that we monitor that after the MFF has been improved at large.  The second, more political, debate is about national allocations. I’m very happy that we found a compromise among the shadows and that we did not fall into the trap of moving towards national allocations, but that we found a compromise on a bio-geographic balance, which means that we take the ecosystems in Europe as a basis and not our national borders. Finally, I would like to make some comments on amendments that have been tabled here in plenary. There is one EPP amendment that explicitly mentions the agricultural sector and forestry to include them even more strongly in the LIFE fund. I would like to emphasise that, under the current LIFE, agricultural projects are very much eligible. We currently have 136 projects ongoing, and so it’s not only superfluous; it’s also behaving a bit like the very hungry caterpillar. There are agricultural funds of EUR 400 billion already reserved, and this limited fund of EUR 5 billion should not be more strongly focused on the agricultural sector than it already is.  Finally, regarding the other amendment from the EPP on large carnivores: I know it’s a political debate and it’s worthwhile having that debate here, but putting it among the general objectives of the LIFE programme, which talks about climate, environment and biodiversity in general terms, and then adding large carnivores as equal to those general objectives doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Let’s have that debate when we discuss the other, more individual, parts of it.

I would like to thank, too, all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) for their excellent report on the Commission’s proposal for establishing the next Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE), and also for proceeding with this report very quickly and with a lot of ambition. Speed and ambition in adopting the proposal for a LIFE Programme post—2020 are indeed necessary. The Commission has put forward ambitious yet realistic proposals for a modern EU budget, proposing clearer and simpler EU financial rules, which ensure that the Union budget delivers on the issues that matter to Europeans, such as the environment. Flexibility is a key feature of a modern European budget. It is therefore essential to maintain this flexibility in the LIFE programme in order to allow the Commission to respond to new and emerging issues in the future. Let me also emphasise that LIFE will continue to be entirely dedicated to supporting the EU’s environment and climate objectives, while broadening its scope to support the increased deployment of renewable energy and improved energy efficiency. We have proposed an increase of ambition through wider scope and also through volume for strategic integrated projects, which have an impressive catalytic effect. The new Clean Energy Transitions sub—programme will also enable stronger synergies in the implementation of environmental, climate and energy policies. However, I would like to stress that LIFE is not meant to solve all environmental and climate funding problems on its own. Rather, this instrument is a pivot at the heart of the Commission’s overall approach to ensuring that the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021—2027 will support environment and climate across all of its instruments. Closing the gap between basic research and innovation, the new LIFE programme will support, across the European Union, the development and testing of improved methods to implement the EU’s environment and climate policy objectives. The new programme will ensure that those successful methods will subsequently be upstreamed and replicated across the Union. As a matter of fact, greater importance will be placed on EU added value. Let me be clear about this: the success of LIFE will depend on the EU added value of its projects, not on their distribution simply by Member State. That being said, the Commission will take care to pursue extended geographical distribution of the projects by supporting the network of national contact points responsible for facilitating the sharing of know-how and good practices. Finally, I would like to remind you about the importance of LIFE for nature and biodiversity. In addition to providing continued support for standard LIFE projects, the dedicated Nature and Biodiversity sub—programme under the new LIFE programme will include a new type of project, namely the strategic nature projects. These projects will specifically support national programmes to enhance the mainstreaming of nature and biodiversity into other policies and financing programmes, including through coordinated implementation of the priority action established pursuant to the Habitats Directive. Let me conclude by saying that I am keen to achieve a first-reading agreement before Parliament’s recess and I would like to reassure you that the Commission stands ready to play its role as an honest broker. Next week, I will discuss the LIFE programme at the Environment Council, where, hopefully, a partial general approach will be agreed. Such a timeline could allow trilogues to start as soon as January.

Our way of life needs to change, but it is very difficult. Combating climate change is cross-border work. Not only at EU level, but globally. It is therefore natural and absolutely essential that responsibility should be shared on the biggest shoulders. Climate and environmental work is the EU's core area of activity and life is the only EU funding programme that is fully earmarked for this work. Mr President, I am pleased that Parliament has already expressed its strong support for the continuation and strengthening of LIFE on several occasions and has wanted more money for this. However, it has to be acknowledged that the financial efforts available to the EU cannot solve the problems facing our environment, as the Commissioner has just said. It is therefore important that we use scarce resources sensibly. LIFE has been aimed at achieving a major re-impact even with a small amount of investment. This must continue to be the case.

Significantly increasing the budget for the next 2021-2027 programming is therefore not only justified, but indispensable. LIFE plays a key role in the conservation of ecosystems, especially in relation to the Birds and Habitats Directives and through the management of Natura 2000. Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are essential elements for growth, employment and the economy. It is therefore important to ensure, as indicated in my amendments, clear, quantitative and measurable objectives, with result indicators, monitoring tools and review and reporting mechanisms. The decarbonisation target of the Paris Agreement requires a rapid shift to a clean, low-emission energy strategy. A considerable proportion of the increase for the LIFE programme was therefore allocated to the \"Transition to Clean Energy\" sub-programme.

Mr President, Commissioner, it is high on the European agenda that farmers should be given a fair price for their products. This week, for example, I am working on legislation to tackle unfair trade practices. What we are doing a lot is to ensure that legislation for farmers who come mainly from Brussels is workable and that farmers can get away with it. What I'm particularly concerned about is that we can start using more animal manure instead of fertilizer.  But one thing we seem to forget and I have a lot of concerns about that in recent years, that is the appreciation for the farmer and gardener. Because if you open the newspapers now, the farmer is very often used as a scapegoat for climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental impact and you name it. But we seem to forget what the farmers have already done, for example, and we conveniently assume that they do nothing.  But here's the numbers. Since 1990, the carbon footprint of milk has decreased by 32%, pork by 35%, poultry meat by 46%, eggs by 38%, veal by 50%, sugar by 41% and greenhouse horticulture uses 59% less energy. In the last three years, 15 000 hectares of agricultural land in the Netherlands have disappeared. In the same time, 11 000 hectares of nature have been added. The leaching of fertilisers has fallen dramatically in the last 20 years and there has been a ban on many hundreds of plant protection products, with no alternative available to some. Whichever agricultural system you use – whether conventional or organic – in the production of food, you always have an environmental impact and always take a look at nature. We must ensure that that impact is minimal. 80% of farmers in the Netherlands say they would like to achieve this.  Now we can do two things. One, seeing the farmer as a scapegoat and having no respect for him or two, see him as an important partner to further make agriculture more sustainable.

Since 1992, LIFE has co-financed over 4 500 projects, including 828 Italian projects, with a contribution of EUR 620 million. These projects have helped, for example, to make European citizens discover the Natura 2000 network and to protect biodiversity, which is still declining in Europe today. These projects have also helped to reduce environmental pollution and combat climate change. A Europe that, when it wants, knows how to serve its citizens and the common good. For Italy and the European Union, therefore, the LIFE programme is strategic and its continuation must therefore be supported. In the next seven years 2021-2027 LIFE must continue to support innovative actions to protect the environment and the climate, actions to be replicated on a large scale, to facilitate the transition to a society resilient to climate change, based on the circular economy and renewable energies, precisely that society that today we must try to defend in Katowice, Poland, during COP 24. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. I particularly welcome the fact that it has identified, as further objectives of the programme, the fight against the degradation of ecosystems and the need to minimise the negative effects of chemicals.

I hear from the Netherlands and also from other countries that the money for this will be difficult for projects. I also hear it from delegates from the Netherlands and I will be happy to refer them to you, because it needs to be simpler. I also think we should double-stroke. When it comes to money and agriculture, you say that this does not belong together, but the whole Committee on Agriculture and all the parties have supported me as shadow rapporteur.  Then I said, it's about the cycle. It is about low-emission agriculture. It is about farmers in Natura 2000 sites. It's about peatland areas. It's about the estate owners. It's about forestry when we look at CO2. So we can do a lot with it. We must also involve the citizens. So not against each other – that is often the case now – but with each other. And not as often happened in the Netherlands until now, that farmers are expropriated because they are in a beautiful nature reserve, when they have been there for hundreds of years.  I am also pleased that the Committee on Agriculture has fully supported me to do this, and I also hope that my amendment 79 – and you will never do it alone in this Parliament – will be further supported.

It is such a shame that this LIFE budget is going to be wasted on a totally useless project trying to make farmers improve the world’s weather. What are the drivers of climate change? The main one, of course, is the activity of the cosmic rays, this atomised cosmic dust and, where our atmosphere condenses against it, cloud cover. What can the farmers do about these exploding stars? Nothing at all. What can the farmers do about the five different solar cycles whose cycle is well understood and that have caused the changes in our climate for over 2 000 years? Farmers can’t change the solar cycles. Farmers can’t change the gravitational pulls of other planets. Farmers certainly can’t change the ocean currents. We haven’t even got on to greenhouse gases yet, which are pretty trivial – the most important one of those for climate change is water vapour, and yet you never hear about that, and a very good thing too, because that is our cloud cover. They all talk about CO2. Yes, the levels have gone up. Why have they gone up? Because of the warming we had in the last part of the last century: the seas got warmer and released some CO2. CO2 is a consequence of global warming, it isn’t a cause of it. Then we’ve got methane that farmers produce in tiny, tiny quantities – it is a tiny, tiny gas. In any case, it breaks down to CO2 and water vapour. There’s no point in fiddling around trying to do anything with that. Then, of course, we’ve got nitrous oxide, the leguminous crops. We are wasting our time in trying to persuade farmers they can change the world’s weather. What could we be doing with this budget? We’ve got a serious problem worldwide called anti-microbial resistance. Farmers do have a part to play in trying to overcome this. We could use this LIFE budget to find ways of improving biosecurity on farms and then allocating grants to make the biosecurity a lot better. We could offer grants to farmers to cull their flocks when the only choice is to give them antibiotics. This would be a very good way of preventing antibiotic use. We could use this budget to research the breeding of harder, more resistant birds, instead of them requiring antibiotics.

In my constituency, the LIFE programme is having a vital role for the preservation of the Ebro Delta, as one of the programmes funded through these funds is aimed at the study of sediment transfer in the final stretch of the river. In the last century, the contributions of sludge to the delta have been greatly reduced by the construction of dams along the river, with the consequence, on the one hand, of its sinking, and on the other, the inlet of seawater, which directly affects the balance of this unique ecosystem that is a biosphere reserve.

First, I would like to start with the issue of increased funding. The proposal for a LIFE regulation is part of this EU budget package, and altering the nature of the LIFE proposal will have a very direct impact on the entire EU budget which is the result of a delicate equilibrium among several EU funding programmes. And as I already mentioned, LIFE is not meant to solve all environmental and climate funding problems on its own. This instrument is to ensure that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will support the environment and climate across all its instruments. Also, let us not forget that the Commission has allocated a lot of money for the environment, in addition to the LIFE programme, and not to mention the amount of investment coming from individual Member States as well. I agree with the comments that were made that the LIFE objectives must also be mainstreamed in other policies and funds. Some MEPs mentioned agriculture and the CAP. The MFF already provides finance for the environment through the mainstreaming of policies into other environmental policies and other policies. It is in everyone’s interest to ensure that every single euro that is spent in the CAP, every single euro which is spent in the Structural Funds, for example, is contributing to nature and environmental policies. With regard to the CAP, I have full confidence that our farmers want to be part of the solution when it comes to protecting nature and the environment. I think Mr Gerbrandy also mentioned the broader geographical uptake and, even there I agree: we recognise the value of a broader geographical uptake of LIFE across Europe. We therefore need a new approach that will increase the number of high—quality applications coming from all corners of the EU. Under this new programme there will be financing addressing the specific capacity—building needs of the National Contact Points (NCPs) through network activities. Finally, I would like to remind our colleagues that the LIFE programme was very positively commented upon by the European Court of Auditors and it was mentioned as being very fit for purpose. Also, the ombudsman, in 2017, gave LIFE the Award for Good Administration. Perhaps one last comment – and here I want to be a little bit self—critical as well – there are already a good number of integrated projects related to the oceans. But I still feel there is perhaps the need to push more integrated LIFE projects towards the ocean environment, towards ocean biodiversity and towards ocean sustainability. I therefore look forward to working with the European Parliament and the Member States to ensure the timely adoption of this very important instrument. I reiterate the importance of concluding the interinstitutional negotiations early in 2019 in order to facilitate the adoption of the MFF at the earliest date possible.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union, the main cause of work-related deaths is cancer. Every year, 100,000 people die from exposure to carcinogens during their professional careers. Silent deaths, deaths that no one talks about, diseases that are not the subject of major prevention campaigns. That is to say the importance of the second revision of the directive on carcinogens and mutagens, which we are dealing with today. It is unacceptable that thousands of workers lose their lives to earn it. As such, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having the courage to launch the revision of this directive, which has been expected for more than ten years, to thank also the shadow rapporteurs and also the Council, the Presidency, which has been attentive to our work. A first phase has already been completed. Tomorrow, thanks to your approval, we will conclude a second stage which, with the first, will help save 100,000 lives in the Union in the next 50 years. This text sets exposure limits for six carcinogens. We wanted to be ambitious. With the mandate given to me by Parliament, I have defended the inclusion of diesel fumes faced by millions of workers. I could not mention all the sectors concerned, as there are: from construction, to the road or rail transport sector, to the mining sector or to the tunnel sector. But what is important today is that we always protect those who work better. The subject was sensitive, we negotiated at length, but the result is there. Together, we have succeeded in meeting this challenge: tomorrow, employees will be better protected, because we have included the fumes from diesel engines and we have set an exposure limit that will protect employees. The protection of workers must be strengthened even more. Science and technology are constantly evolving. We have undertaken a third revision of the directive, with the will to be completed before the end of the legislature. But beyond that, I again plead here in this Chamber for the next Commission to continue the work with the constant addition of substances to be controlled. We need a permanent review of this directive. Europe cannot stop in such a good way. The health of many workers depends on it. In this report, I also wanted to give back to the social partners the fundamental role that is theirs. To encourage stakeholders on the ground to be proactive, the Commission will publish the agreements on the OSHA Occupational Health and Safety Agency website. This is an opportunity for the social partners: to establish a real culture of prevention within companies, ahead of the legislative measures. I note with satisfaction that in October the chemical industry and the European trade unions, in a joint statement, asked the Commission to include toxic substances for reproduction in this directive. This demonstrates the willingness of the actors to move forward. As you will have understood, ladies and gentlemen, all these measures are not only essential to safeguard the health of employees wherever they are in Europe, but they are also beneficial for companies that care about those who make them work every day. By supporting this text tomorrow, it is the health of millions of workers that you will protect. By voting tomorrow, you're going to save thousands of lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, dear Members of Parliament, ever since the beginning of this mandate, the Commission and myself have given the highest attention to sound health and safety at the workplace, with clear rules that are enforceable and applied on the ground.

If, in the European Union, cancer is the leading cause of work-related deaths and around 90-100 000 people die each year in Europe, then taking further decisive action to prevent exposure to carcinogens and mutagers in the workplace becomes an urgent necessity. It is estimated that if we prudently and rationally set limits on exposure to carcinogens and mutagers at work, if we assess the risk properly scientifically and take optimal action, we can save up to 100,000 workers over the next 50 years. So there is something to fight for. The report rightly bends over to the protection of workers exposed in the workplace to reprotoxic substances, i.e. harmful to the reproduction of women and men, to which more than 1% of all european Union workers are exposed.

One figure, just one: every hour in Europe, between 7 and 12 people die of cancer due to exposure to toxic substances in the workplace. From now on, eight new substances will be included in the law, and one that is not the least: diesel fumes. Everyone agrees to end diesel. Cities, states, many consumers want to get rid of it.

Exposure to pesticides is very real and, it seems, too often left out, perhaps because there are fewer and fewer farmers and rurality is often left out.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I remember very well how we launched this food basic regulation at the time. There have been difficulties with our food, more and more food scandals. And we needed something that would give us and our citizens more security. That is why we have set up the European Food Safety Authority. The work of this authority has been very successful. Our food in the European Union is considered to be the safest in the world. However, EFSA has not yet had to comply with the same transparency rules as other agencies, such as the Agency for Medical Devices or the Chemicals Agency. The Commission has proposed, driven by the European Citizens' Initiative against glyphosate, to change this now and to harmonise these rules. What the Commission ultimately proposed, however, was not approximation, but was much, much stricter rules for EFSA than the other agencies have. (The President interrupted because of a lack of English interpretation) However, the Commission has now proposed new rules for the European Food Safety Authority, which go much further than the transparency rules that the other agencies must comply with. The other agencies publish the applications submitted and the studies on which they are based, at the moment when they publish their opinion on the application. EFSA is now supposed to do things very differently, according to the Commission. It is intended to publish the application and the underlying studies directly at the beginning of the process, when the application has been submitted. When I read this, I thought: is the Commission so naive, or is it wanted? Does this have something to do with election campaigns? We have all been in pre-election mode for months, and the Commissioner seems to me to be in the pre-election campaign as well. Surely we cannot force an applicant to present his application, his new idea, his innovation to the world public via EFSA's website. It is not acceptable for an applicant to be indirectly forced to make his/her documents available publicly on the internet worldwide by submitting an application for authorisation of his new innovative product to EFSA. This encourages piracy of ideas! EFSA's authorisation procedures take a very, very long time, up to 55 months. After all, everyone in the world – competitors in third countries – has the good opportunity to check EFSA's homepage every day to see what new innovations are in Europe, copy-paste, and they are already starting to copy this product while the authorisation process is still in progress in Europe. And the third-country competitor has the opportunity to bring a product that it has stolen to the world market, and can probably offer it much cheaper than the European could ever. The European product is dead, and the European producer is lagting behind. That's wrong! That is why I am suggesting something quite different that brings at least as much transparency. I do not understand why the Commission does not think that this should be supported. I propose a three-stage procedure. First of all, EFSA examines the application and the underlying studies, then publishes the draft of its scientific opinion and at the same time the application information and the underlying studies. And then the second stage begins: a consultation phase in which the public, the interested public, the application and the underlying studies can put the matter through their paces. We can talk about the duration of the consultation period, there is no question about that. However, it is only after this consultation phase that EFSA, as I propose, should publish its final opinion and then be able to take into account the outcome of this public consultation. I think that is the right procedure. EFSA is already doing this on its own, and why should we not make this system compulsory? I would like to point out that, for example, in the case of acrylamide, EFSA has once again amended its final opinion after such a public consultation. So that is possible, and it has even an advantage for the public: you already have EFSA's assessment of this request and the underlying studies as a means of dealing with it. I therefore ask for my request to support my request. One final word: if the Commission proposal gets through, we will have much, much less transparency than we have today. In that case, no applicant will apply for authorisation of his product in Europe. Then if the manufacturers go directly abroad with their innovations, and then we will no longer have access to the application documents. That is not what we want! So, I ask for your support for my proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you very much indeed for the opportunity to speak on this important proposal. Whenever we talk about our health and that of our children, people are absolutely right to ask for the highest standards of transparency and scrutiny. In recent years, European citizens have expressed such a clear demand for more transparency in the way that risk assessments are conducted, and I have been listening carefully to them and have been active on this issue since the beginning of my term of office. Some of you in this House have expressed the same legitimate demand. In fact, when the European Parliament voted its resolution on glyphosate one year ago, it stressed the following: that the European Union’s authorisation procedure, including the scientific evaluation of substances, should be based only on published studies. The European Citizens’ Initiative in relation to glyphosate also asked the Commission to base its decision on published studies, and the findings of the recent ‘fitness check’ on the General Food Law Regulation confirmed this priority. Today’s debate is a significant stepping stone on the way to meeting these expectations and to showing that the EU can deliver on our demands, on your demands and on citizens’ demands. Allow me to draw your attention to the main features of the Commission’s ambitious proposal. I would like to explain briefly how we have pursued the objectives of reinforcing transparency and trust. I believe it is through greater transparency that we will increase citizens’ confidence in the risk assessment system. The new legislation will thus contribute to increasing the legitimacy of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and of the Commission’s decisions when it accepts or rejects requests for approval. With this goal in mind, the Commission has proposed proactive public disclosure of all safety—related data – let me repeat, safety—related data – supporting applications for authorisation, and we have proposed that this be done early in the risk assessment process. Early disclosure is essential to ensure maximum transparency and public scrutiny in an effective way, while maintaining a timely and effective risk management process. Of course, transparency can also help us to avoid potential bias in science. It is crucial to restore trust in the EU’s evidence—based food safety system and trust in science. Let me insist on one important point. Postponing transparency until the opinion is published would, as we know from practice today, risk feeding suspicion and controversies. It would not permit a real scientific debate between different views, but would lead to more political controversies – and we have had too many of those recently. As long as the principle of early disclosure is retained, however, its exact timing could be the subject of further consideration. For example, it could coincide with the moment the underlying application is found admissible. This disclosure of studies is also closely linked with two other measures in our proposal: first, the public consultation of submitted studies; and, second, the disclosure of the relevant information in the Union register of commissioned studies. These measures will ensure that EFSA has at its disposal the broadest relevant scientific evidence possible before it drafts its scientific opinion. And, of course, any rights stemming from the Access to Documents Regulation and the Aarhus Convention remain intact and will continue to apply. At the same time, I am aware of concerns in relation to the protection of innovation, but I want to reassure you that, when we prepared this proposal, we also had in mind the need to maintain the European Union’s high food safety standards together with the competitiveness of the EU food and feed sector. There is no controversy as between food safety standards and competitiveness, and that is why the proposal sets out safeguards for the protection of justifiable, confidential information. It includes a closed positive list of items that may be claimed as confidential. Confidentiality can be claimed if the applicant can prove that public disclosure of such information would significantly harm its competitive position. At the same time, the proposal respects existing intellectual property rights, data exclusivity rights and rules on the protection of personal data. These are recognised as key to stimulating innovation, and for the worldwide recognition of EU product safety. Furthermore, to assist applicants – most importantly, small and medium-sized enterprises – we have introduced the possibility of EFSA providing pre—submission advice. This advice will facilitate a better understanding of the application process and will make life easier for innovators in Europe. Finally, the proposal also provides for the possibility of commissioning additional studies for verification purposes. This may be done in exceptional circumstances, for example in the event of public controversy or scientific divergence about a product. Further to the provisions on transparency, and to ensure the long—term sustainability of EFSA’s high level of independent expertise, it is proposed that Member States will be represented on the EFSA Management Board. Similarly, and without jeopardising EFSA’s independence, there is provision for more active involvement by Member States in ensuring the presence of experts on EFSA’s scientific panels. It has also been recognised that there is a need to improve on our communication of risk. It is important that strong, clear messaging on risks is available to our citizens. To this end, the proposal lays the foundations for a comprehensive and effective risk-communication strategy to ensure that, whether the message comes from the Commission, EFSA or Member States, it will be clear, comprehensive and consistent. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are all responsible for maintaining and reinforcing an EU food safety system based on scientific assessments. Transparency and risk assessment are therefore a shared duty for all of us. With this proposal, we are, more than ever, playing our part. I would like to thank all those involved, including the rapporteur, Ms Sommer, and the shadow rapporteur as well as the rapporteurs for opinion, for their active commitment so far – and, I hope, for their continued engagement and dedication in advancing with the Commission proposal and defending transparency. Who can be against transparency in science? No one.

However, I sincerely believe that there has been a lack of political ambition to make an in-depth reform of the Regulation and to update the tasks of EFSA which, after almost twenty years, is overloaded with tasks that depart from what is strictly food security. As regards EFSA transparency, it should be approved to other Union agencies such as ema and ECHA, i.e. information on basic applications and studies should be published at the time their scientific opinion is made public.  I agree that we must strengthen the transparency of the Agency, but without ideological tints and without conditions the innovation capacity of applicants.  Finally, this regulation in force established the early warning system, but despite being revised in 2011, we continue to have no harmonised procedure for action by all Member States and without strengthening the Commission's powers in the management of alerts.

Our current authorization system is based on the applicant's obligation to prove the safety of their product. In the past, however, this may have led to some firms being able to buy favorable studies or, conversely, to conceal adverse results. We can now prevent these practices by providing independent scientists and the public with timely access to complete information.

It is a little crowning achievement of much that the European Union has actually come to achieve. If we only back down for a few decades, you were advised if you as a Swede were to travel in Europe to \"Beware of the eggs, beware of the chicken!\" because the risk was that you would suffer from salmonella of such an aggressive nature that death was perhaps imminent. I don't think we've ever had such a high level of food safety, food standards, food research and everything related to food and our health that we have today. We should respect and respect that because it probably saves the lives of many people across the European Union every year and ensures that we have better health than we would otherwise have had. At the same time, there is a fairly clear hunt for food, food producers and food producers across the chain. What makes me somewhat nervous is that the Commission is listening a little too much to a number of opponents who are quite few. We have all been able to follow the heated debate about glyphosate in here. No scientific evidence that we have mishandled glyphosate in the European Union has been presented. Yet we have a committee that is acting on this particular issue in the European Parliament, and it is the issue of glyphosate that has raised this whole legislation. As our colleague from the ECR said, this is legislation that concerns tens of thousands of people working in food, food quality and food. I believe that we need to ensure that we have a balance and it is clear that we should listen to the citizens when they come up with demands for greater transparency. However, it is a matter of finding where the balance is going and I feel that Parliament is in danger of going too far in this. I was quite attracted to a proposal circulating in the Council at the moment on a proposal from the Austrian Presidency. I think it strikes a better balance than the Commission. We tried to get it right with the Socialist Group, but unfortunately they backed away from this compromise. This means that we at ALDE will support the rapporteur's proposals on this. We believe that, in the run-up to the forthcoming negotiations, where I think the Commission has gone too far and fallen in the balance, it is important that Parliament weighs this up.

Mr President, the food industry in Europe is bumping from scandal to scandal. Just think of the horsemeat scandal or think of the fipronil scandal in our eggs.  One of the biggest scandals of this century is the re-approval of the highly harmful agricultural poison glyphosate. The Monsanto Papers showed in detail how long the arm of the industry is. Monsanto paid big money to scientists to demonstrate the so-called safety of glyphosate. The European authorities took that for a while those bodies are responsible for monitoring the safety of our food. Concerned citizens no longer picked it up and collected more than one million signatures for the citizens' initiative \"Ban glyphosate!\". Well, ban, the European Commission did not, but it did come up with a proposal to make the whole decision-making process more transparent and independent in the future.  According to the Party for Animals, the only responsible guide is the precautionary principle. Human and animal health and the right to a healthy living environment must always take precedence over the commercial interests of poison producers. Unfortunately, we have to note that the rapporteur does take sides with these producers. Fortunately, the Committee on the Environment and the Special Committee on Pesticides are taking a different line. Like us, they want to prevent industry in Europe from taking decisions. Citizens and independent scientists need to have early access to all the information and, of course, they also need to know who that information comes from.  Tomorrow, Parliament will have the opportunity to show once again that it is not giving in to the power of money, that it is not giving in to the power of industry.

It is not for nothing that there have been a million signatures to question this critically.  Transparency in the current process is not guaranteed; you can just say that. I can understand Mrs Sommer when she is very concerned about the industry. But I am more concerned about the interests of the environment and consumers. I do not believe that they were identified and put on an equal footing in the current legislation. This needs to be corrected. Transparency must prevail from the outset, not only after EFSA has put its proposals on the table. This is very important, and here we stand in contrast to Mrs Sommer, that we do not want to allow access to the public again only afterwards, but from the outset.  It is also important to involve critical scientists in the process of discussion. The result of the whole thing becomes all the more trustworthy afterwards. We must also see that we are putting all the studies in one register, and not just the studies that suit industry. This, too, is important in order to regain confidence.

This is always painted somewhere in the sky when we discuss something like this. No, the current draft law provides sufficient support for both innovation and the protection of intellectual property. That is why we are fighting for this directive to get through. Another: EFSA's panels must be staffed independently. We need to attach even more importance to this.

European citizens are increasingly becoming aware that every aspect of the agri-food chain must be controlled and made transparent, with the possibility of constantly accessing information concerning the product.

The opportunity to obtain information on the preliminary stages of the process and the advantage of being able to contribute to the study of risks will bring a certain benefit to the entire European food sector.

I would like to stress here that we must give EFSA absolutely the necessary tools so that it can play the powerful role that we expect from this authority. This proposal provides answers to these challenges and deserves our support. But at the same time, I recognise that the concern about, among other things, the timing of publication, that these concerns are legitimate, that there must be an answer to that. If we do not want to slow down innovation in the food sector, we must find the right balance and make workable choices.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 107, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Jan HUITEMA", "mepid": "58789", "text": "   – Mr President, consciously or unconsciously, we use potentially dangerous substances in everyday life, for example in our car or in our smartphones.

I believe that the proposal that came out of the Committee on the Environment responds precisely to these needs of consumers with a firm commitment to the protection of human health and the environment.  Risk management, assessment and communication have to respond to the precautionary principle and should be done through a clearly transparent, objective and independent process.

I would like to say that the amendments which allude to the need to go backwards and that the publications of the studies to be taken into account are finally carried out with the opinion, are a setback.

However, I have some concerns with the report that has been tabled for plenary this week, and I think we need to be careful about this vote and ensure that we find a more sensible, pragmatic and balanced approach to tackling this important issue. It is important that we give more careful consideration to what this proposed regulation is requiring of companies in terms of when the publication of information and underlying studies in relation to applications is due. In the text tabled by the committee, and indeed in the Commission proposal, food companies would need to inform EFSA immediately of the subject matter of studies commissioned. I feel we need to be careful here, and consider further the impact this immediate notification could have on innovation in the food sector.

Maintaining the competitiveness of our EU food industry is extremely important for workers, farmers and citizens alike, and so we should ensure balance in imposing such an obligation.

It is important that they know what meat they are eating, but it is also important that they know what pesticides are used in their food, and we will have a much better opportunity to do so with this regulation.

This is also evident in the development of plant protection products and food products. People want to know what's on their plate and rightly so. They know on the basis of what considerations we take decisions that directly concern them in their daily lives. That is precisely why I think it is very good that the European Commission has come forward with a proposal on transparency in the European risk assessment in the food chain. I do not need to remind you of the many citizens' initiatives concerning, for example, the lack of plant protection products in order to illustrate this deep concern among citizens on this subject. Then we must listen to these concerns. I think that's self-evident.  As policy makers, we have more than one responsibility alone. Although full disclosure is desirable in some cases, there are also certain procedures in which total transparency can undoubtedly also involve risks. And this is one of them. Because, ladies and gentlemen, let's not fool each other. In the global industry there are always hijackers on the coast. Competitors are lurking and information is more power than ever. So if we want to support our own European companies and safeguard the jobs they provide, then imposing an obligation on them to immediately disclose all the secrets is the last thing I think we should do.

I heard a lot of support for the proposal today, and I am reassured by the fact that Parliament believes transparency is crucial in terms of Europeans’ trust in our work to protect them. I thank the many Members who have raised the issues of transparency, science and so on, especially Mr Andrieu and the members of the Special Committee on the Union’s authorisation procedure for pesticides (PEST). This proposal is for a targeted revision of the General Food Law. It is a targeted revision, which means that we are focusing just on ways of addressing transparency issues, because they are the main problem. As you know, the General Food Law was introduced in 2002, and now, after the fitness check, we know that it is fit for purpose. The targeted revision is designed to provide an ambitious response to calls for more transparency in the risk assessment process in the food chain.  Therefore, once again, allow me to emphasise that public disclosure of studies supporting applications for authorisation at an early stage is important, in order to increase citizens’ confidence in the risk assessment system, and also to restore trust in science and to avoid bias in science. Two weeks ago we had debates with presidents of industry and we explained once again that our proposal is a balanced one. Industry needs to postpone disclosure, but that is not the right answer in this situation. I am convinced that, on the basis of the positions expressed here, a good compromise can be reached on this issue. Please be assured that the proposal, while strengthening transparency, includes enough safeguards for business to enable innovation in Europe to continue. I would further mention, once again, that duly justified confidential information will remain protected, and there is no interference with existing intellectual property rights or other rights. That is crystal clear. In any event, enhanced transparency will contribute to strengthening a climate of consumer trust, which is beneficial for stimulating innovation – and I would emphasise that. The Union’s product safety system is recognised worldwide. Please compare the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) system: the openness of the data is much broader than what we have in Europe today. And what about companies in the United States? They are not complaining about that. So, let’s see how we can improve transparency, while not putting innovation at risk. On Ms Schreijer—Pierick’s question about impact assessment, as explained in the roadmap and the explanatory memorandum to the proposal, no initial impact assessment was carried out. The measures proposed focus on transparency and the way that the Commission and EFSA will gather and manage the evidence needed to perform their tasks on the basis of unchanged criteria. Secondly, duly justified confidential information is protected in addition to any existing intellectual property rights and data exclusivity rights. Therefore, incentives for innovation remain largely unchanged. Thirdly, the proposed measures have a particular impact on EFSA, which is publicly financed.  As to questions related to the possibility of equipping EFSA with more financial instruments, as you know, we are proposing in our new Multiannual Financial Framework to provide an additional EUR 62.5 million every year so that EFSA can recruit 106 additional workers and address the issues related to capacity problems. The proposal also addresses the long—term sustainability of the risk assessment process, and that of EFSA, in particular. EFSA’s role is, and will remain, crucial – actually as much as that of the Member States – in achieving a high level of protection of public health for European citizens.  Honourable Members, I thank you once again for your active engagement on this issue and I look forward to working closely together towards a strengthened climate of consumer trust in the food chain, and to seeing how we can move forward, starting with our debates in the months to come, with the Council, Parliament and the Commission together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 129, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Rapporteur.

You have done a bad job and, at the same time, I am incredibly annoyed by the way in all these months you are calling Parliament, driving wedges into the political groups, driving between groups and trying to get your proposal through. Let me be elected to Parliament if you want to become a legislator! You are not the legislator, you are the Commissioner. I would like to draw your attention to this. It is not right that you are lobbying in this way.  I would like to say a word to the left of this Parliament – S&amp;D, the Greens and the GUE: I find it outrageous to accuse the PPE-DE and the other groups, which are in favour of a moderate proposal that protects innovation and, at the same time, brings the public to the public, which he might want, to stand up against consumer protection and only for industrial interests. This is an aberration, an outrage.  Industry – I mean the manufacturers, yes, not the big bad industry; But, in your eyes, industry is always evil - industry - the manufacturers - that is also part of our society. They provide jobs that we urgently need. Incidentally, the food sector is one of the largest in the European Union. It provides millions of jobs, and all these workers are also consumers. Perhaps one should also think of their interests when there is a risk that companies will move their research and perhaps ultimately their production abroad.  And no, it's not always about glyphosate. The glyphosate debate was the reason for this story. But it is not acceptable for the whole food sector to be punished for this glyphosate debate and to be overlaid with rules that threaten existence.

Oddly enough, there is no Representative of the Council here, the institution to which this debate and the report are actually addressed, despite the promise made in July to the LIBE committee by ministers from the Austrian Government that this will be on the Council's agenda during this half-year. Obviously, the Council has nothing to answer for its position. In fact, the truth is that for seven years the European Council has been in breach of European rules, not deciding on the membership of Bulgaria and Romania in Schengen. And all sorts of reasons have been highlighted since 2011. Including, here in this chamber, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Rutte, a few months ago said that \"a deal is a deal\" and must be done by everyone. Only you messed up the deal, the agreement. He tried to mix the Schengen criteria with the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification in the Field of Justice, and this is unfair to Bulgaria and Romania. However, the purpose of this report is not simply to once again call for the membership of the two countries in Schengen, as the criteria, all criteria, are clearly met. This is the assessment of the experts of both the Member States and the European Commission. It is about the fact that in recent years, especially this year, a new idea or compromise, as they say, for a \"new type\" of partial membership of Schengen. It is proposed that Bulgaria and Romania be accepted only by air and sea, postponing indefinitely the membership of the Schengen countries and free travel at land borders, which is contrary to both all the basic rules of the European Union and common sense. This idea seeks support and quite conjuncturally finds it. However, I would like to point out several main reasons why it is a dangerous precedent that should not be allowed. First, it will postpone once again indefinitely the release, lifting of controls at land borders. Secondly, the phased entry guarantees more economic losses and lost profits, both for Bulgaria, for its citizens, for the companies that export, as well as for European companies and European countries that import goods to Bulgaria and will have to waste a lot of time, and will cost the final product. Third, it will set the double standard in Schengen. I would like to stress that the Schengen legislation is not designed to function with two categories of countries – countries that are full members and those with only one foot inside.  I would therefore like to call on Parliament to support this report and to give a very clear vision and position to the European Parliament. It's been seven years since all the criteria have been met.

This will be an important step towards a better and more harmonised protection of the Schengen external borders.  Bulgaria and Romania joining Schengen in full will not only enlarge the area of free movement, but at the same time make the Schengen tools more performant and increase security.

Already in 2011 this Parliament approved the entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen Area, advocating the immediate abolition of internal border controls with these two countries. I had the honour of being Parliament's rapporteur on this issue 7 years ago and also this year, through the annual report on the state of Schengen, I advocated the full and immediate accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area. Today, with this report by Mr Stanishev, which I take to congratulate him on his excellent work, I maintain the same position. It is important to remember that all the requirements are met and only because unanimity is required in the Council, or the political opinion of some Member States, Romanians and Bulgarians are still treated as second-rate European citizens.  At a time when several Member States have imposed illegal controls at internal borders, as this Parliament has already denounced, and when the assessments reveal worrying flaws in the protection of their borders, it is difficult to understand the reticence towards Bulgaria and Romania.  And for those who invoke the issue of corruption and the problems that still persist in these two countries, let us be clear: corruption is not a criterion for schengen membership, but if we want it to be, then it should be for all Member States, indistinctly. We can't have evaluation criteria that are just for some and not for everyone. It is true that the Romanian Government has alarmingly destroyed the advances made in recent years in the fight against corruption and this cannot fail to merit our firm condemnation, but I have no doubt that Bulgaria and Romania must now enter Schengen and should be able to benefit from the area of free movement as European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Emilian PAVEL", "mepid": "129256", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sergei Stanishev, for this report.

The decision not to have Bulgaria and Romania in Schengen is purely political. All technical criteria are met, all requirements are made, but the suspension of Bulgaria and Romania is due to internal problems in countries such as the Netherlands, countries such as Germany, countries like Austria, and this is wrong, unfair, two-faced and hypocritical. Such decisions, dear, reinforce scepticism in Eastern Europe regarding the European Union, because this political decision has its economic dimensions, because perhaps the most European economic activity in Bulgaria and Romania is transport, forwarding. More than 150,000 families in Bulgaria are supported and live by transport. And today from Romania, from Bucharest to Ruse 70 km you travel 12–13 hours. And today from Blagoevgrad to Thessaloniki, where there are 200 km, you travel much more time. This hinders economic activity, destroys the efforts of these people and makes them poor, and causes them to emigrate.

Seven years later, the Council's inaction requires us to look again. I have repeatedly stressed and will reiterate today that effective border security for the whole European Union cannot be achieved in full without full access by Bulgaria and Romania to all information systems. Granting only partial access to both parties because they are not members of Schengen leads to vulnerability of our border systems. The issue of the costs to the European economy that internal borders generate has been repeatedly raised. Imports and exports to both countries have been severely affected by the waiting time at internal border crossing points. The impact on transport operations to and from some of the largest maritime ports in southern Europe is negative. I'm a convinced European. The majority of Bulgarian and Romanian citizens support the values and ideas of the Union. We are for the strict application of the Common European Law. Its violation for so many years opens up big questions about the European Union's capacity for self-regulation and its sustainability. That is why I thank you, all the colleagues in the European Parliament, who have not for a moment wavered about compliance and taken the right position.

The successful fulfilment of the criteria was confirmed by the Council on 9 June 2011, when the Council stated that Bulgaria and Romania had fulfilled the conditions in all areas. Seven years ago, the criteria were met by Bulgaria and Romania, but for seven years now the entry of the two countries into Schengen has not happened. Some Member States oppose, arguing that they are not in the criteria they have written in advance. Member States that are opposed to Bulgaria and Romania's entry into the Schengen area grossly violate the rules that they themselves have adopted and voted on. This is a drastic and extremely bad example of the application of double standards. Double standards for food, double standards for Schengen.

What we are facing is a shame. The Council is absent because they have nothing to say. What can they say? We  are violating European legislation and the rules. That’s what they should say. In reality, the situation is the following: we are discussing today the destiny and life of 30 million European citizens. Each time a Bulgarian or Romanian citizen comes to the Schengen border, they feel personally that they are being treated like second—class citizens of the European Union. That’s it. It’s very modern today to express concerns about the lack of trust in the European Union. It comes from a very simple thing. Words have been devalued by actions or inaction. When there is a huge gap between what we say and what the Council should do, and what is being done or not done, this is a major source of disappointment for the citizens. This is why I think the best thing that the Parliament can do tomorrow is to send a very powerful message, with a big majority, to the Council: do your duty and fulfil your obligations. The countries have done their homework. You should accept Bulgaria and Romania at all Schengen borders. Otherwise, they will be irrelevant.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to welcome the role played by the decentralised agencies of the European Union. Spread throughout Europe, they are an expression of the polycentrism of the European project and the european Union's desire to be close to its citizens by truly anchoring itself in the territories. These agencies, which are often unknown to the general public, are nevertheless essential to the proper functioning of the European institutions. They are the right-hand man, providing them with technical expertise on a wide range of subjects. And in the social sphere too, agencies are involved, often behind the scenes, in the construction and implementation of European policies. Tonight we are talking specifically about three linchpins committed to building a social Europe, following the momentum initiated by the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and very widely relayed and materialised by the commitment of Commissioner Thyssen, which I would like to welcome. These three agencies are the Eurofound agency, working on living and working conditions, the EU-OSHA agency, which focuses on the health and safety of workers, and the agency Cedefop for the development of vocational training.  In order for these three agencies to keep pace with the reforms initiated, it was essential to be able to provide them with a framework and tools adapted to new challenges. I welcome this in the sense that we have been able to achieve this with my colleagues in charge of OSHA and Eurofound, whom I would really like to welcome and thank, both my fellow rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, because we have really worked together, with the Council and the Austrian Presidency as well, to reform the founding regulations of these agencies. As rapporteur for the regulation on the European Centre for Vocational Training, Cedefop, my priority was to lay a sound and solid foundation for the effective functioning of the agency, without affecting its DNA, namely its tripartite governance structure placing employees, employers and states on an equal footing. In this reform, we have achieved a more transparent and closer functioning of the citizen. The proposed new rules reinforce the role given to the European Parliament. In concrete terms, our institution, the voice of more than 500 million European citizens, will now be represented by an expert on the agency's board of directors. MEPs will also meet the candidate for director. In order for the Cedefop to move to a higher gear and work better, we have also strengthened the role of the director. Finally, the new regulations set requirements to better respect the gender balance within the agency. What impact will these new rules have on citizens? The Cedefop will be able to function better and thus work better on vocational training. The challenge for our citizens is more skills, because that is what we have to aim for, of course. Unemployment, and in particular that of young people, is still extremely high and the challenge for the European Union in the coming years will be to ensure that our citizens have the skills to face the new digital challenges or the energy transition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Czesław HOC", "mepid": "135540", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Dear colleagues, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. Today's economy is already – or should be – a knowledge-based economy in which human capital is the most valuable and valuable resource of any business. After all, it is human capital that determines the survival and development of every business. Therefore, the future and current employee should be trained and educated. Then offer him an attractive job offer, in which he will work in safe, health-promoting and productive conditions. Moreover, the worker must be convinced that at all times the relevant institutions ensure the quality of work and the continuous improvement of his living and working conditions. And it is important that this process is rewarding and generate tangible benefits for the worker, the employer and the governments of the Countries of the European Union. Hence today's debate on improving and adapting to the new economic, social and even political realities and conditions of the three European institutions, namely the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound).  At this point, I would like to sincerely thank my fellow rapporteurs on the package of regulations on EU-OSHA, Cedefop and Eurofound: Annie Sander and Enrique Calvet Chambon. It was a very good and very friendly cooperation lasting almost two years. We have held eight triathly, a very large number of shadow rapporteurs and technical meetings with advisers from the Council and the Commission, as well as with the services. I would like to express my separate thanks to the Representatives of the Council and the European Commission for constructive and substantive discussions and common-sense compromises.  In order to better organise the discussions, the Council Presidencies decided to address the proposals for three tripartite agencies in the package, which was the main focus of the Social Questions Working Group.  Interinstitutional negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission began in spring 2018. An agreement on Cedefopu and EU-OSHA was reached at the seventh trilogue meeting on 16 October. On Eurofound, an agreement was reached on 9 November.  The revision of the three regulations has created an opportunity to provide anti-fraud measures, a conflict of interest policy and the conclusion of a headquarters agreement. Ex-post and ex-ante evaluations, which are the main principles of proper budgetary control, have also been introduced into the Regulations. The revision also harmonises the programming and reporting provisions with the requirements set out in the revised Financial Framework Regulation. The terminology on governance structure is currently in line with the 2012 Joint Project on Decentralised Agencies. As regards EU-OSHA, the provisions of the new Regulation, compared to the Regulation establishing the Agency in 1994, clearly define the role of the Agencies in providing the Union institutions and bodies and the Member States and social partners with objective technical, scientific and economic information as well as the expertise they need to formulate and implement policies to protect the health and safety of workers. As proposed by Parliament, the key point of the EU-OSHA negotiating agreement was the presence of a Representative of the European Parliament on the EU-OSHA Management Board. The role of executive director has also been clarified. In addition, the candidate will have to appear before the relevant parliamentary committee, i.e. the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL).  The European Parliament's team, working together in accordance, has achieved success in the trilogue negotiations by introducing the amendments we have proposed.

Elle a été une personne clé pour le bon av'nement de cette nouvelle loi qui va régir les agences européennes, dont celle pour laquelle j'étais rapporteur. Maintenant, Madame, souffrez que je passe' la langue de Cervants dans cette pléni're du Parlement européen.  It wasn't all pink and we had to go back some difficulties, which explains that it took a year and a half to negotiate and that it took a lot of time. Well, it was worth it, because if we take into account that Eurofound's fundamental mandate dates back to 1975 — if I remember correctly — we have been doing a job that we hope will last at least twenty, thirty or forty years, like the previous one. You had to take it seriously. Some feathers had to be left from Parliament or from this presentation. The most painful, perhaps, was not being able to rationalize, not so much economically as administratively and logically, the Executive Committee, which ends up having, I know, ninety people, that is, more than twice as much as the entire International Labour Organization. This is not only sad — I start with the only sad thing — because it is a little ridiculous that there are, for a hundred-and-a-half-year-long agency, some ninety representatives on the Executive Committee, but because it gives away that mania towards the renationalisation that we are experiencing at this European moment. We would have been able to reduce the Executive Committee perfectly, seeing that it was a European agency and that all the Member States did not need to be there all the time. And so, respecting the tripartite, we could have done it. It couldn't be done.  But a lot of good things have been done, and it is time to congratulate my two colleagues, who have already flattered me with their words, Mrs Sander and Mr Hoc. It is time to thank the Commission and the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies — because we started with the Bulgarian Presidency - for all the efforts they have made to ensure that this important Agency once again has a continuity — because it was already working well — and is even more productive and operational going forward. It is very important this Agency — the others too, I am just talking about mine. Why? Because it is this Agency that nourishes us with reason, knowledge, the empirical basis which makes it maintain a characteristic of the European legislative aspect: that it is not done on feelings, it is not done about visceralities, it is done about reason and the exact knowledge of problems, a good way to combat fake news. This Agency has an obligation, first of all, to nurture the European institutions and, secondly, to help Member States, social actors and even international institutions to know the most accurate possible truth of the problem we are going to address, in order to legislate on it. It is an indispensable element of the way in which all the actors involved act in Europe act. It had to be renewed, because obviously some things had become obsolete; other things were adapted to the pretechnological era, from employment contracts to many other aspects. But by renewing it we have also contributed what I understand will allow it to better fulfill its function in a more agile way. For example, an important professionalization with the strengthening – as has been said here – of the EXECUTIVE Director, his ability to appoint an deputy director, something that social agents asked us to respect the creative spirit of Eurofound, but professionalizing the relationship between them and professionalizing all that is acting. We have also strengthened — and this is very important — Parliament's presence through a link that will be present, without a vote, in the Executive Committee and also through more information on its development. Of course, we have addressed a thousand technical details to make everything more operational, to make it more economically efficient and, of course, I think Europe can be satisfied to have a single instrument to better make its laws better. And I only ask this Parliament one thing specifically: let us use it much more. Long before we think of other agencies — it is a European agency — Europe now has an excellent tool for at least – hopefully – the next twenty years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 167, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I thank Parliament for organising this joint debate on the revised founding regulations for the three EU agencies, namely the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in Thessaloniki, the European Agency for Safety and Health at work (EU-OSHA) based in Bilbao, and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) based in Dublin. Through their EU-wide service, analysis, collection and dissemination of good practices, these agencies have provided us, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States with important data to inform our policy-making in the areas of labour and social policy. They have also developed tools to help with policy implementation. Cedefop and Eurofound are two of the oldest agencies of the European Union, as the rapporteurs rightly said. They were created in 1975. EU—OSHA is their younger sister, we could say: it was created in 1994. The world of work has changed significantly since the establishment of these agencies and that is why the time was right to update the regulations so as to reflect better the current economic and social context. We also needed to align the three regulations, as much as possible, with the common approach on these centralised agencies, which was endorsed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission in July 2012. We are bringing them to you as a package: three revised regulations for the three tripartite agencies serving governmental actors, representatives of workers and employers. I would like to pay tribute to the three rapporteurs who worked on their own and as a team on these revisions – Anne Sander for Cedefop, Czesław Hoc for EU-OSHA, and Enrique Calvet Chambon for Eurofound. Their clear understanding of the challenges faced by the agencies, their determination and their spirit of compromise made it possible to reach a balanced agreement with the Council on our proposals. Let me give you an overview of the main changes that the new founding regulations will introduce. I will start with two important points for Parliament. For the first time, an independent expert appointed by the European Parliament will become a member of the management board of each agency. This will allow Parliament to follow the work of the agencies more effectively, and Parliament will also have an exchange of views with the candidate for the post of director before his/her appointment. Secondly, more emphasis is being placed on cooperation between the agencies when it comes to horizontal administrative tasks, promoting synergies and complementarity in their activities, while avoiding duplication of effort. Thirdly, the new founding regulations define more clearly the tasks of the management board (currently called ‘governing board’), the executive board (currently called ‘bureau’) and the executive director. Next, the management board of each agency, and not the Commission, will now be appointing the executive director. Finally, other rules in terms of programming, budget, staff and evaluation have been aligned with the common approach. Complete alignment was not always possible, and here I would recall the Commission’s Declaration on all those elements that depart from the common approach. The new founding regulations also maintain what currently works well, such as the tripartite composition of the management and executive boards. Having been a member of the management board of Eurofound a long time ago, I can attest that the tripartite composition provides added value. For me, it is a key feature of the agencies. Let me now give you examples of the provisions introduced for specific agencies, first Eurofound. It has tripartite advisory committees, which evaluate and follow up on Eurofound’s projects, and these committees are now explicitly mentioned in the founding regulation, which was not the case under the current regulation. There will also be a clear role for the Eurofound Director in appointing his/her deputy. This should benefit the functioning of the agency. For EU-OSHA, I welcome the fact that the regulation now clearly mentions that the agency will pay particular attention to the specific challenges of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, when it comes to health and safety at work, and the new text also recognises health as covering both physical and mental health. Lastly, Cedefop’s founding regulation will now cover education in general and vocational education and training (VET) in particular, in accordance with Articles 165 and 166 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This reflects the enlarged scope of Cedefop’s activities, as they have evolved over the years. The agencies need these changes in order to be able to continue providing high-quality outputs in a changing economic and social environment. Therefore, I am counting on the House to adopt the new founding regulations with a large majority. I thank you very much for all your work. Commission Statement (in writing) The Commission regrets that the co-legislators have decided to deviate on several points from the Common Approach of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012, without providing the necessary justification. The deletion of the sunset/review clause is not in line with the Common Approach. However, the absence of the sunset clause in the Founding Regulations will not affect in any way the Commission’s right of initiative. The Commission also regrets the deviation from the Common Approach with regard to the process for conducting an overall evaluation of the Agency referring to the need to consult stakeholders, including Members of Parliament and of the Management Board, during the evaluation of the work of agencies. The Commission recalls that such evaluations have to be conducted in full independence. In carrying out evaluations, the Commission will apply its usual practices for stakeholder consultation activities. The Commission will assess the impact of the deviations from the Common Approach on the functioning of the tripartite agencies at the appropriate opportunity. They should not be considered as a precedent for other agencies. Finally, the Commission regrets the re-introduction of the function of Deputy Director in the Founding Regulation of Eurofound. The Commission would like to recall that, given the size of this Agency, this provision is disproportionate. The Commission would also like to stress that it is now the Executive Director’s responsibility to decide on the internal structures of each Agency and for CEDEFOP to define the necessary deputising arrangements to ensure continuity of service.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 168, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Jens GEIER", "mepid": "96833", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

This will maximise the potential of the agencies, especially in supporting Member States and the EU in developing relevant policies. This should allow for a more efficient response to current challenges. As shadow rapporteur of the Eurofound Regulation, we managed to strengthen the role of Parliament. Parliament will have the power to nominate an independent expert to the management board and a right to a discussion with the nominee for the Executive Director. This will increase transparency and lead to better coordination with EU policymakers. Provisions on conflicts of interest or against fraud will also increase the transparency and credibility of the agency.  I welcome the emphasis on comparative studies, as I believe that these studies are particularly useful and encourage Member States to share better practices. I believe that the new regulations will allow for the more efficient and transparent performance of the agencies.

I would also like to thank the other rapporteurs for all the work that has been done together with the shadows.  Although vocational education and training plays a vital economic and social role in Europe, leading to equal opportunities and social inclusion for all citizens, it is still not sufficiently developed in our Union. Vocational training (VT) systems need much more support and require more focus from all Member States. This is why agencies like the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training are so important. Cedefop’s role is to contribute to the shaping and implementing of VT, but also to shaping skills and qualification policies at Union level. The agency can do this by providing crucial evidence and services for policymaking and knowledge sharing among the Union and national actors, in particular to governments and social partners.  I believe that the revision of the function of this tripartite agency has been a very good one, and I fully appreciate the agency’s great work in supporting and developing inclusive and quality VT systems.

After this, and as I have argued from the outset, I reiterate that these three European Union agencies – EU-OSHA, Eurofound and Cedefop – are necessary. They are to know with data the reality of what happens in the nothing small world of work; they are necessary to make effective policies, to find the points to improve and the problems to be solved and are necessary because they are also the example of the importance of social dialogue and how to articulate in a tripartite way. Because of this importance, we cannot forget that, in order to carry out their work efficiently, these agencies must be equipped with sufficient economic and staff resources and stability, without any doubt, in such changing contexts. In the case of EU-OSHA, I would like to remind you before that, since the beginning of the crisis, we have seen workplace accidents gradually increase. The main reasons are the cuts in public policy and the lack of investment in many companies, which have overlooked the work they have to do in this area. With regard to prevention programmes, that is precisely where the cuts have been most noticeable. And, on the other hand, there are also labour regulation reforms, such as the one that occurred in Spain, which weaken collective bargaining and the possibility of creating new prevention plans and measures to improve occupational health and safety. The attack on working conditions, the normalization of temporary work, subcontractors, deregulations, etc., are not exactly what we want to promote. EU-OSHA itself recalls that an investment of a euro in occupational safety and health has a return of 2.2 euros in profits. But this is not the most important thing, because there is no economic interest above the health and safety of workers. And this cannot be measured in terms of cost and profit.

The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) is one of the oldest. It was established in 1975, as the Commissioner said, but I think it plays a very important role in identifying the skills and further education that are required, for young people in particular and indeed from a lifelong learning point of view. This is more and more relevant today than ever now because we do not know what jobs will be there tomorrow and what jobs will be needed for us, so we need to continue to develop the skills, training and education required for those courses. In my own country last week, we had a report in our newspapers on access to third level education from schools. League tables were produced. I kind of disagree with it, but I think what our media should be looking at is the schools that actually do help young people to gain relevant training, whether it be an apprenticeship or a further education model, and suitable employment. I think that in itself would be a much better level of success of our schools, rather than how many students they send to third level education.  We have a lot to learn and a long way to go, but I think a reformed Eurofound, and indeed SOLAS in our own country, that provide such support in terms of education and training are very welcome in today’s age.

As we have said, the unemployment rate remains high in the European Union, even though it has decreased, and yet the talent is there and the job offers, at least in some sectors, too. We must therefore make sure that the skills available are better aligned with the real needs of companies, and here vocational training has a real role to play, as it makes it possible to acquire skills adapted to the practice of a trade and thus to enter the job market more easily.

The report presented to you today is Parliament’s contribution to this crucial security dimension. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and openness to achieve a positive result. Military mobility is about the EU’s credibility to deliver collective security in real terms and time, to defend EU citizens and territory everywhere. According to the old saying, ‘the devil is in the detail’. This applies perfectly to military mobility. NATO and the EU have committed themselves to defence and solidarity clauses. Now, to make these commitments credible we need a very down-to-earth, practical, well-coordinated and joint effort. This means harmonising all European networks of roads, bridges, tunnels, railways and ports, which will enable the efficient and quick transportation of troops, military equipment and necessary goods across Europe. The present situation is problematic, to put it mildly. In fact it is unsatisfactory; there are an impressive number of obstacles, bottlenecks – physical, legal and regulatory – that can prevent vital assistance reaching its destination in time. Delays, even for a few days, can change the whole strategic situation. Last summer for example, a military vehicle starting from Germany needed several days and five specific permits to reach its destination – Tallinn, Estonia. This is an example of legal and documentary problems while crossing the borders of several Member States, and it was just one vehicle in question. We also point to the declining quantity and quality of our rolling stock suitable and available for moving heavy military equipment in conditions of urgency.  At the same time, military mobility and its requirements can be seen as a significant civil benefit as it will enable the upgrading of civilian transport corridors, making these more resilient and able to carry heavier loads. The good message is that it is going to be a win-win situation for all sides. The key words in this report are ‘dual-use’.  To conclude, efficient and credible military mobility can be achieved only through the total commitment of all Member States, in close cooperation with NATO. It is absolutely paramount for all partners to understand the following: the EU can coordinate and supplement, but not substitute, concrete efforts by the Member States. What is absolutely important is to retain the funding of EUR 6.5 billion promised for the specific objective of military mobility from the Connecting Europe Facility.  We call on the Commission and the Member States to adhere strictly to the proposed time limit, which is set out in the Action Plan. The Commission needs to adopt delegated acts by the end of the next year to further specify military requirements and to list priority dual-use infrastructure projects. We call on Member States to prepare and adopt by the end of next year their national plans on military mobility with a high priority level.

It will enable Europe to respond faster to crises and increase its resilience to external threats. Military mobility is a topic where the Union fosters civilian-military cooperation and creates dual-use opportunities. It is supported through other defence initiatives, notably the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), and it contributes to enhanced cooperation with NATO. As the resolution also highlights, improving military mobility will also contribute to strengthening Europe’s strategic autonomy.  This European Parliament resolution on military mobility rightly addresses the topic in a comprehensive manner, providing advice on all relevant areas of work in this context. Improving military mobility is an important priority for which the Union can help provide solutions, taking into account the needs expressed by the Member States and in full respect of their sovereignty. This was at the core of the EU Action Plan submitted by the High Representative and the Commission in March this year.  Together with our Member States, work is advancing at different levels in a coordinated way. The Council conclusions of 19 November on security and defence in the context of the European Union’s global strategy made a substantive advancement in implementation of the Action Plan, with the approval of the finalised military requirements for military mobility within and beyond the European Union.  The EU Action Plan sets out the actions by all relevant EU players involved in the following key areas: transport infrastructure, regulatory and procedural issues related to customs, cross-border procedures, diplomatic clearance and others, and cross-cutting issues like countering hybrid threats. Furthermore, the Commission has proposed a budget of EUR 6.5 billion under the next multiannual financial framework to support dual-use infrastructural projects using the Connecting Europe Facility. As set out in the resolution, the aim of this initiative is to improve the mobility of military forces within and beyond the EU, hence enabling the EU and its Member States to act faster, in line with their defence needs and responsibilities, both in the context of common security and defence policy missions and operations, as well as national and multinational activities, in particular in the framework of NATO. Building on civilian-military synergies, this initiative will bring better infrastructure, more efficient procedures, and safer transport across the Union. It will thus help overcome existing difficulties and limitations on the mobility of our forces, removing delays and disruptions, lowering costs and eliminating vulnerabilities across our Union. The European Parliament resolution rightly acknowledges the principles that inform these actions: respecting the sovereignty of Member States, calling for a whole-of-government approach, coordinating at the European level and with Member States, including in the context of the Permanent Structured Cooperation, and seeking further cooperation with NATO on military mobility, to be pursued in the framework of the joint declarations.  I warmly welcome the support of Parliament, in particular as regards the establishment of the mechanism for co-funding of dual-use infrastructure projects within the new Connecting Europe Facility Regulation. This will call for close work between the EU and Member States in order to help respond to military needs by supporting civilian users.  The European Union and its Member States are making real progress in the area of military mobility, a good example of fruitful interaction between national actions and commitments, and EU level action and support.

According to an Oxford study prepared for the Commission, in the next 25 years, 30% –almost one third – of today’s jobs in Europe will disappear. They simply will not exist anymore. Janitors, taxi drivers, postmen and low—skilled workers will be replaced by cleaning-machine operators or robot station managers. This will happen pretty soon, during the lifetime of MEPs, even taking into account that our average age is 55. When we retire we can allow ourselves to observe changes from the sidelines, but our children and grandchildren will find themselves at the epicentre of this evolution. Their level of digital skills will determine not only the welfare of our descendants but also the future of our common project, a united Europe. While working on this report, representatives of all the political groups agreed that having or not having digital skills will become the basis of a new social divide in the near future. On the other hand, a high level of digital education will open new opportunities for economic growth. It’s a challenge for which – let’s face it – our education system is not ready. At a time when there is nothing to do on the labour market without a knowledge of programming languages, we are discussing how many more schools in remote areas will receive an internet connection this year. Everyone knows that, after graduation, each student must have a certain level of knowledge in mathematics, languages or biology, but we do not have a universal mandatory system for evaluating digital skills. Moreover, in Europe there is no set of professional requirements for an information technology teacher – and the extent to which teachers use technology in class differs across EU Member States like day from night. This report therefore calls on the Commission, at least in its next term of office, to develop an EU—wide strategy for education in digital skills. Our current approach consists of loose projects from various departments, which are all on a voluntary basis. It is important to set common goals for all Member States to reach a certain level of digital skills. If no goals are set, there is little motivation to invest. It is important that digital skills are assessed so that a proper comparison can be made. Therefore, the report calls for the creation of an assessment based, for example, on a Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) model. Of course, teachers have to be at the core of this development and they need to be properly trained and assisted. As teachers are already under increasing work pressure, this should not entail extra workload. Finally, the approach should be based on lifelong learning. Technological development will not stop, and we will have to adapt throughout our lives to new changes. We need to be able to recognise them and to learn how to learn. Those unable to adapt will be left behind. This is not only about the labour market: technology has become a part of our daily lives. Banking, doing taxes and even health care are becoming more digital. In addition, our social and political lives now develop online. Devices have entirely changed not only the way we communicate but also the way we consume information and form our opinions. This all requires skills: media literacy, etiquette online, cyber hygiene and protection of personal information. Those who do not know how to use online communications in a proper way will either be easily manipulated or simply left out of political participation. It is crucial to ensure that everyone profits from technological development, and education is the best way to start.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 189, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Csaba SÓGOR", "mepid": "39724", "text": "   - Madam President, I would like to thank you for your support Indeed, the world is undergoing a huge transformation and education systems need to adapt to digitalisation and the rapid and continuous development of technologies.

The acceleration of the transformations that digital causes in professions but also in daily life, in the increasing modification of all jobs, makes it absolutely essential to adapt education systems not only, I agree, for the use of digital technologies, but also in terms of teaching methodology, educational research, digital skills and teacher training. It can be an extraordinary opportunity to rethink the role of education, adapting the competences of each and the different social groups, as a real right of citizenship. This European strategy is urgently needed at this point, through the Digital Education Action Plan but also by overcoming the current fragmentation.

Now that we are implementing the Digital Education Action Plan, your calls for a more ambitious EU strategy on education in the digital age come at the right moment.  As you rightly highlight, the Digital Education Action Plan, which the Commission published in early 2018, can only be a first step in tackling the digital divide. I strongly believe that Parliament can be a key partner in developing the next steps. I also believe that Member States are keen to cooperate more closely on this issue. Despite differences in their education systems, they all face similar challenges: first, how to ensure that staff and students develop digital skills; second, how to use digital technology for teaching and learning; and, third, how to improve education systems through better data analysis and foresight. This requires learning throughout one’s lifetime. Hence, digital competence is one of the eight key competences for lifelong learning that the Council confirmed in its recommendation adopted earlier this year. Member States are also working to embed digital technologies in the school environment. Investment in resources and infrastructure is crucial but, if it is to lead to innovation, it needs to be matched with a comprehensive vision for digital transformation that tackles the educational organisation as a whole. The Commission thinks that SELFIE, a free online tool just launched in October, can play a vital role here: it can help any school assess its use of technologies for teaching and learning. By the end of November, over 50 000 teachers, students and school leaders had already used SELFIE. Our goal is to reach one million users by the end of next year. I also welcome the emphasis on teachers and trainers in your report. I fully agree that teaching staff are at the heart of digital transformation. Teachers do of course need training, but crucially they need time and support to be able to use technology in their teaching. Technology should also help relieve teachers from the burden of administrative and non-teaching tasks. Moreover, in its proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the Commission has demonstrated commitment to supporting educators and learners in gaining and updating skills and competencies, including the digital ones. The EU budget support for digital skills development will not only be guaranteed by the successes of the existing EU funding instruments covering this field, such as ESF+, Erasmus and Horizon Europe, but also by the new Digital Europe programme. The Digital Europe programme will provide learning opportunities reflecting the latest technological developments in advanced digital skills relating to artificial intelligence, high—performance computing and cybersecurity.  As you rightly say in your report, all schools need to be provided with high capacity broadband. In fact, within the future Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme, after 2020 we aim to support access to Gigabit connectivity for socioeconomic drivers, including schools. With the future Digital Europe programme, in turn, we plan to support the deployment of digital capabilities in schools, and the future Erasmus programme will support schools, universities and other educational organisations in their digital transformation.  We therefore strongly welcome your support in the negotiation of these new programmes. I fully agree with the honourable Members that the Action Plan can only be the starting point of a broader debate. In keeping with the wishes of the Member States in Gothenburg, we deliberately started with schools, higher education and vocational education and training. Adult learning, non-formal education and teacher training will follow at the next stage. The plan has helped a great deal in generating political discussion and momentum, and we intend to build on this. To conclude, I would like to thank you again for this constructive discussion. The Commission looks forward to working with you in developing a fuller vision and strategy.

As a Representative of Lithuania to the EP, I can be proud that, in my Member State, questions about internet accessibility (and data speed) do not arise in principle – in this sense we are at the vanguard of Europe. However, it is important to constantly remind yourself that in the education system, the focus on the development of digital skills must undoubtedly be a priority. We are talking about this at EU level, which must be reflected in the agenda of each Member State. In the digital era, we are becoming increasingly vulnerable to threats related to cybersecurity vulnerabils, personal data breaches or fake news. The threats referred to must therefore receive due attention in the education system. I am sure that in the learning process, the perception of digital literacy should change from consumerism to digital technology to the ability to create digital content and form, as well as to critically assess what is created.

However, digital transformation has a great impact on education systems just as much or even more than in other sectors.

Madam President, I would first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have had excellent cooperation. We have therefore come up with a text which I consider to be very important for culture in Europe. It is indeed a good coincidence that this text is being presented at the end of the European Year of Cultural Heritage, which highlighted the brilliance and importance of European culture. As I was drafting the report, I had in mind the multidimensional challenges facing Europe today: the economic crisis, the refugee issue, to the rise of populism and the far right. In these difficult times civilization can lead to the rediscovery of the common bonds that unite and connect us. In this context, therefore, we have worked in the Committee on Culture and have come up with concrete proposals, which move around three general axes: firstly, adequate funding for culture. It is necessary to at least double the Creative Europe programme. It is also necessary to create strong cooperation with the Structural and Investment European Funds, so that cultural actions reach 1% of the next budget. The truth, Madam President, highlighted by the great politician and orator of ancient Greece Demosthenes, \"See money and without them any focus of the right\", is as timely as ever.  Secondly, the protection of the rights of authors. It is well known that the nature of the authors' work often leads to economic uncertainty, and they often remain exposed to the interests of multinational giants. The adoption of the Copyright Directive last September was an important step in the right direction. But it must be completed and implemented as soon as possible and in the best possible way.  Thirdly, mobility of authors and their works. The European Union must make a decisive contribution to the mobility of creators in order to facilitate their contacts and enable them to reach the greatest possible audience, both within the Union and outside its borders.  In conclusion, I would like to refer to an innovative proposal, which other members of the Committee on Culture have strongly supported. It is the establishment of an institution which, in proportion to the European Capital of Culture, will bring out every year a personality that through its work and life has expressed and influenced European values. I could cite random but specific examples, such as Mozart, Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, Plato, Goethe, Marie Curie and Simone de Beauvoir, Cervantes, so many others. Culture is expressed and flourished by people, and it is time for their contribution to be recognised at pan-European level.  In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to stress that the adoption of the report will, for the first time in many years, contribute to a coherent and coordinated path of culture for the Member States. It will be the best follow-up to the European Year of Cultural Heritage, which is coming out leaving behind its strong glow and deposits.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2018-12-10.json", "name": "Csaba SÓGOR", "mepid": "39724", "text": "   - Madam President, I would like to thank you for your support The new European Cultural Agenda and the report on it mention the importance of intercultural dialogue and ensuring intercultural interoperability.

Nevertheless, we find that in the countries in which we live, we are expected to know the majority culture, which is also found in compulsory curricula, in which the culture of national minorities is not included. Moreover, in Romania, hungarians are clearly present in a negative context in the compulsory curriculum currently in force.

On behalf of the Commission, I would like to congratulate Mr Grammatikakis on his excellent report on the new European Agenda for Culture. The Commission adopted the new Agenda for Culture as a response to EU leaders who, just about a year ago, had underlined the potential of culture as a means of creating a more inclusive and cohesive Europe. They therefore asked us to boost cooperation on culture at European level. I am proud to say that we, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, are delivering on this call. It is inspiring to see that we are all working towards the same objectives. In fact, last month, Member States adopted a new Council Work Plan for Culture 2019-2021. It contains over 30 measures, many of which coincide both with the Commission’s new agenda for culture and with the points made by Mr Grammatikakis in his report. Let me highlight some of them. First, together with the Member States, the Commission will leverage the power of culture to enhance social cohesion and to address the growing polarisation in European societies, a topic which is also highlighted in your report. Engaging with Europe’s culture promotes the inclusion of disadvantaged groups. Gender equality is a welcome new priority reflected in both the parliamentary report and the Council Work Plan. Second, it is excellent to have a measure for music in the Council Work Plan. With the support of the European Parliament, we have progressed on the Music Moves Europe initiative, and it is now time to bring this onto the policy level. Third, on international cultural relations, your report calls on the Commission to regularly update Parliament on the state of play of the initiatives we take to boost the role of culture in external relations. I am pleased to inform you that the Council has agreed to complete its work on an EU strategic approach to international cultural relations. The Commission and the European External Action Service are advancing their work on European Houses of Culture and on global cultural leadership training. Fourth, as your report makes clear, EU policymaking on culture is better if it is backed by providing financial support to the cultural and creative sectors. That is why the Commission’s proposal for a new Creative Europe programme after 2020 is fully aligned with our policy agenda, and proposes to increase funding. I am grateful for your support for the programme in general and on the key issue of the budget in particular. In line with your report, the new Agenda for Culture is a truly cross-cutting agenda, listing all EU funding opportunities available to cultural operators in fields as diverse as education, research, cohesion, the digital single market and external affairs.  Lastly, cultural heritage: a few days ago in Vienna, I presented the European Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage. The framework aims to ensure that the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage will have a lasting impact. You will be pleased to see that the framework addresses both tangible and intangible heritage, as emphasised in your report.  Honourable Members, let me thank you sincerely for your strong support for, and throughout, the European Year of Cultural Heritage. Together, we have made it happen. Together we can make it last beyond 2018. I believe that our new instruments will help us build more inclusive and cohesive societies and sustain our competitiveness, and, by doing so, they will invigorate the European project.

Many of the objectives of the new programme are worthy of support, including the development and creation of new jobs in the cultural and creative sectors, facilitating the mobility of artists, disseminating education in the fields of art and culture, promoting appropriate capacities and encouraging innovation. Unfortunately, the proposed text is more ideological, as well as incomprehensible European jargon and materialistic vision of culture than the promotion and protection of cultural heritage. Culture is the most important factor in shaping a sense of community, but it is worth supporting the heritage of European civilisation, provided that it is reflected in and does not break with the cultural heritage of nation states. It is necessary to expand access to culture as well as to strengthen relations between the societies of the Member States in order to fully exploit the potential of culture for sustainable development, but the proposed Commission's solutions and initiatives in most cases exceed the competences of the European Union, infringe the principle of subsidiarity and the exclusive competences of the Member States.

However, the British Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, has set up a new legal expert unit to prevent members of the British forces from facing the court.

On the contrary, we are getting rather more worrying news from a number of European countries.

What do the citizens of the European Union expect? They undoubtedly expect protection and safety. If there are trust issues between these security forces, I think it is important to name them, not publicly, but certainly to address them so that we do not see the terrible events that took place a few years ago again for the Christmas holidays.

When Macron was elected as President two years ago, many people had the impression that they had voted for liberal values and a united Europe. However, few people paid attention to the fact that Macron received support not for his views, but rather for the fact that he was the only candidate in the elections who was fresh and did not belong to the old political elite.
