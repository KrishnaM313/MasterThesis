We consider this an absolute exaggeration. It has nothing to do with situations like the one that has now been mentioned.

As a major player in regional integration in Latin America, Venezuela has the potential to contribute to the region's economic growth and prosperity, or at least it would have the potential.  However, the exacerbation of tensions and political polarisation in the country is of deep concern. 2014 was a turbulent year that brought pro- and anti-government protesters to the squares. Since February, the European Union has expressed, through a series of declarations, its concern at the increasing polarisation and the increase in violent incidents. We expressed our concern about the imprisonment of students and politicians and appealed to the government and opposition leaders, students and civil society in the country to work side by side to find a consensual solution. We have called on all parties to engage in political dialogue and to condemn violence.  It is worrying to note that there is no progress towards much-needed reconciliation. The scenarios of confrontation that are also expected for the future are a cause for concern. The European Union had expressed appreciation to President Maduro for the commitment he made in his inaugural address in 2013 on building an inclusive nation. The country's current tensions, however, remind us that Venezuela is far from having overcome internal divisions. It is a complex situation that appeals to the sense of responsibility of the government and opposition parties to come together to find a way out. Only an inclusive approach will make it possible to take the necessary decisions. We urge the government that won the 2013 elections to take the lead to bring the country back to Unity and find a compromise solution. Venezuela is facing not only political problems but also serious economic, social and security problems: rising inflation, increasingly deficient basic consumer goods, civil tensions and record levels of crime and insecurity. The dramatic fall in world oil prices is also likely to further aggravate the situation and severely affect the country's ability to meet its 2015 targets. Recently, President Maduro announced a series of cuts in public spending. As the political crisis continues, the government is in danger of failing to find the necessary public consensus in support of anti-crisis measures. Venezuela's role in the region could also be affected, as unasur Secretary-General Ernesto Samper recently recalled in a speech in Brasilia. Parliament's resolution rightly recalls the situation of protest leaders, including students, opposition politicians and all those arbitrarily detained. The Venezuelan authorities have a duty to ensure rapid and impartial investigations and to verify the allegations in full compliance with the law. It is disreciable that a number of legal proceedings continue to be delayed. We will continue to follow closely the case of political opponents such as Leopoldo Lopez and the four students who were inquire at the same time. The European Union stands ready to intensify relations with Venezuela at both regional and bilateral level. It is in the name of a real and heartfelt friendship that we remind Venezuela that stability and progress can only be achieved through an inclusive dialogue based on respect for human rights and freedom of expression. Dialogue is the only way to ensure reconciliation throughout the political spectrum.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 32, "date": "2014-12-18.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   The debate is closed.

This includes giving the Haratin group the opportunity to own land – land on which the Haratin has been working for generations and which they have cultivated.

To date, only one legal proceeding against a slave owner has been successful in seven years, that is to say. Since 2008, Biram Dah Abeid, a descendant of Haratin slaves but also a political opponent of the regime, has been leading the fight against these practices of another age, questioning, among other things, his religious justification.

We are well aware of the case of Biram, a Mauritanian human rights defender and anti-slavery activist, who was arrested several times for his convictions and actions and accused of apostasy in 2012. Biram is the president of the IRA, the Initiative for the Rebirth of the Abolitionist Anti-Slavery Movement, an activity that has earned him numerous international tributes in the field of human rights. As a politician, he also ran in the last presidential elections last June. Biram was arrested along with other IRA members at an unauthorized rally, on charges of disturbing public order, insulting the authorities and belonging to an unregnized organisation. According to his organization, the rally served to denounce the lack of respect for the traditional land rights of Mauritanians, mostly black, in the south of the country, near the border with Senegal. At the same time, the Mauritanian authorities declare that Biram is now in the hands of the judges, who are the subject of legal proceedings. We are very concerned about these latest arrests. Through our delegation in Mauritania, we are in regular contact with biram's organisation, we are informed of his situation in prison and of the progress of judicial proceedings. We take every opportunity to engage with the authorities on this issue. Eu ropean Union ambassadors to Mauritania raised biram's case with the Prime Minister immediately after his arrest and further discussions on the matter took place on 15 December as part of the political dialogue provided for in the Cotonou Agreement. On that occasion, the European Union reiterated the need to fully respect biram's rule of law and rights and stressed that equality and non-discrimination for all ethnic and racial communities are fundamental factors for the unity and stability of the country. The European Union will continue to follow the case of Biram Dah Abei very closely. we will also continue to engage in dialogue with the authorities and civil society to ensure that it is treated fairly and impartially. If the development of the situation so requires, we will not hesitate to take further action. We have been informed that the process could take place as early as today. The Eu ropean Union delegation on the ground is following developments and will follow the process closely, which should in any case take place as soon as possible. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has entered into a regular dialogue with Mauritania on the issue of human rights. We are also supporting the government in its efforts to strengthen institutions and harmonise legislation with human rights standards, but more needs to be done. In March 2014 Mauritania adopted a road map promoted by the United Nations with a series of recommendations to eradicate slavery to the last forms. It also agreed to set up a special criminal court to deal with cases of slavery.  The European Union is strongly encouraging the government to continue the implementation of the road map. We are in close contact with the UN Human Rights Office in this respect. We also organise regular meetings with human rights defenders, which will allow us to have a more complete view of the situation and to understand how they see the government's efforts and, in this regard, we would point out that the European Union also funds three projects under the human rights and democracy programme in Mauritania which benefits local NGOs. The case of Biram, however, reminds us that much more progress still needs to be made.  I can assure you that in the context of our dialogue and cooperation with Mauritania, the issue of human rights, including the problems of slavery and existing practices and the case of Biram Dah Abei and other cases that may arise in the future, will remain at the top of our agendas and will continue to be a priority of our diplomatic action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 54, "date": "2014-12-18.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Arrested, as has been mentioned several times during the debate, by the Sudanese security forces on 6 December 2014, Amin Mekki Medani has since been detained in solitary confinement and his arrest is part of the government's campaign against the so-called Sudan Call, the call for peace and democratic change that Amin Mekki Medani signed, as a representative of Sudanese civil society groups , on 3 December in Addis Ababa, together with other leaders of the main opposition parties and rebel movements. Amin Mekki Medani is for us a person of great moral stature who tirelessly fights, as a leading lawyer and civil society activist, in defence of human rights in Sudan and internationally. In 2013, the European Union delegation awarded him the Human Rights Prize and involved him assiduously in his activities. We call on the Sudanese Government to release him and the other political prisoners immediately. The head of the Eu ropean Union delegation in Khartoum, who maintains contact with family members, is discussing his case with the highest echelons. The arrest and imprisonment of Amin Mekki Medani is not only en route to Sudanese law and the Sudanese constitution, it is a flagrant violation of freedom of expression. A violation that also conflicts with the objectives and principles of the national dialogue, announced by the government in early 2014. It is clear that such a public debate on the state's bases and policies will not succeed without a climate of freedom of expression for citizens and until the weapons are laid down. This is what the EU's foreign ministers expect, as is apparent from the conclusions of 20 October. The human rights situation in Sudan continues to give rise to deep concern: arbitrary arrests, intimidation, ill-treatment of political activists, human rights defenders and journalists severely restrict the political space. The media are under control and censorship, while the conflicts in Darfur, south Kordofan and the Blue Nile region continue to inflict deep trauma and suffering, with indiscriminate air strikes, scorched earth, mass displacement, widespread violence against women and children and a ban on humanitarian access, all with complete impunity. We call for an end to these conflicts and we find it worrying that the peace talks conducted by the African Union group under the aegis of President Mbeki were suspended last week to no avail. I would like to assure you that human rights and peace will continue to be our main concern in all contacts with Sudanese actors.

This country in the heart of Africa is becoming a black spot on the world map, and if the international community does not make effective, peaceful attempts to resolve the conflicts in these areas, it may soon turn out that the situation in Sudan will destabilise the entire region.

In October 2013, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on immigration in the Mediterranean.

I personally support a comprehensive solution agreed by all the States of the European Union.

Of course, it is for the people of Georgia – as it is for the people of Ukraine and every other country – to make their decision, but if they choose the direction of Western liberal values, then we have a duty to support them. By ‘we’ I do not just mean the European Union, I mean the entire Euro-Atlantic community.
