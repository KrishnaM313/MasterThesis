[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Dennis de JONG", "mepid": "96748", "text": "  Rapporteur. – When I started working as rapporteur for this legal aid directive more than a year and a half ago, I took seriously into account that it would take many years before we had an agreement on it. This was linked to the fact that this is legislation which is at the cutting edge of criminal procedure law and social security, and that is a sensitive area. I think the Commission was well aware of this, because the Commission's original proposals really only extended to legal aid in the case of a European arrest warrant and provisional legal aid in other cases. In a separate recommendation, the Commission had also included rules on, among other things, the quality of legal aid. That was very modest. If we really want to have confidence in each other's legal systems, then that includes trust in each other's legal aid systems. There should be no place for class justice in the European Union. Equal access to justice for everyone, regardless of your income. The right to a lawyer had already been regulated by the EU in a separate directive. Then it made sense to me that in those cases where you are entitled to a lawyer, you also get the right to legal aid, if at least you cannot afford a lawyer yourself.  In addition, I think it is important that certain elements of the recommendation, in particular on the quality of legal aid, should also be included in the directive. The majority in the European Parliament supported this approach and so we entered the negotiations with the Council with an ambitious position. The vote in the Council was quite reticent. Despite good efforts by the Luxembourg Presidency, the differences between the Council and Parliament remained wide. It was thanks to the great commitment of the subsequent Dutch Presidency that we were finally able to agree on a text that was stronger than the original Commission proposals, even though Parliament did not get its way on all points.  The great gain is that legal aid has been arranged in ordinary criminal cases, not in all cases, but in the case of deprivation of liberty and in certain far-reaching investigative methods involving the accused himself. In the case of questioning of the accused, the right to legal aid is guaranteed and, in the case of European arrest warrants, there is a right to legal aid in the executing, but also in the requesting Member State, if necessary. In all cases, the main rule is that an independent body becomes responsible for the addition of a lawyer. Only in an emergency, the police still play a role in this. Member States must also ensure that there is sufficient money for a high-quality form of legal aid.  Is a whole lot going to change in the European Union? This will vary from one Member State to another, but at least all Member States will now have to set up a high-quality legal aid system for people who cannot afford a lawyer themselves. For some Member States, as the securities report we have carried out as Parliament itself, this will be a considerable financial investment. In any case, it means that there can be absolutely no question of the tendency of governments in other Member States where there is legal aid, as in the Netherlands, to then cut back on legal aid.  A large part of the rights that have been in the directive have been derived from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. The Directive also explicitly refers to key UN instruments, such as the principles and guidelines for access to legal aid, as a guide for the implementation practices of the Member States. This strengthens the power of all these international instruments and makes it easier to monitor their implementation. All in all, I am satisfied with the end result. I am convinced that in practice many people will benefit from it, which is still devoid of a good lawyer.

The first was in 2010, on the right to translation and interpretation, the right to information, and the right to access a lawyer. Later, in 2013, we proposed the Directive to strengthen the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial, the Directive on special safeguards for children suspected or accused of a crime, and the Directive on the right to provisional legal aid. And this is the proposal you are going to vote on tomorrow, as the last piece missing from the system of procedural rights. I think we can all agree that there is no point in rights if you cannot really take advantage of them. What is the right of access to a lawyer worth, if you cannot afford a lawyer? In other words, access to justice and a fair trial must not be something which is only for rich people. I would like to thank your rapporteur, Mr de Jong, and the shadow rapporteurs for their dedicated work on this issue, which made an agreement on this directive possible after long and very difficult negotiations. The directive is an important step forward in the construction of an area of justice in the European Union. Today there are large disparities in the way legal aid is provided in the European Union. The directive, once adopted, will significantly strengthen the procedural safeguards for all citizens in criminal proceedings. The scope of the directive covers those situations where legal aid is needed most: when persons are deprived of liberty, during a number of crucial evidence-gathering acts, and in cases of mandatory defence by a lawyer. As proposed by the Commission, legal aid will also be granted at the very early stages of proceedings when persons are most vulnerable, especially during police questioning.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Elissavet VOZEMBERG-VRIONIDI", "mepid": "125065", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr de Jong, and the co-rapporteurs deserve congratulations. As the Commissioner, Mrs Jurova, has said, we are moving in the sphere of criminal law and we are talking about the rights of suspects and accused persons, because of the need, thanks to this agreement already enshrined, to adopt a directive that effectively harmonises the laws of the individual Member States.  We all know that the right to legal protection for the suspect and the accused who is in a difficult position and faces the possibility of a custodial sentence must be guaranteed in practice and not only in theory. The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that the quality of legal protection and legal aid that a suspect or accused person can look forward to in practice often depends on his financial capacity.  The Member State's response to this problem must be to guarantee the right of these persons to financial cover from specific funds. The provisions of the law ensuring the protection of such persons should also be harmonised by the Member States. We know, of course, that these rights, such as the presumption of innocence, are guaranteed not only by the Constitutions of the Member States but also by national law based on international instruments of law, such as the ECHR. We also see in the Member States too many cases of suspects or accused persons who, both in the pre-trial proceedings and in the main proceedings, go to the Court of European Rights on the basis of Article 6 of the ECHR and accuse the Member State in which they are located, whether they are citizens of the Member State or foreigners, of inaction in terms of the protection and protection of their individual rights and, in particular, the rights guaranteed by the Constitutions and by supranational legislation.  Ladies and gentlemen, I know, from my thirty years of experience as a lawyer and indeed in criminal law, that the Member States have rules of law that protect and protect the rights of suspects and accused persons. But what we are seeking today and will be voting on tomorrow is the harmonisation of the laws, so as to preserve the European edifice from the divergences between the Member States in relation to the different levels of protection they provide. It is ultimately in the interests of the rule of law and justice that all citizens of the European Union should be able to look forward to the same protection of their rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Birgit SIPPEL", "mepid": "96932", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the The European Union is enabling more and more European citizens to live, study and work in another Member State. This, of course, also increases the likelihood that one may be involved in criminal proceedings in a Member State other than one's own. For years, the Council and the Commission – and this is a good thing in principle – have been very ambitious in harmonising and Europeanising law enforcement: the European Arrest Warrant, the Evidence and Investigation Order, instruments for long-term storage or exchange of data, joint investigation teams – to name but a few examples. Harmonisation of procedural rights, however, has long been neglected – to the detriment of citizens involved in criminal proceedings. They face very different standards of protection in the different Member States. Fair procedures for everyone across Europe? Misreporting. Information about my rights in criminal proceedings, translation, the principle of the presumption of innocence, the right to a lawyer. The legal aid directive is now the last of a total of six to strengthen procedural rights in criminal proceedings and, in my view, one of the most important. Why? What good is all the well-worded rights, including the right to a lawyer, if I cannot pay for it at the end of the day and i run the risk of not really being able to exercise my other rights in the proceedings and thus not to receive a fair trial? As Mrs Jourova has already pointed out, fair procedures must not be a question of money. That is another reason why we, as a Parliament, have clearly supported the Commission's proposal and have also developed it further in the negotiations with the Council, with the Member States. For example, the provisional right to legal aid has now become a general right, and in the cases of the European arrest warrant we have been able to enforce that the right to legal aid applies in both the exporting and the issuing Member State. There are also quality standards for legal assistance, and we have also provided for an effective remedy. I now expect the Member States to implement this jointly negotiated directive swiftly and comprehensively. The Commission and Parliament will follow this closely. This is the only way we can finally ensure fair procedures for all citizens throughout the European Union.

We already have directives on the right to an interpreter or lawyer, whereas this draft law specifically deals with the right to legal aid. We are therefore talking about access to legal information, getting an initial opinion or a referral to a lawyer, free of charge or not.  The text proposed by the Commission was a meageny critter. During the trialogue negotiations, the text was substantially aedentied. I am already satisfied with the increased level of protection. It seems to me, more than normal, that the same minimum level should be maintained throughout the European Union. For example, certain EU Member States do not provide legal aid for people detained under a European arrest warrant. Such gaps are eliminated in the current text.  Finally, it seems to me to be a good thing that such legal aid is only offered if there can be some added value, regardless of the incapacity of the person. In Belgium, this is already the case with regard to the assistance of a lawyer. If he thinks that his intervention has no added value, he can ask the overarching agency to remove him from the case.

Ik wil eerst en vooral eleven collega De Jong danken voor de bijzondere inspanningen die hij geleverd heeft om in deze kwestie vooruitgang te boeken. The right of access to a lawyer is a fundamental right guaranteed by European legislation. However, as we know, in practice, this right is not matched or rarely accompanied by measures to make it effective. For lack of resources, some people may find themselves alone in the face of the charges against them. Personally, I refuse to endorse a two-tiered justice system. We had to ensure the effectiveness of legal aid systems in the Member States. The European Union had to define a minimum floor to be respected, and the façade systems - I call them \"decoy systems\" - which exist only on paper, must disappear. This is an absolutely scandalous cynicism. The European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, played a decisive role in the negotiations. Our ambitions have paid off since we have achieved, among other things: first, that common minimum criteria be established; secondly, that legal aid be guaranteed during all criminal judicial proceedings; third, that special attention be given to vulnerable people by taking their specific needs into account; and, finally, fourthly, and this seems important to me, that the police and the prosecutor's office play a very limited role in the appointment of the pro deo lawyer. This is a real victory. It is unacceptable that the police can both investigate a person and, at the same time, make decisions about their defence. I would like to thank the European Commission, which was crucially supported during the negotiations. I would also like to commend the work of the Dutch Presidency and its determination to reach an agreement. Of course, we would probably all have preferred to go one step further, fully aligning the right of access to a lawyer with the right to legal aid. That was not possible. Unfortunately, the legislation is limited to guaranteeing legal aid to situations of deprivation of liberty, but it must be clear that this must include the period of interrogation. Under no circumstances can we accept that people are subject to questions from the police without the right to a pro deo lawyer. We are talking about a fundamental human right.

The possibility of representing the accused is one of the most important aspects of the right to a fair trial, as enshrined both in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in the European Convention on Human Rights. Particularly in the light of the ongoing economic and social crisis afflicting millions of European citizens, we must ensure that the accused or suspects can be effectively represented before the authorities.  The timely provision of legal aid and the extension of its scope to any Member State where evidence is collected or other investigative acts are carried out are necessary steps.

We set a European minimum for legal aid, and Parliament - and let me congratulate Dennis de Jong - finally got the Commission and the Council along. We had previously enshrined the right to a lawyer in the law at a first hearing, but what do you have if you are told in a number of Member States: yes, you have the right, but how you are going to pay that right is a second one. Legal aid allows people with little money to represent themselves, and with that our rule of law has improved a little bit.  We are also seeing some improvements in the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant. You are now entitled to a lawyer in the country where you were arrested, but unfortunately not yet in all cases in the country where you are sent. However, this is a significant improvement. Too often we see cases of civilians being handed over for a minor offence or on the basis of a weak suspicion. And where you are at home in your own country, you can wait for a trial by just working through and eventually get a call to report you, you will be placed on remand in another country. We know that pre-trial detention is not done equally neatly in all countries in Europe. You will be placed on remand and say goodbye to your work, to your life and perhaps to your relationship and sometimes say goodbye to your health. So yes, the Greens are happy with this step, and now the next steps.  I would like to warn of two things: further criminal justice harmonisation should not take place at a minimum level of protection, because it erodes national achievements. And a second point is: don't let money be the guiding principle. The costs of proper protection of suspects and victims are often used as an excuse to refrain from improving procedural rights. At a time when European Member States are being rocked by terrorist attacks, we need a well-functioning criminal justice system. So we need to harmonise procedural rights at a good level.

Mr President, Mrs Jourova and the parliamentarians who have just spoken are clearly all in favour of this draft directive, and I regret to have to break this fine consensus. What is it about? This directive aims to ensure access to a lawyer for anyone who is criminally prosecuted. In particular, it is a matter of forcing states to grant legal aid to people who are too poor to pay their lawyer in full.  So, in itself, legal aid is obviously a good system, but states do not need the European Union to impose it. If I take the example of France, know that this system is introduced here by a law of January 22, 1851. That is to say if France is two centuries ahead of you. The European Union's interference in this text is based in particular on Article 47 of the Eu Charter of Fundamental Rights, which provides for precisely this right to legal aid.  But precisely, it is problematic to invoke this charter which, in my opinion, is an extremely questionable instrument. If we are serious about protecting human rights at European level, I believe that the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights is more than enough. In reality, the charter is a wolf for human rights. It is the ultraliberal wolf in the human rights fold. The justification for interference is given by the directive. The aim, she says, is to \"strengthen member states' confidence in the criminal justice system of other Member States\". Having said that, I believe that the objective is missed because this interference is taking on such proportions in criminal matters that it is sure to worry the peoples of Europe. You have not learned any lessons from Brexit, nor have you learned any lessons from the Hungarian referendum on 2 October.  You also say that this text is applicable to the European mandate, which is not reassuring. The European mandate is a much less protective system than extradition. Under French law, extradition is not a judge-to-judge procedure, but a procedure involving judges, the investigating chamber, and the government, the decree. This means that the individual has two chances instead of one to escape extradition.

The Directive on the right to temporary legal aid to persons in criminal proceedings deprived of liberty has been presented by the Commission years ago, as the Commissioner has already said. After difficult negotiations, an agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the Council only during the Dutch Presidency and june this year respectively. As has already been said, this is not the first EU directive on procedural rights, the space of personal security is gradually expanding in the European Union, and that is a good thing. I support the report because it provides common and minimum standards on the right to legal aid to suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings when they have been deprived of their liberty, and free legal aid for persons subject to european arrest warrant proceedings. In my opinion, the originally proposed text of the European Parliament was toooptimistic, as it envisaged extending the scope of this directive to cases where the freedom of persons in the proceedings was not withdrawn. However, not all Member States would be in a way to bear this burden. The text now foresees a more realistic scope and is therefore certainly better. On the other hand, I support extending this directive to the provision of regular, not just temporary legal aid, as this will at least seek to ensure a fair trial throughout the criminal proceedings. This will strengthen member states' mutual trust in the justice systems. A provision providing for the possibility of recovery where abuses by persons who are not entitled to regular legal aid occur is also correct. This procedural rights directive is one step on the road to a fair trial in the European Union, but the implementation of common minimum standards of the rule of law should also be more attentive to the EU when it comes to dubious judicial, sometimes politically motivated, processes in certain transitional countries where even the usual standards of the rule of law have not yet been achieved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Josef WEIDENHOLZER", "mepid": "111014", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the Many positive things have already been mentioned today, and I agree with this: that access to the legal system should not be dependent on solvency, that it should not be made more difficult by national borders and that procedures should be subject to as uniform standards as possible.

We may all have signed the same conventions and treaties, but in the real world there is a huge difference in how things are run, from Bulgaria and Romania to Finland, Denmark and the United Kingdom to the Central Continent.

From a purely traditional European point of view, it is a disaster. It is very non-European. In Europe, it has always been our concern that each country could protect its own citizens. However, this regulatory framework prevents member states from protecting their own citizens. It's not worthy.  I have to say that, with the ridiculous cases we have also seen, where the arrest warrant has been used on charges of having stolen a pig, accusations of having stolen some rear tyres, accusations of having had a few grams of hashish in our pockets, we are far out on a drive where these rules should never have applied.

So I would like to thank very much the shadow rapporteurs, as well as everyone in this House, for working towards the biggest majority we have seen on a trade-related issue in the current parliamentary term. This strong EU position and EP position allowed us to improve key points, despite initial reluctance in Council. I am glad that advertising online for banned goods, and also trade fairs, will be illegal. This extends the ban on services facilitating this dreadful market of torture and death-penalty goods and services. I am glad we included the ban on transit via the EU for prohibited goods and that, in addition, knowledge-based transit bans will be in place for multipurpose goods. We also added the urgency procedure, which allows for rapid bans or controls on new products, and, to make the rules future-proof, we expanded the reach of the urgency procedure to cover all annexes to the legislation, thus enabling the Commission swiftly to add new items to annexed lists of banned or controlled items if this is necessary.  We will add law-enforcement standards, so that, when the competent authorities are looking at the supply of technical systems related to Annex 3 goods, they must see that there is a provision promoting law-enforcement standards that respect human rights and contribute to the prevention of torture. Another key element is the inclusion of several steps for better sharing of information. The updated agreement covers the possibility of the competent authorities sharing information with the national preventive mechanisms established under the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. An Anti-Torture Coordination Group will monitor the application of the rules, with Parliament’s experts attending meetings on the preparation of delegated acts and the updating of annexes. We have made this EU regulation a baseline, and there is room for national measures. Member States are permitted to adopt or maintain additional national measures that restrict certain ancillary services, such as transportation, financial services, insurance, advertising or promotion in relation to Annex 2 goods. And, in order to keep the door open for possible further strengthening, we have asked that the Commission, when reviewing the rules at the end of July 2020, should assess whether they should also include activities of EU nationals abroad. This is something that we in Parliament requested, and I hope it can be included in the review. This whole update would not have been possible without the active involvement of civil society and of a number of people in the EU who care deeply about upgrading and updating our human rights record, and I would like explicitly to thank them as well. I would emphasise that we want to make sure we practise what we preach in Europe, and that we have to make sure that all foreign policy instruments, including for trade, help to address the world’s most pressing human rights issues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 40, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it was actually on Human Rights Day, on 10 December 2015, that we had the first trilogue on this issue of how to reform the so-called Anti-torture Regulation. Thanks to very good cooperation between the Commission and the Parliament and, of course, the Council, we managed to get something I think we can all be very proud of. I welcome this agreement. It is ground—breaking. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Marietje Schaake, and the shadow rapporteurs and, of course, the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mrs Barbara Lochbihler.  Many countries have, like the EU, abolished the death penalty for all crimes, but we know that the death penalty still exists, and the abolition of the death penalty worldwide remains one of the flagship objectives of our human rights policies. Today we show how we can concretely deliver trade’s contribution to this. We are leading the way. It is a ground-breaking revised version of the regulation designed to stop the trade in equipment used for the torture or execution of people. The new reforms of the regulation from 2005 is now a robust export—controlled regime designed to prevent EU involvement in trading goods that are intended to be used for capital punishment or torture in third countries. As the rapporteur said, there are some very important new elements in this regulation. It covers such activities as brokering services, concerning goods located outside the EU, for which an authorisation will now be required, technical assistance, which will also require an authorisation, and also advertising. For the first time, we are introducing a ban on the display of goods in trade fairs in the EU. For those products made in third countries and exported in transit through the EU, we are making it more expensive and more difficult by introducing a ban. We simply cannot tolerate that these torture and execution products are circulated through our ports or through our territory.  We know that technology evolves and new products for torture may reach the market. That is why it is imperative that the list of products under export control can be updated quickly. The Commission will now have the possibility to use a fast—track – or urgency – procedure to amend the list of goods to which the regulation applies on the lists or the list of countries benefiting from the general export authorisation. Let me stress that, if this procedure is applied, it does not in any way deprive Parliament and the Council of their right to scrutiny of the delegated acts. This regulation sets a high EU trade standard, which takes into account the need to respect human rights. It is an excellent example of the new value—based trade that is so essential for our trade policy. We have shown leadership when it comes to human rights. It is not only an empty statement, but this is a concrete way to contribute to it. With concrete action, through concrete measures, we show that we are taking the death penalty and torture seriously. We want to make it difficult and to remind countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, China and also the US, that we do not tolerate, and we condemn, these practices. It is a message of support to all those people suffering torture and inhumane treatment in prisons and police stations that we care about them and we are listening to them.  The original regulation already made the point that restrictions on trade are instrumental in promoting respect for human rights and human life and thus it serves the purpose of protecting public morals in compliance with the WTO rules in this respect. In our contacts with third countries, be it with members of parliaments or governments, we should promote our values and explain that these restrictions are justified and proportionate. We should of course continue our fight against abolishing capital punishment for all crimes, and invite countries to apply similar end-use control to their exports. We should also explain that these trade restrictions are not intended to deprive third countries of listed medicinal products, but have to prevent such products from being used for the death penalty. We know that in the past that has actually worked. So authorisations can be granted for exports of medicinal products if it is shown that they are being used for the treatment of patients – i.e. the purpose for which they were originally developed. So I hope that Parliament with the vote today will confirm the agreement that we reached last May. It is indeed a very important decision. A strong vote in this plenary will, of course, send a very powerful signal, showing that trade policy is not only about economies, jobs and investment, but is also a way to promote our values. I want again to reiterate my deepest thanks for the contribution and for the good collaboration we have had with this Parliament.

The abolition of the death penalty and inhuman and degrading treatment is part of the high priorities of the Union's human rights policy. The European Union, through this Regulation, reaffirms its policy of eliminating the death penalty in the world. It is a unique instrument, ensuring respect for the human rights enshrined in both the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union and the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular respect for and protection of human dignity, the right to life and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This agreement is a very important step in the fight against torture and will set a precedent that I hope will set an example for other parts of the world. As the rapporteur has very well explained, in May this year we reached agreement with the Council on a compromise text which includes a large part of Parliament's recommendations. I'm pleased about it. A number of products intended to inflict torture or the death penalty, as well as their publicity, promotion or transit through the territory of the Union, have been prohibited. A number of controls have been introduced for other types of products to ensure that their use is correct and does not serve for torture or capital punishment purposes. We must not forget that certain instruments or medicines serve to ensure our safety or cure our health, so we must seek a balance, clearly define their legitimate uses. Here's all the difficulty: the same product, well used, can save lives and, poorly used, be used to execute a person. From the European Parliament we have also succeeded in establishing an anti-twist coordination group and adopting guidelines on good practice in verifying the final use of these instruments. In conclusion, the text resulting from the trilogue seems appropriate to us and contributes to the protection of human rights, and makes the European Union a pioneer in the regulation of trade in these products.

Extending the prohibition and control to all activities necessary for its use, such as intermediation, technical assistance, transport, advertising or exhibition services at trade fairs.

I regret that the catch-all clause has not been incorporated, although the emergency procedure is true, it is a step forward in preventing new trade in instruments that may be considered risky. And, of course, we would also have liked extraterritoriality to be incorporated, although I hope that the Commission's agreement to carry out its assessment in July 2020 will have a happy ending.

It is precisely for this reason, precisely because I consider it a sign of civilisation to ban the death penalty and torture, that I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that very serious incidents of torture and violation of human rights took place fifteen years ago in my country, during the demonstrations against the G8 in Genoa. I also remember this because I was present in those days, in what Amnesty International described as the greatest suspension of democratic rights in a Western country since the Second World War.  Well, fifteen years after those very serious acts, after the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which in 2015 condemned Italy for the conduct of the police during the break-in at the Diaz school at the G8 in Genoa, where there was real retaliation to prove the humiliation and physical and moral suffering of the victims, Italy has not yet adopted a measure recognising the crime of torture. I believe that the fact that this is happening in this European Union is absolutely serious.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 47, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Barbara LOCHBIHLER", "mepid": "96728", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Mr President, I would like to thank the Yes, we have managed to close many of the loopholes that the previous anti-torture regulation still had, and that is very positive. Now, for example, the transit of goods through the EU is to be banned if there is reason to believe that the goods are being used for torture or the use of the death penalty in the country of destination. However, as there is also an ever-increasing development of technology for potential torture tools in this terrible market, this new rush procedure is now also being introduced. This will enable the Commission to add new products to the list of prohibited or eligible goods without much effort, and will hopefully be able to react quickly to these developments. Finally, we were also able to agree to ban the advertising of torture tools at European trade fairs. In the future, therefore, it will no longer be possible to exhibit torture instruments at trade fairs in an EU Member State. These fairs always attract many interested parties from non-European countries. Finally, it is particularly welcome that national authorities must now pass on information on certain commercial transactions to the national agencies for the prevention of torture, which the signatory states of the Convention against Torture must establish. This demand was particularly important to us from the point of view of human rights, and it was a key demand for us in the Committee on Human Rights that we get this into the regulation. All these changes were long overdue. However, it is now absolutely essential that the Member States implement the new provisions swiftly and consistently, and we should work at all levels to ensure that other countries also make progress in the fight against torture and the death penalty. This export control system, which the EU has created, is the only one of its kind in the world and one of the few examples of trade policy not only being reconciled with human rights, but can serve to enforce and protect it. Unfortunately, the situation in other regions and countries is quite different. Trade in security goods is regulated much less stringently than, for example, trade in conventional military or armaments, despite the fact that, according to Amnesty International, the technology for these dual-use goods has developed significantly in recent years. We have also seen an increase in the number of companies producing and distributing such goods, as well as their geographical spread, particularly in countries with little to no production and trade controls. However, if we want a world without the death penalty and without torture, then similar export control systems must also exist in other countries and regions.

This is also a great success for Parliament, as most of our recommendations have been taken on board. Measures agreed which have already been mentioned include the EU transit ban for torture and capital-punishment goods, which will make sure that, in the future, the EU in no way contributes to the trade in these goods thus inadvertently participating in violations of human rights and international law. We now have a system in place which should guarantee that there are no loopholes in this law but, as Daniel Caspary has rightly said, what is now important is the full commitment of all the Member States to continued monitoring of the situation. And, while I welcome the regulation, it is worth pausing in a debate like this to remind ourselves that, incredibly in the modern world, torture is actually still on the increase and the use of the death penalty went up in the last three years for which have statistics.

Torture instruments have even been advertised at trade fairs, including at the scandalous \"Enforce Tac\" trade fair in Nuremberg, Germany. At the very least, this regulation is supposed to stop.

The fact that some substances or products in the European Union can be used for the execution of human beings by lethal injection is a reality, so it is necessary to take further measures to prevent human rights violations in this respect. In this context, it is important to ensure an adequate combination of the legislative, administrative, judicial and external measures of the European Union in order to prevent and prohibit the production, trade and use of goods intended for torture, as well as to effectively control elements with potentially lethal and inhumane uses. Major importance and increased efforts must be directed towards export control, but also towards the development of a specific list of goods to be controlled. However, efforts cannot be limited not only in the direction of eradicating torture by reducing the availability of equipment with which abuses can be committed, but also by promoting appropriate controls beyond its borders.

The proposed legislation closely touches on one of the values of which the Eu ropean Union is the bearer: support for human rights and the fight against the death penalty. There are two general principles which under which this issue is based. Firstly, the European Union, which is leading the way in the fight against the death penalty, must be consistent. We are not credible if we claim to protect human rights in distant countries, while allowing our companies to market in those same states some of the products that contribute to the perpetuation of abuses against human dignity.  Secondly, the text is consistently part of the European trade strategy, a policy aimed at promoting sustainable development and growth, imposing the principles of social protection and justice on globalisation. Our aim is to provide global trade actors with a basis of common rules that will enable the side effects of globalisation to be corrected and prevented. It is essential for the European Union to be at the forefront of this battle of civilisations in order to prevent the changes that are accompanying our time from becoming weapons in the hands of a few, to the detriment of the weakest.

Together we have closed most loopholes, and we must ensure solid monitoring at the Member-State level. It is indeed, as the Commissioner said, hard to imagine the kinds of products and services that are offered at trade fairs and in online or offline catalogues. This must end. Today’s update shows the EU leads in raising the bar globally to take concrete steps to end the death penalty and torture. The increase of torture and the death penalty call for such measures, from Iran to Saudi Arabia or Egypt, from China to the United States. We must push back and challenge these kinds of human rights abuses. In fact, we need more EU-wide leadership to push back against those who challenge the universality of human rights. Today’s trade measures – and I hope they will be adopted with a large majority – will of course not in of themselves end the death penalty or torture. So we must see this step in sync with other measures and instruments the European Union has and must use.

(Applause) This fulfils the formal condition for the plenary to be able to vote today on this report, which Mr La Via will present to us. This is a historic vote, because with the adoption of this text, we can take the last political step towards ratification by the EU of the Paris Agreement. And our vote would clear the way for the entire convention to exceed the threshold necessary to enter into force worldwide. Less than a year after its adoption in December 2015, this would be an outstanding result. And it would come in time for the next COP-22 climate conference in Marakesch. In doing so, the EU would have shown leadership, important in these times. By way of comparison, eight years passed between the adoption and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. We are now less than nine months after the Paris Conference. I am therefore very pleased that you, ladies and gentlemen, have agreed to my proposal to hold this historic vote within an appropriate and solemn framework. We are therefore very honoured that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, is with us, and I would like to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament, Mr Secretary-General, to which you are without a doubt one of the great architects of this historic agreement, together with our respect for this extraordinary achievement! (Applause) Today, however, we would also like to thank the French Republic, which, as the host of the COP-21 conference, has made enormous political efforts to bring about the agreement. I am therefore very pleased that the President-in-Office of the COP 21 climate conference is attending our meeting today, and I would like to thank you warmly, Minister Royal, on behalf of the entire French Government, for your great efforts.

Thank you for this privilege. I was not originally planning to come to Strasbourg but I diverted my travel to address you at this crucial time, at the invitation of President Schulz, on the importance of Europe’s ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change. I deeply appreciate your leadership and engagement. The European Union has a long and proud record of leadership on climate change – the defining challenge of our time. As Members of the European Union, your countries have demonstrated, time and again, that you not only recognise the seriousness of this threat but you are also ready to seize the opportunities it brings for building more sustainable, competitive economies and stable and healthier societies. From an early leadership role in the UN Framework Convention negotiations, to support for the Green Climate Fund and other funding mechanisms, to your own efforts in scaling-up clean energy, European Union members have stood strong. Today you have another opportunity to demonstrate global climate leadership. I encourage you to build on your proud legacy and to support the speedy ratification of the Paris Agreement. This would allow the European Union, and its Member States which are in a position to do so, to deposit the ratification instrument at UN Headquarters in New York. Such a swift embrace of an international agreement would be a remarkable achievement at any time. It would be especially impressive for an agreement that addresses one of the most complex and all-embracing issues of our time. In the past few weeks, we have seen tremendous momentum, from all corners of the globe, to bring the Paris Agreement to life this year. Already this week, India has formally joined the agreement. Thirty-one countries joined the agreement at a high-level event which I hosted at the United Nations on 21 September. Already in September, the world’s two largest emitters, China and the United States, have put their political support behind Paris and formally joined the agreement. I commend all of these governments for their vision and leadership. This means we have crossed the first threshold for entry into force. As of today, we have 62 countries which have joined this Paris Agreement. Excellencies, honourable parliamentarians, ladies and gentlemen, I understand and respect the unique decision-making process of the European Union. At the same time, I welcome the decision by the EU Environment Ministers on 30 September to act on a fast track. This will enable individual countries to send their ratifications directly to the United Nations. I appeal to you to approve this fast-track procedure. We are on the verge of passing the 55% threshold. You now have an opportunity to make history by helping lead the world to a better future. I can think of no better way to secure the legacy of Paris than to have the agreement enter into force in record time, with the support of the world’s most powerful economies and its most vulnerable countries. Rapid entry into force would demonstrate anew Europe’s commitment to international cooperation, which is at the heart of the European Union’s identity. It would spur the transformation to the lower-carbon, higher—opportunity, climate-resilient economy that we need in order to keep global temperature increases well below two degrees. And it would help to protect the world’s most vulnerable communities and assist them in adapting to inevitable climate impact. In the name of humanity and for the sake of future generations, I encourage you to support the speedy ratification of the Paris Agreement. At a time of record heat, let us take historic action. At a moment of divisions on many other challenges, let us show that we are united on the biggest one of all. This is our chance to set a course towards a safer, more sustainable and more just future for all, on a healthy planet. Let us seize the moment and be true to the values and aims of our organisation. As you may know, my mandate as Secretary-General ends at the end of this year, when I finish my tenure. It has been a great honour for me to serve this invaluable organisation and to work closely with the European Union and the European Parliament. I take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude for all the wholehearted support you have given to me and to the United Nations over the past 10 years. I sincerely hope that the European Union will continue to lead in supporting the noble missions of the United Nations for human rights, sustainable development and lasting peace in our world. Thank you for your great leadership and your commitment. Let us work together to build a world better for all.

The adoption of this agreement on the cumulative announcements by the end of the COP 21 of intended nationally determined contributions by 187 parties will now form the basis of a global effort. The ECR Group therefore notes that ratification will enable the EU to join with the United States, China and 60 other parties who have formally submitted their instrument of ratification.  In light of this, the Paris Agreement will now become legally binding before the end of this year. The Paris Agreement carries importance for all stakeholders, whether they be investors, businesses, civil society or policy-makers. Indeed, the global nature of the effort is made manifest by the 189 national climate plans which have been put forward. We should, however, be mindful that this step only marks ratification of the agreement and we await with interest to see how national governments across the EU will seek to implement the promises they have made.

J'espère donc que vous connaissez maintenant le chemin. So colleagues, I think that the COP21 Paris Agreement is historic. I think, in my opinion, it is even as historic as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. As in 1948, COP21 is proof, in fact, that multilateralism works, and that the global governance of our planet is not a dream, as some people are saying. It proves also that we, Europe, can lead the world in the right direction and that in fact we are stronger together.   Mr Secretary-General, what a dramatic difference between this and the ongoing tragedy in Aleppo: civilians killed, hospitals bombed, and stalemate between America and Russia – the reluctance of the first coupled with the cynical and cruel determination of the other and, I would even say, the failing post-war logic of the Security Council.  I think COP21 and the Paris Agreement demonstrate exactly the opposite: that the international community and Europe can take responsibility, and that in fact multilateralism is the way forward for the next generations.

The Member States of the European Union have been at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Ambitious targets have been set and achieved. However, when it comes to more ambitious targets than ambitious, I would like to make two comments on this. Perhaps it is not a celebration, because we have a multifaceted responsibility for the European population and for a European economy. So, in the case of more radical steps than radical, we must take into account that Europe is only responsible for 10% of emissions and, where appropriate, globally, there is not a reduction, but only a relocation. These aspects must therefore be taken into account in order to ensure the competitiveness of the European economy. On the other note, the most important thing about the Paris climate agreement is that it is legally binding. However, the European Union must also enforce this in all respects, and it is not possible for the United States, as one of the largest emitters, to have an attitude and then to deliver on who comes to power in the presidential election.

There is no doubt, however, that the implementation of the agreement definitively means that, in reducing the effects of climate change, it must finally move from words to action. The agreement calls for a halt to global growth in greenhouse gas emissions and for climate neutrality to be achieving after 2050.

In the meantime, scientific research has shown that industrial activities are at the root of climate change. In 1997, Kyoto was the first to curb emissions of harmful greenhouse gases. Many climate conferences would follow. With varying degrees of success. Because either large industrialised countries such as the US and China remained on the sidelines, or ambitions were adjusted. That is why the Paris Climate Agreement is 'historic' for a variety of reasons. One: because all partners have now taken the climate threat seriously and are immediately committed to limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 °C.  Secondly, rapid ratification is achieved through a strengthened multilateral approach, which provides evidence that global challenges are best addressed if they are addressed together.

In addition, extensive damage has been reported to regional and municipal networks of infrastructure, private and public buildings (including the local hospital) and other infrastructure, but also to cultural monuments. . Total damages amounted to EUR 66 073 345. Greece has submitted an application for a financial contribution from the EU Solidarity Fund in the context of the earthquake, fulfilling all the conditions laid down for the application, so I support the mobilisation of EUR 1 651 834 in financial assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund.

The earthquake had vast consequences, such as the loss of the lives of two inhabitants, eight wounded and extensive damage to infrastructure systems, buildings and cultural points. The estimated damage was around EUR 66 million, which in the region concerned represents 2.1 % of GDP and may thus qualify as a regional disaster.

They link the shrinking workforce to major structural changes in globalisation-influenced world trade, which has reduced the EU's share of ICT employment, while China's share of the US has increased.  In July 2016, The Commission adopted a proposal for a decision to mobilise the EGF in Finland's favour to support the reintegration of workers made redundant by Microsoft, with a sum of EUR 5 364 000.

Competition in the IT industry is relentless, whether it is the European Union market, but also outside it. Unfortunately, in this situation there is a decrease in the volume of operations of individual IT companies or a shutdown of individual sectors when they lose certain market shares. In this situation, many workers lose their jobs, especially when it comes to large companies.

We are constantly deciding on subsidies from this fund. The EGF has a maximum annual budget of €150 million for the period 2014-2020. I fundamentally reject this fund as a waste of taxpayers' money. The fund subsidises support measures when a company has not been able to compete with its business model. The Fund also means overstepping the EU's competences.

Ericsson shifted most of its hardware production and development to Asia (mostly to India), from 56,000 employees in 2005 to more than 118,000 in 2014 globally. This means that while doubling global recruitment, it has gradually been reducing it in Sweden (from 21,178 in 2005 to 17,858 in 2014). In 2012, the Swedish company sold all of its mobile phone development and production to its competitor Sony. Here's predatory and exploitative capitalism at its best. Without prejudice to positive aspects, the resolution does not recognise or point out the fundamental problem. On the contrary, it implicitly assumes the defense of neoliberalism – the cause of relocations, through its large dominance on a global scale – by saying that it understands Ericsson's reasons.

Ericsson shifted most of its hardware production and development to Asia (mostly to India), from 56,000 employees in 2005 to more than 118,000 in 2014 globally. This means that while doubling global recruitment, it has gradually been reducing it in Sweden (from 21,178 in 2005 to 17,858 in 2014). In 2012, the Swedish company sold all of its mobile phone development and production to its competitor Sony. Here's predatory and exploitative capitalism at its best. Without prejudice to positive aspects, the resolution does not recognise or point out the fundamental problem. On the contrary, it implicitly assumes the defense of neoliberalism – the cause of relocations, through its large dominance on a global scale – by saying that it understands Ericsson's reasons.

Such measures take effect only in the short term, but do not solve the problem in the long term, since the issue of employment and relocations should have another approach to action.

This means, for example, who will be able to provide this form of free legal aid in which state.  Let me have one more little something.

Having common minimum standards governing these rights should promote mutual trust between judicial authorities and thus facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition. A certain degree of compatibility between Member States' legislation is essential to improve judicial cooperation in the Union. Thanks to the work of the rapporteur of our group, significant improvements have been made to the Commission's proposal; inter alia, extend the scope beyond deprivation of liberty, allowing provisional and ordinary legal assistance in all circumstances. It is important to note that it reflects aspects such as that the initial phase of the proceedings, especially when defendants or defendants are deprived of their liberty, is the time when they are most vulnerable and when they need the legal assistance of a lawyer most.

It introduces a ban on means of torture and the execution of the death penalty only and related technical assistance (Annex II) and establishes a licensing system for products suitable for torture and lethal injection executions in the event of abusive use (Annex III). The draft opinion also proposes the development of a equipment coordination group and the implementation of a periodic review mechanism and a more systemic information sharing and reporting system in order to strengthen control and effectively implement the Regulation.

The Regulation lays down the European Union's long-aspirations to combine prohibitions with the licensing requirements for trade in the products listed in its Annexes.

This report seeks to regulate trade in certain products that can be used to apply the death penalty or inflict torture or degrading treatment, which I consider very necessary and for this reason I voted in favour of the report. However, although I have supported the report with my vote, I believe that the Union has no credibility in the fight against torture as long as it continues to be subordinate to the United States (for example, there is evidence that torture has been routinely practiced at Guantanamo with complete impunity for 14 years).

Since its inception, the European Union, recognising its historical responsibility and the need to promote a model of sustainable development in areas with a high poverty rate, has pursued policies of assistance and cooperation. Since 1975, the year of the Lomé Convention, cooperation, which is characterized by a holistic approach, has been based on three pillars: development cooperation, political cooperation and economic and trade cooperation.

On the other hand, how can we accept that Europe uses the EDF (European Development Fund) to attribute achievements due to direct contributions from states (point X) and to present itself as a friend of Africa while it uses countries ACP to impose its binding framework on states (point 2), that it intends to create a special procedure to manage the ultramarine territories of states (point 29) and remove them from negotiations with the United Nations or the African Union?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to debate in plenary session with you on this important subject, which I have had the opportunity to discuss regularly with the working group set up a few months ago in the European Parliament. Let me start with some news that I would describe as rather reassuring, on the economic front in Greece. The country grew by 0.2% in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue, so overall growth is expected to remain slightly negative in 2016. But, as I had already announced, the second half of the year is going to be a slightly positive growth semester and this trend is expected to strengthen significantly next year. It is too early to give accurate forecasts; it will be done in a few weeks. This is the autumn forecast for the whole of Europe and the euro area. Disbursements under the programme should, in fact, help to ensure the liquidity necessary for the recovery of economic activity and therefore, our forecast is rather strengthened. On the fiscal front, this year's developments have also been rather encouraging. Based on the data we have on the implementation of the 2016 budget, achieving the target of a primary surplus of 0.5% of GDP should be feasible for Athens in 2016. So we can say that what we have put on track is moving forward positively.  I now turn, more specifically, to the negotiations related to the adjustment programme. There are three points to be noted with regard to the developments of recent months. Firstly, the first revision of the programme partially concluded, as you remember, in the spring, which allowed the Eurogroup of 25 May, which I believe will remain an important date, to mark its political agreement on a further disbursement of EUR 10.3 billion. I am very happy about that. A first sub-slice of 7.5 billion euros, the main one, was paid in June. Part of the second sub-slice, which amounts to EUR 1.1 billion, is conditional on the adoption of a series of milestones which is expected to be completed this week; I'll come back to it, of course. The other part of the second sub-slice, therefore the remaining EUR 1.7 billion, must be used to reduce the arrears of payment of the State for the benefit of suppliers or subcontractors and therefore, in reality, the real economy. So much for the first point. Second, major legislative initiatives were taken in virtually every area of the economy, and that is what was provided for under the MOU, which is our shared benchmark. The government has adopted measures to allow budget savings of 3% of GDP over the period 2016-2018, including income tax reform for 1% of GDP and a major reform of the pension system for 1% of GDP as well. To improve tax collection, a new independent agency for the collection of public revenues has been established. That was something we cared about substantially. It was not the easiest to get, but it is now done. These measures have been accompanied by significant structural reforms. In particular, they concern non-performing loans to restore what is essential to the stability of the banking system in order to boost the financing of companies. Measures have also been taken to improve the business environment, including the implementation of OECD-recommended competition measures. Legislative initiatives have been adopted on land use, liberalisation of the energy market, the establishment of a new privatization and investment fund to combat corruption, another major point of the Memorandum of Understanding adopted in July 2015. We also wanted to strengthen the independence of the Commission and the lines of competition to depoliticize public administration. All of this is an extremely strong set of measures.  It is true, it must be said, that no Member State is conducting so many parallel reforms. It is true that no Member State needs to carry out so many reforms simultaneously. The Eurogroup as a whole expressed its satisfaction that Greece is moving in the right direction. Of course, I want to do this, too, on behalf of the Commission. Finally, third and final point, we are currently assessing progress on the last milestones that I have mentioned, which are the condition for the disbursement of the first remaining substalment of the programme and, therefore, also the second. Measures should have been taken by mid-September pension reform, bank governance, energy market liberalization and privatization and the independent public revenue agency. It is therefore a question of finalising these reforms, which are already adopted in principle. After a relatively slow start, it must be said - slowness which we have attributed to the summer break - the Greek authorities have accelerated the movement since the beginning of September and, sincerely, I hope that we can conclude on this point at the Eurogroup on 10 October. That is to say that there are very few days left to conclude. We are the 5th, there are also, in parallel, the general meetings of the International Monetary Fund, which will be held from tomorrow. I therefore take this opportunity to appeal to the Greek government. It is of paramount importance that we can conclude on this point by Monday, the date of the Eurogroup in Luxembourg. I am now moving on to the next steps. The challenge after that, because I intend it to be done, will be to initiate and conclude the second review of the program within a reasonable time. This reasonable period of time for me - I have said it several times, to Prime Minister Tsipras, to Minister Tsakalotos, to the other ministers in the economic fields - is November. The success of this revision is essential at a time when the Greek economy is showing signs of recovery. We are not making reforms for fun, we are making reforms to get the Greek economy back on track, to make the structure of this economy more efficient, to recreate the confidence that is essential for attractiveness and therefore for the return of investors, because it is an open economy that needs investment. Therefore, there is a win-win situation. This is a positive step that needs to be concluded.  A conclusion within the expected timeframe, I would remind you of this long-awaited economic normality for investors, I would remind us of this long-awaited economic normality. A mission will therefore begin in Greece in mid-October. Our goal remains to conclude the whole by the end of the year. What will be the second revision? It will focus on implementing the reforms adopted. It can therefore be considered that with the end of the first, the biggest will have been done but, as they say in French, the devil sometimes hides in the details.  That is why the second revision will not be easy. Key issues will include the 2017 budget, the framework for business insolvency, labour market reform and the establishment of this famous privatisation and investment fund, which is really a key to unlocking the Greek economy.  It must be acknowledged that over the years - and this is not the government's own, it has been a constant for quite a long time - implementation has been the weak point of previous Greek adjustment programmes. The Commission's approach will be fair, objective and, you feel, positive. I claim that this Commission has always been hostile to the prospect of a Grexit and always in favour of finding solutions. But at the same time, the fact that we are positive does not mean that we are over-volunteering or over-indulgent. We are demanding with the Greek authorities. All departments will have to demonstrate a full commitment to the program to ensure the success of the reforms we have adopted, and the feeling we can have is that this is not necessarily always the case. There are a few head departments moving forward and a few others, which sometimes seem useful to push them to move faster.  It is time for the European side- because we must not be merely demanding with the Greek side - all of us and the partners who are included in the Eurogroup are shouldering their responsibilities by specifying short-term debt measures. I know that this is highly anticipated in Greece, and I find this perfectly legitimate once the work on the reforms has been done and completed. It is also time for the program to move more strongly towards growth and employment. The government, as I know, is developing a growth strategy for the coming years. It will have to be supplemented with social measures and we are also aware of that. The program includes the roll-out of the Guaranteed Minimum Income Mechanism next year. If this is done within the financial balances provided for by the MOU, I think we can all consider that combining social justice with investment and reform is a good policy. The Commission is also doing everything it can to mobilise the Funds European. Our services provide technical assistance to support structural reforms. The commitment of the authorities to ensure the implementation of funded projects, to avoid irregularities and to make better use of technical assistance remains of paramount importance. That, in a matter of minutes, is the state of affairs, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. You see that we are moving forward, you see that we have come out of the period of great difficulty when The Grexit was threatening, but you also see that the work on reforms must continue to move forward so that what was and what is still a problem, a difficulty, not only for Greece but for Europe, turns into - forgive me this anglicism - success story.  This is really what I want, this is what the Commission is committed to and that is what I, for one, continue to dedicate a good part of my political energy, my political capital because I think that we all really have an interest in Greece coming out of this crisis stronger and finding its place in the euro area , as I had the opportunity to say, as simply a normal economy. The Commission is fully committed to ensuring the success of the programme to help Greece find the path to sustainable growth and the path to job creation. I know that this is what the Greek people expect, this is what the Greek youth expect and beyond, once again, the political sensitivities that we can have on this subject, it is for the population and for the youth that we have a duty to act to offer them a better future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1876, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Burkhard BALZ", "mepid": "96997", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has Thank you for coming and also for this statement on the situation in Greece. I think it is extremely important that we have this debate here today. In my view, it should have come earlier. I would like to remind you that Greece is already in the process of the third economic adjustment programme, and I think the expectation is clear: the Greek Government must press ahead with reforms of its own will, with the aim of putting Greece back on the path of growth and jobs in a sustainable way – that is the emphasis on this. Unfortunately, the Tsipras government has all too often shown that it is unable to do so. Reforms that have been adopted on paper are not implemented, and it is certainly not conducive to always blaming the EU institutions or the International Monetary Fund on this. We are at an important stage. Greece already received EUR 7.5 billion in a first payment in June – as you mentioned, Commissioner – although the reforms have been implemented only half-heartedly. The second review is now due, with a second payment of EUR 2.8 billion. The government must finally deliver on this. Eurogroup ministers did not see enough progress in September to give a positive assessment. So the ball is clearly in the Greek field. And this week, too, according to the Eurogroup, there is still no clear progress in implementing the reforms. The Tsipras government is playing with fire. Even if the growth figures for the second quarter appear positive, which is certainly a good sign, more needs to happen. Even if Greece gets the green light for this second payment next week, new challenges are already waiting: the 2017 budget must be presented, and structural reforms must be implemented in one key area, namely the labour market. It is now up to the Eurogroup to assess whether the reform efforts are actually sufficient. I expressed my expectations, Commissioner, and that of my group at the outset: a serious, credible and comprehensive implementation of the agreed reforms.

The unity and irreversibility of the eurozone has been at risk, while Greek citizens have suffered the harshness of a crisis that has hit them very hard. The consequences of the recession of recent years continue to bite, but today we can finally say that we see light at the end of the tunnel. Greece's membership of the euro area is no longer in question and, after a year marked by better-than-expected results, the estimate of significant growth for 2017 appears realistic, as does the achievement of a primary surplus slightly above the Memorandum of Understanding target.  We must acknowledge the commitment and courage of the Greek Government, which, since the referendum, has been able to make difficult choices and correct its course, saving the country from the abyss and negotiating a demanding programme which has involved painful choices but which contains new elements of social equity that were absent from previous programmes. At the same time, the European Commission must also be acknowledged that it has always opposed Grexit's perspective and has played a valuable role in mediating against certain excessively closed and selfish positions of some creditors. It is now essential not to lose momentum and to take the opportunity for a real breakthrough to the end. First, you must complete the milestones and have the disbursement of the second sub-tranche, so as to start the second review. We know that this review will be demanding and must be carried out in a balanced way, especially in terms of labour market reform. In this context, it would be a good thing if the Monetary Fund were to refrain from throwing petrol on the fire in a delicate budgetary procedure, and to propose further measures which are not necessary. At the same time, creditors need to take seriously not only the implementation of short-term debt relief measures, but also the more concrete definition of medium-term measures. It is clear that, even if the data are better than expected, a prolonged primary surplus of 3.5 does not appear sustainable. We are not asking for an immediate and timely quantification of all these measures and we respect the political needs of some Member States, but this must not be an excuse to avoid giving concrete form to the Conclusions of the Eurogroup and overcoming an ambiguity that would hinder not only the participation of the Monetary Fund in the programme, but also the credibility of the recovery prospects for Greece and the possibility of finally associating Greece with the ECB's QE. This Parliament will continue its role of monitoring and enriching the democratic dimension of economic adjustment programmes for Greece and for the Union as a whole.

Madam President, more than six years of implementation of the Memorandum have already been completed in Greece and the country has become a vast social graveyard, since the hundreds of billions of euros given as loans have finally returned to the pockets of lenders, rather than being invested in the Greek economy. So it has been six stone memorial years in which the Greek people experience poverty every day, poverty, unemployment and national humiliation, six stone memorial years of failed troika policy and international loan sharks - a policy that reduced GDP by 25% and in absolute terms by EUR 47 billion or more, which devastated the economy, filled Greece with armies of millions of poor and unemployed and created caravans of young people who are massively migrating , which made a tax resalto in the pockets and fortunes of the poor Greeks, who socialized the losses of the banks, cut the reserves of insurance funds, cut salaries and pensions, led 40% of the Greek population to live below the poverty line.  This is, Mr Moscovici, your policy, the callous policy of the troika, a policy which, instead of reducing the debt, has skyrocketed it. It was at 123% of GDP in 2010 - at 200% it will arrive in 2016. It is a policy that encapsulates, rather than repays, the profits of the ECB and the central banks, a policy that denies the haircut of Greek debt when the European Union does so in the case of Ukraine and Tunisia, a policy that mortgages for a century and sells off, through the occupying fund, public property and hammers the homes of the Greeks , giving them to the crows. This policy has been served for the last six years by all the memorial governments, this policy is imposed by force, as the Tsipras government did yesterday against pensioners. That's enough, Mr Moscovici! The Greek people can no longer stand poverty and unemployment and will soon throw the troika and lenders out of Greece.

Madam President, the relationship between Greece and the eurozone is a chronicle of a huge mess. Beyond the hypocrisies, it is the consequence of the absence of a European government. Having admitted Greece, the Eurogroup should have watched it like milk on fire, but this was the time when Germany and France were breaking with impunity the rules of co-ownership of the euro, the stability and growth pact. In 2009, we took the measure of the disaster and found that, if Greece was over-indebted, its main creditors were domiciled in the euro area. No one has been asked to provide Athens with public works and equipment, weapons systems and other expensive supplies. For its part, Greece has abandoned itself to the facility, taking advantage of European aid and the sudden drop in interest rates on abysmal debt and giving free rein to corruption and clientelism. So let's agree that responsibility is widely shared. These angry cases cannot remain in democratic hiding any longer. We must put them in the public square if we want to move the lines and bring down the smokescreens erected in the name of respect for national sovereignty. It is to the credit of the European Parliament that it has taken up this challenge by deciding to set up a working group on financial assistance, made up of European elected representatives responsible for bringing the debate to life as we do today. We went to Greece in March to try to take stock of the third macroeconomic adjustment programme. We also hear regularly from the Commissioners, the representatives of the Court of Auditors, the European Investment Bank, the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund, but more needs to be done. Ladies and gentlemen, the next step is to write a comprehensive and uncompromising report on the state of Greece, which ignores political considerations. The elected official who will be in charge of this Report of the European Parliament must work closely with the Greek parliamentarians so that European and national parliamentarians can knead the budgetary dough together. Control of the bailout can no longer be left to the finance ministers meeting in the Eurogroup, who, since the creation of the euro, have erected opacity and mutual complacency as a golden rule.

And Mr Balz, I appreciate you very much, you know that, but I thought that your speech completely missed this point. It is a disrespectful speech not to acknowledge what has been done in Greece before we rightly talk about implementation deficits.  In fact, there are things in the reforms that we do not like. For example, it is wrong for the privatisation fund to make its decisions in a non-transparent manner. This does not fit with European values. Nor does it fit with European values that there is now a partial privatisation of water. It is good that the Greek Parliament has put up a stop sign for full privatisation together with the Greek courts.  We are also very concerned, Mr Moscovici, about investing in new lignite-fired power stations in Greece. These are dead investments. What we need instead in Greece is a departure for sustainable energy, for energy efficiency. These are the jobs of the future! New lignite-fired power stations are destroying the environment and do not create sustainable jobs.  We too want greater reform efforts, especially when it comes to the fact that the tax system in Greece is still too clientelistic and that many of the tax evaders are not persecuted. Efforts must be made in this area.  I would also like to say one more thing: within the framework of the Troika adaptation programmes, there have been many victims of people who really cannot afford such sacrifices.

No reason can be put forward to prevent the release of the new tranche of nearly 2.8 billion euros provided for by the programme. But Greece's debt is unsustainable: it is close to 180% of GDP, despite three successive plans for financial support. That is why even the IMF argued on 23 September for debt relief. This relief is an emergency; it would make realistic the target of a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP in 2018 and, above all, ensure the country's sustainable recovery. There cannot be double standards in terms of each other's political calendar, and I do not understand that some people can say: \"That is good, Greece must make the reforms and we will see, after our own elections, whether we can discuss the debt.\" Grexit could be prevented, but at the cost of tensions, which weakened more than strengthened the European spirit.

And now, in his latest debt sustainability analysis, he is almost completely turning it around, saying that Greece's debt service will by no means be 15% in 2016, as previously predicted, no, it will be 60% of gross domestic product. More than half of the total gross domestic product will be used by debt servicing! And the debt itself tripled in 2016 from the International Monetary Fund's previous forecast.

I do not want to talk about unemployment, especially youth unemployment. The IMF has long expressed doubts about Greece's debt sustainability, most recently in an analysis in May this year. It now calls on the euro area and The European creditor institutions to make a major debt cut. For a quick agreement with the IMF by the end of the year, a monetary package to provide a loan package will not be respected, and there is a risk that it will happen. It is now up to the Greek government to implement the agreed reform steps so that the Eurogroup can decide to pay out the remaining 2.8 billion. But these reforms are flawed. Although a reform package was adopted by the Greek Parliament last week, only three out of fifteen measures were actually implemented. That is not enough!

This is also confirmed by independent research. So Greece should be at the turning point, but a turning point that is too low and that has come too late. We should ask why. I think that the first reason was the very bad governance of the Greek state by governments in decades, before the start of the economic crisis, creating a malfunctioning state and promoting unsustainable policies. Second, there has been a lack of trust since the beginning of the programme and a lack of ownership of the programme. I think this was the main reason why the programme in Greece worked much less well than in the cases of Ireland and other countries. Last but not least, we should mention the huge mistake made by Mr Tsipras when he came to power. In my opinion, his experiment delayed the recovery of the Greek economy by about two years, and showed us what would happen if the calls for leaving the euro and giving up the support programme were actually accepted. I believe that Greek debt will be sustainable if the economy grows in nominal terms, interest payments are lower and the budget is in order. So we shall see what sustainability of the Greek economy looks like.  But most importantly, I believe that there is better future for the Greek people. They deserve it.

And to oversee all this, which is more competent than a Commissioner who has done the opposite in his country.

We have been dealing with the Greek sovereign debt crisis for six years. Other countries have successfully completed support programmes during this period and have also emerged stronger from the reform process. But the balance sheet in Greece is very sobering: the public debt is almost three times as high as the Maastricht criteria allow, the unemployment rate is 23%, no economic growth for seven years. This raises the question of why things are not progressing in Greece, even though the Greek Parliament has been deciding reform for reform for many years. The central reason , Commissioner, you mentioned this – is that progress is only on paper. What is decided by Parliament does not appear to have any binding effect on the administration. And it raises fundamental questions about the extent to which Greece can be governed or reformed in the first place– I want to make it so clear. That is the real point to be paid to: strengthening the capacity of the administration so that reforms are actually implemented so that they actually arrive. The debate on debt reduction, initiated by the International Monetary Fund, therefore completely misses the problem. The opposite would be true. It is a question of not letting ourselves be divided, but of standing together. And the IMF's model of no reform is not the model we have agreed: loans against reforms.

Genuine European solidarity was needed here. The European Union is more than just an economic community: it is about European values. Solidarity is and will remain one of the cornerstones of the European Union. After all, that is what our European Treaties say.  Nevertheless, we must also be able to demand that the Greek Government make its contribution. Without further reforms, I do not believe that there should be any further financial resources. Solidarity is not a one-way street. In the meantime, funds from the third aid package are flowing to Greece. It is unacceptable to me that, contrary to the commitments, the IMF has still not taken part in it.  Around half of Greeks aged 15 to 24 are still unemployed. This is a scandal!

If there is an obstacle to the moral hazard of taking this opportunity by strategic bad payers who can but do not pay, then we must set strict conditions, because otherwise there is another, greater moral risk: those who want but cannot – and are the vast majority of the Greek people – lose their property and, as prices have collapsed, remain themselves and their children hostage to debts. , without being able to make a fresh start in their lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1949, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   – Dear President, let me first and foremost stand in solidarity with the Greek people, which in these moments carries a great deal of responsibility, regarding the migrant crisis and all that Greece has done and is doing in this case, and this is essential for the whole of Europe.

Madam President, it was an important debate with a lot of speeches, a lot of passion as well. I will try to engage in a perhaps a little more reasonable exercise because what I have heard is a whole series of reflections, extremely fair and acute remarks, but also, sometimes, the projection of a political debate that we can have - and this is legitimate - on this subject.  For me, the question is not whether to enter the euro, get out of it or stay there. I am Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs and, of course, I consider the euro to be a monetary and political construct that has a very important economic basis. That is what the Commission and I are devoting our efforts to. Personally, the question I am asking myself — I understand that it is different for others — is not whether or not I have sympathy for Mr Tsipras's government. Some have them, some do not, some have had them and no one. No, I want to put myself in terms of the action that we are taking and the fact that the Commission is doing, as well as the Eurogroup, which, as you know, is by definition a very pluralistic body.  Of course, not everything has been done in Greece, many mistakes have been made, especially in the recent period. It is true, time has been wasted, and time wasted is delayed reforms, they are also points of growth that have not been found.  But I think it's not fair either to say that nothing has been done. On the contrary, in recent times, many reforms have been passed and initiated. They have yet to be implemented. I think things are moving forward from our point of view in a positive way. This is what the Commission will continue to strive to promote in such a way as to enable Greece to regain economic success, to offer a future to its people, first of all to its youth, by setting up a virtuous circle.  For me, the virtuous circle is clear: it is a question of ensuring that we are able collectively to live the fulfilment of the commitments made in the Memorandum of Understanding of July 2015. The first revision must be really behind us, the second revision must be completed quickly, the reforms must move forward, it must give a signal of economic confidence and return of investors, and that from that moment on, indeed, and I hope all this by the end of the year, we can reach an agreement on the debt because it is both legitimate and expected.  This requires everyone to make efforts: the creditors, all the partners around the Eurogroup table, including economic thinking efforts, and, above all, the Greek authorities, to carry out the reform programme. This is what the Commission will try, I repeat, to promote, namely the search for sustainable growth that will enable job creation, which also respects the social dimension because it is absolutely essential.  Many of you have called - it is true and it makes sense to say this in this Parliament - to deepen the euro area, so that it has its own instruments and also more democratic governance. This is a view that I share and that is what we will have to find in a White Paper which the Commission must prepare. We will continue the discussions in the Eurogroup on Monday in Luxembourg, where I hope we can see that the famous milestones have all been reached.  Naturally, I will be prepared to resume this debate regularly before you in the European Parliament. I know your vigilance, I know your demands, I also know your attention to the situation in Greece and your wish that Greece come out of this endless crisis.

Such a situation only records the populist and extremist political forces there, promising desperate populations unfulfilled miracles.

Action must therefore be taken in this regard. Specifically, the financial union involves partly mutualizing the issuance of public debt by eurozone Member States (Eurobonds) and giving a solution to the stock of debt inherited from the past (legacy debt). It is therefore necessary to organise a European debt conference, as proposed by the chairman of my bench, Gianni Pittella, in order to be able to launch a debt repayment fund, under which it would be possible to restructure greek debt.

The poorest 10% of the Greek population have suffered particularly heavy losses of revenue. In terms of labour standards, Greece is now even on a par with Qatar. Instead of alleviating the crisis, the reforms have exacerbated the crisis. The unemployment rate is now 24%. And of the young people with completed education, even one in two are without a job.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current Commission, the Juncker Commission, is very firmly committed to meeting its obligations as enshrined in the Treaties and the Commissioners' Code of Conduct. Among these obligations is the obligation of independence and integrity of the members of the Commission. This Commission stresses two major concepts: transparency and exemplarity. Parliament and all citizens must be assured that the Commissioners are acting exclusively in the interests of the European Union and that the necessary transparency is guaranteed. Any situation of conflict of interest must therefore be avoided. The treaties, I would like to remind you, provide for the obligations of independence and integrity to be respected by the members of the Commission for the duration of their duties. Article 245 of the Treaty also provides for members of the Commission to respect the duties of honesty and delicacy in order to accept certain other functions or benefits after the termination of their duties. The Commissioners' Code of Conduct contains provisions that reflect treaty obligations. It aims to prevent any risk of conflict of interest by establishing the prohibition on members of the Commission from performing other functions during their term of office, with the exception of strictly honorary functions or political activities, of course without a warrant. The members of this Commission are men and women who have convictions and political commitments. The code also provides for a procedure for authorizing the activities envisaged at the end of their mandate. These are strict rules, in relation to those that apply to members of other European institutions or those in force in the Member States. I'm starting to have a bit of a political life, at least quite respectable; I have held many positions - Member of Parliament, MEP, local elected official, minister in my country - and I can indeed testify that the rules set for Commissioners are rather stronger than all the rules I have had to live in before. This code has been the subject of several revisions, each time to be more precise and rigorous. These revisions have always been in the direction of strengthening these provisions. I would like to turn my attention for a moment to the post-mandate activities that have generated a great deal of interest. According to the Code of Conduct, when Commissioners are considering professional activity , therefore, ex-Commissioners, within 18 months of the end of their term of office, these members or former members have an obligation to inform the Commission of these activities. This 18-month period is in line with European and international standards and aims to avoid conflict of interest situations at the end of the mandate. In this configuration, the Commission consults with the ad hoc ethics committee when the activity envisaged is related to the portfolio exercised and then decides on the compatibility of the activity envisaged on the proposal of the President. In practice, this means that, in the 18 months since the end of the previous Commission, this Commission - I am referring to the Juncker Commission - consulted the ad hoc ethics committee on 40 of the 114 activities notified by the members of the previous Commissions. The committee adopted 5 negative opinions. In the event of a negative opinion, the members concerned have always, on each case, preferred to withdraw their notification rather than risk receiving a negative opinion from the Commission as well. This, in my view, proves the effectiveness of the ethics committee's operation and the strength of the rules that apply. All the decisions adopted by the Commission are accessible to the public, I would like to say - through its minutes. In order to ensure greater transparency, this Commission has set up a web page where each decision is taken up with a direct link to the corresponding minutes as soon as it has been adopted. Criticisms of laxity or lack of transparency are therefore unfounded. We are faced with debates that are sufficiently serious and to which public opinion attaches sufficient importance not to add to or imagine other types of shortcomings. Moreover, no rule, even the strictest, can replace the individual responsibility of the members of the Commission. If we consider - and you have mentioned two communications, which I have in fact grouped together - the recent cases of the former President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the former Vice-President, Mrs Kroes, no extension of the obligations imposed by the code of conduct could have prevented their choice of professional development. There may be assessments here of the individual responsibility for this or that. As for the Commissioners' declarations of interest, everyone is personally responsible for them. This statement must be accurate and complete in order to allow for an effective examination of the risks of conflict of interest, and, again, it is precise, updated and goes to the bottom of it.  I will conclude by saying that the President is closely and personally monitoring the implementation of the Code of Conduct and considers that at this stage no change in the code would have prevented cases that are now the subject of special attention by Parliament and public opinion, which does not, of course, prevent us from debating it and making any such or such assessment that the President has also had the opportunity to make known.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1973, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Tadeusz ZWIEFKA", "mepid": "28301", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. Matters relating to conflicts of interest in the case of commissioners-designate or commissioners are an extremely sensitive issue, but at the same time so sensitive and so moving in the imagination of our society that we cannot silence the situations that are taking place and which are also of concern to us. The European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs is required to give an opinion on whether a commissioner-designate actually meets all the requirements relating to the absence of a conflict of interest. The problem is that, in the Committee on Legal Remedies, we do not have in principle any meaningful material on the basis of which we could give such an opinion in a safe way, while ensuring that we actually issue it in earnest. In this regard, we and the European Commission seem to have a great deal of work to do. The Code of Conduct for Commissioners is, of course, an extremely important instrument, but many of the provisions there are very general. We would like to know what the wording of Family interest means? What kind of family or friendly links do a commissioner or current Commissioner have in this broad sense? This would also facilitate the work of the Committee on Legal Remedies. We do not want to be either a prosecutor's office or a court, but we want to do the work that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament impose on the shoulders of members of the Committee on Legal Affairs in the selection of new Commissioners and the evaluation of the work of the current Commissioners in a very precise and very honest way.

What do these two points have to do with each other? They are primarily evidence of obvious system errors. On the one hand, we have high-ranking former representatives of the European Commission, who could actually be expected to have a particular sensitivity – in practice, misreporting – because of the strict rules clearly highlighted by Commissioner Moscovici. On the other hand, as far as Bahamas leaks are concerned, we have countless anonymous letterbox companies which are not illegal per se, but which open the door to criminal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. We are dealing here with cover-up crime, which is all too often tolerated by the state. In both cases – and this brings the two things together – the consequences are devastating. The citizens out there get the feeling that certain parts of society that are up there are somehow subject to very different rules, different laws than for ordinary consumers. It doesn't matter if this is true in individual cases or not. The feeling spreads. We, as representatives of the people, must take a profound counter-effect to this, because this goes to the pillars of people's acceptance of our system. In other words, as far as the Commission is concerned, of course we have good rules, but they need to be improved and the sanctions must be even tougher. And as far as letterbox companies are concerned, this naturally means that we need clear rules on which countries will be on a tax haven list for us and what effective sanctions are.

At the very least, it gives the impression that politicians are incapable of countering the misuse of tax legislation, the leaking of taxpayers' money into any offshore ports. That in itself is bad at a time when we are already seeing a noticeable increase in the distance between politicians and the population and voters. But here in this situation, of course, the situation is even worse in that it was a former Commissioner who was more or less caught up in fresh action, who clearly violated the code of conduct that she herself signed, where she undertook to disclose her potential conflicts of interest. The point that you have not really raised, Mr Moscovici, and where I would ask you to go back to it later, is this: what are we doing about these violations? I do believe that the rules of conduct are well formulated, that attempts have been made to make them as precise as possible – although the honourable Member from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has rightly noted some room for improvement.

Madam President, the difficult situation in which we find ourselves is rooted in the defects and largesse, in view of the confidence that people place in their leaders, enabled by the Commissioners' code of conduct.   The first important element is that the initiative to draft this code of conduct rests with the Commissioners themselves. So they are judges and parties, and from that point of view, that is really not a good thing. Ironically, it was the Barroso Commission itself, which in 2011 was responsible for the revision of the code of conduct. It cannot be said to have been severe.  Second, the call off period is far too short. Currently, it is eighteen months old. Legislation for which commissioners can be influenced by lobby groups has a much longer, much tougher life: three years, five years and sometimes even, as in the case of the NRP, a good ten years. It is therefore imperative to review this period in order to remove any suspicion. The third element, which I think is very important, is that the Commissioners' Code of Conduct establishes an ad hoc ethics committee, but that committee is only advisory. It is before the Commission itself, when it had to be independent and sovereign and had to be able to self-seize. So here are my recommendations. First, to have an independent ethics committee. Second, allow him, as I have just said, to self-seed. Finally, here is the example of what I call a healthy democracy: Canada, an extremely demanding country. Ministers, secretaries of state and parliamentarians are barred from lobbying for five years. It is a commissioner who oversees this matter who makes the law. He was elected by parliament for seven years. This is a democracy.

Kroes had become known during her time as Dutch minister because of her not unfortunate friendships with dubious businessmen. The Dutch Parliament had launched an investigation into conflicts of interest, but that was not completed in time before she was already minister. In that sense, I was not surprised that Kroes was connected to a dark enterprise in the Bahamas, whose main task would have been to buy up a piece of the equally dark Enron. But it is serious, especially since Parliament had demanded in 2004 that, as Commissioner for Competition, she no longer had any interest in any company. She solemnly promised this in this House, but it now appears that she had failed to check whether there was an unfinished project somewhere.  But Kroes continues. She has new jobs at Merrill Lynch and Uber, among others. For the first job, she received conditional approval from the Commission's Ethics Committee. For the second job this was no longer necessary because the cooling-off period of 18 months had ended. Kroes can now lobby for that company and she knows her way as ex-Commissioner Digital Agenda. All in all, it's a mess.  I therefore ask the Commission for three specific points: 1. No longer has a conditional approval by the High-Risk Ethics Committee and the strengthening of that committee with fully independent experts; 2. extension of the cooling-off period to three years; 3. Clear guidelines on what integrity and discretion mean for ex-Commissioners, because it is clear that some of them have or do not want to have any notion of this.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, who is doing the most harm to the European project today? Eurosceptics like Mr Farage or Mrs Le Pen or the Eurocynics like Barroso and Mrs Kroes? What is clear is that the former are gaining ground by squenting the anger aroused by the unworthy behaviour of the latter. The more the rulers are won by cynicism, the more populism seduces the governed. By joining The Goldman Sachs Bank, a symbol of all the excesses of finance and a leading player in the 2008 financial crisis, José Barroso further undermined citizens' confidence in the European project. That is why it must be sanctioned. Mr Juncker's decision to refer the matter to the Ethics Committee is far too late and insufficient. We have to go to the Court of Justice.  The scandal that is splattering today Mrs Kroes reminds us that the Barroso case is far from isolated and the cases of Gerhard Schroeder, Tony Blair or Jérôme Cahuzac illustrate that this is not a disease unique to the European institutions.  There is an urgent need to strengthen the rules on conflicts of interest and I would also like to warn the representatives of the Commission and, beyond that, all of us European politicians, both in Brussels and in the Member States: citizens feel - and all too often rightly - that political decisions are increasingly tailored in the interests of big business. The retraining of former commissioners or ministers in the business community or their involvement in tax avoidance strategies only reinforces their suspicion, not to mention the accumulation of political responsibilities with mandates in the private sector, including in this assembly.  Citizens' confidence in their institutions and their elected representatives is the foundation of democracy and we know that this trust is being shaken.

I will simply mention a few names: Mr Romano Prodi, advisor to Goldman Sachs Italy on international issues, who becomes Chairman of the 1999-2004 Commission; Mario Monti, Competition Commissioner in the same Commission, who was hired in 2008 by Goldman Sachs; Mario Draghi, Vice President Europe of Goldman Sachs between 2002 and 2005, who became President of the European Central Bank.

The position obtained by Mr Barroso with Goldman Sachs is a case in point. Could such a bonanza affect the thinking of a current Commissioner involved in regulating markets? I fear it could.

The EU cannot be seen as having double standards.  The Bahama Leaks teach us two lessons: first of all we need to increase our efforts in combating tax havens. Information provided by whistle-blowers and investigative journalists ought to have been freely available to all European authorities. It is our duty as European politicians to ensure that happens in the future through new legislation to end the world of secrecy, fraud, corruption and tax evasion, and put real pressure on tax havens.  Secondly, when it comes to our own procedures to avoid potential conflict of interest, we must be honest: they are not good enough.

That is the weak point of our system.  Concerning the information about tens of thousands of offshore accounts in interesting places, held by interesting people with interesting amounts of money, as I said last time, this clearly just underlines the urgency of the tasks that are already underway for some time now. We need to learn more. The question of the balance of illegal, immoral and legitimate activity is still not clear to me but what is obvious is that two key components in the fight against this phenomenon include the programme of beneficial ownership and automated exchange of information on bank accounts. The second one, developed by the OECD, is already underway and will be implemented very soon.

Indeed, beyond the immorality of these practices, our states are doubly penalized. Every year, as you know, tax evasion deprives the government of EUR 1 trillion in revenue, so much money that will not be invested in health, employment, education or security.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate, and I have of course heard the concerns expressed in this House, of which I know - I belong to a political commission, its president is a politician and we are politicians - that it also reflects many questions, questions and sometimes reactions in public opinion. Through all this there is a lot of emotion and I can feel them. There are convictions that exemplarity and transparency are not divided and reduced, that we should not compromise with that, and I totally share these convictions. There may be, here or there, this or that excess, which I can understand and that I would like to see a little more moderate. While it is true that certain situations are questionable and discussed, we must always - we are in systems of law - respect people and their right to assert their rights. I would also like us here in this Chamber to avoid amalgamations, attacks or the risk of weakening an institution in the name of this or that behaviour. I would like to see my very deep feeling that we avoid always shooting the Brussels pianist, because the European Commission, which is your interlocutor, particularly on the subject of the fight against tax evasion and tax evasion, is an institution that does more than many others, not only in this area, but also to preserve the ethics and guarantee that of its members and former members. Again, let us be able to distinguish what can be dealt with in a particular individual case, which must be dealt with without damaging, weakening or even smearing this institution which is clean and beautiful. I would like to reaffirm the Commission's desire to apply and enforce the highest standards of political and ethical behaviour in the exercise of its responsibilities, but also to shed light on the behaviour of its former members which would contravene the rules or have contravened the rules in force and take the appropriate measures. That is a commitment made by the president, and I say it very clearly on his behalf. In fact, believe me, President Junker , I spoke with him when I came here to defend this position before you, is the first to regret that the situations you have mentioned are currently the subject of such discussions. In this context, the President, since it is part of his prerogative, has taken the necessary steps at his disposal. He asked for an explanation when he felt that this should be done and consulted the ad hoc ethics committee on the basis of these explanations on two cases involving members of the previous Commission. When the opinions of the ad hoc ethics committee come to us, they have been requested, the Commission will discuss it and decide what appropriate action to take. You have seen , as I said in my opening remarks - that these decisions are still being respected, and the Commission will, of course, go in that direction. President Juncker is committed to keeping this Parliament fully informed on the outcome of these individual issues. Again, I was saying that we must also respect the right of individuals to assert their rights. We have treaties that set obligations, a code of conduct to enforce them, and an ethics committee that we have to trust. The notions of honesty and delicacy, which Mrs Bérès referred to, are included. These concepts, which apply not only for the 18-month period, but also for the entire duration of life, are not in fact meaningless and should not be so for men and women who may, at some point, have the honour of holding office in the Commission, even if, subsequently , we cannot wish for lives to be fossilised or frozen - they can take over or exercise political or professional activities in the private sector.  In conclusion, I believe that we should not turn the problems posed by the members of the previous Commission into an amalgamation of the Commission and Parliament. Let us not use material errors or personal choices that may be regrettable for questioning rules that will, in any case, never govern or determine the solution of this type of situation. The rules of the treaty and the code of conduct are firm. They represent standards, I repeat, that go far beyond what is applied in the majority of Member States or in all the other European institutions. The Commission is committed to applying them with the necessary rigour and transparency towards this Parliament.  We will, of course, be attentive to the debates which will take place on these subjects, in your chamber, and we will give our full support, including the work of the PANA committee. I have already declared myself available to come before her, both to deal with these issues, but also and above all to discuss what is the very substance of the policy that we must - Parliament and the Commission, together - lead, which we must also push towards the Member States and which must be a policy of fiscal transparency First of all. From this point of view, and I repeat, you have an ambitious and bold Commission in front of you.

The Commission offers them a very generous transitional allowance so that they can preserve their integrity, but unfortunately a considerable number of past Commissioners have given in to the temptation of monetising their influence; this phenomenon being so widespread that it already has a name, the ‘revolving door’. Siim Kallas was allowed by the Commission to take up the position of special advisor to Commissioner Dombrovskis, and a position in the private software company Nortal. Although Kallas had a duty to refrain from lobbying the Commission on Nortal’s behalf, he had, in his position as an advisor, unfettered access to the Commission while being on the payroll of a company on whose behalf he theoretically couldn’t lobby.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in April we already had an exchange of views in this Chamber on the impact of the migration crisis in the European Union, particularly on the transport sector. We are all acutely aware of the many challenges posed by migration flows, including in Calais. Together with Commissioner Bulc, we take this issue very seriously, and we want to find sustainable and viable solutions to ensure, first, the normal crossing of borders for people and goods in Calais and, secondly, to improve the management of migration flows in this area and the living conditions of the migrants present.  We must bear in mind that the Franco-British border is an external border of the Schengen area. For this reason, specific bilateral agreements were concluded between France and the United Kingdom, such as the Le Touquet agreement in 2003. We recognise the desperation of migrants, who are trying to board trains or lorries to get to the UK, but their attempts are clearly having a negative effect on the transport sector. Eurotunnel informed us that, compared to the first half of 2015, there was a 43% decrease in the number of freight trains and the amount of freight transported in the first two quarters of 2016.  We continue to work with all stakeholders on two issues. On the one hand, securing the transport of goods and people and, on the other hand, managing the humanitarian and migratory situation. Ladies and gentlemen, while the maintenance of public order and security is France's responsibility on its national territory, our aim is for the passage of people and goods across the border to function normally. For example, over the past summer, the Commission has taken exceptional measures to reduce the impact on the transport sector. We have allowed the UK to temporarily deviate from the rules on the working hours of road drivers. This allowed drivers to wait in a safe parking spot to rest. In the summer of 2015, the Commission wrote to the French and British authorities. We called on them to install safety equipment as quickly as possible at transport facilities near Calais. We also called on the French and British authorities to better coordinate their police and customs forces to improve the efficiency of border controls and reduce congestion. This reduces the risk of migrants getting inside trailers. As a result, the number of illegal intrusions into transport terminals has decreased dramatically. According to Eurotunnel, there were fewer than 17,500 interceptions this year up to September. This figure should be compared to the 80,829 interceptions that took place during 2015. However, I am sure I have recently seen television reports showing that the migrant problem had moved away from transport terminals in Calais. Stowaways are present in truck-only parking lots, sometimes several hundred kilometres from Calais. In this regard, the Commission's services are preparing recommendations for the road freight transport sector in order to better secure vehicles of all types against unauthorized intrusion. We will consult widely with stakeholders. I hope to be able to present these documents at the end of the spring of next year.  The French authorities have had to deal with the security situation and migration issues. They deployed police forces and moved migrants near Calais to centres across the country. In this regard, the Commission welcomes the intention of the French authorities to dismantle the Calais \"jungle\" by the end of the year. We are convinced that this will help improve living conditions. This is necessary in particular to improve the plight of many unaccompanied minors who are present in Calais. The dismantling of the un organised camp around Calais must be accompanied by the proper application of EU asylum rules for those in need of protection and rules on the return of those who do not have a legal right of residence. At the same time, the situation in Calais demonstrates that the sources of migration need to be better managed within the framework of joint action and a common emigration policy. In this context, as you know, the Commission has proposed a major measures to improve the management of migrant flows and combat migrant trafficking. These measures have already significantly reduced the flow of migrants across Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2037, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group.

I am grateful to the Commissioner on the one hand for his overview and his efforts to solve this problem, but I must tell you that I do not think it is sufficient on behalf of the PPE Group. There's a great human drama going on there. There are currently more than 10 000 illegal asylum seekers in the relevant department of France. President Hollande has said that he wants to resolve it before 1 January 2017 and I would at least ask the Commissioner, both Commissioners - because I see that Mrs Bulc has now been pushed - that they, in consultation with the French Government, should also abolish this so-called jungle.  I know it's not just a French problem. There are illegal asylum seekers from all over Europe, which is why, of course, the Commissioner is responsible for this, but it cannot go on like this. Transporters from all over Europe are extremely affected by these aggressive people who are desperate and who are trying to come to Britain. That is why I am pleased with Hollande's commitment, but I do hope that the European Commission will also help France to solve this problem.  Finally, Mr President, we also have Brexit and the reliability of European transport. That's something we have to pay attention to. There is a lot of transport to Great Britain.

It is Europe not only because it belongs to it geographically, but above all because what is happening in Calais reflects in miniature what is happening in other places in Europe. In Calais we must reconcile security and humanity. Security for all, Europeans and foreigners, who have the right to live and grow up in safe places, not to have to bow to human traffickers, not to live in shacks or bins, to be able to trade freely. The decision by François Hollande'French Government to brutally close what is brutally referred to as the 'Calais Jungle', what a bad name! Concern for security, if it is not accompanied by humanity, becomes disorder. We all know that, if we do not offer alternative housing, assistance and protection to asylum seekers, tomorrow's shacks will rise on today's rubble, which will be even poorer and unlubrious. Those who call for bulldozers do not have a monopoly on security, but rather on the unsolubriity, misery and insecurity that will be created. The decision to put an end to the Jungle therefore makes sense if it responds to an imperative of humanity, because in Calais there are lives, stories, people who cannot be swept away, there is also energy, a hunger for life, the one that has driven so many men and women to face a long journey in which Calais, which also seems like a dead end , it's just a stop. These people must be provided with humanitarian protection and assistance, especially for unaccompanied minors, as Commissioner Avramopoulos mentioned a moment ago. The burden of this support cannot remain as usual on the shoulders of the poorest, and Nord-Pas-de-Calais is one of the poorest departments in France. It is therefore right to distribute asylum seekers in France and, I would add, in Europe. We are talking about 0.01% of the French.  I will end with a call for consistency.

I have requested this debate, Mr President, because the situation in Calais is completely untenable for everyone, for refugees, for local residents and for drivers. I held a meeting in Rotterdam last year with my esteemed colleague Dennis de Jong and we asked dozens of drivers about their experiences there. There are often trees of men in between, but many of them were terrified to have to drive to Calais, because drivers at Calais are threatened. They get spat on, they get beaten. Many loads of fruit and vegetables disappeared into dumpsters after refugees defecated and on them. And then the driver is fined 1 000 euros for having stowaways in his car.  So we are talking about a European problem and the European Commission needs to address it. Not by sending a few letters to governments, but by organising a summit conference within a few weeks with all those involved to find a solution. Then it is also about the refugees, selection at the gate, resettlement of genuine refugees. This must now be achieved and, at Calais, France and Great Britain must work together to find a solution. Catch those refugees there. France must close the camp and ensure that no new camps are created along the Canal Zone, plus secure parking spaces, no more fines to drivers who are honest and a quick passage at customs.  It is now time for us to stop talking for years because how many French ministers have not been to Calais who have said: 'Yes, it is very bad, we are going to put an end to it'. And now Mr. Hollande again. It doesn't work that way. So, Mr. Avramopoulos, it's with you now to show deeds and stop talking. Not words but deeds, we say in Rotterdam.

Madam President, Madam and Commissioners, dear members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in recent years I have had the opportunity to visit many refugee camps on the Syrian border, in Lebanon, Italy, on the Balkan route and in camps organised in Bavaria. Unfortunately, the worst of the camps I saw last July was the one in Calais. These are not things that are happening on the other side of the world, but in Europe, a few hours before this Chamber. For my part, I would like to emphasise what you have mentioned, Commissioner, in particular the situation of unaccompanied minors, the situation of children in Calais, who number more than 6,000 today in this camp, that of 1000 children who are exposed to cold, fatigue, fear, violence, harassment, forced labour, prostitution , despair, disappearance —multiple children have disappeared— or also death, as some of these young people died, suffocated in the back of a truck or struck during the nights they were trying to escape. Last week, my country, France, was condemned for the situation of a Kurdish child in this camp, who lived in the Calais Jungle and has family in the UK. My country has twice refused to register it, to register its asylum application. Here, everyone knows that the asylum application is a mandatory process before family reunification can be studied. Beyond the controversy and all these tragic situations, three essential and immediate things to do concerning these children: the first is to register all the children who arrive at the Calais site and on the many slums that surround this sector of my country; the second is to ensure that everyone has access to accurate information, in their own language and adapted to their age, on the right to apply for asylum in France - with the Dublin reform - and on family reunification procedures; and, finally, the third is to implement appropriate reception and shelter so as not to leave them in the hands of smugglers and criminal networks.

Madam President, Commissioner, I thank you for your expression in this impeccable French. In 1989, everyone was delighted with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Today, new walls are being built and multiplying in Europe and elsewhere. Calais is a symbol of this. Since 2000, barbed wire has been erected there, constantly raised and elongated. Today, we will add more by vegetating and we will dismantle this camp of misery for the third time.  More than 10,000 people live in the area, including more than 1,000 minors, most of them unprotected. We're going to move them again without solving the problem. They want to join the UK because they have ties, family and they think they can easily find work there. If they apply for asylum, they have to wait weeks, and the acceptance rate in France is among the lowest in the European Union. On this basis, the good refugees and the others are sorted out, which are supposed to be deported as soon as possible, including to their country of origin, regardless of the country of origin, as if they had no other rights. Like others, here I have been to Calais. I met these men, these women, these children, I heard their testimonies, their life story, their distress, their mind-blowing journey of violence. Calais is neither a Franco-British affair nor just a transport problem. European law, however imperfect, is flouted, especially for isolated minors. It is humanity, of taking into account their situation that these men, these women, these children need.  Security policies have a cost: one policeman in Calais for every five migrants.

But I think it is also clear, when we look at Calais, that deterrence policies over the years clearly have not worked and that the so-called Jungle is a reflection of a long—term problem with no coherent ongoing governmental response. I have been going to Calais since the years of Sangatte, I have been there with the Road Haulage Association and we know the problems well. It is a long-standing history of French failure to deliver effectively on its obligations, aided and abetted by a UK Government that we know drags its heels to deliver safety and security, even to children who are clearly entitled to be in the UK. Every time the camp at Calais is destroyed, children go missing and smuggling gangs responsible for much of the violence there gain more customers because people simply don’t trust the state.

Mrs Grossetête, again, forgets that the man who was The Home Secretary who had concluded these Le Touquet agreements, suddenly wanted to denounce them, as if Schengen were applied by the United Kingdom, as if the United Kingdom could be a failure of the European Union's migration policy, even though that country does not belong to Schengen. After Brexit, denouncing the Le Touquet agreement is simply forgetting geography. It is to allow the United Kingdom to stop taking its share of responsibility, precisely, in the management of this situation. It is to allow asylum seekers to be exposed to terror again. It is to allow smugglers to continue their work of undermining. It's more drama in the English Channel and on the roads.

For me, it is not so decisive in the case of the refugee camp whether these are now illegal or legal refugees who are actually entitled to asylum. They are people who live in unworthy conditions on our continent – the continent that for many stands for security and humanity. That is something that must be very worrying. And then, of course, it is the case – we are talking about transport today – that this terrible situation for people in Europe has also had an impact on the transport sector and on the internal market. It is the case that the psychological burden on lorry drivers, which has already been mentioned, is immense, that they no longer dare to stop in the parking lots because they fear that refugees could enter their lorries illegally. The fact that they no longer do so is not only to protect themselves, but also to protect the refugees. Because no one wants to find a suffocated refugee in the truck later. And, of course, lorry drivers do not want what has happened now: when they come to the UK, they will be punished for having an illegal refugee, in whatever condition, in their lorry. It is, in fact, really a high-security wing that we already have in Calais and at the ferry facilities, and that is something that shows how unresolved the situation is. It is essential that we do something to improve this. It is indeed the case, that is true, it has been mentioned: there are criminal gangs of people smugglers. Truck drivers are also terrified that they will be threatened, forced to take in people and then face penalties afterwards.

Since October 2015, the cost of reinforcements from crS and mobile gendarmes, to whom I want to pay tribute today, and who are completely exhausted by the attacks of migrants, amounts to 150,000 euros per day. An exceptional budget has been devoted to tear gas: two million euros of additional budget.  Today, the French government announces the dismantling of the \"jungle\" by spreading migrants in French villages. Again, it is the French who will foot the bill. In the Oise, my department, the cost of the forced reception of 300 isolated foreign minors amounts to 50,000 euros per year per minor, at the expense of the community, at the expense of French taxpayers.

This dismantling must be done with responsibility and in an orderly manner, with humanity and dignity, which results in the reception of people in premises on a human scale and with appropriate social and administrative support. This is to bring concrete solutions. Thirdly, we must continue to fight for national and European solutions to co-exist, because that is the only possible key. The situation in Calais will not be resolved just by renegotiating the Le Touquet agreements, with all the uncertainties associated with the two years' notice - Françoise Grossetête is not there to hear it and I regret it. It is therefore a duty of exemplarity and distribution between what we are asking for with the Member States of the European Union and at a time when too often they are turning their backs on European solidarity, as evidenced by the referendum by Viktor Orbon this weekend.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2068, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Inés AYALA SENDER", "mepid": "28292", "text": "   – Mr President, I am grateful for the Commission's recommendations, but I also express a growing concern. From the beginning, months ago, we said that the relationship between the refugee crisis and the European mobility and transport routes had to be addressed in a holistic way, and not by action-reaction and always too late.  The humanitarian problem of families and minors alone had to be solved, losing their lives and health, through the safe humanitarian corridors we have been demanding, and thus order the arrival and avoid inhumane agglomerations both on the southern beaches and on the eastern and northern borders, as in the case of Calais. It wasn't done. And now we must face a worsening of the situation that threatens to collapse one of the fundamental axes of the European economy: the free movement of goods, services and people.  And it is very sad that since transport we have not been able to anticipate the human and humanitarian problem and we do react when it affects the economy. Well, let's make necessity virtue. And, unlike what has been done since 2000 in the southern countries, it must be recognised as soon as possible that Calais is a European problem, which requires european policies and not leaving the French Government and the inhabitants of Calais abandoned to their fate.

Since then, we have had this situation where the camp has grown to reach 7,000 people fleeing war and misery, with the aim of joining their families in the UK.  In the face of this humanitarian situation, the UK's inflexibility has made Calais a dead end for many refugees. And, in the face of these human tragedies, the European Union has failed to take responsibility. In such a context, France has been left to its own devices in the management of this issue.  However, the President of the Republic, when he came to Calais, presented a package of measures to relocate refugees from the Calais camp, which are going in the right direction. It has pledged to provide shelter in reception centres for 80 per cent of the 7,000 refugees eligible for asylum. Therefore, Commissioner, the European Union must show solidarity with Calais and support this relocation of European funding, particularly in the context of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.

It shows again the complex challenges related to the migration crisis we are called to tackle together. The transport sector has been affected by the migration crisis, that is a fact, and whilst the situation in Calais has the highest visibility, it is also important to remember that this problem is not unique. It also affects ferries between Greece and Italy.  We welcome the joint initiatives of the UK and France over the last year that have improved the security at the Eurotunnel and provided practical solutions to the immigration pressure. The underlying problem that is really fuelling the situation is the role that organised criminals are playing in human trafficking, but allow me to clarify how the Commission is addressing the humanitarian crisis in Calais.  Let me stress one more time that preventing migrants from physically boarding goods vehicles is a national police competence. The Commission has no authority in this matter. The Commission has adopted, and helped France, with two emergency assistance grants of nearly EUR nine million under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). Since 2014: EUR 3.8 million for the setting up and running of the emergency day accommodation centre for irregular migrants in Calais; EUR 5.1 million in relation to the sanitation and humanitarian reception conditions to care for the irregular migrants present in Calais, and with EUR 1.68 million emergency assistance under ISF—Borders for strengthening security efforts and checks at the Channel Tunnel.  In the long-term perspective up to 2020, France has been allocated nearly EUR 430 million in the framework of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and EUR 177 million under the Internal Security Fund for border management and police and security-related actions. Within this financial framework, EUR 85 million were earmarked for actions in the area of return of irregular immigration, improving detention conditions and returns management and an increased information campaign. Let me also stress that EUR 413.4 million were earmarked for the UK for the period covering 2014-2020. On the issue of minors in Calais which was raised, indeed thousands of minors pass through Calais. According to French law they are legally staying, they cannot be returned, and should obtain appropriate support from the French authorities. However, a significant number of unaccompanied minors do not want to be lodged in the available structures and continue living in the camp or leave shortly after having been taken in charge because they want to reach the United Kingdom illegally. In essence, the French authorities cannot oblige unaccompanied minors to remain in the foyers. This issue is indeed very difficult; one of the main priorities there, as minors are prone to exploitation. When dealing with the migration crisis, the Commission pursues a comprehensive approach at all levels, from tackling the root causes of migration to management of the flows at the borders. The Commission is working to implement the European Agenda on Immigration. This will help Member States to better manage all aspects of migration.

The Commission very much supports the thrust of the question raised and welcomes the opportunity to debate it today. This is indeed consistent with two essential priorities of the European Commission:  namely to put a renewed focus on Europe’s Youth, and to facilitate EU citizens’ mobility, and particularly low—emission solutions. These two priorities were specifically highlighted by President Juncker in his recent State of the Union speech and in his Letter of Intent sent to President Schulz and Prime Minister Fico. The Commission welcomes Members’ ideas that go in the same direction. I wish to recall that three weeks ago here, in this Parliament, President Juncker announced several concrete initiatives for our youth. First, in stepping up the fight against youth unemployment, we will in particular pursue the roll-out of the EU Youth Guarantee which has already benefitted 9 million young Europeans. We propose to increase the EU contribution to the Youth Employment Initiative which supports the implementation of the Youth Guarantee by EUR 1 billion under the MFF review. This will allow us to reach a total amount of EUR 8 billion (with EUR 1 billion of matching funding to be provided from the European Social Fund). Earlier today the Commission adopted the report on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative. The report shows the positive impact that these initiatives are having for young people across Europe. Secondly, the Commission will also develop further European solutions, including the European Voluntary Service, the mobility of apprentices, and a European Solidarity Corps. This Corps will give young Europeans the opportunity to express their solidarity by helping communities faced with challenging situations (such as the refugee crisis and the recent earthquake in Italy). Our objective is to have this European Solidarity Corps up and running by the end of the year. By 2020, we intend to see the first 100 000 young Europeans signed up. Thirdly, I also want to highlight the fact that the European Commission is already doing much to support the mobility of young Europeans. Our hugely successful ERASMUS+ Programme is probably the best example of this.  In 2017, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Erasmus, which by then will have benefitted more than 5 million Europeans. Participants in these mobility activities are higher education students, trainees and apprentices, young people and young volunteers. In September, the Commission proposed to increase the Erasmus+ budget by EUR 200 million for the period 2017 to 2020 as part of the MFF mid-term review. Let me now refer more specifically to the idea of facilitating access to InterRail tickets for 18 year olds. We admire the boldness and the level of ambition and we are ready to explore it further. Currently, there are 300 000 people using InterRail every year. They buy passes at a cost of between EUR 200 to EUR 480. Extending access to all 18 year—olds for free would therefore present many challenges which require further analysis. The Commission will carefully assess the potential cost and funding sources for this initiative, as well as its administrative feasibility. We will also examine how to ensure that it is truly accessible to all and is as inclusive as possible. The possible scope of such a scheme must be explored, for example, how we can take into account the fact that not all Member States railways are InterRail Members. Also, the scheme could become – at least progressively – intermodal, and not only limited to rail tickets.  InterRail illustrates well the need to address missing links in multimodal and cross-border connections. Of course, we will have to discuss this directly with the rail operators managing the existing InterRail services. They know best what the operational constraints are – for example in terms of capacity and occupancy of trains. We may also consider possible variants to this excellent idea. An attractive option might be to have a lottery open to all or specific categories of Young Europeans, with a significant number winning free tickets. We could think of a pilot phase, to be extended later on. I also wish to challenge Europe’s young people to come up with other ideas for boosting their mobility. Who better to identify their specific mobility needs? Who better to come up with vibrant and innovative solutions? So we could also consider the idea of launching a competition open to all people under the age of 25, with a substantial prize for the best new concrete ideas for youth mobility. To conclude, let me reiterate that the Commission likes this idea. We will carefully look into all possible options to further support the mobility of young people.

Nevertheless, we must realise that we reach many people on the subject of Europe not only with facts, not only with laws, but we must put emotions behind what Europe means. That is why, in my speech two weeks ago, when we were talking about Jean-Claude Juncker's State of the Union, I simply asked what it would be like if we did not see what young people experienced with Interrail this summer, that we could give this gift to every young person in Europe, namely to get to know the beauty of Europe, not to see our neighbour in the other country as a neighbour. , but as a friend, to experience as a friend, simply to feel what it means to be European. That is why I put the idea into the room, whether we can not give every eighteen-year-old a free Interrail ticket. First of all, I want to make it clear that this was not my idea. There have been many initiatives that have initiated this before, which have already made it clear that this can be an access to Europe's youth. I would therefore like to thank the tens of thousands of young people who have taken up the idea on the Internet and on social media. There are polls in Germany showing that 84% of the young generation in Germany support the idea. Jean-Claude Juncker and Commissioner Bulc have made their support clear, and even at the level of the state and government side, Matteo Renzi, for example, to name a Social Democrat, has made it clear that he can imagine this idea. So there is a momentum to tackle this issue now, to take up it, and we should work on it now. Incidentally, it is also remarkable to see who is against it. It is the nationalists who do not want to see the neighbour in the neighbour, who do not want you to recognise the neighbour as a friend. It was rightly cited by the Commissioner as a model for Erasmus. This is our youth project, so that young people get to know each other, a great success of Europe and a positive investment. With Interrail, we could complement this, an investment that really makes it available to all young people in Europe to experience this continent. It is often discussed when it comes to money, investment, that it is much more important to strengthen the Youth Guarantee, to invest money in training. I would like to make it clear that we should not make a contrast out of this, not to play one against the other, but that we should try to tackle both ambitiously now. I want to make it clear that I am someone who is influenced by Interrail. I have twice used this method to get to know Europe. And perhaps to make this clear to the UK, on my first Interrail trip to London, I was fascinated by this great city in the UK. When I was able to experience England via Interrail, i was fascinated by it. And I have really been able to experience the beauty of Europe in the British example. I want many people to be able to do this, and that is why I would like to thank many for the preparatory work that has already been done. I would like to thank the Commission for its openness. And now just get on with the topics! Now it has to become concrete, now the detailed work begins. We must invite the youth associations, we must invite the railway companies, and we must, of course, look at the budget so that all this remains realistic. These points must now be tackled.

We invest in young people, we invest in training for European citizenship by travelling through Europe and in knowing our continent. However, we must also invest, and with equal conviction, in measures to combat youth unemployment, which remains the first dramatic emergency. I am pleased that the Group of the European People's Party has believed in this. I say this because the proposal for a free pass was put forward and supported by the Group of the Party of European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats through a pilot project in the Committee on Transport, which the GROUP of the European People's Party voted against. Having said that, it is a proposal that has important value especially if it is combined with a more explicitly formative and knowledge dimension. What? Firstly, substantial access must be guaranteed to all, with particular attention being paid to 18-year-olds from the less well-off. Secondly, Erasmus+ remains the Union's mobility programme and training programme and cannot be penalised in any way. We therefore need adequate resources for both of us, as has already been announced this evening for the Youth Guarantee. Thirdly, we must make the most of this pass in association with other cultural and citizenship initiatives, such as the so-called e-card for European students, an idea of the Committee on Culture on which the Commission services are already working, or within the framework of the European Year of Cultural Heritage, initiatives that encourage young people to discover our roots and identity.

Mr President, I would like to thank the In my group, we are discussing this very intensively at the moment. As you know, liberals are not necessarily the first to do so when it comes to throwing state benefits among the people, but in this case there is a heated debate because we believe that, in addition to the Europe of regulations, the directives, the summits, we also need a Europe of the soul, the heart and also the grassroots, and what better means there are. , as giving the young generation the opportunity to get to know Europe, to get to know Europe practically locally with new acquaintances, new experiences, to experience this great continent? Manfred Weber quoted the Spiegel article here – in response to Jean-Claude Juncker's State of the Union speech – in which all this was described in detail.  The young generation has a much more positive image of Europe than we professional Europeans sometimes have. It has a much more optimistic view of our continent than many who are always critical. Of course we have crises, and of course – let me make this very clear – the idea is that we are going now and giving young people this chance, not the solution to all our problems. Nobody claims that. But when I look at the figures, they are doable. The Commission has said that it likes this proposal. I think that's a good thing. Now the details are coming, now we are moving on to implementation, now we are going to check, now the whole thing has to be done. I think that's a great thing.

And I would like to say to our colleagues – both from the ECR and from the Social Democrats – that the more fathers and mothers this project has, the better. We have a nice German proverb: \"Success has many fathers\" – the mothers also take it for granted because of equality, even if it is biologically a bit daring.

With relatively little effort, a great deal of European cooperation and understanding can be achieved. I say this as a former Interrailer. I never went to the UK, I always had to sleep on the beach because I couldn't afford anything else, and I found it quite chic at the time. Let's see how today's generation handles it.  I would never say that this initiative can replace a proper Youth Guarantee, Erasmus, European Schools or even the Ecological Social Year in the European Union.

But I am deluding it because this is indeed a laudable initiative, which would like to revive the spirit of the European Community that was breathed about twenty years ago, as you have all mentioned. However, there are critical issues. I have heard Commissioner Bulc, who has also expressed concerns that will certainly have to be carefully considered. One of these, for example, is the fact that, as the Commissioner herself has pointed out, there are already instruments such as EURES and Erasmus+ which are concerned with promoting the mobility of young people, both work-related and educationally linked. So the important thing is that we do not take away essential resources from these instruments that already exist, precisely because, considering all the 18-year-olds within the European Union, the budget is beginning to become quite significant as an impact. What are the other critical issues? The absence of meritocratic criteria and socio-economic criteria that contributes to making this initiative a little populist. Now, it seems strange that a populist initiative comes from you. Then there are geographical areas, I think of islands, that have different transport needs. So the talk of intermodality linked to the fact that not all Member States have access to Interrail as an association. Then, of course, money is being made available to a part of the railway industry, which thus guarantees safe revenues at the expense of other market players.

I welcome the move by our group chairman, Manfred Weber, to have relaunched the debate on the Interrail ticket and to have pushed and submitted the proposal here once again. We must give more young people in Europe the opportunity to get to know their neighbours and to engage in social and cultural exchanges. The promotion of intercultural dialogue is now more important than ever. Mutual understanding and respect between different cultures must be the basis of our coexistence, so that our society can continue to exist in diversity and freedom. A well-thought-out, low-threshold approach to mobility, especially for young people, can certainly help to create opportunities for mutual acquaintance in Europe and to promote European identity formation. Above all, we should target young people, who have so far been little or not at all covered by the existing education programmes. Therefore, the programme must not have too many barriers to access. Well thought out, this idea was a useful addition to the existing European support programmes for young people in Europe, so that potential synergies can arise. To achieve this, we need good concepts that should be developed quickly. Funding must also be carefully examined, because, after all, the consequence should not be to further deprive the well-functioning but hopelessly underfunded education programmes of the funding base. Erasmus+ education programmes are still chronically underfunded, despite the 40% increase. Only a fraction of the good projects, such as a funding programme such as Youth in Action or Comenius or Leonardo, which are submitted, can also be supported in the end. The rate is partly less than 25 percent. Nevertheless, I think this new offer is important, because it reaches exactly another clientele. However, we need to promote mobility, which is on a financially sound basis, and I also call on the Member States and the Commission to participate actively in the project, including financially, and the railway companies could also contribute their share without further ado.

But I would go even further in the future and provide every 16- to 23-year-old young person living in a town-twinning community with a free Interrail ticket to visit the town twinning every year.

It also means having a sustainability of this opportunity, because it means making large-scale agreements with Interrail, but also with other subjects and not only with Interrail, because we are interested not only in children going on holiday or traveling, but also having the opportunity to access cultural and educational services and hospitality.

Therefore, before addressing the important issue of roaming, let me stress the importance of the Comprehensive Connectivity Package the Commission adopted in September. We want ambitious connectivity targets and modern rules to support these goals. I am confident that you in the European Parliament share the need for a swift but comprehensive handling of this ambitious package.  Turning now to roaming: in 2015, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation establishing that from 15 June 2017, retail roaming surcharges should be abolished. This regulation only addressed roaming surcharges. It did not aim at price harmonisation or at lowering the price of international calls, which I will address in the second part. Abolishment of retail roaming surcharges is essential for citizens and businesses across the European Union, and the Commission is fully committed to deliver. Now we need to complete the steps necessary to ensure it. When agreeing the end of roaming surcharges in November 2015, the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put in place necessary accompanying measures, the reform of the roaming wholesale market, including the setting of price caps, to set up fair use of our ‘roam like at home’ to prevent abusive or anomalous usage of the system, and an exceptional derogation system in cases where replication of ‘roam like at home’ would otherwise provoke price increases for domestic customers. None of this is an easy task, given the diversity of existing business models in the European Union and fragmentation of the markets, but I am convinced that together we can find solutions and deliver on what we commonly agreed.  Let me also briefly turn to the issue of intra-EU calls which has also been raised in this House. I agree with you that, in a single market, barriers should fall and the price of calls should not depend on the country code. To tackle the fragmentation inside the European Union, the Commission proposed the new electronic communications code. It provides clear rules for the whole of the whole EU for an inclusive single market where competitive investments in networks will ensure high quality connectivity and where consumers enjoy a high level of protection and have access to affordable services. But besides this, the proposal also includes measures that will help to increase competitive pressure and reduce the scope for price discrimination. In particular, we propose the unification of call termination rates also for international calls arriving from other Member States. This will lead to a reduction of the cost for outgoing international calls.  Furthermore, the markets are adjusting to new realities. The growing use of internet-based communications applications has already reinforced the competition for international calls, and it is still early days for such market developments. The codes supported by the market developments will ensure that every European has effective access to wireless broadband, which will facilitate the use of alternative means of communications to make online competition work for consumers, also as regards intra-EU calls.

So here we are, 13 years later, and roaming surcharges will finally be abolished. To deliver by the deadline of 15 June 2017, the EU needs to agree on implementing the text without creating any loopholes that could reintroduce roaming fees through the back door. The Commission should stick to its fair use proposal, which includes neither time nor volume limits to roam – like at home – and the Council should consent to an ambitiously low wholesale price. But that is not all: the European Parliament is readying itself for the next battle – the one against abusive mobile prices charged for intra—EU calls from your home country to another EU country. Why? Because those fall outside the scope of roaming regulations and hence remain priced at prohibitive levels – often EUR 1 per minute for calls and 15 cents for SMS.  This situation makes absolutely no sense, and that is why more than 150 MEPs from across all political spectrums asked the Commission to address the issue in the telecom package.

We welcome the fact that, with this proposal, there is consistency with that vote of Parliament, with that common position of Parliament and the Council. Because you see, Commissioner, I am convinced, as you are convinced, that there is credibility for Europe before our citizens if we have consistency in all our steps.

We are convinced that this must be done with a system that can be as simple and user friendly as possible. We welcome the fact that the proposal imposes neither volume limits nor time limits, because it would have been inconsistent with our parliamentary vote, and that it is based on the approach of a stable link with the country. However, we ask you, while appreciating the proposal that has been made, that we always take into account that consumers must be protected both from the point of view of data protection and in cases of disagreement with telephone companies, because the procedures put in place by operators must be transparent, simple, efficient and non-invasive, no later than necessary. It is therefore necessary that the guiding principle of a single market must also guide us to ensure an increasingly harmonised fair use policy, which is no different from one country to another and which does not include a list of different indicators in each European state, because this would once again set us back on the road to a genuine single market.

Mr President! It is actually somewhat ironic that today we are going to discuss fair use and rules of abuse when it comes to citizens' use of telephony and data to telecommunications companies. This shows that the Liberal Group's proposal of the summer of 2013, which at the time caused a great deal of anger and fury, but which nevertheless gained a majority in the resolution just before the summer recess, is a huge success. At the time, it was a question of ensuring fair use for the individual consumer. The tax on roaming for telephony and text messages was barely 300% above the cost price and 698% on average above the cost of network access when staying outside your own country. That is why it is a huge victory for Parliament that we have now reversed the issue and discussed the reverse problem instead of, namely how to prevent citizens from abusing a system in which we have duty-free roaming but still do not yet have a real internal market for common frequencies.  First of all, Commissioner, it requires a very, very clear definition of what abuse really is. In my worldview, there can never, ever be abuse in the case of the traveller or of the person seconded to his business for a shorter or medium period. I would like to make that clear. Abuse can only be if you cheat with your domicile or you try to make a business out of buying sim cards in another country and selling them in a third country. That is why I would also like to acknowledge to the Commission that it withdrew its proposal of 90 days and instead agreed to the premise that abuse on the basis of a place of residence or illegal purchase and sale is what is based on.  I still think that there is a great deal of ambiguity in what the Commission has made, but I believe that we can find a common solution and I expect everyone to live up to their election promises and to take their responsibility for finding solutions, for everyone to live up to the election promises that came in the 2014 election campaign, including the Commission and also the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2133, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "João FERREIRA", "mepid": "96706", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Mr President, the asymmetric nature of the European Union is revealed in small things as in great things.

That is why we are making legislation for operators on wholesale price caps. As rapporteur, I give my word that this Parliament will be ready by the end of November.  There is a strong link between the fair use policy and wholesale caps. Today there are huge differences in SIM card prices between the Member States: for phone calls some seven times and for data 35 times or even a hundred times if I look at my home country, Finland, and compare, as there operators do not limit data volumes at all on the monthly bill. Fair use policy is needed to avoid abusive use, and so as not to put an additional burden on consumers. It is clear that we cannot all order the cheapest SIM cards in Europe and make that operator pay the local operator whose network we will actually use. Mobile usage also varies a lot, with the average use of data ranging from some 0.30 gigabytes to some 10 gigabytes a month. The good news is that investing in capacity will dramatically bring down the unit cost, and data is the most important – if not everywhere, let me tell you that it will be soon. Cheap and fast data is our aim because we are aiming for the gigabyte society. We need low enough wholesale caps so that all operators can provide roaming free services and the telecom sector remains competitive, as stated in the digital single market strategy. Then there is less need and less fear of restriction on the roaming free services and fair use policy will not be used to limit the right of Europeans to have ‘roam like at home’. I think the fair use policy needs to be clarified to a certain extent. Fair rules for consumers and information are needed.

The Commission, together with operators and national regulatory authorities, must work together to ensure a harmonised fair use policy within the European Union.

Cross-border phone calls, SMS, they are too often expensive for most consumers and are an obstacle to the completion of the single telecom and digital market. The revision of the regulatory framework for electronic communications is a good opportunity to address this issue as well.

We promised citizens a total ban on roaming, not 90 days of credit. There should be no limit in terms of timing or volume. Therefore, I welcome the Commission’s new approach to fair use of free roaming, which does not impose any maximum restrictions. However, I still have some serious concerns, especially when it comes to consumer protection.  First, rules should not be based on the assumption that the ‘roam like home’ principle will be abused by operators and bona fide consumers. It is normal that once the roaming charges are removed, people will use this service more. Consumers should not be penalised simply because they use a service that was previously too expensive or because no travel occurred in the last 12 months, as the Commission seems to imply. Second, the Commission needs to clarify how, when and what will trigger the fair clause. How will consumers be protected from abusive contractual clauses and subjective assessments added to the non-exhaustive lists of criteria that the telecom companies will use to identify abusive behaviour? Third, the unfair definitions on matters such as periodical travelling, abusive use or anomalous use could lead to different practices among Member States. How will the Commission ensure the application of a more harmonised fair use policy which does not confuse consumers across borders and, more importantly, does not disappoint them? Fourth, the stable link requirements must be simple and sensible without imposing unnecessary administrative burdens on the consumer. Last, but not least, we also need strong data protection and consumer privacy safeguards and proper complaint mechanisms.

I, too, would prefer that we do not have to regulate so that competition forces prices to fall, but there is no competition and the consumer, when choosing an offer in his own country, is mainly guided by the prices of domestic calls. As a result, foreign talks are horrendously expensive. I agree with everyone who said: Roam like at home is supposed to make Europe our home. We should therefore not be charged for cross-border contacts, since there are no borders. To conclude with one sentence: I very much regret that the proposal to regulate the prices of cross-border telephones within the European Union was not included in the last package and we, the European Parliament, will add it to the European Commission's proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2151, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Lefteris CHRISTOFOROU", "mepid": "26837", "text": "   Mr President, no matter how much one tries to find a problem or a flaw in this very important proposal and in this important work carried out by the Commission and the European Union, it will not succeed, because this measure is indeed a purely social measure, it is a measure that actually removes borders, it is a measure in favour of consumers, it is a measure that strengthens the social face and social sensitivity of the European Union.

If I can just agree with Jens Rohde that time was too limited to broach all those difficult questions within one minute or even four minutes. It is practically impossible. So let’s remember from where we started. A Member of the European Parliament, Viviane Reding, made a proposal and then we started to decrease roaming surcharges. But just one and a half years ago we were faced with the ‘5+5+5’ proposal: five minutes in five days in a year, ‘roam like at home.’ And people had to be happy about this proposal.  We had hot debates and we were able to find a solution. Thanks to this, roaming surcharges have decreased by 75% since this May. This is the first year people have said that they did not feel as if somebody was murdering their wallets when spending their summer holidays in other countries. In comparison with 2009 prices, we can say that the cost of roaming surcharges for calls, and SMS messages have decreased by 92%, and even by 96% for data.  Today, many of you said that that we are bullish with regard to roaming surcharges. It is not a done deal yet and finalising the whole process is very complicated.  As was mentioned by Mr Pereira, Member States are in very different situations. In southern countries operators had to make investments to provide services to tourists visiting those countries only during the three summer months. It means that those operators are not able to get revenues during the other nine months. Of course I am simplifying the situation. It means they have the right to ask for higher prices. And this is the reason why they have blocked this wholesale reform. There is now a blocking minority in the south and also in the north.  What is wrong in the north? Nothing is wrong, but, as Miapetra Kumpula-Natri knows, in Finland for example, for the same price you can get 100 times as many gigabytes than in Hungary. While the average consumption of gigabytes in the European Union is just one gigabyte per month, in Finland it is 10 gigabytes per month. Nevertheless, I think if this pattern of trips made by Europeans during the year does not change then the majority of service providers will survive. It means we have to prevent abuse of the system, because people will not start to travel just to avoid high roaming surcharges.  So fair use policies are, of course, important. As we know, we decided to withdraw this proposal based on daily limits. According to Eurostat, just 0.1% of all trips last longer than 92 days. So practically, financially in real life this is not an issue, and it was not an issue. We have made new proposals based on residency, and I think they are better proposals. But we have to deal with wholesale prices. Today, I still think EUR 50 for one gigabyte is too much. It is too much, and even the proposal we made from the European Commission – EUR 8.50 per gigabyte – still leaves space to decrease wholesale prices.  We have to find a good compromise which allows us to protect those investments made in southern countries to provide services to tourists and also to protect those consumers in Scandinavian countries, for example, who love those generous offers with really affordable prices. So – as I said – I am sorry to say that is not yet a done deal. The European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament have to work together to find the right balance, and we have to be keep our promises. We have to abolish roaming surcharges in the European Union. I am looking forward to a fruitful cooperation with you.

The current proposal is in the right direction, but I strongly believe that it should be an occasion for measures to set a cap on mobile pay that is in line with the purchasing power of citizens.  A recent report was published according to which users of prepaid mobile services in my country Bulgaria pay some of the highest fees for prepaid mobile services in the world. Is that fair?

Author. Mr President, Commissioner Jourova, Representative of the Council, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Thank you both for being here today. Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor's Office have been negotiating in the Council since 2013, and no general approach has yet been reached on either. The Slovak Presidency is very ambitious and has announced that it will also take decisive steps at the European Public Prosecutor's Office, so that the European Public Prosecutor's Office will also be included in the main agenda item of the JHA Council next week. It appears that the dossier of the European Public Prosecutor's Office is on the right track, and Commissioner Jourova has also repeated on several occasions that the European Public Prosecutor's Office is an absolute priority for her.  However, we in Parliament still have a great many unanswered questions and are pleased that we are taking this time for this joint debate this evening. I would like to apologise to Mrs Matera, because unfortunately she cannot be here today. You, in her capacity as rapporteur for the European Public Prosecutor's Office, and I, in my capacity as rapporteur for Eurojust, have now also worked with S&amp;D, ALDE and the Greens on a joint motion for a resolution, and on this point we are in favour of the following points across all political groups and collectively: we are in favour of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and also of the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. We call on the Council to explain the competences of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, both investigative and indictment powers. We regret that, in the case of disputes between the European Public Prosecutor's Office and the national law enforcement authorities, the final decision does not rest with an independent court such as the Court of Justice of the European Union. We are in favour of the independence of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and, in this context, we are also addressing legal assistance and access to information. We call on the Council to end the negotiations on the PIF Directive. In this context, we also want vat fraud to be included in the scope of the PIF Directive.  We also call on the Commission to give an assessment of the impact on Eurojust of the collegial structure of a public prosecutor's office. We underline the role and importance of Eurojust, and we call on the Council to clearly regulate the relationship between the Eurojust Public Prosecutor's Office and OLAF. Finally, we are also in favour of Eurojust and the Public Prosecutor's Office operating from one location. Organised crime knows no borders, and organised groups and terrorists operate globally. However, offences affecting the EU budget are also cross-border. And cross-border fraud, such as VAT carousel fraud, but also any form of fraud against the EU budget is also a fraud against our citizens. We therefore call on the Council to make decisive efforts to speed up the negotiations, particularly on the European Public Prosecutor's Office.  Nevertheless, there are a lot of unresolved questions for us. In my opinion, the collegial structure of the European Public Prosecutor's Office is completely exaggerated and, in my view, not what the legislator wanted in Article 86 of the Treaty. How does the Council enface the system of the European Public Prosecutor and the 28 representatives? Who is to pay for all this? Where does this money come from? Is this really so necessary? And are we not thereby creating a body which, in its structure, resembles Eurojust, but which in reality is devoted only to one competence, namely fraud against the EU budget? This is an important task, which is also called for by the Treaties under Article 86. Nevertheless, we should also leave the church in the village here – it would be as if we in the European Parliament also had 28 deputies of our President of Parliament, which would then be like a Commission, and that will be a very expensive undertaking.  Nor do I want to undermine the importance of the rapid creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. However, we must also realise that we should not achieve something that creates additional bureaucracy or unnecessary bureaucracy. That is why the Public Prosecutor's Office and Eurojust should also operate in one place and under one roof, and that is probably the will of the legislator in Article 86.  Eurojust has seen an increase in the number of cases – cybercrime, terrorism, the migration crisis – and at the same time, jobs are to be cut or the budget to shrink. This does not really fit with the current requirements.  Which one are the exact effects to be expected for Eurojust? What is the financial impact of the creation of the Public Prosecutor's Office on Eurojust? What does this mean for staff? How many jobs should be cut? What does this mean for infrastructure? What is the operation between Eurojust and the Public Prosecutor's Office? And what I really attach particular importance to is that we will have a very clear procedure – and not duplicate structures or competences in cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office with Eurojust and Europol.  What will happen to OLAF in this context? What should be the cooperation with the national public prosecutors? How should cooperation with national tax authorities be organised? What are the powers of law enforcement when the perpetrator or perpetrator commits several crimes at different times? And what are the powers when the same acts are committed by several offences at the same time? And how do we deal with it?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2165, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the author of the question rightly reminds us that this proposal has been on the table for quite some time, for three years exactly. I remember when it was placed under the leadership of Madam Reding. It is no surprise that this has been on the table for some time, given the sensitivity of this proposal, because in fact the regulation deals with many complex issues which lie at the heart of the criminal law systems of the Member States. Let me update you on the state of play of our work. After very intensive and constructive work, we have now reached a point where the Member States agree on most of the provisions in the draft Regulation, and it looks possible that negotiations in Council can be concluded in the near future. The Presidency is treating the discussions with the highest priority with the objective of closing the file by the end of the year. In this context, we are ready to work – let me underscore this –very closely with Parliament.  Let me briefly mention one issue that has been raised in earlier contacts with Parliament and which is very important for all of us, namely the need to ensure that the Office is both independent and efficient. Let me explain in more detail: the current structure of the Office builds on the idea that the College Member of a given Member State will be in charge of investigations and prosecutions in his or her Member State of origin, and will supervise them. This organisation has been chosen mainly for practical reasons, in particular with a view to ensuring the efficiency of the Office. The legal systems and cultures of the Member States still vary to a considerable degree, and it is clear that only a prosecutor with his or her background in a given legal system will be able to know exactly what actions are most appropriate and efficient in that given state.  I can assure you that the Council wishes to ensure that there is no ambiguity on these issues. The Council remains convinced that the structure proposed in the current text fully ensures the independence of each European Prosecutor and of the Office as such. I also believe that the current Council text is, by and large, in line with the main wishes and expectations of Parliament. A detailed picture of the state of play on the draft European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) regulation, containing all the provisions of the regulation that ministers have preliminarily agreed upon, is freely accessible. This draft should be very close to final outcome. However the documents still do not include a number of provisions: on judicial review, cooperation between the EPPO and Eurojust and relations with third countries. These provisions will be included in a new consolidated version, which will hopefully be completed in the coming weeks. The main task of the Presidency is now to ensure that outstanding reservations are resolved and that the few remaining gaps in the text are filled. In other words, the Council is relatively close to an agreement on the full text.  As noted in your question, it is also clear that the EPPO regulation must be made coherent with the Eurojust regulation and with the directive on the protection of the Union’s financial interests or ‘PIF directive’. The Council adopted its general approach on the Eurojust regulation in March last year and is ready to start negotiations with Parliament at any time. Certain provisions need to be coordinated with the EPPO regulation, but we do not foresee major difficulties. The Council agrees with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) that it would be useful to ensure that the PIF directive is adopted before or at least around the time of adoption of the regulation. The negotiations on the PIF directive have been on hold since last year, but I am confident that the Council and Parliament will find a compromise solution in the near future. As regards the financial analysis, the Commission is studying this important but complex issue, and it is likely that the Commissioner is better placed to reply to this question. From the point of view of the Council, I would like to underline that it is generally agreed that Eurojust must continue to have sufficient resources to fulfil its tasks in an efficient manner. The EPPO regulation should, for this reason, a priori not have any significant impact on the Eurojust budget.  Finally, the exact nature of the operational, organisational and administrative links between the EPPO and Eurojust is one of the last issues which are still under discussion in the Council. The Council is working on a model according to which the EPPO may rely on the support and resources of the administration of Eurojust, and where Eurojust will provide certain services to the EPPO. Whether there is a need to define these services, or if this could be left to the two bodies, is still under discussion.  It is thus still too early to give a detailed account of the links between the EPPO and Eurojust. We will come back to you with a more precise reply in the coming months. Let me however assure you that our aim is to ensure that the bodies complement each other, and that there is no duplication of work. The creation of the EPPO must not lead to any weakening of Eurojust.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2166, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, as we all know, we face some crucial challenges in Europe in the area of security, but also regarding our prosperity.  We have a problem because crime does not know borders, as Mr Voss said before. This goes for big scope crime against EU money, including big cross—border VAT fraud. Crime is harming our economies and decreasing taxpayers’ trust. It is our duty to fight against this crime, which can be done only by joining forces. I am speaking about a pan-European issue that cannot be resolved by national authorities only. As you may know, Eurojust and OLAF are not equipped to lead criminal investigations and prosecutions, and national authorities are facing limits in addressing fraud cases, either for political or resources reasons. That is why I see the European Public Prosecutor as a specialised body dealing with financial crime in the EU, having the necessary competence to investigate and prosecute. We need a European Public Prosecutor to deal with the alleged fraud cases we all read about in some cohesion countries, but we also need it to tackle the big VAT fraud cases, especially in the cross-border context – our very conservative estimation is around EUR 50 billion in revenues lost every year due to VAT fraud, and the real figure is probably much higher. We need an effective answer to these negative impacts on the EU budget, but also on national budgets.  So, where are we on this? I know, replying to questions one and two, we are – as you also heard from the Presidency – in the final stages of our negotiations, and the Commission fully supports the efforts of the Slovak Presidency to achieve a political deal on this by the end of this year. We are hopeful that the Council will be able to finalise the remaining chapters of the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of the EPPO, in particular the provisions on the judicial control of the Office and on relations with third countries and international organisations, with non-participating Member States and relations with Eurojust, in October. Provisions with respect to staff matters relating to the setting—up of the EPPO would also need to be added. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 October, the Slovak Presidency will present a complete consolidated text to seek the conceptual support of the Council on the revised provisions.  From the perspective of the Commission, the current Council text should still be improved on several points. Two should be highlighted in particular at this stage. The first one relates to competence. The priority competence of the EPPO on cases of fraud affecting the Union’s financial interests demands that the EPPO have access to information on all PIF cases. The EPPO needs to have competence to fight at least serious cross-border VAT fraud. Also, the rules on ancillary competence must not lead to a restriction of the EPPO’s core competence in the PIF area.  The second point is on efficiency, because the efficiency of the EPPO requires a flexible mechanism to redistribute work at central level between the European prosecutors, even if the general principle that European prosecutors supervise cases being handled in their respective Member States is maintained. As already stated on numerous previous occasions, the EPPO can only be launched with confidence if we streamline the rules concerning its competence, and strengthen the guarantees of independence, as well as the provisions on procedural rights. In addition, given that its material competence is defined by reference to the PIF Directive, finalising the directive is essential for setting up the EPPO.  Now let me reply to questions three and four. The EPPO, as a specialised body for financial crime, is to be seen as part of our overall structure in the European Union to combat crime effectively. Since Eurojust will no longer work on financial crimes against the EU budget (so-called ‘PIF cases’), it will be able to focus on the fight against terrorist threats or other crimes such as trafficking, drugs, and in our cooperation with neighbouring countries. In accordance with Article 31 of the Financial Regulation, the Commission’s services undertook an analysis of the financial impact of the changed EPPO structure and competence following the Council compromises. This paper, with initial working estimates, will be shared with you in parallel with Ministers, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 October. This estimate also takes into account the synergies and the future relationship between the EPPO and Eurojust. The Council model chosen for the EPPO, based on governance by a College, will create the need for new posts in the EPPO’s central office, but as a result of the EPPO’s shared, rather than exclusive, competence it will overall lead to a reduction of posts at central level when compared to the original Commission proposal. This will have an impact on costs. The cost implications of European delegated prosecutors (so-called EDPs) are still under discussion. It depends on how many EDPs will be appointed by the Member States. As regards benefits, the Commission expects that the inclusion of VAT fraud into the EPPO’s competence will bring considerable benefits in comparison to today’s situation where especially large intra-Community VAT fraud cases often remain undetected or are not followed up effectively. As regards the involvement of national parliaments, the Council supports the approach proposed by the Commission whereby the European Chief Prosecutor or one of the deputies may be requested to appear before national parliaments to give account of the general activities of the EPPO. Such appearances should be without prejudice to the EPPO’s obligation of discretion and confidentiality as regards individual cases and personal data.  Axel Voss raised a lot of other questions here, and I can confirm what you also heard from the Minister that we are ready to come back between October and December, when we will go through a decisive period for the final version of EPPO and reply to all your questions, both regarding the text and regarding the relation between the EPPO, Eurojust and OLAF, and all the other practical matters, especially the financial conditions. I only wanted to declare here today that we are working on the cost—benefit conditions for the EPPO, with full regard and full respect to the value of money, which means that we need to do the right thing, to do it in the right way, and to do it for the least possible money. So this is our aim, and that is also why we are working now on a very precise financial analysis.  As for Eurojust, I am not someone who would like to establish a new body for combating serious crime in Europe by devastating the other one. I see the clear picture of combating crime in Europe, standing on three very strong legs: one is OLAF, which has to continue its work; the second is Eurojust, which should focus more on crimes other than financial crime; and the third is the EPPO, with full prosecuting competence. I believe that for the near future, from 2019 we will be able to do this reorganisation so that we will be able at European level to address all of the serious crime which the Member States cannot investigate and prosecute efficiently. It is all about this. We are not replacing here the prosecution at national level; we are setting up a layer above it so that we are jointly more successful.  Finally, let me thank Madam Viviane Reding, who is the mother of the proposal, for giving me the chance to continue what she started. I can only declare here that I will try to be a good stepmother to this proposal and I will do my best to push it to a successful result.

Because every year the Commission states the same thing in its report on the protection of the EU's financial interests, namely that the national authorities only pursue to a limited extent suspected cases against the EU budget sent to them by OLAF. It is unacceptable that these crimes should be insufficiently investigated and that fraudsters should not end up in court. It is therefore right to create a European Public Prosecutor's Office.  However, there can be no free pass for the negotiations in the Council on this European project. The European Public Prosecutor's Office only makes sense if it means real added value for the protection of European taxpayers' money. I would like to mention three points that need to be ensured: firstly, and this also played a role here, there is an inseparable link between the so-called PIF directive and the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The PIF Directive must specify the offences for which the authorities can investigate and prosecute. VAT fraud must, in any case, be included.  Secondly, efficiency must be ensured, and here the division of labour with the national authorities must be clearly regulated. Thirdly, the independence of the European Public Prosecutor's Office must be ensured. Particular attention must be paid to this, particularly in view of the envisaged automatic link between a European Public Prosecutor and cases from his own country of origin.

Mr President, 40 years ago the idea of creating a European public prosecutor's office was born. 40 years later, and since 2013, a legislative proposal has been on the table. Today, after three years of negotiations between the States with the Council, what is left on the merits? Three or four points.  First of all, we wanted a European prosecutor's office responsible for serious cross-border crime, transnational crimes, transnational terrorism, because if criminals and crimes have no borders, our investigations and criminal prosecutions should not have them either. This is the popular saying: the gendarmes must have at least the same weapons as the thieves. What's left?  Firstly, a European public prosecutor's office which will only be responsible for the protection of the Union's financial interests. It is true that, in the current context, with the increase in serious organized crime and criminal networks, it was time to limit the powers of such a prosecutor's office. Secondly, a European Prosecutor's Office, moreover, is limited within this competence to combat fraud against the Union's financial interests, since the Council has introduced limiting thresholds. Thus, in the case of co-financing, if the Union does not contribute more than 50% of the amount invested, the prosecutor's office will not be competent. However, everyone knows, especially in the European institutions, that the Union mostly funds projects at less than 50%. Thirdly, an incompetent European prosecutor's office where fraud is linked to another form of crime, such as trafficking or money laundering. Fourthly, a European public prosecutor's office with no jurisdiction over VAT fraud, Commissioner, you have pointed out the principle and you have pointed out the estimated shortfall that this represents, since the Council refuses to include VAT in the directive on the protection of the Union's financial interests. This is a border fraud par excellence.  Secondly, and it is obvious, we want an independent European public prosecutor's office that can conduct its investigations and investigations independently of national interests. What's left here, too? A European prosecutor's office whose structure will be decentralized, a prosecutor's office with a complex organisation tied up by the omnipresence of the national link, a prosecutor's office that will not be competent as a last resort, since in the event of conflicts of division of powers between a national authority and the prosecutor's office, it is the national authority that will decide as a last resort.  Commissioner, the outcome of the negotiations in the Council is simply worrying.

Many years have passed since then – and we have just heard it – many years of negotiation.  We have had a special committee here in this House to combat organised crime, money laundering and corruption, in which it has become abundantly clear how important it is for an independent European Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate these crimes across borders, and that is why it is good that the Presidency is now taking this into its own hands and that we seem to be on the last few metres to reach an agreement.  But there are still a few unanswered questions, and I would like to add a few: how many Member States will be there in the end? It will be important that as many Member States as possible actually participate in this European Public Prosecutor's Office. It is not acceptable that all the Member States have been calling for cooperation and coordination in recent times, but that in the end no one wants to be coordinated by such a joint public prosecutor. This must be made clear, and we must also put a little emphasis on the fact that everyone is there.  And how far does the scope of application go? I believe it has become clear here that the European Parliament is clearly in favour of the large-scale VAT fraud being included in the scope. I believe it is important that this should now be regulated again.  Finally, it is important that we continue to create common minimum standards in criminal proceedings.

In criminal justice, it is simple cooperation that European states need, not integration. Like me, the French Senate has denounced this project as too centralizing. He rightly believes that he is in breach of the principle of subsidiarity. But in my opinion, the principle of subsidiarity is a decoy. For the Union, as Philippe Séguin said, it is not a legal principle, but a principle of efficiency that it uses to do what it wants, when it wants. The main thing is said, the rest is secondary.

Why are we establishing an EPPO which needs to have clear added-value? We see the statistics of OLAF: on average only about 40% of the recommendations of OLAF are sent to the Member States with a clear purpose: investigate and prosecute. We have been saying for years: what can we do? The Member States do not prosecute and we cannot remain helpless. We must act here. I am not criticising any specific Member State, but this is the general situation.  VAT: yes, it must be included in PIF and the EPPO because, besides the many arguments which you have set out here, we have also case law. We have the case which clearly stipulates that VAT is a source for the financial budget.  With regards to VAT, believe me, it is not easy to push the EPPO towards its final adoption because we needed to open the second line of negotiations vis-a-vis the ministers of finance and vis-a-vis the tax authorities, because we will need also all these authorities to be on our side. Then, especially, when the EPPO is working fully, we will need not only national prosecutors, but also the police, tax authorities – and whistle-blowers – to cooperate with the EPPO. We will need the cooperation of a very wide and complex puzzle of institutions at the Member States’ level. So that is why we need to do this right and in a convincing way so that it will bring real added value.  This added value can be, and must be, measured by finance. Of course these are the benefits which we speak about: the money which will one day be brought back to national budgets and the EU budget. We are working on setting up the proper threshold for structural funds and agricultural funds and customs: at the moment this is EUR 10 000, but we will continue to discuss this. For VAT it should be really only a big scope of fraud, so we speak about three or five million euro for cross-border VAT fraud. I want to have the EPPO doing big things. It should not be established, as I said before, to replace national prosecution; it must do only big things creating big benefits. Yes, we need unanimity in the Council. So this will need a very strong push in regard to several Member States. For me it is clear that the cohesion countries, especially, must be there because it would not be logically if we established the EPPO to prosecute fraud on EU funds without having some of the Member States which receive the money, which receive more than they contribute. So here I have had, along with my colleagues, a lot of work in some of the Member States. The final point: speaking about the benefits. I spoke about the financial benefits, but here we must be fully aware that it is the thrust of the people in Europe, taxpayers, at stake.  I am always absolutely frustrated when I hear the critics, and I read the articles of the critics of the EU, who say that structural funds are only a source for fraud and corruption. Where is all that ethos? This is the policy of solidarity. The rich countries are contributing money to the poorer countries and the critics say it is only there to be stolen and cheated on, and all those benefits, all those good projects, all the jobs and all that prosperity, which has been created over years thanks to this money, is forgotten.  I think that we need to act here and to show taxpayers and all those critics that yes, this is the distribution of massive amounts of money, but the money is well managed and controlled. It is our duty to act, and to create the EPPO as a really strong, competent and functioning European body.  We have three decisive months ahead of us and I count on your support so that we will manage first the negotiations in the Council and also the consent in Parliament to be achieved in a reasonably short time.

At the same time, we have heard you highlight many aspects that we need to address in the remaining period of negotiations during the Slovak Presidency.  I would like to make just two points here in my concluding remarks. First of all, it is clear to the Presidency that we need to ensure that outstanding reservations are lifted in the period remaining and that the gaps in the text must be addressed properly. I dare say that we are close to finalising the text and getting an agreement on it. We will, of course, include some of the outstanding provisions, like judicial review cooperation between EPPO and Eurojust, in the new consolidated version. Second, as many of you have indicated, it is vital that the EPPO Regulation be made coherent with the Eurojust Regulation and with the PIF Directive. It is clear that we need to make progress on this because the PIF Directive should contain the substantive law to be applied by EPPO. So that message is well taken, Mrs Gräßle, and the Presidency will try to address it in the remaining period. I wish to thank Members once again and look forward to further cooperation.

Vat must in any event remain in the Union's Financial Interests Protection (PIF) Directive, thereby falling within the remit of the General Prosecutor's Office. Therefore, it should not be allowed for the Public Prosecutor's Office to have jurisdiction only if the EU is concerned above 50%, since the European impact of VAT is necessarily below that threshold. Vat, recognised by the Court of Justice, is the Union's own financial resource and, as such, must be able to be substantially protected, especially if the system of cross-border VAT fraud is popular in many EU countries and cannot or is not effectively detected by the authorities of the Member States.

In particular, the rules regarding the recognition of losses incurred in the banking system. In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the international financial reporting standard IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), addressing some aspects of the financial crisis and its impact on the banking sector, as its key response.  In early 2016, the Commission referred the draft implementing measure for international financial reporting standards (financial instruments) to Parliament for scrutiny. On 7 October 2016, the three-month scrutiny period for this important financial reporting standard will end.  The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) had started its scrutiny activities already well before this official referral of the measure by the Commission. These activities have been conducted very thoroughly. The activities included the commissioning of four external studies on IFRS 9 and public scrutiny events during ECON Committee time, for example, a public hearing. In addition, the newly established IFRS permanent team conducted several meetings on this issue. The International Accounting Standards Board, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, the Commission and the stakeholders have been invited for an exchange of views on IFRS 9. On 7 June 2016, Parliament adopted a resolution on International Accounting Standards evaluation and the activities of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group and the Public Interest Oversight Board, which also addressed some of the issues.  In addition, the ECON Committee had already written in January 2016 a letter to the Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) expressing its concern about the lack of reliable quantitative data assessment. The impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 on financial instability in general, and on the amount of loan loss provisioning and banks regulation capital in particular, is of especial concern to the Committee. The Committee requested further analysis from the ESRB of the impact of IFRS 9, especially on financial stability. Another letter was written by the ECON Committee to the Commission in June 2016 addressing additional concerns. These related to possible negative effects of the implementation of IFRS 9 on crucial long-term investment and on the misalignment of the effective dates of IFRS 9 and the upcoming new insurance standard IFRS 17, which will replace the current insurance standard IFRS 4. In this regard the IASB published in September 2016 amendments to IFRS 4, addressing some concerns regarding the insurance issue.  This oral question on IFRS 9 to the Commission and the motion for a resolution which will be voted on on Thursday, reflect the various concerns which Parliament and the ECON Committee have brought forward during its scrutiny activities.

Investors and other users of financial information must be able to rely on it. We do not develop the standards ourselves but use those developed by the International Accounting Standards Board. It is for this reason that we have a rigorous endorsement process to test each standard to determine whether it should be adopted into EU law. The scrutiny period by Parliament is an important part of this process. International Reporting Standard 9 is an important standard for financial services companies and governs the accounting for most assets and liabilities on bank balance sheets. It is for this reason that we are here today.  The financial crisis showed that financial accounting has economic consequences. The G20 called on the Standards Board to develop a new approach to accounting for losses on lending so as to avoid reporting too little, too late and the new standard achieves this fundamental change. We assess whether a standard will be conducive to the European public good. For this reason we asked the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, our adviser on the reporting standard, to consider a number of areas of concern in developing its endorsement advice. Your question reflects some of these areas. First, we wanted to understand its effects on long—term investment. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group did not expect that Reporting Standard 9 would lead to significant changes in long—term investment strategies, a finding that we recently confirmed. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor this area carefully and will work with the Advisory Group and the Standards Board to assess whether a change in the standard would be necessary.  Secondly, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group identified a limitation in the standard for insurance entities. These will face a huge challenge in their accounting for their liabilities relating to their insurance contracts, which will come on board in 2020 or 2021. However, Reporting Standard 9, which covers the accounting for investments backing those liabilities, is effective from 2018. This misalignment of dates could give rise to volatility in reported results, as well as leading to higher costs in implementing the two standards. We therefore support a deferral of Standard 9 for the insurance industry. The International Accounting Standards Board has developed an optional temporary deferral solution which we will propose for endorsement as it will bring relief to most large pure insurance groups in the EU. The solution also includes a form of relief for bank insurers who will not qualify for a full deferral. Most Member States and the European supervisory authorities support this solution. Nevertheless, we are currently considering whether it is satisfactory for Europe as a whole. We are assessing whether the lack of a full deferral could create a significant competitive disadvantage for bank insurers compared to pure insurance groups. If we were to conclude that such risk exists, we would extend the scope of the Standards Board deferral to the bank insurers, taking into consideration that this is a temporary measure. However, we have not yet arrived at this conclusion.  Thirdly, based on the advice of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, which drew on input from the European Central Bank and the European supervisory authorities, we believe that Reporting Standard 9 should be an improvement over its predecessor in the area of financial stability. The Commission, together with the European Banking Association and the Basel Committee, is assessing the need for a transitional phasing—in of the prudential capital effects arising from the new impairment model in Reporting Standard 9 so as to prevent a sudden impact on capital ratios when the standard is first applied. I should like to thank you and, in particular, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the International Financial Reporting Standard permanent team under the chairmanship of Mr Stolojan for the detailed and careful consideration of this standard.  In conclusion, we strongly believe that International Financial Reporting Standard 9 should be endorsed, but our work on the standard will not stop with its endorsement. We will be vigilant to avoid any unintended consequences.

We therefore support the process of adopting the standard in the European Union. We are convinced that it will in particular allow banks to apply a loss recognition policy earlier.

I would also like to thank my colleague Theodor Stolojan, who is very effective and intelligent in leading our working group. The accounting standards developed in the wake of the financial crisis, as you pointed out, were primarily for banks, since the financial crisis revealed the need to strengthen the strength of the global financial system, including through these accounting standards. It was in this spirit, and in line with the conclusions of the G20 in London in April 2009, that accounting regulators worked to replace the IAS 39 standard. It was this reflection that led, in July 2014, to the publication by the IASB of the finalized version of the IFRS 9 accounting standard, which aims to ensure greater transparency on credit risk in financial statements, through an approach to asset impairment that should be more responsive to changes in the credit cycle. THE IFRS 9 standard is initially designed to apply to banking institutions and, as a result, two questions arise: first, in the absence of a real impact study, there are concerns about the potential effects of applying this standard on investment, as it could introduce volatility into accounts unrelated to the economic reality of a long-term lender. In a way, we would like to refer here to the concept of a \"public good\" as developed by Maystadt in its report. Isn't long-term investment the public good par excellence, especially since we are in this troubled time? Second, we are concerned , as you mentioned , about the impact of this standard on the banking sector—insurance, and we obviously want to continue our work and our intelligence cooperation with EFRAG and its new president.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2195, "date": "2016-10-04.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Mr President, I welcome the scrutiny of the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, and given the concerns that have been raised, I welcome this short discussion. It is important that measures to represent big changes to the norm, particularly in the financial sector, must be given as much assessment as possible. I very much agree with the principle of what IFRS 9 seeks to achieve, namely to prevent some of the problems that we have encountered in the financial crisis by moving towards a model with banks recognising expected losses and financial assets on the balance sheet. This is a welcome step given that, until now, banks have been unable to book accounting losses until they happened, even if they could see them coming down the line. This could prevent a number of problems.  What concerns me most about the introduction of the IFRS 9, however, is the uncertainty it seems to be generating in the financial sector. It is reported that two-thirds of banks are still unsure how IFRS 9 will affect their balance sheet, and I hope the European Commission can offer some assurances on this issue. Ensuring the same mistakes are not made again is crucial, but there is definitely a need to ensure that unintended negative effects on the economy are avoided, and I welcome the Commissioner’s comments in this regard a few moments ago. Finally, I just want to conclude by saying that the introduction to the IFRS 9 can hopefully find a good solution that allows ample time for the financial sector to adapt to the changes.
