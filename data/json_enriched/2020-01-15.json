As Prime Minister Plenković told you yesterday, as far as the Council is concerned, we are starting work to define our position regarding the establishment of the Conference. As you know, the December European Council gave us guidance to this effect. We believe that priority should be given to the implementation of the strategic agenda for 2019-2024, agreed in June last year, and to delivering concrete results for the benefit of our citizens. The priorities outlined in the strategic agenda closely echo those raised by our citizens, for instance in the citizen consultations and dialogues. The Conference should build on the success of these dialogues over the last two years. Yesterday, my Prime Minister underlined how the Conference could be an opportunity to listen to citizens so that we are better able to meet their expectations.  We think the Conference should contribute to the development of our policies in the medium and long term so that we can better tackle current and future challenges. We also believe the upcoming Conference should be an inclusive process, involving our three institutions in full respect of the interinstitutional balance of our respective roles. Likewise, Member States should equally be involved, including their parliaments. Shared ownership is important.  The European Council asked the Croatian Presidency to work towards defining a Council position on the content, scope, composition and functioning of a Conference on the Future of Europe and to engage on this basis with the European Parliament and the Commission. We are indeed starting this work and I can announce to you that, today in Brussels, ambassadors will have a first informal exchange of views to that end, and that the General Affairs Council on 28 January will discuss the issue. We will listen to your debate on the Parliament’s position and read your resolution attentively. We also look forward to the Commission’s input, which we understand will come back next week. Thank you very much for your attention.

As a previous Member of this House, I consider the European Parliament as a close friend. Today I stand before you, honourable Members, still as your friend and now also as your partner in my new role as Vice-President for Democracy and Demography. Like you, I know how important citizens are to European policy-making: after all we are making these decisions to their benefit. However, we have not always got that right – this must be acknowledged. Now we have an opportunity to reflect with citizens, to listen to them, to connect and engage, to answer and explain, to build trust and confidence in each other between the European Union and citizens. This is an important part of what the Conference on the Future of Europe is about. We are at a key moment in European political history and are facing a unique opportunity, as well as a challenge. Getting this right will have repercussions, not just for the present but for the future. It is up to us all to make this a success. Honourable Members, let me be very clear: we are no longer politics as business as usual. The old way of doing politics no longer works. Citizens want us to hear them, and we must listen to them and give them the feedback they need. Cooperation and courage are the new keywords in this process. We must be brave and find new creative and innovative solutions to make our democracy work even better for citizens. We must do this together as partners: the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. To this end, a joint declaration from all three institutions can pave the way for this unique partnership. But partnership does not stop with these three institutions. Member States and their national parliaments must also be involved. Their cooperation will be an asset to this process. To ensure we reach every citizen, especially those who do not always engage directly with us, we rely heavily on cooperation with the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. I am committed to visiting regions in my role as Vice-President, and I want to hear from citizens from all corners of the European Union. Shall we stop here, dear colleagues? Certainly not: this is an open process. As the Conference progresses, hopefully, others will join us. There are two strands to this process. One on policy, with debates clustered around the themes, including the Commission’s political priorities and the European Council strategic agenda. The second strand addresses institutional topics such as the election of the President of the Commission and transnational lists. Here, the role of the Commission is that of honest broker. My colleague, Vice-President Věra Jourová, is responsible for following this institutional strand. The European Commission will adopt its contribution to the shaping of the conference in its Communication on 22 January next week. This Communication is the Commission’s contribution to the discussion that needs to be held in the coming weeks between the three institutions aimed at agreeing together on the scope, formal structure and objectives of the Conference. This would be the content of the joint declaration I referred to earlier. Once the General Affairs Council has discussed the Conference on the future of Europe on 28 January, we will be able to move to the next phase, including to determine the date for the start of the conference, ideally in the first half of 2020. And what better date for this than 9 May – Europe day – which is a date of such importance for all of us? I can already see the potential for a fruitful partnership with the European Parliament, given the priorities we share. In his role as Vice-President for Interinstitutional Relations, my colleague Maroš Šefčovič, will join us in this work. Honourable Members, as directly-elected representatives of the citizens, you are crucial to this process, and I welcome the resolution of this House, as well as your commitment not to pre-determine the outcome of the Conference. I believe that pre-determining the outcome would cause more damage to democracy than if it did nothing at all. So no pre-determining from our side. Honourable Members, by confirming me in my post as Vice-President for Democracy and Demography, you have shown that you have placed your trust in me. Just as it is important to build trust with the citizens, I want to build trust with you, and I look forward to hearing your views.

As you know, the conference was the result of a request from the European Parliament that The President of the Commission, Mrs von der Leyen, met last July, after the European elections, when it became clear to everyone that certain mechanisms of democratic governance need to be reviewed and rearranged, and of course we want – and this is the opinion of the whole Parliament – that this should be done with the national institutions but above all on a path of listening to the citizens. I believe that the resolution that the plenary will vote on today will be the start of a season of reform, not predetermined, but certainly of great impetus, because we need democracy to work and, above all, for democracy to be useful to the citizens. I believe that this is in the interests of the European institutions but, as a whole, of the Union. That is why we want this process to focus on the citizens. I believe that today, for this Parliament, is an important and shared day from this point of view with all the political groups, on a path of listening, discussion and dialogue, naturally with all the European institutions. We will succeed if the European institutions can walk together.

The second largest democracy on the globe. That is the starting point for our debate, so people believe in Europe; people trust in Europe; people want to contribute to the future of Europe. The key question is now: does my vote count? Does it really have an impact? And there we know an improvement is possible, and that’s why the next decade must be a decade of strengthening European democracy.  What are the principles for the working structure for us as the PPE Group? The first and most important point already mentioned is people’s involvement. So, to find a way to get in touch with the ideas of our citizens to involve them in the process. The second thing is that Parliament is in the lead. That we are the representatives of the citizens. We are representing the political landscape of the European Union of today – geographically, politically, from the content point of view. We are representing a Parliament where we really respect the free mandate in a very, very positive sense. For me as a group leader, it’s always difficult to manage the unity of the group. We have a real free mandate and that’s good, and we have, together with the Commission and Council, a good working relationship.  First of all I want to underline that with Dobrevka as Vice-President responsible for the issue, we really can work very strongly together. And another element for these principles is to involve the national parliaments. All of these issues are agreed, but again, the ‘re-parliamentarisation’ of the European Union is for our group, a key element. That is the working structure and then about the direction.  Democracy is based on two principles – on candidates and on a programme. You have this for a mayor, you have this for a chancellor candidate and for us it’s also important to implement this on a European level for becoming the Commission President, for example. So the old debates on the Spitzenkandidat concept, last year we failed with this idea, it is still our interest as the PPE and we want to make this Spitzenkandidat process a binding process for the upcoming elections on the European level. We need a healthy competition between the European parties. That means we have to reflect again on the rules for the European political parties, and we have to consider how to strengthen the rights of this institution – the European Parliament – for example on the key issue, the question of right of initiative for the European Parliament, like all other parliaments have.  So that is what must be the direction for the future. More democratic – people decide. That is the best medicine against the anti-Europeans.  And finally, are we really prepared for the challenges of tomorrow? What can we do under the current Treaty, but also, is there a need for a Treaty change? That is another element which we want to discuss during the conference on the future of Europe. So let’s start today, let’s work and let’s have a new dream for Europe.

That day began a political adventure, in the world and in history. Six countries freely chose to unite their destinies to ensure peace and improve people's lives. But I was already saying that declaration that Europe would not be done at once, but throughout a constant evolution that should be based on solidarity. Now it is up to us to give it a new push to ensure that the European Union is able to guarantee peace in Europe and the world, and also to improve people's lives. Today our Union faces new challenges such as climate emergency, inequalities, digitisation. But also, unfortunately, attacks on the rule of law, the deterioration of the rule of law, and the populs. The Conference on the Future of Europe is therefore a unique opportunity, which we cannot miss, to update our Union by improving its capacity to meet the challenges. And it is also an opportunity to involve citizens, to listen to what the people of Europe expect and to know their proposals, so that they can also come from all sectors of society. This was the first major conference on the future of Europe, held in The Hague in 1948. Of course, today we have many more means and mechanisms to facilitate the participation of civil society. And we have to take advantage of them. The Socialists and Democrats want this to be a real dialogue with the public and to translate into concrete results. We will work to ensure that there is broad participation of the whole society, with a balance of gender, age and geographical origin. And, moreover, with all levels of representation: from the local to the European. Because everyone has something to contribute. Because Europe does not exist if there is not each of its towns and cities, which is where the policies we decided here in the European Parliament are finally implemented. Jean Monnet said that we are not here to coalition states, but to bring people together. Some seem unclear and are still bent on speaking in the national key. They don't realize that Europe adds up. That together we are stronger, and that in an increasingly difficult geopolitical context we need to strengthen our project. And we're not here to build a market either. We want to build a community, which is much more. That is why it is time to defend European democracy and remember that we must improve people's lives. For too long the Union has neglected the social pillar, and economic policies have not been accompanied by social measures. We have let poverty grow, and inequality to increase, and that can only increase populsy. We have taken great steps to advance the Europe of citizenship, and we must be proud. The Lisbon Treaty strengthened the European Parliament and has also introduced new instruments for citizen participation, but it is not enough. I hope that the conference on the future of Europe will open up new spaces to enrich the debate and to find innovative ideas that will improve our Union. We must refine the electoral system for the next election in 2024. In these seventy years we have come a long way and, above all, the European family has expanded. Only six countries started and we've become twenty-eight. With great sadness we say goodbye to a member, although I hope it is only temporarily. Let us see it as an opportunity to rethred the European project. Looking back to see the path traveled is a necessary exercise. So is remembering everything that brings us in. But even more important is to be aware that the future is in our hands, that we cannot fall into nostalgia, that every day we are building Europe. This is a community of destiny that belongs to all of us, and between all of us we must set the course.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we often say in this forum that diversity is an asset of Europe. Now, once again, we will have the opportunity to demonstrate that. The European elections have shown that European citizens believe in Europe, but they want a better, different Europe, a renewed Europe. The first change must be in how citizens are involved in these European processes because Europe was not created for Brussels or for an elite or for a bubble but to serve all citizens. The conference can become a great opportunity to renew Europe if we have the courage to get out of our procedural way of thinking and to really give citizens a voice in their diversity. Yet over the years we have often developed the feeling that Europe does not listen, that Europe means rules and constraints. The Europe that builds is often hidden behind restrictions. The conference is an opportunity to open the doors of Europe to the citizens and it is not for nothing that we defended the date of 9 May for its launch. We need to find solutions to involve citizens on a regular basis and not just once every five years for elections. Of course, I hear some Member States who are worried because they are afraid of losing their responsibilities, but I am convinced that participatory democracy and representative democracy, through the parliamentary process, are complementary and not opposed. Colleagues, we are giving ourselves two and a half years to present ideas that should not only make the functioning of our institutions more efficient and readable, but also ensure that our priorities echo the expectations of those who want Europe to be a real common home. Many people already experience it in this way and I think we have a lot to learn from how they combine their links with a specific territory and culture but also from this European sharing because Europe is both. This is the last session of our British friends in Strasbourg this week, and we have also just celebrated the ten-year anniversary of the Lisbon Treaty. I do not make a link between the two events, but it is clear that the time has come to refresh Europe and adapt it to today's challenges because without the European bubble syndrome, Europe can rebuild its diversity and the European Parliament must be the promoter of this new vision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Daniel FREUND", "mepid": "106936", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I think this debate that we’re having today here is the absolute best going away present for Nigel Farage. For his last plenary, what better idea than to dedicate the prime slot of the week to this conference, what I think is a bit his worst nightmare. So it’s a shame that he hasn’t joined us here today. He would call this the federalist plot, but it’s happening right here in the open. It’s a public debate. It’s a democratic process, and not for some old ideology but because solidarity is stronger than hatred and because cooperation is stronger than nationalism.  While Nigel and the band of lying Brexiteers are driving the UK over the cliff edge, we start a much needed debate on the next steps of European integration, a debate that will lead to a stronger and a more democratic Union and because we think what is needed in a time of climate crisis, of large corporations not paying their taxes, of being squished between a less reliable United States and an ever-stronger China, is not small mindedness, is not national selfishness. We have to unite. We have to cooperate because otherwise we perish, small and alone.  The big challenges of our time we can only face as Europeans, so the proposals that the European Parliament is putting forward today are strong, based on the good examples that we have seen in Ireland, the citizens’ assemblies. Our ambition is to have a grand debate with citizens from all across the European Union, with national parliaments, with the EU institutions. I have to say to my colleagues from the Social Democrats and the Conservatives that it’s not enough to also bring the social partners, Business Europe, to bring European trade unions to the table, but we also have to include European NGOs in in this debate as well.  I know there are risks in this project – having this debate in 24 languages, possibly not breaking out of the Brussels bubble, maybe not delivering the kind of reforms that citizens expect from us, but I think the worst thing we could do is to not even try. So we have seen in the euro and in the migration crisis that we always get stuck when integration is done only half way. So I think the answer that we have to deliver, is that we give the European Union the tools and the competence to actually address the major challenges of our time. Let’s stop letting populists and eurosceptics dominate the debate on European integration. Let’s start building a stronger and truly united Europe today, and let’s take another step towards a European Federal Republic.

However, I do not believe that this exercise is useful in giving answers to what the citizens have told us in recent years and, above all, with the elections in May. The citizens have not asked us to organise conferences, to organise debates, to organise agora, but for years they have been asking us for concrete answers, asking us for action. So the problem is not listening to the citizens, we know what they want, the problem is political. The problem is that these institutions have not been able, in recent years, to give concrete answers, to play politics, to respond to the three major problems that the citizens of Europe are facing today, namely that of the economic crisis, that of internal security and that of immigration, which is an issue that I believe is also lacking in Parliament's resolution and which cannot be ignored. I believe that this type of exercise may make sense if, before making proposals, this House and these institutions are able to make a profound self-criticism of what they have done wrong in recent years, because mistakes have been made and serious mistakes have been made, which have led the continent to sink, to count for nothing more on the international political stage. If we do not understand that the reforms and policy pursued over the last twenty years have only weakened states, weakened our continent, made our citizens poorer, any proposal we are going to discuss will only be a marketing exercise that will make no sense. I believe that the aim is to understand where it has been wrong - and unfortunately the institutions have not yet made a profound self-criticism - to understand that, contrary to what my colleague from the Greens said, the issue is not to create a federal state – what the citizens do not want, what the citizens, when they have been called upon to express their opinion, have always said against – but that we must start from our identities. , that we must start from the knowledge that without states, without our nations, without our peoples, Europe does not exist.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Ryszard Antoni LEGUTKO", "mepid": "96796", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I will be talking about the resolution that will be coming from this Chamber and my main point is that everything in this resolution is wrong. It is wrong because Article 48(4) of the Treaty on the European Union states clearly that it is the Council, not Parliament or the Commission, that can convene such a conference. I know that the attitude of this Chamber and of the Commission towards the Treaties has been consistently rather cavalier, but let us at least remember that we are deviating from what the Treaties have stipulated. So the attitude is that the aim justifies the means, the aim being ever closer union justifies the means, even distraining and ignoring the letter and the spirit of the Treaties.  It is wrong because the whole procedure to produce this document was a disgrace. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) excluded two Groups from serious involvement in drafting its opinion and fixed the voting list in advance. Five Groups prepared the document in secret and excluded two Groups from having any input in the draft text. In case you don’t know, ladies and gentlemen, this is foul play. This is the tyranny of the majority. This is foul play. It is wrong because it gives the European Parliament the leading role in the process to the detriment of national parliaments, and the democratic legitimacy of national parliaments is far, far greater than that of the European Parliament.  It is wrong because it gives the real power of the conference into the hands of an inner cabal, called the board, which will no doubt include only the representatives of the five political groups. So you have the tyranny of the majority again. It is wrong because it has a predetermined outcome as we have heard this morning. The conference is simply regarded as a springboard for the next great leap forward in European integration, including a transnationalist spitzenkandidat process and greater competences for the Union at the expense of the Member States, so do not talk about consultation. This will be fake consultations because the aim is already specified. It does not really require much intelligence to predict that all this will exacerbate the divisions in Europe, which are already quite deep and disconcerting. But we should not be surprised. The advocates of  ever closer union have always been very good at antagonising people. It is said that human beings learn from mistakes.

Mr President, for more than a month, the French have been protesting against the breakdown of their retirement. Yesterday, 1,200 doctors tendered their resignations to denounce the general state of disrepair of our French hospitals. Across Europe, citizens are mobilising against the consequences of austerity, which is at the heart of the European Union's treaties. Everywhere, they reject this individualistic future where solidarity systems are broken one by one. The conference on the future of Europe should have responded to this tremendous desire for change. Unfortunately, it is a stunted procedure that is proposed to us at this stage, both on the objectives and on the method. On the objectives, the Union cannot be satisfied with a cosmetic façade upgrade. It is the whole building that is currently in danger of collapsing, and it is therefore all its architecture that needs to be rethought, that is to say, that we must dare to name things: to change the treaties of the European Union in depth. Why not rename this conference on the future of Europe in a conference on the change of European treaties? The project is huge and we will not be able to miss out if we want to implement a genuine European, social and ecological green pact. Moving away from the logic of free trade, favouring a pact of solidarity and sustainability rather than growth and competitiveness, and social harmonisation from the top rather than widespread dumping. On the method, nothing would be more disastrous than a new falsely democratic gas plant. Parliament must be the only leader, not the Commission, which has no popular legitimacy to do so. Who can think that citizens' agoras, composed of a maximum of two to three people per Member State and without real power of impulse, are sufficient to guarantee the effective participation of citizens? Who can think that the confidence of European citizens and peoples can be regained in the institutions without endorsing the results of consultations by referendum or equivalent procedure? Don't we learn from our failures? Why repeat the mistake of the Convention on the Future of Europe in 2002, which led to the unfortunate adoption of the Lisbon Treaty against the wishes of the European peoples expressed in a referendum? For years, the fear of the people and the contempt for the will of the citizens have shaken the European edifice. We must respond to the growing distrust of the European institutions by assuming to challenge the rules of the game. Behind its bombastic title, the conference on the future of Europe is in danger of giving birth to a mouse at this stage. This is not what we want, on behalf of our group of the European Unitarian Left.

The higher turnout in the European elections in May last year was a first step out of this negative spiral. The citizens have made it clear through their high voter turnout that they have an interest in Europe, that they do not care about Europe. But they have also expressed their expectations of a Europe capable of action. This turnout was not automatic, but broad alliances, an active civil society, helped to make this time different from the other European elections. Citizens want a union capable of action, an EU that protects them and strengthens them. That is why it is important that, with this conference, we finally look ahead, that we dare to set off. But this will only be possible if we get it right, if we tackle it properly and courageously. Therefore, this conference must not be a routine affair, it must not be business as usual. We must have the courage to get out of our comfort zone. We have to go where the people are, where they are, who feel abandoned. This also means: out of the capitals, into the rural regions, towards the workers, the unemployed, the young people, those who are critical of Europe, to whom Europe is not necessarily an important project. That is why it is important for citizens to be able to exert direct influence – from the outset and not at the end of the day, when everything has already been bagged. That is why we have made it clear that we see this conference on the future of Europe as a great opportunity. We have an institutional plenary, where representatives of civil society are also represented with the European Economic and Social Committee as the House of Civil Society, but where the Committee of the Regions is also present. Because we need the mayors, we need the councils if we really want to bring these debates to the people.

That is that, for the first time – nearly 20 years, I think, after the start of the Convention, the three institutions agree again on the necessity for an in-depth reform of the European Union. This is already an important fact because it is 20 years after the start of the previous Convention and, for the first time, these three institutions say, ‘OK, an in—depth reform of the Union is absolutely needed’. I will not contradict or have a debate with Mr Legutko because, in the meanwhile, he is no longer here in the plenary. The reason why we want this Conference is because there are problems that we recognise in the European Union. When we have Brexit, a big country that is leaving the European Union, it’s difficult to say, ‘Oh, fantastic, we work well’. No, it’s a problem. We have a problem when a big country is leaving the Union and when, five years after the start of the migration crisis, we still don’t have a reform of the Dublin Regulation. We have a problem in the European Union when, ten years after the outbreak of the financial crisis, we still do not have a banking union in the European Union. We have a problem. And when Russians and Americans are deciding everything in our neighbourhood – in Syria and in Libya and in Ukraine – well, we have a problem. In fact, the reality is that, on the international stage, we are mocked by Putin, we are blackmailed by Erdoğan, we are bullied by Trump, and mostly we are ignored by the Chinese Government. That’s the reason why we want to reform Europe; not because we say ‘we are Europeans and everything is going well’, and it’s over. No, tomorrow it will be a different world tomorrow, dominated by what I call empires, like China, like India, like Russia, like America. That doesn’t mean that we have to become an empire – on the contrary – but we want to defend a Europe in which our children and grandchildren can survive in this new world, which is not the case today.  We have to do it with a new method, not like in the Convention. In the Convention it went from the top down and at the top, with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the top was something very impressive and present. We have to do exactly the opposite, not in contradiction, but from the bottom up – going up from the citizens so that we can create. After the generation of Monnet and Schuman and after the generation of Kohl and Mitterrand, we need a third movement, a third movement with, I would say, the vision of the first and with the courage of the second generation.

As 2010 was approaching references to the agenda were expunged from EU websites and the plan was renamed the Europe 2020 strategy. 2020 has arrived and the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy, maybe as a moral champion of the world, but it also enjoys the highest consumer income and corporate taxes in the developed world, high unemployment and the lowest growth apart from Japan. For the most integrated countries of the eurozone, economic data are even worse than for the more sensible non-euro EU Members.  The Commission president now proposes a conference on the future of Europe to make the EU more democratic. She mentions an economy for the people. Yet also proposes more taxes and an EU Green Deal for EUR one trillion plus, when EU influence on world climate is minimal. In the name of Europe’s way of life, she’s advocating more non-European immigration to make Europe less European by the day. EU democracy is democracy, neither for nor by the European peoples. Sigmund Freud spoke of ‘Flucht in die Krankheit’ or ‘escape into illness’ to describe a neurotic avoidance of an unsatisfactory reality. Rather than face the struggle to regain health, the neurotic patient is secretly desiring to remain ill. Is there a better diagnosis of the EU today?

However, there is no doubt that, bearing this difference in mind, one must reflect on the future and of the Union and Europe. Such a discussion is needed because, on the one hand, the voices of prominent thinkers, both conservative and left-wing, are multiplying, that European civilisation is in a critical, even end-of-life state. On the other hand, we feel that the European Union is also in need of reform. We are in favour of an open, honest, non-exclusionary discussion of people with different views, such as opponents of further integration, which does not prejudge the direction of the proposed changes. We cannot divide (like some colleagues who talk about the European republic) European citizens into bad and good Europeans.  We also agree that citizens should be involved in the debate on the future of Europe, but we know that there is no single European public sphere, which is why this should be done at national level.

Yes, a conference on the future of the EU means, first and foremost, making citizens' voices with their wishes, expectations and demands on the EU. They themselves should decide which issues need to be addressed in order to eliminate democratic deficits, develop new policies and test the suitability of policies at EU and national level.

Europe was a dream, but today it is an unsatisfactory reality.  We should rebuild the dream, but we live in times when politicians have no legitimacy to dream.

For example, we distinguish between ourselves and the citizens to give the impression that we are close to the people, when the citizens are the ones who have elected us, when in election campaign we have been talking to the citizens, when we ourselves are citizens and, if not, what do we do in this Parliament? The assemblies of citizens parallel to parliaments all they do is delegitimate parliaments.  Europe does not need politicians to dream. Europe needs politicians to believe.

It is the pro-European groups, the ones that support this resolution, that represent more than 70-75% of the vote in the last European election, so let’s set the record straight on this matter.  (Applause) Second of all. It’s 10 years after the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. And if you look at the world now, some others have already said it, it is totally different from the world of 2009. At that time we didn’t have Brexit; we didn’t have the Arab Spring; we didn’t have Trump as President of the United States; we didn’t have the immigration flows. So unlike some other colleagues that mention Freud and narcotization, we do live in reality. The issue is that you don’t recognise reality, the external pressures that as Europeans we are facing and that we have to react with this conference on the future of Europe, that I think has to lead us, because the world is there and we cannot ignore it, towards a political union of a federal sort.  But we are going to do this with the citizens – in a conversation with the citizens and with organised civil society. It’s very important that we ensure the participation as well of the organised civil society. I think that we can achieve the maximum implication of ordinary citizens and NGOs in this process, national parliamentarians, and then come up with a set of answers to the policy challenges that we are facing and we cannot ignore.

This is a new element that is part of a debate that is often too institutional and we have an extremely strong opportunity here. I would like to rebound from a word that you used that echoes the French that I am, you spoke of the word 'audacity' and you know that this is a phrase that the revolutionary Danton had quoted at the time when France was in danger saying: 'Boldness, still audacity, always audacity'. Yes, now is the time. Europe is in danger, as has been said and explained, we are probably at a crossroads. Yesterday we were talking about Brexit and other dangers are before us. Sir Winston Churchill said 70 years ago, at Kléber Square, at the end of the war, that the dangers before Europe were great, but that great was its strength and that it must be aware of it. So it is to you, Mrs 'Ukoica,' and I turn to the Council. And I will simply base myself on a phrase by Jean Monnet, who said when Europe was created: Europe is not there to coalesce states, it is there to connect human beings with each other and this is the moment we find ourselves today. I therefore look with both concern and hope at the Council. I look at you, Mrs Ica, and I look at the Commission. And I ask you, on behalf of this institution, which represents European citizens, on behalf of NGOs, who are knocking on the door of these institutions, on behalf of civil society, not to waste this opportunity to finally make us work together with all those who represent European citizenship. We must succeed together or we will fail without each other.

So we are living in this Parliament the first effects of Brexit and the departure of the first of the 28 Member States. We hope that this will be the only start, but what do we know? Did we really think ten years ago that this first risk of dislocation was possible? During this parliamentary session, we will also study and vote on a resolution which recalls the triggering of Article 7 by the Commission and Parliament against two governments of the Member States: Poland and Hungary, following serious violations of the rule of law. We seem to have been frozen for two years, with no real capacity to react to these threats to our European project. The European Union is therefore at a critical juncture. This idea of a conference on the future of Europe is a necessary and remarkable initiative: the President of the Commission and the Commissioners can be congratulated for supporting it. But above all, the fact that the European Parliament has seized on it with such determination and a relative share of audacity is also promising. However, let us be clear: if this conference is a failure, we will all bear the responsibility: Council, Commission and Parliament. And this could be one more step towards the end of a coherent And ever more inclusive European Union. Conservatives and Social Democrats, many of them want to curb citizen participation.

Yes, currently, we can’t defend our national interests because national interests are European interests and that is I think important to understand.

In the monetary field, we have a zero interest rate policy in the face of a negative interest rate policy. The economy is weak and we are not able to stimulate the economy accordingly.

A fair and equal distribution of refugees is required in all, without exception, the countries of the European Union according to the criteria we have set. Today we didn't hear anything about it. How do we dream of a united Europe when each Member State pursues a different policy of its own interests? When countries have closed borders and refuse to take responsibility? Let us be realistic and honest, colleagues. We cannot talk about the future of a Europe without solidarity in practice. Migration threatens the cohesion and foundations of the European Union, and its management undermines citizens' confidence in our values.

For me, one issue is important, which is to strengthen our parliamentary democracy. And when I talk about parliamentary democracy, I mean the leading candidate process. We have talked a lot today about proximity to the citizens and how we involve the citizens. I note that a great deal of trust has been lost among the citizens since the last European elections. We have over 200 million people who took part in the European elections, and our people had a clear expectation that those who are running as leading candidates in this European election will ultimately assume responsibility in the Commission. We all know that things have turned out differently, and I believe that if we want to restore confidence to our citizens, then we really must work on reforming this leading candidate process. For me, the heart chamber of democracy here is the European Parliament. This is where the decisions are taken, and we need to exchange and discuss.

On the other hand, it will find its relevance if, at the same time, European citizens can vote on transnational lists and thus clearly give a mandate to a European personality to try to gather a majority around his name. European lists for European elections are, I think, a fine goal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 101, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Karlo RESSLER", "mepid": "197413", "text": "   – Madam President, the European Union today is significantly different from what it was only a decade ago when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force.

This clearly affects the way we live, the way we work and the way we communicate, but it also has an impact on the demand for a more active role for our citizens in our democracy.  This is why we have the responsibility to offer new and innovative ways for Europeans to be included more in the decisions that matter to them. Since young Europeans are often the ones who really lead the transformative trends in our societies, they can certainly offer a unique point of view. I’m also glad that Vice—President Šuica will lead the Commission’s work on the conference. This is because, for its success, it is really crucial to understand all the European diversities and to include the special perspectives of our citizens coming from all corners of Europe. Because of that, it is really important to include all those perspectives. This conference should certainly not be a box—ticking exercise.

I have listened carefully to today’s points and taken note of your views. It is my role to listen to you. The start date of the Conference is yet to be confirmed, but the listening process itself has already started. We are already reflecting and engaging with as many actors as possible. We will need the cooperation of the Commission representation offices and the European Parliament liaison offices in the Member States, who already do tremendous work to bring the European Union closer to its citizens.  We need them, now more than ever, to lead our efforts. Let us remember how this feeds into other areas of my work as Vice-President for Democracy and Demography. We want to hear from all people of all ages and, of course, from the young. I thank the younger Members of Parliament for today’s debate.  I also have to thank Pascal Durand, Daniel Freund and Ruiz Devesa Domènec for mentioning NGOs. Of course, we haven’t forgotten NGOs. They will be included, and that was our idea from the beginning. We also have to take care of the older generation, whom we wish to encourage in their active contribution to our society and economy.  Of course, this concerns not only NGOs or older people, but also minorities, entrepreneurs, students, regional and local authorities, mayors and everyone who can say something on the structure, scope and the content of the Conference. These views will feed into my work on demography. We want to provide real and workable solutions for our citizens. Our democracy is in need of creative and innovative solutions. The results of this process – whatever they are – must be tangible, must be implemented and must be based on the feedback we receive from our citizens. As I already said, this is no longer business as usual. We must be brave and embrace the innovative nature of this process. Not everything needs to be known in advance, but we are providing the solid structure necessary for full citizen participation, both online and in person. I want to ensure that every voice is heard and listened to, and that we follow up on it accordingly. It is vital that this process remains open and transparent. I do not want to pre—empt what the citizens have to say, on the contrary, I want to be surprised by them.  I’m sure that, together, we can also surprise the citizens. But we, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, we can do this only by working closely together as real partners.

Mr President, honourable Members, Your Excellencies, my friends, thank you all. It is an honour to speak before the European Parliament once again. As I look around this historic Chamber, I see it holds many hundreds of people. But in truth, there are with us today millions more, from different countries, histories, and perspectives. So we who are gathered here have two things in common. First is our responsibility to these millions – the people who have entrusted us with their hopes and fears. And second, we are all very fortunate, for a life spent in the service of others is a life fully lived – but only if we live up to the expectations of the millions of people with us in this hall today. If we falter, the most vulnerable pay the highest price – the young men and women who look to their future and see nothing; bewildered refugee mothers, clutching their children, with no place to call home; or anxious fathers who cannot find jobs to provide for their loved ones. And the many who feel side-lined, their identity under threat. The defining feature of the past decade has been people finding their voices. millions across the world have poured onto the streets, marched, occupied, sat down, sat in, tweeted, podcast, hashtagged what they want, loud and clear. And they all want the same thing: a fair chance, a fighting chance. Dear friends, people around the world have voiced their desired destination but are looking to us to guide them along the path; looking to us to foresee and prepare for the obstacles ahead. This calls for several ‘what if?’ questions. And these questions are not merely a whimsical or a theoretical exercise – especially in my region, where worst-case scenarios don’t lie comfortably within the realm of the hypothetical but often wander too closely to the borders of our reality. Furthermore, what happens in the Middle East has a way of making itself felt everywhere around the world. So let me start with our region’s deepest wound. What if the world gives up on the two-state solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Seventy-plus years of conflict have played havoc with hopes for justice. Today, one-staters are actively seeking to impose an unthinkable solution on the region and the world: one state, propped up by structural inequalities, with Palestinians as second-class subjects; one state turning its back on its neighbourhood, perpetuating divisions among peoples and faiths worldwide. Five years ago, I stood in this Chamber and spoke of the dangers of failing to move forward with peace, and today, I must say frankly that the dangers have grown: violence continues; settlement-building continues; disregard for international law continues. I’ve said it countless times and in countless ways, but I will say it again and again: a more peaceful world is not possible without a stable Middle East. And a stable Middle East is not possible without peace between Palestinians and the Israelis. (Applause) What if Jerusalem, a city that is close to my heart personally and of great historical significance to my family, remains disputed? Can we afford to rob Christians and Muslims alike of the spirituality, peace and coexistence that this city symbolises, and instead allow it to descend into political conflict? Now fast forward to the most recent standoff between the United States and Iran. What if, next time, neither side steps away from the brink, dragging us all towards untold chaos? An all-out war jeopardises the stability of the entire region. What’s more, it risks massive disruptions of the entire global economy, including energy markets, but threatens a resurgence of terrorism across the world. And I ask you another ‘what if?’: what if Iraq fails to realise the potential and aspirations of its people and slips back into an erratic, 17-year cycle of recovery and relapse – or worse yet, conflict? Iraq is home to 12 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves. But more importantly, it is home to over 40 million people, who have suffered through four decades of war, crippling sanctions, occupation, sectarian conflict, and the terror of ISIS. Today their future rests on a fragile peace. And I, for one, will not abandon our brothers and sisters there. Now what if Syria remains hostage to global rivalries and spirals back into civil conflict? What if we see a re-emergence of ISIS and Syria becomes a staging-ground for attacks against the rest of the world? Syria may be out of the headlines, with its suffering out of sight and out of mind, but the crisis is far from over. Over the past nine months, more than half a million people have been displaced, many of them already refugees. Do any of us in this hall want to see another Syrian refugee crisis unfold, with all its horror and heartbreak? Or another innocent child washed up upon your shores? I know I speak for everyone here when I say: absolutely not. And let me ask you: what if Libya collapses into an all-out war, and ultimately, a failed state? What if Libya is the new Syria, just much closer to the continent you all call home? And let me say again: what if Arab governments fail to create the more than 60 million jobs our youth will need in the coming decade? And if we fail, wouldn’t we in fact be creating a perfect setting for extremist groups? We make their job of recruitment easier if we leave behind a trail of vulnerability and hopelessness. Can we afford to let the region’s young people live without hope? My friends, let this reflection upon ‘what if?’ scenarios be a productive exercise, one that can pre-empt countless tragedies and safeguard our people along their journey. My faith in God reinforces my optimism and my belief in the strength and resilience of humanity. There is always a better and much more united version of us around every corner. The Holy Qur’an teaches us that ‘Those who endure in patience and put their trust in their Lord’ will enjoy the greatest rewards. Patience is hard in a world that never seems to slow down, where people make split-second decisions and expect instantaneous results. Leadership, however, demands the very opposite: reflection, wisdom and the long view. More than ever, we need patient politics. Because we all have a responsibility to safeguard our people’s long-term interests and welfare; to react to rapidly unfolding events with measured responses, not knee-jerk reactions. Because politics is not a game where the fastest win. Sometimes, the faster we go, the farther away we end up from the finish line. My father, the late King Hussein, taught me that peace-making is always the harder – but the higher – path. And a tough road is best walked with our friends: friends like you and the people of Europe, so that together we can reach the future that both our peoples aspire to and that they and our whole world deserve.

As we’ve already heard, there are 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK who each have their own personal stories and situations, but they have one thing in common: they want to ensure a safe future for themselves and their families.  The UK Government has done everything possible to make things difficult. It has failed to provide a system that gives them full guarantees, or physical documents that would enable them to prove their status to prospective employers or landlords. Now this is a huge concern in my constituency of the West Midlands, and this is not hearsay. I have case-work that proves some of the awful experiences that EU citizens have had, and we forget that the EU migrants contribute GBP 2 300 more to the UK Exchequer than the average adult.

I have heard and I acknowledge the concerns voiced by Mr Weber, and I’m aware of the statement referred to and of the reaction by the Polish authorities. I would like to use this opportunity to express my sympathy for all World War II victims. It is important to remember Europe’s past if we want to build its future. The topic of today’s discussion thus prompts a reflection on how Europe can learn from history and especially from one of its darkest chapters. As highlighted also by the European Parliament’s resolution of September last year, the authoritarian and totalitarian regimes which emerged across Europe in the last century remain a dark chapter in our continent’s history. The Second World War led to unprecedented levels of human suffering, both for the militaries and for civilian populations. Ten of millions of victims were deported, tortured, murdered under totalitarian regimes in Europe. Remembrance of the wars that ravaged Europe and its people should always prevent us from overlooking these horrors. For this reason, it is essential to find ways to strengthen our common values and the general principles on which the European Union is founded: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Fortunately, most of the younger generations in Europe have not suffered under totalitarian regimes. Yet there is now a risk that we are taking these common values and principles for granted. Europe’s tragic past should continue to serve as moral and political inspiration to face the challenges of today’s world. The common values that have enabled the longest period of peace in Europe must remain a cornerstone of our democratic society and need to be safely guarded and constantly nurtured. The experience of the two world wars taught us not to focus on differences but to create a common space to live, study and work. Most European societies have been learning over several generations the value of inclusiveness and tolerance. Despite these positive developments, Europe, unfortunately, did witness war, conflict and destruction in the 1990s, and here I speak of my home country’s direct experience, still quite fresh in our memory. However, this is an additional reason why we should all deeply respect the peace and security that the EU project has brought to our continent and why we should continue promoting its achievements outside its borders. Today our societies are facing different kinds of challenges: xenophobia, nationalism, populism, disinformation or violent radicalisation, just to name a few. These very complex issues cannot be solved with simplistic, quick-fix solutions. The Union must be vigilant and ready to fight propaganda which promises such solutions. Not only can these promises never be fulfilled, they also discredit our democratic institutions and authorities. They seek to divide our societies into us and them, friends and enemies. This undermines democratic and open political debate. Radicalisation and violent extremism gain ground. We all need to step up our efforts to prevent intolerance, racism and xenophobia. Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to conclude by stressing that our societies need to remember their own history in order to learn from the past and not repeat the mistakes for which they might have been responsible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 175, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank you and the honourable members for this debate. Our collective history and how we commemorate and share it is fundamentally important for Europe’s present and future. As the now—famous quotation goes ‘everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts’. The Commission’s role here is to talk about the facts. The European Commission fully rejects any false claims that attempt to distort the history of the Second World War or paint the victims, like Poland, as perpetrators. The Commission will not tolerate these attacks on Poland and stands in full solidarity with Poland and the Polish people.  The EU evolved out of the ashes of the Second World War and the holocaust and, in the context of the Cold War, these memories are the foundation of the European project and our responsibility for the future. These historical facts are not open for debate. The Hitler-Stalin Pact, signed by the Foreign Ministers of Nazi Germany, Ribbentrop, and the Soviet Union, Molotov, on 23 August 1939, paved the way for the Second World War. The Nazi-Soviet alliance enabled the attack on Poland by Nazi Germany on 1 September 1939 and, subsequently, Soviet troops on 17 September. These events marked the beginning of the Second World War and these are the facts.  We also must recall the occupation of the Baltic countries and Bessarabia, events hard to imagine without the existence of the treaty dividing the continent by a zone of influence of the evil regimes. We must highlight the horrors committed by both regimes without equating them – in particular, the unimaginable tragedy of the organised genocide by Nazi Germany, the holocaust, which consumed the lives of millions of Jews, and other atrocities that cost the lives of millions of Poles, Roma and many other nationalities.  Yes, history is complicated and we cannot forget about the role that the Soviet soldiers played in the crucial part of the war when Stalin and Hitler became enemies. It is a fact that Soviet soldiers were first to push out the German soldiers from Central and Eastern Europe after immense sacrifices by the peoples of the Soviet Union. It is a fact that they played a key role in liberating the Nazi concentration camp in occupied Poland, Auschwitz-Birkenau. We will commemorate the 75th anniversary of this event on 27 January.  Even after the war, many people from Central and Eastern Europe continued for decades to suffer under the totalitarian rule of communist regimes, regimes that were often installed without support and against the will of the local population. The European Union has established 23 August as the official day of the memory of the millions of victims of totalitarian regimes. The Commission is committed to contributing, in line with its responsibilities, to the promotion of the memory of crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe and the Commission encourages the Member States to consider the possibility of adhering to this Europe-wide day in the light of their own history.  It is our duty to preserve the names of the millions persecuted and keep their memories alive and also to study diligently the root causes and behaviour of the totalitarian regimes, especially because today, 81 years after the opening of this dark chapter in European history, our common values of human dignity, fundamental rights, rule of law and democracy are challenged again by extremists, nationalists and divisive rhetoric and actions.  We have to recognise those facts to understand our own history and build a better future. The dream of the European Union was formed right after the war, with the clear aim to create new, strong foundations for long-lasting peace in Europe. This is why it is important for Europe to be very clear on these matters. Distortion of historical facts is a threat to our democratic societies and must be challenged wherever possible. Organised and targeted dissemination of distortions and disinformation is something we have to oppose and reject. I myself will work under my mission to strengthen the European democracy to allow us to live in freedom from these threats. Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to the debate.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind you why we are sitting here. The nucleus of the European Union, the beginning of cooperation between the peoples of Europe, was the ECSC Treaty. In its preamble, we can still read that this Treaty, which was essentially nothing more than the establishment of a free trade area for coal and steel, was concluded by the parties with the firm conviction that action and cooperation with each other and the establishment of common institutions are peace-promoting. We can see how successful this model is by the fact that we are not just talking about coal and steel here, but about much more. However, if we want to prevent the right to our own facts, we need European public opinion. You cannot decide on that, you have to do something about it.

Madam President, the management of the past is always a very delicate matter. It may seem delicate, it is often laborious, but in any case it is indispensable. And I believe that Jean Kahn, who was the originator of the European Observatory for Racist and Xenophobic Phenomena, could have told us a word. Unfortunately, he left us in the meantime. He had been in charge of taking stock of all the aberrations that are still contained in the history textbooks today - it was rather the late 90s - and one of the biggest aberrations was a quote in an Austrian history textbook claiming that Austria had been the first victim of the Third Reich: a bedtime story. This is what happens when you do not deal with the issues of the past and when you do not have the courage to address them. Indeed, many participate in misinformation and distort historical realities, either by ignoring irrefutable historical evidence, or by refusing to refer to it or by failing to name them. The second case is even worse than the first. We could still find exeumental circumstances to explain the stupidity, but bad faith is unacceptable. What can we do about the deniers? What can we oppose the murderers of memory, as Pierre Vidal-Naquet calls them? I believe that we can do one thing, even if it will have no immediate effect: since the witnesses and survivors have almost all left us, we will have to replace the duty of remembrance with a duty of history. And I would like, in closing, to cite an example from which we must draw inspiration: the Federal Republic of Germany, the version of the former Bundeslanders, had the courage to face its past, and this Federal Republic of Germany has done so courageously, without covering anything in the history textbooks and in the public media. This was not the case in the new Bundeslanders.

Premise: my intervention is not against the Resistance in Italy, on the contrary, we do not want to demonize, but it is necessary to make some clarifications. In Italy there was not a single group of partisans fighting against the fascist regime but there were communist, socialist, Catholic, conservative and republican groups. Yet, despite this, there seems to be a well-established and distorted narrative in my country that only one team has been the author of the fight against Nazi fascism. In the wake of this, some associations, even financed with public money, instead of explaining history in detail and objectively, do not miss an opportunity to side politically with the left, in this case in Italy. During the Civil War, which took place between '43 and '45, heinous crimes were committed by both sides. But on those committed by the fascists there is wide and fair emphasis, on those committed by the partisans it is as if a manhood of impunity and forgetfulness had fallen. Take, for example, the story of Rolando Rivi, a 14-year-old seminarian murdered by partisans, or the more than 2 600 women raped and murdered without a fair trial, on the sole pretext of being friends of fascists. Yet today it is easier to hide behind any 'Beautiful Hello', as some Members of this House have unknokno faredly, when we know, as you know, that 'Bella Ciao' was not the partisans' ion. I will end, Mr President, by quoting a great Italian left-wing journalist who disappeared a few days ago: 'Everyone knows these things or has heard them say and no one dares to bring them back and tell them for fear of being pointed out as a fascist'.

Later, during the negotiations for ending the Second World War in Potsdam, there was yet another war crime perpetrated against Poles and Lithuanians: the so—called Augustów roundup.

A distorted depiction of Jewish history only made possible the persecution and cruel murder of six million Jews.

With the boycott of Jewish goods, the BDS movement is reminiscent of the \"Don't buy from Jews\" signs.

It is impossible to understand the European project outside the values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights which those regimes systematically violated.

Mr Putin, you will not succeed in your attempts to divide Europe on the history issue. We are standing for the truth because truth makes you free, and that is the strength of Europe. We would like to wish the same sense of real truth and freedom upon the ordinary Russian people. The history lesson is very simple: the truth, in the end, wins.

It directly influences the daily lives of our citizens and the environment in which our businesses operate. Shortcomings in this area make our societies and our Union more vulnerable, both internally and externally. The very fabric for our societies rests on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. These elements are interlinked, interdependent and mutually reinforcing. One cannot exist without the others.  Article 2(1) procedures are ongoing. One regarding Poland, and the other regarding Hungary. Concerning the procedure with regard to Hungary, which was triggered by the recent proposal of the European Parliament in September 2018, two hearings took place last semester at the General Affairs Council on 16 September and 10 December 2019.  The first hearing was general in scope and covered all the issues raised in the European Parliament’s recent proposal. The second hearing focused on specific topics: freedom of expression, including media pluralism, academic freedom and independence of the judiciary, as laid down in the standard modalities for hearings as referred to in Article 7, approved by the Council. Last July, the Finnish Presidency updated the Parliament on this procedure and conveyed the Parliament’s views during Hungary’s first hearing.  Ahead of this first hearing on 4 September, together with representatives from Croatia and Germany, the Finnish Presidency also met the chair of the LIBE Committee and rapporteur for this file. On 10 December, right before the second hearing, an informal exchange between the ministers and the European Parliament took place. On that occasion, Parliament had the opportunity to present its recent proposal and views on the recent developments in Hungary. To conclude, during the Croatian Presidency, it is our intention to continue to keep the Parliament regularly informed on the developments concerning the Article 7 procedure regarding Hungary.

It is essential that all EU institutions contribute, within their respective roles, to upholding the rule of law in the EU. In November, President Ursula von der Leyen recalled in this House that the rule of law is our foundation and can never be compromised. We must ensure that it is respected and upheld everywhere, with every country treated equally. She added that we must focus on dialogue and prevention but never hesitate to take all necessary measures. As regards the situation in Hungary, the Commission has already explained on different occasions that it shares an important number of concerns expressed by the European Parliament in its recent proposal triggering the Article 7 procedure. The Commission has also made very clear that, whatever position the Council will be taking on the Article 7 procedure, it must ensure a fair handling of the reasoned proposal put forward by the European Parliament. Most recently, the Commission stressed this again during the hearing of Hungary in the General Affairs Council on 10 December. Let me briefly update you on developments in Hungary that have occurred in a number of areas covered by the European Parliament’s reasoned opinion. In the area of the rule of law, new legislation with substantial changes to the structure and functioning of the judicial system was adopted on 10 December without public consultation or consultation of the Venice Commission. We are assessing that legislation. On 10 September 2019, the Hungarian Supreme Court issued a judgment declaring unlawful an order by a district court judge requesting a preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice. This may have an impact on the EU preliminary reference mechanism. The National Judicial Council is still facing difficulties in counterbalancing the power of the President of the National Office for the Judiciary, who is in charge of the management of the judicial system. In the area of media pluralism, last December, six international organisations of journalists and media published a report stating that, since 2010, the Hungarian Government has systematically dismantled media pluralism, in particular because media ownership is concentrated in the hands of the Government and the media market is distorted by state advertising. And further developments raised concerns. The impact of the merger of more than 400 media outlets into one single holding has been analysed by a report published in July by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF). This report concluded that the establishment of this merger will exacerbate the overall risk to media pluralism in Hungary. The report pointed to the government decision to exempt the merger from the scrutiny of both the National Competition Authority and the Media Authority. As regards academic freedom, you will be aware that the Central European University had to relocate its US-accredited academic programmes from Budapest to Vienna. Also, a new law on the financing of research has been criticised by the national and international scientific community because it detached 15 academic research institutes from the independent Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The Commission is following closely all these developments and has already shown that it is determined to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the concerns raised by certain measures adopted by the Hungarian authorities. In particular, the Commission has launched a number of infringement proceedings against Hungary. These relate to the rights of civil society organisations, academic freedom and the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. The Commission is also using other instruments such as the European Semester. On 9 July 2019, the Council, following a Commission proposal, recommended that Hungary strengthen judicial independence and reinforce its anti—corruption framework, including by improving prosecutorial efforts and access to public information. To conclude, I would like to recall that the Commission remains available to engage with the Hungarian authorities on resolving rule-of-law issues.

We were concerned at one point that the situation was extremely frozen. Thanks to the hearings organised by the Finnish Presidency, we have seen a small evolution, just a small evolution. Today we call on the Croatian and German presidencies to continue the good work done by the Finns. These hearings were an important first step, because it was not easy for peers to assess another Member State and, of course, we innovated quite dramatically. We must continue on this path. Another hearing may be possible, particularly on the question of the use of Eu funds, which could be a next topic. Ms Jourova, you raised the issue of media independence. Could it be that European funds were used to enable media concentration in Hungary? That is a question we should be asking ourselves. I would also like, and I must do so, to remind us here, as Mrs Strugariu said, that we also have an institutional problem. Parliament is still not officially received at these hearings: we can also improve. This resolution, which we will vote on tomorrow, refers to two procedures: one against Poland, the other against Hungary. There is an unfair treatment in both cases. In the case of Poland, the Commission is heard. In the case of Hungary, we, Parliament, have not yet been heard formally, and the informal meetings are not satisfactory. This cannot continue: you are setting a precedent that does not create equality between our three institutions, and that must stop.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 240, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Jérôme RIVIÈRE", "mepid": "197615", "text": "  on behalf of the ID Group. - Mr President, in this case of the implementation of Article 7 against Hungary, the Commission has a role only to ensure the secretariat of the Council, because it is indeed up to the sovereign nations and themselves to decide this debate, which is by no means legal but indeed political.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I am proud that the European Parliament has taken a position on the issue of developments in Hungary; that we have taken a stand for the rule of law, for democracy and for human rights.  Under Fidesz's rule, we have seen how media freedom has been curtailed. We see how NGOs and civil society are being persecuted and how academic freedom is being attacked – this is the first time that a university has had to be moved. We see the government attacking migrants' rights and banning homelessness and rebuilding cultural institutions. We are also now seeing the restriction of the freedom of the courts by the new law, which has entered into force this year.  I think it is also worth mentioning the NY Times review which shows that Hungary's use of EU agricultural subsidies is full of corruption and profiteering oligarchs, and is being used by Fidesz to strengthen the party's power. One might ask: what is the goal? Well, let's be clear. It is to strangle any form of opposition, to strangle the involvement of the citizens, and this is, as has been said here before, a totally unacceptable development. It cannot be called democracy and it cannot be called respecting the rule of law.  There are lots of citizens in Hungary who want a different development. Those who stand up for human rights, for the rights of migrants, for the rights of the homeless, for women's rights, for LGBTQ people and for democracy and the rule of law. And with all of them, we fight side by side.  But this is also a European issue. Should Hungary, as a non-functioning democracy, sit and make laws for the rest of us in the Council, laws that apply in our individual countries? No, we can't have that. We are grateful that the Finnish Presidency has taken hold of the Article 7 procedure against Hungary. But, as in the case of Poland, things are not moving forward – quite the contrary: things are going in the wrong direction.  We want to see the Commission do more. We also want to see a mechanism that is effective in terms of monitoring the rule of law, and not least, now that we are negotiating the Multiannual Financial Framework, that is when we should set the tough requirements.

Violations of European values have been under discussion for years in several Member States, as in the case of Hungary, but the procedure laid down in Article 7 is far from offering an effective remedy. The difficulties in achieving the majorities required for the adoption of sanctions make this procedure essentially non-functional and unsuitable for its purpose. The Government of Orbán is also well aware of this, so sure of its impunity that it continues the authoritarian drift undertaken.

On a positive note, let me recall that the Hungarian Government has decided not to push through the controversial reform establishing a separate administrative courts system. However, new legislation was adopted in December introducing structural changes to the functioning of the justice system. In particular, it relates to the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, introduces new possibilities for the public administration to challenge final judgments before the Constitutional Court, and reorganises the courts hearing administrative cases. We are analysing this new legislation. At this stage, I would only regret that such reform has been carried out at a fast pace without consulting the Venice Commission and without public consultation. I note that the new legislation does not intend to address the existing concerns about the increasing challenges that the independent National Judicial Council faces in balancing the powers of the administrative authority managing the judiciary. These challenges have led the Council to adopt the country—specific recommendations on judicial independence already mentioned by Vice—President Jourová. The fact that the President of this administrative authority resigned in November to become a member of the Constitutional Court does not resolve the structural concerns related to the possibility of arbitrary decisions in the management of the judicial system.  Another issue that the Commission is analysing relates to the judgement of the Supreme Court of 19 September, declaring unlawful an order by a district court judge requesting a preliminary ruling of the European Court of Justice. The implications of this judgment, including for possible disciplinary proceedings, call for a careful assessment because the very functioning of the EU legal system requires that national courts have unimpeded access to the European Court of Justice. I’ve heard a lot of comments about Roma discrimination. The European Union’s Racial Equality Directive prohibits discrimination on grounds of race and ethnicity in education. The Commission has initiated an infringement procedure against Hungary regarding segregation of Roma peoples in mainstream education and is closely monitoring the steps being undertaken by Hungary to remedy this situation.  The Commission has zero tolerance towards fraud with the EU budget and expects the same level of commitment from Member States, which are mainly responsible for the management of some three quarters of the budget. The Commission conducts audits when there are reasons to do so and can take the necessary measures to protect the EU budget.  The European Anti-Fraud Office plays a key role in this regard, and you know the Commission has proposed a regulation on the protection of the EU budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in a Member State. It is a tool to protect the EU budget and ensure sound financial management. The reasoning is simple. In order to control the use of EU funds and to protect the EU’s financial interests against corruption and fraud, each Member State needs an independent justice system, effective investigation and prosecution services, and an effective functioning of public authorities implementing the Union budget. If these functions are endangered by a generalised rule of law deficiency in a way which affects, or risks affecting, the Union’s financial interests, the Union would be empowered to suspend, reduce or restrict access to EU funding in a proportional manner.  The proposal is currently being examined by Parliament and the Council of the European Union and, if adopted, could make an important contribution to the protection of the EU budget.  I have heard also, Mr President, calls for a new rule of law mechanism. I can assure you that the Commission is working on a comprehensive European rule of law mechanism as a matter of priority. It will cover all Member States and provide a synthesis of significant developments related to the various competences of the rule of law, including for example, systemic problems with a process for enacting laws, lack of effective judicial protection by independent and impartial courts, the capacity to fight corruption, and issues in relation to media pluralism. This will allow us to identify and prevent, early on, rule of law—related issues.  To conclude, I regret that I cannot report improvements of the situation in Hungary since the tabling of the European Parliament’s original proposal.  I hope that the debate today will help the Hungarian authorities to further reflect on the concerns expressed.

In the course of 2019, relevant updates on the state of play were provided and discussed at the General Affairs Council in February, April, July, September and December.  The Croatian Presidency will ensure that the General Affairs Council remains seized of this highly important matter. At the same time, we hope that the ongoing dialogue at a political level between the Commission and Poland will bear fruit.

It is essential that all EU institutions contribute within their respective roles to upholding the rule of law in the EU. I am aware that Parliament has followed the situation in Poland very closely and that you have been regularly updated by the Commission. Last December, Commissioner Reynders had the opportunity to debrief the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE).  Today, the Commission’s intervention will focus on the most recent developments. Let me start with developments in the Court of Justice of the European Union. On 5 November 2019, the Court of Justice, in full support of the Commission’s position, ruled that by lowering the retirement age of ordinary court judges and by granting the Minister of Justice discretionary power to prolong their active service after reaching the new retirement age, Poland had introduced unjustified discrimination based on gender and breached the principle of judicial independence and irremovability of judges under Article 19(1) of the Treaty on the European Union.  On 19 November 2019, the Court of Justice issued a preliminary ruling concerning the independence of the newly created disciplinary chamber of the Supreme Court. The Court of Justice held that it was for the Polish Supreme Court to assess whether the new disciplinary chamber was independent and provided a number of precise elements to be taken into account.  On 5 December, the Polish Supreme Court, based on the criteria set out by the Court of Justice of the European Union, ruled that the disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court did not meet the requirements of EU law on judicial independence and was not, therefore, a court within the meaning of EU law or of national law. We have observed a number of reactions from the Polish authorities criticising the Supreme Court ruling. In this regard, I would emphasise that respecting judgments that apply a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice is of key importance for the uniform application of EU law.  As regards disciplinary proceedings, the Commission decided on 10 October 2019 to refer Poland to the Court of Justice in relation to the new disciplinary regime. In particular, the Commission considered that the new disciplinary regime did not provide the necessary guarantees to protect judges from political control of their judicial decisions.  The situation continues to be very serious. Despite the preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice and the judgment of the Supreme Court, ordinary court judges who seek to implement these rulings are subject to disciplinary proceedings and the disciplinary chamber continues to operate in full. These developments create a risk of irreparable damage for judges, who may become subject to a final decision taken by a disciplinary chamber which has been found not to be independent.  The continued operation of the disciplinary chamber, combined with the launching of new disciplinary proceedings, increases the chilling effect on the Polish judiciary. Polish judges who consider sending preliminary references to the Court of Justice are particularly affected. For these reasons, yesterday the Commission decided to make a request for interim measures in the context of ongoing infringement proceedings for the Court of Justice to suspend the functioning of the disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court. These measures are urgent and needed in this specific case.  The Commission stands ready to continue the dialogue with Poland on the rule of law situation with a view to finding constructive ways forward to resolve the issues at hand. Another important recent development relates to a draft new law governing the functioning of the judiciary and currently being discussed in the Polish Parliament. The draft legislation touches upon matters such as the independence of the judiciary, further raising the Commission’s concerns in this area. For this reason, on 19 December, I sent a letter to the Polish President, the presidents of the Sejm and the Senate, and to the Polish Prime Minister on this draft legislation. The aim of the letter was to recall that the Commission wants to work with the Polish authorities to strengthen the rule of law by preventing problems and by working towards resolving them when they arise. In the letter, I encouraged the Polish authorities to consult the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission on this draft legislation and called on all state bodies not to take forward the proceedings on the new draft legislation before carrying out all the necessary consultations with all stakeholders. I underlined that any legislative development must comply with the requirements underpinning the EU legal order and should not lead to a further deterioration of the rule of law situation in Poland.  The Commission welcomes the fact that the President of the Senate has requested an opinion from the Venice Commission, which visited Poland on 9-10 January and is due to provide an opinion on the draft law. The Commission stands ready to engage in a constructive dialogue and is in regular contact with the Polish authorities with a view to finding constructive ways forward to resolve the issues at hand.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 293, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Poland’s place is at the very heart of the European Union. Poland is the beating heart of Europe. Poland joining the European Union meant that we could start to move past five decades of historical division and suppression. It meant hope for Poland and hope for Europe. Polish citizens are European citizens, just as Polish judges are European judges. Being a Member State of the European Union is about both rights and responsibilities. It is both give and take. We share history, and we must share a future, and it is because of that shared future that we cannot be silent when the rule of law is under threat in Poland or anywhere. We cannot be silent when an electoral majority is used as an excuse to justify the unjustifiable. We cannot be silent when Polish justice is put under threat, and we will not be silent. The term ‘rule of law’ is not a phrase bandied about that means nothing. It means freedom; it means equality; it means rights. Ultimately, it means Europe. Without the protection of the rule of law, our Treaties risk becoming nice words printed on expensive paper, and without a truly independent judiciary, there cannot be rule of law.  Before this is spun as a partisan manoeuvre, let me be absolutely clear: standing up for the independence of judges to perform their function without fear or favour is not an attack on the Polish state, or far less on the Polish people. It is about protecting the European way and about protecting the people of Poland.  Finally, let me salute the courage of the Polish judges who are with us here today.

In just two years we have seen a hit-and-run succession of at least three legislative initiatives of the same smutering majority in the Sejm, in the Polish Parliament. I insist that no democracy is simply the government of the majority, let alone when that majority is based on a majority electoral award that does not correspond to the pluralism of Polish society.  Poland is a great country. It is the largest territory and population of the great expansion of 2004. Its first constitution, from 1791, is even before the first French Constitution of the revolutionary period and yet the european Parliament's concern with the rule of law in Poland is justified and comes again and again to our discussion. This has been highlighted by the Court: judgments which clearly show that the Judicial Office and the Disciplinary Chamber replacing the Supreme Court are incompatible with Article 19 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has also been binding since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty , also for Poland. Therefore, the message is clear. We must tell the judges and magistrates and the lawyers and judges from all over Europe who demonstrated this weekend, this Sunday, in Poland: \"They are not alone, you are not alone\".

And, indeed, it is serious: we have an EU Member State government – one of the biggest EU Member States governments – conducting a ruthless intimidation campaign against judges who are simply trying to protect their independence from political control. And more than 40 of them – and some of them here – have been targeted by disciplinary proceedings and smear campaigns orchestrated also with the help of the Ministry of Justice.  Let’s be absolutely clear on this: this kind of repression of independent judges is without precedent in the history of the European Union. And if this new legislation is passed, it could even happen that judges could be fired for interacting with or implementing the European Court of Justice rulings, which constitutes quite a blatant and clear challenge to the idea of the European Union as a community of law and common values. Unfortunately, in the Article 7 proceedings so far, the Council has been acting in a fairly opaque and timid fashion, unlike the Commission, which has thankfully acted with this request for an interim measure. But national governments can no longer duck their responsibility when it comes to protecting European values: as has been said, Polish judges are European judges, and the situation in Poland is a European problem. Without judicial independence, there is no European Union.

To be honest, there was one sentence said in that meeting that impressed me a lot, and that I wanted to repeat here in this Parliament. One of the representatives said: ‘I swore an oath on the Polish Constitution when I started my job, and with all I do I’m trying to stay true to this oath and defend the rights of Polish citizens’.  To me, this really encapsulates what kind of people we have to protect in situations like this: these are the kind of people that defend the rule of law, defend our democracies, and are the backbone of our democracies and of the systems that all of us have been profiting from in the past. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers are one of the fundaments of this tripartite system, and that is why protecting them really also means protecting the separation of powers, and thus our democracy. Indeed – and colleagues have mentioned it – what we have seen in Poland in the past years is an organised campaign against that very important backbone, and the Commissioner has mentioned the latest developments in this field.  This Parliament and the EU institutions have taken steps in order to defend the rule of law and European citizens in Poland, but I believe that the Article 7 procedure has actually proven to very often come too late and be too inflexible to meet all these attacks that have been happening. I think we need to have a more holistic vision, and the rule of law mechanism that is going to be proposed is one of the instruments that we need, together with budgetary measures and, of course, enabling civil society, enabling these representatives to work together.  Let me finish by saying that I really hope the Croatian Presidency is going to follow the Finnish example in standing up for the rule of law, but just be assured that – no matter what is going to happen – this Parliament will continue to stand up for the rule of law and democracy in the future.

All Poles sitting in this Chamber know this, including the judges who have been invited here. Four years ago, exactly a few days from now, this inglorious anniversary will pass, the Polish opposition organized a debate against Poland. On 19 January 2016, I had the honour of representing my country as Prime Minister of the Polish Government during a debate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. At that time, we talked about the situation in Poland, about reforms, about everything that is necessary to achieve and what the government of Law and Justice has undertaken to trust in democratic elections by citizens. During these four years, we have carried out a great many social, economic and administrative reforms. The Poles appreciated this and trusted us again, once again gave us a mandate of trust to form a government and continue these reforms that had begun. A lot of good has been done in these four years, but Poles still expect all the reforms, including justice reform, to be carried out, because the justice system is to serve the citizens, not to protect some of the certain privileges that a particular group wants to retain.  On Polish several occasions, this government, including myself here four years ago, has explained why reforms of the justice system are needed, a system that has not been reformed as the only one during the transition period, and it can be said that it is so far a relic of a communist state in a democratic Member State of the European Union. The European Commission knows this, you also know this here in Parliament, because we have talked about it many times, and that is why we have undertaken these reforms.

I would like to come back to yesterday’s decision of the College of Commissioners to request the European Court of Justice to take interim measures in the context of ongoing infringement proceedings, to suspend the functioning of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court. As Vice-President Jourová explained, despite the preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice and the judgment of the Supreme Court, ordinary court judges who seek to implement these rulings are subject to disciplinary proceedings, and the Disciplinary Chamber continues to fully operate. In view of the risk of irreparable damage faced by judges in Poland, I instructed the Commission’s Directorate-General for Justice already in December to closely monitor the situation and to prepare the necessary to enable the College to take the decision on interim measures, which was taken yesterday. It was urgent and needed. Regarding the new draft law currently under legislative process in Poland, the Venice Commission is due to provide an opinion. It is important that the recommendations of the Venice Commission are fully implemented in the legislative process. The Commission has invited Polish authorities not to take forward the proceedings on the new draft legislation before carrying out all the necessary consultations. The opinion of the Venice Commission will also feed the Commission assessment. I also again heard calls for a new rule-of-law mechanism. I can reassure you that the Commission will work on a comprehensive European rule-of-law mechanism as a matter of priority. It will cover all Member States and provide a synthesis of significant developments related to the different competences of the rule of law, including, for example, systemic problems with the process for enacting laws, lack of effective judicial protection by independent and impartial courts, the capacity to fight corruption, and issues in relation to media pluralism. This will allow us to identify and prevent early on rule-of-law-related issues. I want to insist, after some remarks, that each justice system is different and must always be looked at in a comprehensive manner. You cannot single out one specific provision from one Member State and compare it with a provision of another Member State without looking at the context of the legal system and the whole system of checks and balances in that Member State. As held by the Court of Justice in its rulings, although the organisation of justice in the Member States falls within the competence of the Member States, the fact remains that, when exercising that competence, the Member States are required to comply with their obligations deriving from EU law. The rule of law is our foundation and can never be compromised. We must ensure that it is respected and upheld everywhere. To conclude, the Commission will continue to monitor the situation in Poland very closely and remains ready to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Polish authorities. The introduction of infringement proceedings does not exclude dialogue. I will be in Zagreb at the informal ministerial meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on 23 and 24 January.

Let me start by making three points very clear. First, the Commission has zero tolerance for fraud or misuse of EU funds. Second, the Commission always diligently follows up on information or complaints with respect to conflict of interest in all Member States. Third, the Commission has been and is taking broad and coordinated action with respect to alleged conflicts of interest in the Czech Republic. What are the facts, and where are we in the audit procedure? The Commission services carried out audits in the Czech Republic in January and February 2019. These audits relate to the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. They are currently at different stages of the procedure. The audits for the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund are now in the follow-up stage. The final audit report provided to the Czech authorities does not represent the final step of the audit process for the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. The contents of the final audit report should therefore remain confidential until the procedure is closed. This means until the Commission has taken a final position as appropriate, in relation to the follow-up that the audit team will give to it. For the rural development investment measures, the Commission has communicated its letter of findings to the Member States, including preliminary conclusions and recommendations to avoid any situation of conflict of interest in the future. The contradictory procedure is ongoing, and the next step is a bilateral meeting with the Czech authorities. For all funds, the whole procedure until adoption of possible financial corrections can take up to 24 months. Confidentiality of the audit is a basic principle and of utmost importance. The Commission must ensure a fair and robust process. Former Commissioner Oettinger and now Commissioner Hahn have shared preliminary information with the Committee on Budgetary Control of this House, in camera. Under the confidentiality rules, I will therefore not comment on the substance of the audit findings today. Let me assure you that, while the audits go on, the EU budget is fully protected. No payments from the EU budget under the European structural and investment funds are being made to projects that could potentially be concerned by alleged conflict of interest. In relation to the Rural Development Fund, the Commission is not reimbursing to Czech authorities the amounts related to projects that could be potentially concerned by the alleged conflict of interest. Let me now say a few words on the Stork’s Nest project. The Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have reacted promptly to investigate potential fraud with respect to EU funding for the Stork’s Nest project. In December 2017, OLAF finalised its investigation. It recommended to the Commission to recover the full subsidy. OLAF also recommended to the competent Czech judicial authorities to take into account all of the findings in the ongoing national judicial investigation. The Czech authorities withdrew the project from EU financing and recovered the funds from the beneficiary. Consequently, there was no impact on either the EU or the national budget. The ongoing national judicial investigation is the exclusive competence of the Czech authorities. Finally, as regards the situation in other Member States, the Commission will equally follow up on allegations of non-resolved conflicts of interest in other Member States. In addition, the Commission is providing support to all Member States to correctly implement measures aimed at avoiding conflicts of interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 350, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Tomáš ZDECHOVSKÝ", "mepid": "124713", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the European Council, this debate is aimed at audits and investigations, but nevertheless, let us take it a little more generally.

One of the richest people in the Czech Republic, Andrej Babic, decides on the policy of that country and at the same time he votes in the European Council on the agricultural and structural policy that has made him rich. This is traditionally called a conflict of interest. But we should not be deceived. It is not the cause of the problem, it is just a symptom. Nevertheless, he is paralysing the country, he has his fingers in it everywhere. In addition to politics, he is gradually taking over the media and a number of economic sectors. He also has strong economic interests in other EU countries, from Hungary to Slovakia to Germany. Nevertheless, he is just one of many oligarchs who have become rich thanks to EU funds. The shocking thing is that we do not even know exactly to what extent Babic and other oligarchs benefit from the European Union budget. Because neither the Commission nor the Member States have enough information to be able to track exactly where the money from the agricultural budget or the Structural Funds actually ends up. We urgently need more transparency. We need a new system to stop this abuse and misallocation of EU subsidies. Without clear rules in the event of conflicts of interest, without rules on property disclosure and without strong conditionality, we will continue to keep this corrupt system alive. But even without political pressure to unravel the nested corporate networks on the land market and to bring to light the landowners who are really behind it, we will not solve this problem.

He later bought a significant part of the Czech media. Thanks to skilful professional marketing and the inability of competing political parties, he and his political project YES got into the Czech Parliament and government at the first attempt in 2013. He won the next election well in advance and became Prime Minister. His companies received large-scale European subsidies.  Political competition has never accepted defeat. She forced the Prime Minister to legally put his firms into a trust. A standard billionaire promotes his own advantage through corruption of politicians and their parties. The Prime Minister founded a company that set up an entertainment business with European subsidies. He seems to have unethically circumvented the rules. But let an independent court consider that. The media persecution of Prime Minister Babiš and street rallies against a government backed by the prime minister's opposition certainly cost a lot of money. But the prime minister's party's preferences have not been down, rather the opposite. He would win the new elections with the upper hand.  The real cause of the current situation is the European Union system, which allows corruption through subsidies to private enterprises. Instead of competition, competition for subsidies, which are an instrument ensuring dependence on and thus maintaining the EU system, is taking place. Solving possible criminal cases on a political platform is also a typically totalitarian practice.

He simply transferred his companies to a trust, which he controls through his relatives and can essentially cancel at any time. This is basically a very trivial trick and primitive action by a salon impostor. But let's take a look at the other part. Andrej Babiš is the owner of one of the largest economic groups within the Czech Republic and receives a very significant part of European subsidies. He uses this money to spread his influence within the Czech Republic and to maintain his position. Here, the European Union directly finances his political campaign for the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, the European Parliament and other institutions through Agrofert. This is a problem, because the state then acts as a lawyer for Andrej Babiš and unfortunately not only protects him, but also protects other friendly businessmen or politicians, or as you want to call them, who operate in a similar way in other countries.

I know this House fully supports the Commission in its fight against corruption in the structural funds. We need to ensure that public money is properly spent.  Let me recall that the Commission presented a proposal in May 2018 on the protection of the Union’s budget in cases of generalised defiance as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The proposal provides for a mechanism to reduce or suspend EU funding in cases of defiance of the rule of law. For instance, the following situations may lead to misuse of the EU funds or would prevent the application of the control mechanism in case of misuse of funds: threats to the independence of the judiciary system, arbitrary or unlawful decisions by public authorities, limited availability and effectiveness of legal remedies, failure to implement judgments, or limitations on effective investigation, prosecution or sanctions for breaches of law. The Commission’s top priority is to protect the EU budget. The Commission has zero tolerance for fraud or misuse of EU funds.  With respect to the allegations of conflicts of interests in the Czech Republic, the EU budget is fully protected. No payments from the EU budget under the European structural and investment funds are being made to projects that could potentially be concerned by the alleged conflict of interests. In relation to the Rural Development Fund, the Commission is not reimbursing the Czech authorities for the amounts related to projects that could be potentially affected by alleged conflict of interests. With respect to the reopening of the prosecution, the ongoing national judicial investigation is the exclusive competence of the Czech authorities. As the Czech authorities withdrew the product from EU financing, there was no impact on the EU budget. The Commission is committed to keeping the Parliament informed.

The devastating bush fires in Australia, the recent fires in the Amazon and Siberia, the droughts in Europe last summer, as well as the dramatic decline in pollinators – this all sadly illustrates the need to act. The European Commission has taken it seriously, and one of its first decisions has been to launch the European Green Deal, the new agenda for sustainable growth in the European Union, tackling the most serious climate and environmental challenges of our times. This Commission wants the European Union to lead on both climate neutrality and the road to the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversit (CBD) in Kunming in October 2020, where the world is to agree on the post—2020 global biodiversity framework.  I welcome the fact that the European Parliament fully supports this ambition. For the European Union, it means leading by example and therefore developing our own European commitments. The European Union Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which we will adopt by March 2020, will include proposals for such EU commitments and will set out our ambition for Kunming, including on global targets. Preparations for this strategy are currently going on at full speed within the Commission, and the resolution which you will adopt tomorrow will be an important input and inspiration for our own reflections and upcoming decisions. We failed twice to achieve our past ten-year biodiversity targets; we cannot allow ourselves to fail again.  Science is perfectly clear that we need a holistic approach for transformative change to address the climate and environment emergency. This should be the spirit for our preparations for CBD COP15, as well as for our work under the European Green Deal. As regards the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, we fully support the European Parliament’s demand for a stronger implementation mechanism and strengthen tools for accountability. We need a systemic and regular cycle for reviewing implementation of the committed actions and progress in reducing the pressures on biodiversity. We should agree on one or a small number of clear overarching long-term goals, similar to the 1.5-degree objective for climate change, in order to maintain political support through the period. We should also kick-start the cycle immediately. Parties should respond to the global framework by 2021, allowing a stocktaking of actions and commitments at COP16 in 2022, at least for the most important issues.  Finally, the monitoring and indicator framework should include headline indicators that are common across parties and hence allow an assessment of the national contributions to achieving the global targets. A stronger implementation and review mechanism will boost work under many environmental agreements. Let me highlight, in this context, the synergies with our important work on international ocean governance, and in particular with our ongoing negotiations on a new international treaty under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea to protect marine biodiversity in the high seas.  It is essential to ensure the means of implementation. The European Union and its Member States collectively lived up to the international commitment to double international biodiversity financing to developing countries. We need financial flows from all sources to benefit nature and biodiversity more, including by mobilising domestic resources. Let me stress three further important aspects in this context. First, the world still spends much more on subsidies that are harmful to biodiversity than it spends on pro-biodiversity action. We need much more progress on phasing out the subsidies and reshaping them to ensure that they are compatible and supportive to biodiversity conservation. Secondly, restoration of ecosystems is typically more expensive than conservation. The quicker we protect the remaining valuable nature and we address the drivers of biodiversity loss, the less we will need to restore, if possible, and the cheaper it will be.  Finally, we need to massively scale-up investments in climate—resilient, nature-based solutions which multiply benefits for biodiversity, climate—change mitigation and adaptation, food security, and finally, of course, health. For the European Union, leading by example means that we should make strong commitments to better protect and climate-proof the biodiversity—rich areas, to restore degraded ecosystems in nature across rural and urban landscapes, to sustainably use and manage our agricultural, forest and ocean resources, and to integrate biodiversity across policies and sectors, including in our outermost regions and territories.  We need to make sure that we deliver on our commitments, this time by creating the adequate enabling environment, from full implementation and enforcement of the EU’s nature legislation to potentially developing new legislation for restoring nature, mainstreaming biodiversity and providing adequate financing. The next multiannual financial framework will be crucial in this regard. We need to guarantee that adequate resources are provided for the protection, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems through the core EU funding instruments, such as the common agricultural policy, cohesion and regional funds, Horizon Europe, the external action financial instrument and LIFE. We need to ensure that such funding leverages private funding through investEU.  We need to ensure a just transition where the necessary transformational change do not leave anyone behind. This means we have to support, for example, our farmers, forest managers and fishermen and women along this transition. We also need to avoid exporting the damage of biodiversity outside the European Union by consuming unsustainably produced and traded products. This is why the future EU biodiversity strategy will need to address sustainable consumption and production, a reduction of the EU’s ecological footprint and the integration of biodiversity into our trade policy.  We also need to engage much better with our international partners and various stakeholders. For example, we need to work with businesses and financial actors with the tools to account for their biodiversity dependency and impacts, so that they can take the right measures to support and contribute to biodiversity.  The window of opportunity to achieve our global biodiversity vision to live in harmony with nature is narrowing fast, and the next years will be crucial. Knowing the time it takes to get to implementation, this Commission is very aware of its responsibility during its five-year mandate. You can count on our full commitment to work hard and achieve our common objective.

Thank you, Commissioner, for your presentation. First of all, I would like to make a reminder as a thank you, when talking about the fight against climate change, but also about the global protection of biodiversity, scientists and activists. I believe that this Parliament has to thank them, because thanks to them there is a level of awareness and also of current political commitment to science and environmentalists. Look, I'm going to quickly tell you some data. Since 1900, the average abundance of native species in most major terrestrial habitats has declined,\" you hear, by at least 20%. More than 40% of amphibian species, nearly 33% of reef corals and more than a third of all marine mammals are threatened; 10% of insects as well. This is the sixth mass extinction of species.  What do the citizens of the European Union think? Well, according to the latest polls, 96% say that nature needs to be protected and that responsibility is everyone's responsibility. Therefore, protecting life on our planet and responding to the demands of citizens have been the priorities with which the Social Democrats have approached this resolution.  And I'm going to tell you seven points very quickly. The ecological transition, ladies and gentlemen, has to be fair. We must prevent new inequalities from being created. Second, environmental taxation. I won't get tired of saying it in this House. We need enough resources. A new green tax model. The one who pollutes the most has to pay more. Deforestation — and this is very important — the European Union has to legislate to achieve deforestation-free supply chains. We have to fight the illegal logging of forests. The agreement, as the rapporteur of the People's Party has also said, to be adopted in China has to be binding, because otherwise we will have achieved nothing. The increase in protected areas to 30% by 2030 to 50% by 2050 is very important. And finally, too, reduce the percentage of pesticides. Achieve a percentage— rather — for the reduction of pesticides.

We are not just destroying living conditions by increasing climate change, but also through the overconsumption of resources, overexploitation and the way we are producing our livelihoods – that is affecting the whole future of biodiversity and the flora and fauna of this planet. The world’s top scientists are warning that even a million species will disappear from the planet by 2030 if we don’t act and change our behaviour.  So it’s obvious that the COP meeting on biodiversity has to be a similar meeting as Paris was for climate. We need legally binding targets because none of the previous targets we’ve had globally have been met. So we need implementation, we need a legally binding process, so that all countries will increase their protected areas and will change the way their economies work. That’s why in the European Parliament and in the Green group we want to push for a 30% target for both marine and terrestrial protection that will also affect and apply to European Union countries. That’s what the Commission should work on so that we also, as the first big actor in the COP meeting, will say that we are prepared to do this within Europe – make it legally binding. We need to restore also areas that are damaged. This is a big part of protecting diversity and reversing the state of biodiversity. That also has to be included in the targets.

There are companies and organisations developing a technology that can wipe out fauna – a whole population of mosquitoes, for example – if it’s prematurely put into nature and we Greens want a moratorium on this technology so that it’s not used in a way which has harmful consequences that are totally unknown and could be totally unprecedented.

The reform of agricultural subsidies, as now proposed, does not do this. We need to move on to organic farming techniques and away from monoculture farming.  Forestry is also a key element. 80% of species live in our forests and how we use our forests is absolutely essential for diversity.

Likewise, many areas are permanently sealed, which does not prevent them from demanding, with false fervor, better certification of products without deforestation. Can I laugh? On the one hand, there is lament of the overexploitation of the seas, the deterioration of coastal regions is lamented, and on the other hand, the Green Deal swears by the great importance of the seas for the construction of offshore wind turbines. And those who who once failed to prevent a ban on cadmium and lead in solar panels or sulphur hexafluoride, are now gruming about the use of pesticides and are also the same ones who do not at least shrug when the degradation of rare earths – in batteries, for example – is caused by highly radioactive thorium and other toxic waste products in China, and instead moan about the alleged stress of biodiversity.

First of all on pesticides: according to scientists, intensive agriculture is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss.

My proposals on monoculture and pesticides: firstly, support family farms more. These bring diversity to the fields, save the bee and the profession of the farmer.

Mr President, I would like to thank the This week, we discussed very intensively the need for the European institutions to move closer to the citizen. We want to establish a European Convention so that citizens can have a say in how the European Union should develop and how to proceed – the key word: democratisation, the key word: transparency. However, ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget that with the European Ombudsman we have an institution that is very close to the citizen, and closer to the citizen, one could almost say, is not possible. You can get in touch with the Ombudsman directly, you can write to him, you can even say that you can touch him if you want. It is also important to bear in mind and to say that the Ombudsman is there for the citizens and not for the Council, not for the Commission and not for the European Parliament. In other words, as ombudsmen, we sometimes have to look at the institutions, the Commission and the Council, and yet we must cooperate intensively. I congratulate the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, on their work and their constructive efforts to achieve this balancing act, if you like, to cooperate with us and to respect the interests of the citizens. It is a question of improving the quality of the management of the European Union and the access and quality of its services for citizens. In particular, I would like to commend Mrs O'Reilly's work on transparency in the Council, in which you – I would say this explicitly – have been strongly supported by Parliament. On the other hand, this has caused less joy in the Council. But transparency and public access to Council documents is essential, and it can really be said that the Council could cut off at least two slices of the European Parliament – no more and no less. We demand transparency from the Council, that is what we are doing, and that is what the Council should do. It is important that European Union legislative procedures are made more accountable to the public, and it is also important that we can bring this closer to the citizens. We call on the Council, as one of the two bodies of European legislation, not to act as a diplomatic forum, but to adapt its working methods to the standards of parliamentary democracy, as required by the Treaties. It was a pleasure for me to work on the report. We have had good cooperation between or with the rapporteurs. We have produced a good report, we have ensured that it has been depoliticised – I always call it this – so that it has been able to achieve a broad majority. That was really the case when the report was adopted in the Committee on Petitions by 28 votes in favour, one against and one abstention. This is also a good sign for the work of the Committee on Petitions, if you like, and also a good sign of cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman. I hope that this can continue this year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 423, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Emily O'Reilly", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   European Ombudsman. – Mr President, good evening everybody and thank you to Mr Jahr and to the shadow rapporteurs for your work on this report. It is always a great pleasure to present the annual reports of my office to Parliament. However, this year is particularly significant, as I am presenting our work to a new Parliament, with many new Members and which four weeks ago voted confidence in me and in that work by electing me for a second mandate. I am very grateful for that trust and I intend fully to live up to it. I also very much welcome the presence of Commissioner Šefčovič at this debate, which comes at the very beginning of this Commission’s mandate and I wish it well in the vital work it does for everyone in Europe and also for many beyond our borders, Honourable Members, as Ombudsman I am the bridge between citizens and the EU administration when problems arise and complaints are made. The complaints come from individuals, civil society organisations, businesses, journalists and often from Members of this Parliament. We apply not only EU law in our analysis, but also the principles of good administration, seeking a just outcome for citizens who are often overwhelmed by the at times technocratic nature and distance of the EU administration. We are not advocates, but we try to create a balanced playing field between the often powerless complainant and the very powerful institutions. The year 2018 saw a strong increase in complaints that fall within my mandate, and this continued in 2019. This is not because the EU administration lowered its standards, but because many more people became aware of the work of my office and what it has achieved and can achieve.  I am grateful to the EU institutions, agencies and bodies for their cooperation in this work. The vast majority of cases are dealt with through a strong collaborative engagement with the administration and it is important to acknowledge that. Yes, I highlight problems, because that is my job, but I also witness all of the good work of EU officials and have indeed publicly and tangibly acknowledged it through an awards scheme introduced to showcase and praise their work and to share good practice throughout the administration. As in previous years, accountability and transparency related inquiries made up the highest proportion of my office’s work. In 2018, I also used one of the Ombudsman’s infrequently used powers: that of submitting a Special Report to the European Parliament. This was only the second time I had done so since my first election as Ombudsman. In 2013, I told Parliament that this power should be used very rarely and only in particularly serious cases where an institution does not act upon Ombudsman recommendations. That Special Report concerned an inquiry into the accountability of the Council of the EU, notably through the lack of transparency of the legislative processes used for discussing and amending draft EU legislation. The public has a right to know how their governments contribute to shaping that EU legislation. Without that right being exercised, the ‘blame Brussels’ culture will continue with national Ministers obscuring their own role in the making of laws that affect their citizens. I was very grateful to receive the overwhelming support of the Plenary for my proposals. While these recommendations have met some resistance from larger Member States, I welcome the growing coalition of governments in Council that have publicly expressed support for such changes. At the moment, it is 10 Member States and I hope that the current Presidency and the following German Presidency will take up this issue of importance to European democracy and indeed legitimacy. As the European Ombudsman, I also coordinate the European Network of Ombudsmen – which consists of 96 offices in 36 European countries, with the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions also being a member. The 2018 annual conference took place in April in the European Parliament in Brussels, with Michel Barnier as keynote speaker, and I am very grateful for the highly professional support of Parliament in helping us make the event such a success.  At the start of the Ombudsman’s new five-year mandate, it is important to ask and to examine what role it should play within the architecture of the EU in 2020 and beyond. If the Von der Leyen Commission is going to be the ‘geopolitical’ Commission, and become more involved in migration issues, foreign policy, defence cooperation and in tackling the global climate crisis – alongside several EU agencies – then who will provide oversight of this work? This Parliament will provide the democratic oversight, of course, and the Ombudsman must also provide oversight of an EU administration which arguably is more directly hands on and on the ground than ever before. Whether it is Frontex coordinating forced return flights for migrants, or EASO interviewing asylum seekers in the Greek islands, or the European Defence Agency trying to envisage the technology required for a 21st century battlefield, the EU is changing and so the Ombudsman must also adapt in order to keep pace with that change. However, the reality is that the Office consists of fewer than seventy (70) posts. We are receiving record numbers of complaints and dealing with more and more complex cases. The lack of resources of my Office has already been recognised by Parliament in the annual budgetary process and in the ongoing revision of the Ombudsman statute. However, I do ask that this issue is discussed further and in a more comprehensive way, and especially with the Commission and Council, and I hope we can find an agreed way forward. It is in the interest of all of us, that the Ombudsman’s office is fully equipped and resourced for the 21st century. We must be able to fulfil our role under the EU treaties, in line with the expectations of European citizens, and in this new ‘geopolitical’ world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 424, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, Madam Ombudsman, I am very pleased to be here tonight and to have the opportunity to discuss with you the annual report of the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2018 and the report of the Committee on Petitions (PETI). Let me start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Peter Jahr, the coordinators of the PETI committee and its members who have been involved in this valuable work. As every year, these reports provide all EU institutions, agencies, bodies and offices with the views of Parliament on the issues that it considers as being noteworthy and important. As far as the Commission is concerned, I would like to assure you that the Commission is very much committed to ensuring good administration in our relations with the citizens, associations and businesses with whom we interact. This is a fundamental part of our work, and we attach great importance to the quality of these relations.  The Commission is indeed dedicated to the values of service, independence, responsibility, accountability, efficiency and transparency, and it strives to put the citizens’ right to good administration into practice and to avoid instances of maladministration. The cooperation with the European Ombudsman is key in this respect, especially as around two-thirds of European Ombudsman inquiries, namely 58.2% or 285 inquiries in 2018, concerned the European Commission. We are indeed the institution with the most direct administrative dealings with the citizens. Every year, the Commission agrees with around three-quarters of the European Ombudsman’s proposals, be they proposals for a solution, suggestions for improvement or recommendations. Thus, in most cases where the Ombudsman issues recommendations, proposals for a solution or suggestions for improvement, the Commission and the Ombudsman agree in the end. This explains why, at the end of the day, only around 6% of the inquiries end with finding of maladministration. In other words, the Ombudsman, after diligent inquiries, in an overwhelming majority of cases, closes complaints with no conclusions of maladministration on the side of the Commission, either because there was indeed no instance of maladministration or because a satisfying outcome could be achieved.  The Commission’s high standards of good administration have been highlighted by the European Ombudsman, notably on the occasion of the European Ombudsman award for good administration. In 2019, the Commission won the overall prize, which recognises initiatives having a visible and direct positive impact on the lives of people in Europe and beyond for its work on the reduction of plastic pollution and awareness—raising about single—use plastics. It also won several awards in different subcategories. The Commission is also aware that it has to continue to pave the way, assess, improve even more and, where necessary, correct its administrative practices. This is why the Commission will pursue the very constructive relationship it has built with the Ombudsman over the years, first and foremost in the interest of the European citizens and other interested parties. I look forward to the debate tonight with the Honourable Members, and I thank you already for your attention.

As shadow rapporteur from The S&amp;D of Mrs O'Reilly's work in 2018, I was impressed by her professionalism, courage and dedication to defending the interests of the citizens of the European Union in relation to various institutions, which was also proven by the fact that she was re-elected to this position. Transparency, accountability of European officials, access to information and documents were several areas where Mrs O'Reilly was very active and where she came up with appropriate solutions. In this respect, Mrs O'Reilly has come up with concrete proposals to ensure the highest possible degree of transparency across all european institutions. Transparency is a fundamental element of the rule of law and I call on the new European Commission to take into account Mrs O'Reilly's proposals in this regard. Mr. Martin Selmayr.  According to Romanian law, as a parenthesis, such an act would have been classified as an act of corruption, and the guilty would have been prosecuted, at least for abuse of office and conflict of interest.

I want to, but I don’t have time so I will not.  We all know that Emily O’Reilly has done an excellent job and I congratulate her on her re—election. However, this election has shown that there are some procedural problems. It will be our task in the Committee on Petitions to change or clarify the election procedure for the next term. It should be in line with the principles that the Ombudsman stands for: clear, transparent and fair. There should be rules on campaigning for, as we all know, this campaign, unfortunately, was kind of dirty sometimes, and we of course need a very clear timeframe so as not to put those candidates who are acting according to the rules into a vulnerable position in comparison with others. After the adoption of this report tomorrow, we also need a vision for the future. I agree with what was said by my colleagues from the PPE and S&amp;D Groups, but I would like to highlight another thing. There are still things which have to be done regarding good administration in EU institutions, and the procedure behind Commission responses is one of them. When we send citizens’ complaints about Member States and possible infringements to the Commission, the Commission asks the national authorities about this. They ask the possible infringer whether they are breaking EU law, and the answer is of course always, ‘no’. What is interesting is that the Commission is normally satisfied with this answer and we receive answers from the Commission saying that there is no problem and no infringement. This means that we are not standing on the side of the citizen who is complaining and who is in an unequal battle with European bureaucracy. This needs to be changed. The same applies to the ‘EU Pilot’ where we can submit individual complaints about possible infringements. The process is not transparent. The documents of closed files are not openly available and getting them is a big problem. I would like to see a more proactive and more transparent approach, and of course I look forward to cooperating with the Ombudsman further and hopefully to solving this problem.

Indeed, its institutions violate the most basic rules of ethics. This is particularly the case for the Brussels Commission and the European Central Bank, as evidenced by the European Ombudsman's 2018 report. Page 9, the Ombudsman denounces the way in which the European Commission appointed its Secretary General, The German Martin Selmayr in February 2018. On this occasion, it denounced \"four instances of maladministration, including the creation of a fictitious state of emergency to fill the post\". I take it that I was right to denounce the illegality of his appointment, both in this Chamber and in the Committee on Legal Affairs. Alas, it took 16 months to hear me and get rid of Selmayr. Following the scandal, the Ombudsman called for a detailed procedure for the appointment of the Secretary-General. Alas, it points out in its report that 'the Commission has refused to put such a procedure in place'. The lack of transparency therefore persists. On page 13, the Ombudsman also pins the European Central Bank and more specifically its President Mario Draghi, whom she accuses of having joined a private organisation, the \"Group of 30\", which includes the directors of the major private banks. Despite these admonitions, Draghi remained a member of the Group of 30. The Ombudsman infers very alarmingly that this is likely to cast doubt on the independence of the European Central Bank from financial lobbies. The Ombudsman thus confirms the reality of what I keep denouncing: the European Union lacks transparency and ethics.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 428, "date": "2020-01-15.json", "name": "Kosma ZŁOTOWSKI", "mepid": "124884", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Dear Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments.

Some may consider this a mere formality, but we have now witnessed a great public debate in the Czech Republic, when the President of the Republic proposed a new candidate for ombudsman, a prominent professor of criminal law, who, however, it turned out that in the 1970s she cooperated with communist prosecutors who sent some political prisoners in the Czech Republic to their deaths, such as Dr. Milada Horáková.

The diligence and the integrity with which you continue to do your work and take an interest in things here, and even in this small office, when there were so many bigger things clamouring for your attention. I wish you all of the very best and we will miss you, and thank you. Could I say, just taking up some of the points that were made. Thank you Mr Terheş for your comments, for your work and for your praise for my work and the work of the colleagues.  Ms Toom, thank you for taking note of issues that arose in relation to the election procedure, the Rules of Procedure. It won’t be my problem in five years’ time, but there is an important conversation to be had in relation to the election of the European Ombudsman. In relation to the case involving the former secretary, the appointment of the former Secretary-General of the Commission: yes, the outgoing Commission, the last Commission, did reject the recommendation. But as Vice-President Šefčovič has just noted, this time it was different, and the appointment of the new Secretary-General has been pretty much in line with the recommendations that we made in our investigation. Mr Złotowski: the trilogues – yes, we have investigated that in the past, it’s unfinished business, and we shall be going back to see what is happening there.  Mr Georgoulis: yes, citizens’ participation is absolutely vital, and particularly for the legitimacy of the EU, and that underpins so much of the work that we do. I agree with Mr Furore, the right of access 1049/2001 is an old regulation, but even short of revising it, there is still an awful lot we can do to have more recommendations accepted, more documents made accessible to the people whom we serve. Council transparency – yes, our big piece, work in progress, but I can see progress and I note in particular that from an issue that was somewhat marginal and somewhat within the Brussels and Strasbourg bubble, it is now becoming more mainstream. Ms Evi, thank you for all your great support. Transparency again: the ECB, all of these agencies and institutions – we need to open them up to greater public scrutiny into greater accountability. The comments in relation to disability, to assisted technology; we certainly take them on board, and we take those particular issues a particularly seriously. I was very pleased to see just last week, the EEAS advertising for paid traineeships, and that arises out of the joint work of my Office and with many people from the Parliament, led by Mr Benifei.

The Treaty of Lisbon introduced the differentiation between delegated and implementing acts and, on this basis, the co—legislator adopted the Comitology Regulation. It lays down the mechanisms for control by Member States over the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers. The regulation also provides for the right of Parliament and the Council to be fully informed of the draft implementing acts submitted by the Commission to the committees of Member States. It also provides for a scrutiny right to address situations in which the Commission may have exceeded its implementing powers.  I think that it’s fair to say that the regulation is fulfilling its purpose. Why? Because, in 2018, the committees provided opinions on 1 633 draft implementing acts. There was no negative opinion and there were 32 so—called ‘no opinion’ cases in 2018. This ‘no opinion’ means that there is no qualified majority in favour or against draft implementing acts in the committee because of either the contrasting positions of the Member States or abstentions. In specific cases, the Appeal Committee must be consulted in such no—opinion scenarios. In 2018, this was the case for 12 draft implementing acts in the areas of health and consumer policy. In all of these 12 cases, the Appeal Committee also delivered a no, or lack of, opinion. It is precisely this very limited number of cases that have led to discussions, mainly because they have so far occurred in the politically sensitive areas of the authorisation of genetically modified food and feed and, to a lesser extent, in relation to the approval of active substances for plant protection products. When the Appeal Committee also delivers no opinion, the Commission may adopt the implementing act proposed. Indeed, the logic of the Comitology Regulation is only blocked from adopting an act if there is opinion in the Committee against it. This has been a guiding principle in comitology from the very beginning and ensures efficient implementation. As regards the 12 implementing acts in the areas of health and consumer policy, the respective substantive legal framework, not the Comitology Regulation, actually obliges the Commission to take the decision based on the procedural requirements and solid evidence gathered. In these cases of a lack of qualified majority in the Committee, the Commission has therefore been legally bound to take, at times, very unpopular decisions. The Juncker Commission therefore decided to propose, as a priority, to change these rules and put forward targeted amendments on the functioning of the Appeal Committee, with the objective of allowing for greater accountability on the part of the Member States in the decision—making process. The proposed amendments were the following: first, to calculate the qualified majority out of Member States which are present or represented and which do not abstain – and that means not all of the Member States; second, to provide for the possibility for a second referral to the Appeal Committee at ministerial level to address the problematic issues a second time; and, third, to make individual Member States’ representatives’ votes at Appeal Committee level public – this is what we discussed a few minutes ago – and to provide for the possibility to refer the matter to the Council for a non-binding opinion and overall political guidance.  Where do we stand with this proposal? Overall, there was practically no progress over the last close to three years. On the Council side, there has been no support whatsoever for this proposal. On the Parliament side, the lead Committee on Legal Affairs has not yet presented a draft report and only some opinion—giving committees supported the proposal. I therefore welcome today’s debate because it gives us the opportunity to collectively take stock of the situation. We have, however, to be realistic and frank. Unless there is a bold move that would help unblock this file, it is unlikely that progress will be made any time soon. The new Commission will factor this and your views today into ultimately deciding on how to proceed in the framework of the assessment of all pending proposals, ahead of the adoption of the Commission 2020 work programme. In any case, the Commission intends to continue to use all existing means to encourage Member States to take on their responsibility in the comitology process and to come to the solutions with Member States that find the widest possible support in the committee. Let me also refer to some concrete steps we are taking to improve the transparency of comitology, which I believe are also very important for this House. I will soon launch a new, modernised comitology register. The new public register will not only provide access to all draft implementing acts, but will also allow more user—friendly access to information on committees and their meetings. I will also work jointly with you and the Council to make sure that the non—binding delineation criteria between delegating and implementing acts that we agreed on last year will actually facilitate negotiations and bring benefits.  The Commission is fully committed to respecting the criteria when preparing legislative proposals and during legislative negotiations. In parallel, we must also jointly advance negotiations on the outstanding alignment of acts that still make reference to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. We were very successful here in agreeing on the first package last year, but work needs to continue on the remaining parts of the package. I’m looking forward to hearing your views on this file because I believe it would help us in finalising the work on the Commission work programme for this year.

I would like to say that at the end of the last mandate, surprisingly, we had some progress, especially in the area of realignment in the comitology area. However, we did not get this specific dossier through. The Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) is just in the process of starting to consider this. However, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) have provided opinions on the proposed regulation. These opinions underline the importance of keeping the comitology framework as it stands, since it’s working properly, but they also agree that the transparency aspect should be further enhanced. The JURI Committee is basically focusing on this request from the other committees, especially in the area of political transparency and accountability. In a number of high-profile cases, however, according to the present procedure, in the absence of a clear position from the Member State, the political responsibility for taking a final decision falls upon the Commission, which without clear political backing from the Member State, is an undesirable situation.  This is what the reform presented in 2007 was intended to remedy in full agreement with the general aim of the proposal. We have to face the fact, however, that taking into account the kind of resistance that most Member States show against it in the Council, the future of this reform is at least highly unpredictable and non-favourable. I particularly regret that the part of the proposal provoking this controversy among Member States also affects the rest of the suggestions, which are otherwise valuable and forward—looking in themselves.

As the Commissioner has already mentioned, it is also possible for Member States not to express their opinion and pass the decision on to the Commission, even in politically very sensitive areas that have a direct impact on citizens' health and safety, such as authorisations, genetic engineering or the authorisation of active substances with pesticides. That is not satisfactory. This is really not satisfactory, because the lack of transparency means that a different voting behaviour in the respective Member States can be communicated to the outside world than it actually was, according to the motto: wash my fur, but please do not wet me. For these reasons, I am very positive about the Commission's proposals to improve the procedure: the change in the method of calculation, the mandatory referral to the Appeals Committee and also the publication of electoral behaviour in the Appeals Committee. I reject the proposal by some colleagues, which we have just heard in this House, that the Commission should withdraw the proposal and make a new proposal that the Council likes better. Because it must be clear to us that any new proposal will be a watered-down version of the current proposal.
