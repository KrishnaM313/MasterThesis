Let me start with a letter. As I previously mentioned to this House, Deal or No Deal, it was of utmost importance to ensure that the Withdrawal Agreement will be operational in time, as of 1 January 2021. This was a matter of trust and mutual respect of international law obligations. Yesterday, we held the fifth regular meeting of the EU—UK Joint Committee on the Withdrawal Agreement. This meeting marked an important milestone. It followed the bilateral agreement in principle that I had reached with the UK Co—Chair, Chancellor Michael Gove, last week and reported immediately back to the UK Coordination Group of the European Parliament. In the meantime, the Member States have managed to swiftly approve the relevant decisions, and today I am therefore pleased to confirm that we have officially endorsed the necessary formal decisions and practical solutions for the timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and that of its Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland by the end of the transition period. In relation to the Protocol implementation, this means that we have delivered on our overarching objective: to protect the Good Friday Belfast Agreement, avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and thereby contribute to maintain peace, stability and prosperity on that island. This was only possible thanks to the dedication and solution—driven approach on both sides. This is also a testament to our shared commitment to the Good Friday Belfast Agreement. These solutions provide businesses and people in Northern Ireland with the necessary clarity and stability, while upholding the integrity of our single market.  As far as the EU is concerned, we have achieved our two main priorities. First, to obtain robust working arrangements for an EU presence in Northern Ireland so that our representatives can effectively carry out their tasks on the ground. In particular, I welcome that the UK has finally agreed to provide adequate equipment and facilities, as well as continuous real—time access to the relevant IT systems and databases both on the ground and remotely. Our EU representatives will thus be able to carry out their monitoring tasks on site at all places where goods and animals enter or exit Northern Ireland through ports or airports. This is key to ensure that the Protocol is implemented correctly by the UK authorities in Northern Ireland, thereby protecting the integrity of the EU single market. Second priority: to make sure that the UK Government not only continues to actively engage in the timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, in the Joint Committee framework, but also commits to withdrawing all contentious parts of its Internal Market Bill and refraining from introducing any similar parts in its taxation bill. This it finally did last week, as part of our bilateral agreement in principle.  Given these reassurances, we were also able to find workable solutions for a number of areas. In detail, the Joint Committee adopted five decisions – four decisions on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland: the evaluation decisions on the practical arrangements for the Union presence in Northern Ireland; a decision on goods not at risk of entering the EU single market; a decision on the exemption of agricultural and fish subsidies from state aid rules; and a decision to correct some technical errors and omissions in Annex II of the Protocol. And one decision on the extension of social security coordination to the European Economic Area and Switzerland, as of 1 January 2021.  The Joint Committee also took note of the list of 25 persons, including five chairpersons, to serve as arbitrators for the Dispute Settlement Mechanism under the Withdrawal Agreement. This decision will be adopted shortly.  In addition to these decisions, we have adopted a set of unilateral declarations to set out pragmatic and time—limited solutions where the UK was not fully ready for the end of the transition period, whilst ensuring credible pathways to full compliance in the forthcoming months. These solutions concern a number of areas: temporary border control posts specifically for checks on animals, plants and derived products; export declarations; the supply of medicines; the supply of chilled meat and other food products to the supermarkets; and clarification on the application of state aid rules under the terms of the Protocol.  I underline again that these temporary solutions are subject to strict conditions to ensure that all relevant stakeholders will be in a position to fully comply with the Protocol in the course of 2021. Last but not least, we also agreed to pursue our joint efforts in assuring that during the grace period until 30 June 2021 and beyond, the rights of our citizens and UK nationals are effectively protected. The Joint Committee thus endorsed and agreed to publish the Second Joint Report on the implementation of residents’ rights prepared by the respective specialised committee. This report provides an update on national residency schemes in the UK and in the European Union. It also outlines outreach and assistance measures to support EU citizens and UK nationals, including vulnerable groups, and to inform important stakeholders such as employers. Much remains to be done, but yesterday marked an important first and decisive step in living up to the commitments of the Withdrawal Agreement. Before passing the floor to our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, I want to underline that we will need to continue paying full attention to the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement in 2021. We will focus on how our mutually—agreed solutions will actually work on the ground. To this end, we also agreed yesterday that the Joint Committee will meet at least quarterly during the upcoming year.  I want to thank you, honourable Members of the European Parliament, for your support in this endeavour. I will of course continue to keep this House regularly abreast of, and closely associated with, all upcoming developments on the Withdrawal Agreement implementation front.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-12-18.json", "name": "Michel BARNIER", "mepid": "72776", "text": "   head of the task force for relations with the United Kingdom. Madam President, hello to each and every one of you, in this very long and extraordinary negotiation which I have the honour of leading on behalf of the Commission and on your behalf for more than four years now, having succeeded together, with Parliament and the Council, in preparing a treaty of withdrawal from the European Union for the United Kingdom, as it wished.  It is this treaty that maroe 'eef-ovi' has just spoken of, which I would like to thank personally and before you for its tenacity and the efficiency with which he and our team have managed to organise, finally, all the last concrete and operational modalities, so that this treaty ratified last year by your Parliament and by the British Parliament is implemented, as we expected and as is normal and necessary for Ireland to be , the economy of the whole island and the protection of the internal market, and that it be operational in due course, in a few days. What we are talking about right now, in front of you, is a second negotiation. Beyond leaving the European Union, the question is whether the UK is leaving the single market and customs union with an agreement or no deal in 10 days. We are at a moment of truth. We have very little time left - a few hours - in this negotiation, if we want this agreement to come into force on 1 January. As our President Ursula von der Leyen told you two days ago, the possibility of an agreement is there , I think it is as a negotiator , but the road is very narrow. At a time when we have to make decisions, it will also be time for everyone to take responsibility. I will take mine, as I have done throughout my public engagement, in accordance with the mandate set for me by the 27 Member States of the European Union, which has been supported and confirmed by the vast majority of Parliament's political groups through your resolutions. Today I want to highlight three fundamental elements in this negotiation. It was the British who set the very short deadline to which we are now obliged. By refusing in June any form of extension of the transition that would have been possible, proposed to them and with which we agreed, they set the deadline of 31 December for this moment of truth. Should they come out, as we wish, with an agreement, or will they leave the single market and the customs union without agreement? It was the British who chose that deadline. The second point is that this is an extraordinary negotiation, conducted in nine months, as we have never seen in the past, on so many subjects that are at the heart of your resolutions and the mandate. Although we regret that the British did not have the will to go further, including through a foreign policy, defence and cooperation agreement, which we were prepared to negotiate, that is their choice. It takes two to negotiate and to reach an agreement. Nevertheless, what remains and what we have been working on for the last nine months is considerable, since it covers all subjects, or virtually all subjects, to establish new cooperation in other forms, in a new framework, after the departure of the British, in the areas where we have had, for 47 years, joint work and action within the framework of the Union. And that is why this partnership is unprecedented: both in the time required for negotiation — I recall that it took four or five years to negotiate a more modest agreement with Canada or with Japan — and by the magnitude of the issues we need to address. Finally, third point: in such an agreement - this is your mandate, this is your resolution - everything forms a coherent whole and there is no agreement on anything until there is agreement on everything. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. So it is not surprising that, in the last hours we are in, the very great difficulties of negotiation, the most difficult and the hardest points, as I have often said before the European Parliament's coordination group, which David McAllister leads, and yesterday again before the chairs of your groups, are also concentrated. Since the beginning of this negotiation, the British have set a fundamental requirement since the beginning of this negotiation, which is the raison d'être of Brexit, that they want to regain their full sovereignty. At the same time, they must respect the sovereignty of the Member States of the Union, which form a united whole across the European Union. And we have a fundamental requirement: this Union of 27 Member States, which operates democratically on a voluntary basis and under the control and impetus of your Parliament, is based on common values, common policies, an economic and social foundation that is the single market, much more than a free trade area, an ecosystem; and we call for the preservation of these values, these principles and this single market. We want open and ambitious trade and economic cooperation, but it must be fair and equitable, free and fair, fair and free. It must be based on what is called a level playing field - I prefer to say 'fair competition', 'fair competition', that is, fair competition rules and high standards, particularly in terms of social standards, the environment and climate. And if the sovereign United Kingdom wants to diverge in the future, that is its right, but it cannot be without consequences when it comes to having access to our markets without tariffs and quotas. The United Kingdom also wants to regain its sovereignty over fishing, to be able to control access to its waters. As I have said many times and I repeat before you, we accept it and we respect it. But if the United Kingdom wants, after a period of credible and sufficient adjustment, to be able to cut off access to its waters for European fishermen at any time, the European Union must also have a sovereign right to react or compensate, then adjusting the conditions of access to its market for all products, and in particular for fishing products. That is one of the major difficulties of negotiating this fisheries issue today, which is part of our overall economic partnership. Ladies and gentlemen, I personally believe that it would be neither fair nor acceptable for European fishermen to have only transitional rights in British waters that would one day evaporate, while the rest of the agreement, especially for British businesses, would remain stable. That would not be acceptable or fair. Those are the main points that separate us today. Of course, as you know, there are many other very important dimensions in the partnership that we are negotiating. I am thinking of a very broad economic cooperation through an ambitious, unique free trade agreement, such as we have never offered to any third country and which offers tariff-free and quota-free access with the rules I was talking about on the level playing field. I am thinking of connectivity in air and road transport and energy, or cooperation in social security. I am also thinking of our partnership in terms of internal security, the security of citizens, and God knows if everything that is happening around us geopolitically calls us to cooperate, to work for this security of citizens with the British. That is why we have already agreed in this negotiation on close cooperation in eight specific areas, on which many of you are working in their committees: Europol, Eurojust, Pmo, extradition, the exchange of information on criminal registers as well as the freezing and confiscation of assets. This cooperation for the security of citizens is based on two prerequisites that are now accepted: respect for fundamental rights, especially as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, and the protection of personal data. That is where we are. The points that remain open in these crucial hours are fundamental points for the Union. We are asking for nothing more than a balance between rights and obligations and reciprocity in terms of access to our markets and waters. Nothing more, but nothing less. While it is clear that we want an agreement, it is also clear that we will not make that agreement at any cost. As I speak to you, very sincerely, and I have always spoken to you truthfully and sincerely, I cannot tell you what the outcome of this last stretch of negotiation will be. That is why we must be prepared for all scenarios, and that is why a series of texts with contingency measures are also put to your vote to prepare us for a possible no deal. On this point, I would like to thank you, and all the services and actors of the European Parliament, for your speed and your readiness to adopt these measures in a very rapid time, which will allow them to come into force, if there is no agreement, on 1 January next. We are also working together to operationalise the new Brexit adjustment reserve as soon as possible. I am leaving you very quickly, I apologise, since negotiations will resume. As the President of the Commission has asked me, we will resume negotiations this morning with David Frost and his team for one last attempt to reach an acceptable agreement, particularly on the issue of fisheries. We are not sure we will achieve this if everyone does not make a real and concrete effort to find a compromise. At this point I would like to thank you for your support, for your confidence which has never been denied since the beginning of our journey together. This confidence is based on a method that I proposed from day one and which was supported by President Juncker and then President Ursula von der Leyen, which is that of dialogue and permanent transparency. I know, including the chairman of the INTA committee, that there are additional requests. We are trying to answer that. There is also the general balance of this negotiation, which is not over. Our services, the task force team and I have tried to be as available as possible to bring you, throughout this long negotiation, the elements you needed. I think that is the reason for the trust that you have always shown me and which I want to thank you for.  I know, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the constraints that are yours for the democratic examination to which you are entitled and which is normal: I was a member of your House, I was a national parliamentarian for a very long time. This democratic issue is at the heart of this negotiation, which must be known, detailed and approved in the national parliaments and the European Parliament. Economic actors must have the means to appropriate it, because it is very important, and - if I may conclude - much more important than the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union alone. It is the European project that is at issue. Throughout this negotiation, I have kept in mind three points of perspective and reference to try to put things in the long term.  The first point was peace in Ireland. It has been and remains a fundamental point for me, and that is why I thanked Maroo for the work that has been done to ensure the conditions of stability in Ireland. The second point is, of course, our Union. I have been mandated to defend the interests of this Union: the single market, consumers and citizens, businesses in all sectors. And then the third point of perspective: let us not forget, beyond Brexit, the United Kingdom is a great country that we respect, a partner country, neighbour, friend, ally with which we must have, in one way or another - if not today because we do not reach an agreement, it will be later - a strong bond and extremely ambitious cooperation. That is the whole point of this negotiation and the serious, very serious moment when we are in for its eventual conclusion.

The negotiations have indeed been intense and tough. They take place in an unprecedented environment and under extreme time pressure. The European Union has never negotiated an agreement with a third country of such scope, and only in nine months. Let me first of all thank Vice—President Maroš Šefčovič and our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and their two teams, for their tireless work and the very good close and regular cooperation with the European Parliament, in particular during the recent weeks. The best solution for both sides would certainly be to reach a comprehensive agreement before the end of the year. This would provide clarity and this would provide predictability to citizens and businesses. Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents emphasised that we, as the European Parliament, stand ready to organise an extraordinary plenary session towards the end of December, in case an agreement is finalised by midnight this Sunday. We stand ready to debate the outcome of the negotiations intensively as soon as possible, and we stand ready to thoroughly scrutinise the final text. But, one thing has to be very clear: this would be a unique scenario and cannot and will not serve as a precedent for future agreements. There is a narrow path to an agreement, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday here in the plenary. Indeed, I welcome the substantial progress made on many issues. However, as we heard this morning, differences remain to be bridged, in particular on fisheries, and we all know this will be very challenging. Since it is still not clear whether there will be an agreement in the end, we simply have to be prepared for all scenarios. The four targeted and time—limited contingency measures we will adopt today aim at limiting some of the most severe consequences in areas where no fall—back solutions exist.  Disruption will happen with or without an agreement. This is the natural consequence of the British decision to leave the European Union and to no longer participate in our single market and customs union. I remain convinced that it is in our mutual interest to agree on a sustainable, a trustful and a balanced partnership with the United Kingdom, which is one of our closest partners and an ally.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-12-18.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, after four years of agonizing in our relations with the United Kingdom, today we would have wanted to discuss and adopt a treaty that will enable us to build the best relationship for citizens and businesses on both sides of the English Channel.  Unfortunately, populist rhetoric, which has been catching the British right for a decade, prevents it until now. We must not hide that the formalization of contingency measures makes us feel the gravity of the moment. But citizenship can be quiet. Thanks to contingency plans we will be able to minimize the impending chaos that would occur in the event of a breakdown in air, rail and road transport, as well as in the fishing sector. Contingency plans should also help us to send London a clear warning: the Commission, the 27 Member States and this Parliament will maintain our cohesion to the end.  We are aware that the absence of an agreement in the current circumstances of the pandemic would be very negative for both economies. But we also know that the UK would suffer even more if an agreement is not reached. Let us not give in at a time when Mr. Johnson is increasingly alone. The cost of an uncavoiced Brexit would be another major blow to the British economy after the pandemic. Major British companies are pressuring him for a deal, and his anti-European godfather, Donald Trump, will soon be history.  Of course we should keep looking for a deal before a bad breakup. And we can only continue to thank the commendable commitment of the negotiating team, led by Mr Barnier, to reach the best agreement. But to achieve this, Parliament's voice must also be heard. The provisional application of the agreement before Parliament has expressed its consent is not acceptable. This would jeopardize the rigorous and democratic examination that European citizens deserve.  That is why, Mr Barnier, we hope that the Commission will forward the provisional text of the agreement to us as soon as possible. We need time. This is how we leaders have agreed in a consensual manner. We will only discuss the outcome of the negotiations before the end of the year if an agreement is reached before midnight on This Sunday 20 December. The spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament must also guide the Member States. Let us not allow London's strategy to let the fisheries agreement pass through at the end of the negotiation. A fair fisheries agreement would guarantee both the right of European fishermen to fish in British waters and UK fisheries exports in the European Union.  Our red line must remain the defence of the single market. Under no circumstances can we allow the UK free access to the single market if the Johnson Government does not undertake to meet the same regulatory standards for Europe. If the British government abandons its nationalist maximalism and returns to pragmatism, there is still time.  Negotiating a treaty does not imply the loss of sovereignty. And the United Kingdom and the European Union negotiate as sovereign parties on an equal footing, because we want to ensure the prosperity of peoples united by historical ties that will always accompany us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2020-12-18.json", "name": "Nathalie LOISEAU", "mepid": "197494", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group.

The original sin here in Brussels was to criticise and despise the decision of the British people, who had nevertheless voted by referendum by an absolute majority. In the ideological approach of European integration, everything has been planned to expand, expand ever more and unreasonably; nothing has been planned to allow a country to leave the European Union in good conditions. Then you negotiated a deal with Theresa May whose terms - and you knew this perfectly well - were unacceptable to the House of Commons, unacceptable to the British people. And of course, by saying that this text was frozen, unspeakable from any modification, you were hoping to iron the dishes and make sure that the British would come back on their choice. Here in Brussels, many were drawing up plans to trample on democracy and cancel the 2016 vote outright. This manoeuvre was a bit pathetic for the European institutions, as Boris Johnson, as soon as he won the election, evacuated the first text. New negotiations have begun. What a waste of time!  Finally, what is likely to cost us dearly in the coming days has been the refusal to deal upstream with the most sensitive and contentious issues. The rules of fair competition, for example: the United Kingdom is being asked to respect European standards, including the decisions of the Court of Justice, even though this is precisely one of the reasons, one of the reasons why they left the European Union. The Union today negotiates free trade agreements, trade agreements, with the whole world. It gives tax, financial and economic benefits to some of the most critical countries, such as Pakistan or Turkey. And we would not achieve a reasonable and balanced trade agreement with the great ally, friend and neighbour that is the United Kingdom?  Another problem, of course: fishing. Fishing is a fundamental point. Let us hope that the interests of the Netherlands, Denmark and France are not sacrificed because Berlin does not see it as a fundamental interest and issue.  Finally, of course, we have an interest in having a quality agreement with the United Kingdom. Let us not play the prophets of doom. We were predicted the seven plagues of Egypt if Brexit were voted on, a shower of calamities if Boris Johnson became Prime Minister; none of this has happened.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the path to a possible agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom, albeit narrow, remains open. I have no doubt that our negotiating teams, led by Michel Barnier, are committed to preserving the vital interests of the Union, starting with the integrity of its internal market. And, who knows, perhaps a trade agreement will emerge from this negotiation which, in contrast to those that the Union has passed so far, commits a healthy emulation towards ever-higher social, environmental and other standards, rather than a perpetual race to the least. Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you that I am outraged by the position taken yesterday by the group presidents of our Parliament who did not accept, but spontaneously proposed on their own, that we ratify a possible agreement in a few days, after what can only be a mock examination. I have been an MEP for more than eleven years and I have heard many colleagues regularly complaining about the lack of respect that parliament would be subjected to from the Commission and the Council. These are sometimes justified complaints, but gaining the respect of others starts with self-respect; and yesterday's offer ridicules Parliament. Indeed, how can we believe that in a few days we can sift through a treaty of unprecedented volume and political importance for the Union, which we have not yet seen the first paragraph of? Whatever confidence we may have in our negotiators and the political likelihood of ratification, what is at stake here is respect for the procedures, responsibilities and roles of counter-powers, so-called checks and balances, crucial elements of a democratic regime. By proposing expeditious ratification, a majority of this Parliament sets a deleterious precedent. It sends the signal that, even if our Parliament rolls the mechanics, it will always ratify the treaties proposed to it, even at the last moment. However, it is precisely the implicit pressure created by the ratification process by the legislative body that keeps the executive - here, the Commission - under democratic control. Otherwise, the officials who de facto write the treaties operate in freewheeling. What is the point of giving them a negotiating mandate if we are not in a position to verify, in the end, the compliance of the final texts with that mandate? The weakening of democratic control inevitably leads to abuses of power. Like you, I do not like the principle of a provisional application of the Treaty, but this one, contrary to what some say, preserves the prerogatives of Parliament, since it is sufficient for Parliament to refuse ratification for it to end. On the other hand, it is not the only way to give Parliament time for a review. There is nothing, legally, to prevent two freely consenting parties from extending the status quo of their relations by a month or two. Colleagues, across the Union, too many parliaments are increasingly being treated by their governments as mere registration chambers. I can only deplore the fact that a majority of the European Parliament, on its own initiative, is joining this grim development. This is all the more ridiculous since we have just fought together a fierce and successful battle over the European budget and on the beginning of the conditionality of European subsidies to respect for the rule of law.

History will be harsh on both the European Union and the United Kingdom if we fail on the ultimate stretch.  My group, the ECR, wants a deal. We have always been very close to the British, in particular the Conservative Party. British Conservatives were co—founders of our group. They offered us professionalism, pragmatism and a sense of humour. In the Conservative Party an understatement is an expression of survival, since your opponent within is never far away – basically behind you! However, that party also produced historic leaders like Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher with the power of strong personalities.  Since the British have left, the European Parliament has become more boring, if I may say, and without Nigel Farage over there in the corner, rather quiet, like a provincial assembly. But Mr Farage has found other topics to play the naughty boy of Britain. Without the British, the right to dissent seems to disappear from this Parliament, unfortunately. There is mounting pressure for la pensée unique. Open debate and conflicting arguments, however, are ways to test ideas against reality. Too many narratives in this Chamber remain in a void of self—complacency, missing the much—needed reality check. Without the British, the European Parliament tends to become a kind of religious congregation mainly convinced of itself.  We have to look for ways to keep these qualities the British have brought to this Parliament in which, ironically, English remains the main language of communication without interpretation.  The Brexit negotiations have also shown cultural differences. The French always have une logique and a big design; the British rather proceed case by case, picking the cases that serve them best, as Mr Barnier may have noticed.  I thank Mr Barnier, Mr Šefčovič and Mr Frost, including their teams, for all the efforts to find common ground from different positions. Madam President, we have to close the deal, but Parliament should not resort to grandstanding. Regarding a possible agreement it’s simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Political groups should work on a resolution for debate here in Brussels. The vote could be carried out remotely – a useful practicality we have mastered in this eventful year.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I want to start with the better news. Firstly, today we are clearing the way for emergency aid and measures in the event of a no deal – that is a good signal to workers and their businesses in the European Union, which is a good signal to the European fishing industry.  However, I would also like to suggest here, Commissioner, that, in the event of more serious economic upheavals, we are considering entrusting the European Investment Bank with the task of setting up a fund to support small and medium-sized enterprises in particular in the event of these serious consequences for these companies. Secondly, I welcome the progress made in the negotiations on the implementation and implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Irish Protocol, to which the Commissioner referred. As a reminder to all of us, full implementation is not only a prerequisite for securing peace in Northern Ireland; it is also a prerequisite for this Parliament to be able to approve a treaty at all. According to Michel Barnier, we are now at a crossroads in the negotiations, and if an agreement is reached in the coming hours, it will be up to me and my group to decide how we should proceed to such an agreement, whether we agree or– on the basis of the content – veto it. And the Commission has started by announcing that this agreement is the first agreement of a new generation of trade agreements, namely a Fairtrade agreement. And we will judge the Commission precisely because we, as leftists in the European Parliament, have been fighting for a new generation – for other trade agreements – for many years, namely agreements that provide a strong response in the social and labour areas, the environment, human rights issues and consumer protection – not only for the EU, but also for trading partners. The problem is that we no longer have time to examine a deal in a truly parliamentary-parliamentary way. Nor can we organise a real democratic debate with each other or with the European public – but that is precisely our job as MEPs! That is precisely what our work is in the interests of Europeans, and it is totally unacceptable that we have not yet had at least access to the draft texts.

Negotiations are progressing, divergences remain, and in the meantime the transition period is about to end. Citizens are worried, businesses are nervous with all this uncertainty, and we have to ask ourselves, why are we in this terrible situation? For two reasons really. The first one is that Prime Minister Boris Johnson always refused even to consider an extension of the transition period. He knew that to conclude these difficult negotiations in such a short period of time would be unprecedented. He knew that back in June, when an assessment was made, progress was far from sufficient. He also knew the dramatic consequences of COVID—19 on our negotiations and the fact that we are facing the worst recession since World War II. But even so, he always refused to consider an extension of the transition period.  The second reason why we are where we are: the UK Government is taking endless time to realise that some illusions of Brexit simply cannot be delivered. Yes, the UK is a sovereign country, entitled to take back control of laws, borders and waters. Nobody in the EU is denying that, but we have to recall that we are just having this conversation because the UK – despite being out of the EU, the single market and the customs union – wants to maintain access to the European market with zero tariffs and zero quotas. The EU answers ‘okay we are ready to go that far if you ensure fair competition’. So this is no punishment. This is not about regulatory freedom. This is a deal. A fair deal.  Michel Barnier, Maroš Šefčovič, we thank you, we support you, and we are sure that, as soon as the British Government understands reality, the negotiations will reach a positive outcome. That reality in this case is very simple: an ambitious agreement can only be reached if fair competition is ensured, if a common level playing field, in a credible manner, is ensured for the future relationship.

In my previous experiences I have learned many things. My father had a small business and I learned that the client was always right, that those who went to him to buy things should not be slapped in the face. This is what some arson workers in this House would like and have wasted many months on hard and complex negotiations, and as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I know how complex trade negotiations are.  Today we are on 18 December and we must above all thank the fact that Britain has failed to conclude a trade agreement with the United States. It would probably have replaced some of the goods that normally come from our single market to them. Some people have said that there has been little transparency. Some political groups are totally excluded from the flow of information.

I would also like to thank Mr Barnier and his negotiating team - he has had to leave us for understandable reasons - for that months-long commitment and tough exhausting negotiations that require a great deal of human being. He has done so with great tenacity, with lucidity, with the necessary pragmatism and with flexibility. My question is that everything would be done to reach an agreement in those last days, last hours. The consequences, ladies and gentlemen, of a no deal are terrible for the European Union. In total, we lose 1.2 million jobs. All this is on top of the coronary disaster. The UK is losing more than half a million jobs. In my small Flanders we lose 2.6% of our GDP and 30 000 jobs.  I would therefore ask the Commission to speed up the Brexit fund for the regions most affected, for the sectors most affected. I would also ask for some compensation for the adverse consequences of Brexit and to speed up new trade deals, which we will absolutely need. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that it should be possible to reach an agreement with pragmatism, with flexibility, to strike a balance between the sovereignty of the British and the integrity of our internal market, which they must respect. There are mechanisms for state aid, for competition rules, for maintaining our standards, for governance. The same for fisheries, where we recognise sovereignty, but where we must have sufficient access, have sufficient quotas and, above all, legal certainty for our fishermen.  I agree with Mr Barnier's words that we need to think about the future, that we should go for a post-Brexit partnership not only on defence and security, but also on research and development, on Erasmus+, on university cooperation and cooperation in and around the North Sea, for the blue economy: the 21st century will be the century of the oceans. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we must also work on interparliamentary cooperation with the British once Brexit is complete. We are also going to have to learn lessons from Brexit. This must not be repeated, this misery. Article 50 will have to be revised. I hope it will never be applied again. But whoever leaves has to come up with a proposal, with a blueprint.

But: what does the Sovereign expect in the 27 EU Member States, what do the citizens actually expect from us, the co-legislator, in view of the situation that has now arisen? That we simply tick off a thousand-page agreement with many details and give the green light to its entry into force – will the right thing have already been negotiated? The expectations of fishermen and those working in agriculture, those working in industry and services, pensioners, students and so many others are high.  What is the final compromise? Are the standards of equal conditions of competition established by the European Parliament still effective in the fine print? Are there any enforcement tools in place? This is particularly true with regard to employment standards, social and environmental rights and governance.

Because yes, that is what Brexit was: irresponsibility, aggravated by the inability to reach a reasonable exit agreement so far, mainly on fishing.

And the British will have to look for other markets, while the whole world will wonder why it is nonsense. The position of the European Parliament and the Council is clear. It has not changed and should not change at this crucial moment in the negotiations. We have sought until exhaustion a sensible agreement on fisheries. I know, and I appreciate the enormous efforts made by our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. But so far it has not been possible, despite the constructive attitude of the European Union. But that doesn't mean we threw in the towel. Quite the opposite. European fishermen know a lot about sailing despite the difficulties and will continue to do so.  The common fisheries policy is a compromise between the Member States of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, because together with them we have built this system, and it would not be fair or acceptable for European fishermen to have no rights.  It's not time to settle for an un agreed exit. It's not even time to look for responsibilities, either. It is time to keep working until the last minute, although it is true that the last minute is already too close for these waters to see European Union-flagged boats again fishing and our markets open up to the UK, because deep down, the British and the whole world, beyond radical positions, know that it is the best and they want it that way.

We stand by our offer. The European Parliament has consistently been extremely flexible, patient and constructive throughout the negotiations. We will continue to do everything within our power to avoid a no-deal Brexit, because we are aware of the crucial importance of such an agreement for our citizens and our businesses. But we also remain realistic. There are only 13 days left until the end of the transition period. A no-deal has never been closer, and our citizens and businesses deserve clarity and predictability. That is why, today, we are ensuring that planes can keep flying, trucks can keep running and fishermen can keep fishing after 31 December. These contingency measures are of course no substitute for a deal, but they will alleviate, if necessary, the otherwise unavoidable disruption for both EU and UK citizens. Because, in spite of Michel Barnier’s tireless work and dedication, the UK Government has still not found the courage to find an agreement. Prime Minister Johnson has yet to acknowledge that every agreement is a compromise and that there is no such thing as having all the benefits of EU membership if you decided to leave. While trade deals are normally about convergence, this agreement deals with future divergence. When sovereign States decide to strike a deal, it is normally not used as a badge to prove their sovereignty. And at a time when all European nations are in the midst of an economic recession due to a pandemic, it would only be sensible to avoid another blow to our businesses and citizens.  The European Parliament has been patient, but democracy cannot and will not bend to the UK’s lack of responsibility. It is Boris Johnson who refused to even consider an offer for the transition period. Our right to post-democratic scrutiny of any agreement will not be compromised, and there will be no provisional application without parliamentary consent.

To understand today's debate on deal or no deal, we also need to look back to 2016, when a majority of the British people said they no longer want to be part of the European Union. And it would have been the right task for the European family of nations to oppose this decision with respect and to counter it with respect to the majority of Britons. That has been missed. From the very first second, a decision that, in the eyes of many here, could not be seen, which was not allowed to be, was not met with friendship, but disapproved of it, repeatedly imposed punitive sanctions, and the worst thing for me was that chief negotiators of the European Union met the British here with inconveniences that do not belong to a European family of nations. I would remind you, for example, of The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Tusk, who would have preferred the Brexiteers to go to hell. I would remind you of the parliamentary negotiator Verhofstadt, who compared the people who pushed Brexit with unwelcome people from the French Revolution. That is the wrong way to go, ladies and gentlemen. But the decision has been made as to how it was made. And behold, the British on their way out of the European Union are suddenly mobile, can make decisions all at once. Just two examples: in the Corona crisis, for example, which affects us all, the situation is that the British have been vaccinating people who want vaccination for two weeks now, and the European Union has not yet started here. Or another example, which is also very important to me: in the area of this agonising animal transport, the British are now putting in place a solution to finally put an end to these agonising transports, and the European Union is still unable to create proper conditions here. Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you: use the objectives of these negotiations to treat the British with friendship and respect.

The UK remains our neighbour, ally and economic partner. The establishment of a new relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom is important not only because of the need for ongoing negotiations, but above all because of the need to maintain Western unity at a time of growing geopolitical challenges.  The future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom must take into account very strong economic links, common values and convergence of objectives in many areas. At the same time, they must ensure an appropriate balance of rights and obligations and take into account the political sensitivities of each party. Strong economic links mean greater ambition, not only to access each other's markets, but also to ensure a level playing field.  The future agreement should ensure that new border control procedures are minimised while maintaining high security standards. This is particularly true for agri-food commodities, which are particularly sensitive to border delays and regulatory issues. We need new solutions in the area of transport: the vast majority of the European Union and UK road transport is served by EU carriers. The agreement should provide for very ambitious solutions on this issue, unprecedented in EU trade agreements. I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in addition to the economic dimension, cooperation in the field of internal security and justice must also be an important pillar of cooperation. Britain has left the European Union, but common threats remain. The exchange of data to combat crime, judicial cooperation in criminal matters, simplified extradition procedures or, finally, cooperation within Europol should all include a new partnership. Threats such as fanatical Islamic terrorism, human trafficking, drugs, arms trafficking remain real. Brexit does not change anything here, and our cooperation to ensure the safety of our citizens remains our priority at all times. There is another foundation connecting the United Kingdom and the Community of the European Union.

It may be the case that some of the new arrangements are disruptive in the short-term, but new arrangements will be found.

From, on the one hand, claiming aren’t those Brits awful eejits that didn’t even know what they were voting for, to being outraged that the Royal Navy might police British waters. Well, why wouldn’t they, when Spanish, French and Portuguese trawlers are already destroying the seabeds and interfering with our fisheries rights in Ireland? So, the idea that the EU was driven by high values while the Brits were just out for themselves is utter nonsense. Both sides are looking out for themselves.

A technical prolongation of the transition, a provisional application of the agreement, or even stopping the clock! That’s also done in such negotiations.

In the north, in Boulogne, for example, 80% of people fish in British waters.  If there was no agreement, European ships would no longer be able to access it. This would lead to the movement of many ships, particularly near the coast, into European waters. This high concentration, but also the unilateral setting of quotas, would cause a real ecological disaster. All fishermen would then be threatened, including those who did not even fish in British waters. But a deal won't solve everything. Despite the promises, it is clear that an agreement will come at the cost of a significant reduction in the European quota. In all cases, Member States must give priority to the protection of small-scale fishing. Quota reductions should not be uniform for the entire fleet, as stipulated in Article 17 of the Common Fisheries Policy. States must use economic, social and environmental criteria to distribute fishing permits. No one would understand that a giant industrial super-trawler that freezes its fish for export to the other side of the world continues to fish if, at the same time, the artisanal fishermen, who sustain the economy of our coastlines and take care of the environment, put the key under the door.

Britain wanted a Canada-style deal and regulatory sovereignty.  Since then, the EU gave way on the ECJ in return for UK acceptance of the regulatory status quo. Negotiations also shifted from dynamic realignment to rules that would allow Brussels to offset high EU costs, imposed by future EU climate change standards, not applicable in the UK. If such sanctions respect WTO ceilings and leave Britain to trade freely with other countries, UK sovereignty would not be unduly abridged.  Germany has a huge trade surplus with Britain. France gains too. UK trade is vital to Ireland, whilst EU trade matters even more to the British economy. In these circumstances, a trade deal is almost an imperative of reason.  May I therefore remind the EU that trade deals are about trade and mutual advantage and not about climate change or world rescue missions. Nor is it wise to make every issue a point of principle.  Let me close, unusually perhaps, on a positive note. If reason prevails and a deal is struck, this will be due in no small measure to Michel Barnier’s commitment, acumen and diplomatic sensitivity.

Last Sunday, another negotiation deadline passed with no final outcome, and what we have just heard from Michel Barnier is that on the negotiation table at least one big, and a number of little pieces, remain without solution.  We continue to be in the No Deal territory and failure is still possible. We must be also aware that even if a skinny agreement is better than no-deal, it will bring a higher level of distortions than a more ambitious deal, and even the most effective preparatory measures will not protect us fully from distortions.  The good news here is the agreement reached on the full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and my appreciation goes to Maroš Šefčovič and his team, but we still have to understand better how, and to what extent, it is warranted that there are no risks there. I support the Commission’s attempts to keep negotiations alive as long as there is a chance for agreement. No Deal has never been our option, especially in the midst of the current crisis, but negotiating under tremendous time pressure cannot lead to an agreement at any cost. I also expect from the British Government that the sovereignty argument will not become a pretext for a No Deal calamity.  As most of us here, I am concerned about the ongoing process. So far, we have stayed calm and carried on, but the proposed new deadline stretches beyond what normally we would be ready to accept. We will be deprived of our basic rights relating to international agreements. Paradoxically, the pandemic has helped us organise a last—minute remote plenary meeting, but evidently there is no time for any responsible scrutiny of the text.

If there is not sufficient time for an agreement before the end of the year with sufficient parliamentary scrutiny, we have to make sure there is no chaos on 1 January, and we have to make part of the negotiations agreeing to maintain the status quo on both sides of the Channel while we complete the negotiations and parliamentary scrutiny.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2020-12-18.json", "name": "Luis GARICANO", "mepid": "197554", "text": "   – Madam President, today we mark the end of a Chapter.

I am worried about what a hard Brexit would mean, not least for small businesses that are the backbone of Europe's economy.

Large companies are more experienced in trading with third countries, but it is, of course, much more difficult for the smaller ones. Now the Commission must do all it can to facilitate, not least for small businesses, so that trade flows and other things between the EU and the UK can be maintained. The European Parliament presented our recommendations in a resolution last summer. In this, we stressed that the Commission must take extra account of small businesses, including by setting up contact points for SMEs and also facilitating the bureaucratic process so that the administrative burden is as small as possible. Since we have heard nothing about this being a problem in the negotiations, I hope and assume that we have achieved these things in the negotiations.

It seems to me that only one thing should count in this crucial moment: to seek the interests of the citizens of our countries to the end. For them, as for all of us, as for our British friends, we must give a full chance to an agreement until the end. This will be crucial for the geopolitical balance of the world of tomorrow and essential for the protection of our economies, which are already so distressed by the current crisis and which, in fact, would be further weakened by a breakdown in our industrial and trade ties and by a brake imposed on the entire agricultural sector.  And how can we not call him back?

Michel Barnier, myself and our teams always appreciated your availability, your interest and also your detailed knowledge of the subject. I fully understand the concerns, the points raised by honourable MEPs, Mr McAllister, Ms García Pérez, Mr Hansen, Ms Hübner, about the importance to maintain this level of transparency as high as possible until the last moments.  You know very well that the Commission published its draft agreement and all additional text and documents submitted to the UK in the course of negotiations. As you know, both Michel and myself, but also our teams, have always been ready to brief you in all details. We know that only through the utmost transparency and dialogue we can earn your trust, we can earn your support and I also know that it was thanks to this trust and support that we built this unbreakable European unity which was so important and is still is very important in these negotiations. I would just plead to do the same which we did in this marathon negotiation. Let’s work together and let’s walk this last most difficult mile in this united approach, being fully aware of our priorities and I would like to reassure Mr Lamberts and Mr Lange that your support is absolutely crucial. You consent is decisive. The consent of this House is a key to ratification of the deal, and therefore, I also want to thank you for your support in these exceptional, demanding and difficult – for all of us – circumstances. Many of the honourable Members raised the issue of full respect for social, environmental and labour standards. Almost all those who intervened highlighted the importance of fair competition. Mr Scholz, Ms Loiseau, and many others, I really would like to assure you that we will deliver on all of these priorities, because I fully understand how important it is for the European Union, how important it is for the citizens you represent in this House.  I was listening very carefully to Mr Sikorski and Mr Silva Pereira about the concerns they have on the issue of the rights of the EU citizens, and I want to assure all of you that there’s almost five million people, EU and UK citizens, who are most directly affected by Brexit because of the residence rights, that they will be fully protected. I would say the rights of citizens and full implementation of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol being the most important issues which we’ve been negotiating day and night with our UK partners under the withdrawal agreement, and I’m glad to say that on this we have absolute full consensus. Mr Warborn, Mr Kelly and Mr Schirdewan have been highlighting the issue of SMEs, of fisheries and other sectors which might be severely affected by Brexit and, therefore, I’m glad to say that the Brexit adjustment reserve is being finalised as a part of the next multiannual finance perspective. I hope and believe that some of the five billion euros which are aimed at countering the possible adverse consequences in the Member States will be able to compensate the sectors which have been affected the most by the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  As you know very well, Europe never leaves their people and their businesses behind, to be fair, to be socially just, this core European value, and I am absolutely sure that we will demonstrate it in this case as well. I also understand the calls of many of you to remind us of the importance of the EU—UK relationship, of the EU—UK friendship between our peoples and I would say that it is exactly because of this that we are engaged in this most comprehensive agreement, to be negotiated in the shortest time in the European Union’s history. If you allow me, I would like to conclude with repeating the words of Ursula von der Leyen and Michel Barnier, that this is now the moment of truth. There is a narrow path to agreement. Our negotiators are currently, now, right at this moment, exploring every possible way how to walk this difficult last mile and how to push the negotiations over the finishing line with positive results. So let us wish them well. Let us wish success in the endeavour so that we can conclude this very difficult chapter and open a new one in our EU—UK relationship.

The latest signals received indicate significant bottlenecks that risk affecting the approval of this agreement so necessary for both sides. Unfortunately, the lack of transparency on the negotiations is raising questions and does not allow the European Parliament and citizens to analyse in detail the elements discussed and to be able to support the negotiations for their swift approval by the European legislature. More worrying is the fact that EU Member States are not sufficiently prepared for the assumption of a no-deal scenario. The business environment, university cooperation or European citizens are at risk of serious harm. The right-wing government in Romania has done nothing to prepare for this hypothesis. There is no legal regulation adopted, no financial support package for companies affected by the situation, no citizen support crisis cell, absolutely nothing that the EU has recommended. I call on negotiators and decision-makers on both sides to become more involved in resolving this situation. No one can afford a failure but at the same time, no one can afford a bad deal. The solution is in our hands, in the will and ability to advance and to have this trade agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 62, "date": "2020-12-18.json", "name": "László TRÓCSÁNYI", "mepid": "197894", "text": "  Writing. – With regard to the WITHDRAWAL of the United Kingdom, it is important to note that one of the main objectives should be to ensure a transition with as few problems as possible, especially in areas of judicial cooperation and other areas of a legal nature. Cooperation between the two countries covers civil law, family law, commercial law and criminal law. There are a significant number of Hungarian communities in Britain, so this has an impact on trade, justice and other relations. We're connected on a number of threads. It would create a more reassuring situation for both parties if the agreement in question adequately covered cooperation in criminal and civil judicial matters. It is important that judicial cooperation in security, law enforcement and criminal matters, as well as judicial cooperation in civil and family law matters, form an integral part of the agreement, and it is in the best interests of both parties to guarantee legal certainty to citizens. Good judicial relations and mutual trust are in the interests of both parties.
