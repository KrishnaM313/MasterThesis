If it did not we would face grave consequences, such as the collapse of Schengen. We have used these two months as best we could. In this time I called two summits, dedicated almost exclusively to this issue. On 7 March the European Council took three important decisions. The first one concerned the ending of the ‘wave-through’ approach, which meant bringing the flow of irregular migrants along the Western Balkans route to a close. This decision was based on the assumption that a European solution without respect for European law and, above all, without respect for the Schengen borders code is not possible. The second decision was on a massive increase of humanitarian aid to Greece. We set up a new emergency instrument to allow EUR 300 million to be sent this year, firstly to Greece but also to other Member States overwhelmed by the refugee crisis. We also offered further assistance in order to manage the external border in Greece, including the borders with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania, not to mention other forms of support from Member States. The third decision concerned sending back migrants from Greece to Turkey – those migrants who are not in need of international protection. Leaders also welcomed the presence of NATO in the Aegean to enhance intelligence and surveillance activities, while Turkey agreed to take back all irregular migrants apprehended in Turkish waters. At our first Council in March, I was also asked by leaders to take forward new proposals made by Turkey and work out a common European position, with a view to reaching an agreement later that month. That agreement was finally reached at the European Council on 18 March. We agreed that, as from 20 March, all irregular migrants coming from Turkey to Greek islands would be returned to Turkey. Implementation would be phased in gradually and based on the so-called one-for-one principle. This is what has begun to happen. For me, the two key elements of the agreement were first, to guarantee compliance with all EU and international laws by ensuring that each and every migrant arriving in Europe would be treated individually. This included the respect for the principle of non-refoulement and excluded any kind of collective expulsions. The Commission gave a positive assessment of the legality of the agreement, and I want to express my thanks to Jean-Claude and his team for their work and contribution. Second, as regards accession talks, we took on board Cypriot concerns. The approach to this issue was, to my mind, a test of Europe’s solidarity towards one of its Member States, and Europe passed this test. On the one hand, some were tempted to force Cyprus to make huge concessions. It is quite understandable. But I maintained from the start that we could not sacrifice the most fundamental interests of a Member State, in this case Cyprus, on the altar of a migration deal with Turkey. We are aware of all the tasks and difficulties in resolving this crisis. From the beginning I have thought it is a dangerous illusion to believe that there exists an ideal and 100%-effective solution. I want to say to all the seekers of the political Holy Grail: you will never find it. Convenient and easy solutions are hard to find in politics, and in this case they are virtually impossible. What we are faced with is a perpetual, tenuous and multi-dimensional effort. In fact, something like a never-ending story. The solutions we are putting into practice are not ideal and will not end our work. Also, the deal with Turkey is not perfect and we are fully aware of its risks and weaknesses. We did everything we could to ensure that the agreement respects human dignity, but I am conscious of the fact that everything depends on how it will be implemented. The deal with Turkey and closing the Western Balkans route raised doubts of an ethical and also a legal – as in the case of Turkey – nature. I share some of these doubts too. They can only be dispelled by putting the solutions as they were agreed into practice in every detail. While taking into account all the above-mentioned doubts and even sharing some of them, I would like to recall that the main goal we decided on was to stem irregular migration to Europe. As I have frequently said, without this, and without restoring control over European migration policy, we would be unable to prevent political catastrophes. Here I mean the collapse of Schengen; the loss of control over our external borders, with all its implications for our security; political chaos in the EU; a widespread feeling of insecurity and, ultimately, the triumph of populism and extremism. Today, everyone has finally understood how high the stakes were, and how high they still continue to be. We need to realise that external circumstances will not work to our advantage. We have heard so many times that the only way to stem irregular migration is by solving the root causes of this crisis, namely by stabilising the world around us. I want to state very clearly that this had too often sounded like an alibi not to do anything at all here in Europe. I hope we will finally understand that Europe does not hold golden keys in its hands to help solve all the problems of this world. Let me say more. We were so preoccupied with looking for the key to save the world that for a time we lost the key to solve our own problems. This crisis has eventually shown that we must regain our feeling of responsibility for ourselves before we turn to repairing the world around us. In the two months when we concentrated on what we should do in our own backyard, we managed to achieve results. Those results were possible even though we have not resolved the root causes of migration, like hunger and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, war in Syria and destabilisation in all regions, from Libya to Afghanistan. Not only have we not solved all those crises, but new ones have appeared, such as tensions between Turkey and Russia, fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh and dozens of terrorist attacks across many regions. It is not humanly possible to resolve all of them with a short-term perspective. Obviously, no one has the right to ignore the root causes of migration, as it is a challenge not only for Europe but also for the whole global community. Therefore we will work hard on our plan to address the migration crisis, which we are going to present at the G7 Summit in Japan and the G20 Summit in China. Our aim should be to increase the socioeconomic development of the affected regions, notably in terms of education, health care, labour conditions, infrastructure and trade. Let us not forget, however, that dealing with the root causes will be a constant and long-term effort. What is even worse, we must work with no guarantee of complete success, because it does not depend on our actions alone. That is why we must be effective first and foremost where almost everything depends on us, namely managing the crisis on European soil. Acting in this spirit, we must remember that the Balkan route is not the only one, and that other countries will also expect our cooperation and solidarity, not only Greece and Bulgaria. I have in mind here the Central Mediterranean route. The numbers of would-be migrants in Libya are alarming. This means that we must be prepared to help and show solidarity to Malta and Italy, should they request it. It will not be possible to simply copy the solutions we have applied in the Balkans, not least because Libya is not Turkey. As regards the Balkan route, we undertook action much too late, which resulted among other things in the temporary closure of the borders inside the eurozone. This is why our full cooperation with Italy and Malta today is a condition for avoiding this scenario in the future. For far too long Europe was divided into advocates of security and advocates of openness. Today we are finally building a synthesis of those two great needs: the need for security at our borders and the need for openness and tolerance. This is perhaps the biggest success of recent months. This synthesis will be one of the main battlefields of the future Europe, and it demands further actions. Let us not be afraid of this tension. In the critical moments of its history, Europe was victorious only when it coped with those two challenges simultaneously. To be true Europeans we need to remain open and tolerant yet at the same time tough and effective. Tensions are something natural, and the European phenomenon was the ability to transform them into positive energy. This phenomenon needs to be preserved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President of the Commission. - Monsieur le Président du Conseil européen, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, une violence fanatique aveugle, voilà ce que des milliers de réfugiés connaissent au quotidien en Syrie ou ailleurs, et cherchent à fuir. En tentant d'atteindre l'Europe, ils tombent très souvent aux mains de trafiquants qui, avec une mise de départ modeste - de quoi investir dans des embarcations de fortune - engendrent des chiffres d'affaires faramineux de trois à six milliards d'euros pour la seule année 2015. C'est cet abject trafic d'êtres humains que nous souhaitons remplacer par des déplacements de demandeurs d'asile contrôlés et légaux. C'est l'intention de l'accord conclu le 18 mars entre l'Union européenne et la Turquie, que nous avons commencé à mettre en œuvre. Soit vous acceptez que les trafiquants et les criminels fassent la loi en mer Égée, soit vous acceptez le bien-fondé de la démarche de l'accord définissant les relations en matière de réfugiés entre l'Union européenne et la Turquie. Bien sûr, ce n'est pas facile. J'ai dit depuis le début qu'il s'agirait d'une tâche herculéenne, et c'est effectivement le cas. Sa mise en œuvre pratique relève de la responsabilité des autorités grecques et des autorités turques, mais sa réussite dépend de nous tous. La Commission est sur place avec son coordinateur, M. Maarten Verwey, qui travaille en étroite coopération avec les agences européennes ainsi qu'avec les autorités grecques et turques pour les aider dans la mise en œuvre pratique de cet accord, en veillant attentivement au plein respect du droit européen et international. À ce jour, depuis le 4 avril, date de la mise en application de l'accord, 325 migrants irréguliers ont été relocalisés de Grèce en Turquie et 79 réfugiés syriens ont été réinstallés de Turquie vers l'Europe. Ce n'est qu'un début et chacun, non seulement la Grèce et la Turquie, mais aussi chaque État membre, doit se montrer à la hauteur des engagement pris pour mener à bien ce processus de retour et de réinstallation. Our responsibility for refugees, Mr President, does not, of course, stop at the external border. The starting point of the action plan with Turkey is that we stand together to offer people on the move a decent life and prospects for the future. That is why the three billion facility is so important. And it is right and important that we top it up by another three billion by the end of 2018. After all, the money does not go to Turkey, as I often have to read untruthfully, but the money goes to the refugees who seek refuge from the rain and cold, who need food and whose children have to go to school because these children have a right to Have a future. This is precisely why we are in the process of approving the first projects under the three billion euro facility. We are spending 55 million euros to ensure that an additional 110,000 children have access to school. In addition, there is a further 40 million euros for humanitarian aid through the World Food Program. This will provide food for 735,000 Syrian refugees. Further projects are in preparation and are on the way. I am often asked - probably here as well - whether Turkey is a reliable partner at all. Of course - and I do not want to hide it at all - there are issues, more than just one, on which Turkey and the European Union have very different views and opinions. But one thing is very clear to me: as much as we value the cooperation on behalf of the refugees, our position on other issues remains unchanged, for example when it comes to basic values ​​such as freedom of the press. I cannot understand at all that a German ambassador is called in because of an admittedly impossible satirical song. (Applause) That does not bring Turkey closer to us, but rather distances us from one another. The partnership with Turkey but also opens up some possibilities in this regard. Because in dialogue, the basic questions that are important to us - and hopefully also to Turkey - can be addressed better than from a frosty distance. And if Turkey moves towards us in the accession negotiations, then I can only welcome that. One day I would like to be able to welcome that too. So of all the solutions we have, the cooperation with Turkey is the best, if only because a border always has two sides and it is always better to protect it than against a neighbor. We also have to be aware of another fact: Turkey alone takes in almost three million refugees - more than any other country in the world and more than we Europeans combined. It is therefore our responsibility not to leave our Turkish neighbors alone with this responsibility. It is a matter of solidarity. If we are capable of only limited solidarity with one another, then we should be capable of unconditional solidarity with those who bear the main burden. (Applause) Solidarity is our guiding light as we prepare to reform our common European asylum system. We know the weak points in our current system, and smugglers know them too. They have exploited the patchwork of national rules to make a fortune from human suffering. Last week the Commission published the options for reform. We need to do three things above all. First, we need to make clear which Member State is responsible for treating an asylum request. This is the foundation of our common asylum system. It must be clear, it must be feasible and it must be sustainable, even in times of crisis. Second, we need to ensure that every man, woman and child receives humane and equal treatment, wherever they are. This requires that we fully harmonize our asylum procedures. Third, we need to ensure that every asylum seeker remains in the country where he or she has been assigned. This is the only way to maintain order. It is the only way to ensure that refugees can enjoy their rights while respecting their obligations. One principle above all will shape our reform: solidarity once again. We cannot abandon any Member State to face a crisis alone. A country’s place on the map should not decide its share of the work. I want our asylum system to be the best in the world, and I want this house to help us to build it. You have an opportunity to provide guidance before we publish our proposal next month. I urge you today: share your ideas with us. I am very pleased that the European Council of March 18 endorsed the Commission's strategy for growth and jobs - that virtuous triangle between investment, structural reforms and public finances. We are applying this strategy, and this strategy is producing initial results. The global economic situation in the European Union remains fragile, growth remains inadequate and we still have 22 million unemployed Europeans. And as long as we have 22 million people out of work, the end of the crisis cannot be decreed for that long. One day before the European Council, the Commission defined its strategy for the steel industry. I would like to make a strong plea for us to take the problems of the European steel industry seriously. The steel industry is not just any industry. The steel industry has ceased to be a heavy industry. The steel industry is the place of future-oriented cutting-edge technology. The steelworkers are not iron girders, but highly skilled workers, and these skilled workers in Europe deserve our full support. (Applause) That is why we must do all we can to combat unfair trade practices. Therefore we have to deal with the causes of global, worldwide steel overproduction. That is why we have to invest in future technologies, and therefore we have to invest in people who work in the steel industry.There are 360,000 steel workers in Europe, but the indirect steel sector is many times larger.These jobs must be preserved in Europe, that is our priority task in industrial policy.(Applause) Free trade should be fair trade.We are now investigating steel products from China to determine whether they were dumped on the market, and we will take other measures if necessary.The European Council agreed the measures the Commission has taken in relation to agriculture.This is an important dimension of our common undertaking.Last week the Commission published a VAT action plan giving our Member States more flexibility to set VAT rates in line with their priorities.In a time of upheaval the Commission continues to defend European interests, driving forward solutions and building bridges.This is our job - to provide stability - and this is how we plan to continue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Gentlemen Presidents, dear colleagues! We met here in the European Parliament for months and criticized the Council for the disagreement, for the dispute that we witnessed there. I would therefore like to begin by saying thank you that we succeeded in describing a common path with Turkey in the meeting before Easter to solve the migration issues on the Balkan route together. For the first time Europe - the European heads of state and government - has succeeded in giving a common answer. In this context, I would like to expressly thank the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, for this. It is his success that he has succeeded in bringing together the various interests and finding a common path. Thanks for that! Dear Colleagues! The answer has been found in Turkey. There is only one way together. We have respect, and certainly also recognition, for the achievements that Turkey is practicing. Almost three million people are already in the country and they are now getting work permits. The repatriation of illegal migrants is now working. We are taking on the fight against the smugglers together - that is the first important message. We are re-implementing law and order in migration flows. And the same thing that we are doing there now with the Balkan route, Mr President, we must also consider the Mediterranean route - you mentioned it. I am surprised at the questions that are now being asked about the legal system, that the questions are illegal, especially from the communist factions. I am amazed because Mr Tsipras - one of the communist representatives - was sitting at the table at the council and the laws have now been passed in Greece. I assume that Tsipras is doing the right thing. So if the left criticizes that now, one should first ask the questions in Greece. The same applies to Mr Verhofstadt, who is discussing this because his two colleagues - Rutte as Council President and Michel as Liberal Prime Minister - have confirmed all of this. I hope that the Liberal Group will also stand by these decisions if their heads of government implement them in the Council. The second: Europe needs secure borders, but Europe is not a fortress. We stand by the fact that we need legal routes to Europe in order to accommodate people who are in need in Europe. The EPP Group also supports the development aid aspects, the money. Waving through has ended. In the last few months we have had hundreds of thousands who have simply walked through Central Europe without control, without registration or without a security check. Thanks to the decision of the European Council and also thanks to the activities of Macedonia, this has now come to an end. It is clear that refugees - as the Commission President has said - do not have the right to choose where to help themselves. I would like to add one last thought and underline what Jean-Claude Juncker said today. With these points, we now have the chance to really give relations between the EU and Turkey a fresh start, to show the citizens that the partnership works, that both sides can work together in a spirit of trust. And that's why we also have a clear demand from President Erdoğan: You risk this restart with the way you deal with the issues. You have to respect freedom of expression, freedom of the press and also the rights of minorities, otherwise you will not have understood what Europe means. And on the current occasion, I also say: This applies not only to freedom of expression and freedom of the press in Turkey, but also to freedom of expression, freedom of the press and also to artistic freedom on this continent, in Europe. We expect from Erdoğan Respect for these values. The second big issue in the European Council was the question of growth. I would like to add one more sentence to this because the start is initially positive when we talk about growth. The Cypriot leader of the party that is currently in government in Cyprus was with us in the group yesterday, and Cyprus is out of the bailout program. Cyprus has managed to provide for itself again, to go its own way again. This is a model of success that succeeds in getting back on your feet independently with partnership and friendship in Europe and organizing growth. We are on the right track because we are reforming the states and the budgets have been stabilized. But we are also experiencing national election campaigns in which parties are calling this course into question again, in which the voters are told: No more reforms need to be carried out and we are spending new, fresh money that we do not have. Promises are made. I would like to say to people, especially when it comes to Spain, where we may have another election campaign in a few weeks: please do not believe these empty promises made by certain politicians! Here too, Tsipras is the best example. He has promised everything to the people and must also realize that he has to carry out pension reform in his own country. Do not believe the empty promises made by those who say that reforms must end and we can spend money again. The appeal to the citizens is: The only serious way is that we carry out reforms, reform our countries and that we ensure stable budgets. That is the only honest way forward, and the EPP Group will consistently pursue it.

Nevertheless, our doubts, the doubts of my political group, remain. We have concluded the agreement at the very moment when Turkey is withdrawn into itself, the free press is repressed and the rights of minorities trampled on. I ask the Commission and the Council to monitor, as they said to do, Turkey's respect for human rights, humanitarian law, to strengthen economic and human resources support for Greece, to pay particular attention to women and for children, to verify the possibility of a European management of hot spots. Honestly, let's face it frankly, we can criticize this agreement - I am doing it - however, we have been forced into this agreement by the selfishness and closure of some EU Member States who have refused to relocate refugees. None of us have the magic wand to solve these issues, but we all know that the key to overcoming this challenge lies in a mandatory and automatic mechanism, as the European Commission has proposed, of refugees and migrants, and we must also take into account the idea of ​​sanctions against those countries that put a spoke in the wheel. It is no longer acceptable that the Union, on the one hand, punishes a state that goes beyond the deficit by one point zero and, on the other, closes both eyes to the sabotage of those who do not show responsibility for politics immigration; we cannot be strict on accounts and lax on people. Then we need an overall strategy, it was said, there are not only the Aegean and the Balkans, the landings on the southern shore are increasing and we must also propose a development pact to African countries, otherwise in the coming months we will see a new exodus in the Mediterranean and migrants will arrive, if not from Africa, from Albania and what will we do? Will we build walls on the water? Thinking about stopping millions of people with walls is not only unrealistic, it is even shameful. I also say this to Austria, what is this preventive barrier for 25 refugees a day? What is that? A useless, shameful, harmful thing! So, in the coming weeks, we have a historic opportunity, we have the opportunity given us by the possibility of reforming Dublin. Juncker has again offered a pact of alliance with Parliament, I say yes to President Juncker, a pact of alliance with Parliament, but for a courageous reform that goes to the bottom of the Dublin rules, to enact a true common asylum policy at European level. I continue to believe - and I conclude President - that in this difficult time we must maximize what unites us. What unites the sincerely pro-European forces that still exist here and in Europe, rather than favoring what divides us. In this difficult time it would be advisable to avoid turning this House into an agora for the electoral campaign in Spain, in Greece, in other countries. Let's do it there, here we try to maintain our unity to change Europe and to save Europe.

Well, as the days get longer and the blossom and leaves appear on the trees, we can now see that summer is coming. The International Organisation for Migration has estimated that eight times more people crossed the seas to come to EU countries in the first three months of 2016 compared to the first three months of 2015. All indications are that the numbers arriving this summer will surpass previous years, many fleeing the horrors of terrorism and barbarism that still exist, but others understandably pursuing a better life in our countries. None of us wants to see another summer like the last, wondering if the public support for the Schengen area or the public’s confidence in our institutions or the public sympathy can last another summer like the last. And whilst the challenge may not change, what does need to change is our attitude and our response. This summer is a chance to show that we have learned the lessons of failure from 2015. And while Mr. Tusk admits that not all agreements are perfect, I have to say that much has come out of the Council and the Commission to tackle the crisis which my political group has called for and supports: measures to better guard the external border; enhancing the Schengen Information System; building a more efficient returns and readmission programme, and taking on the human traffickers. However, other decisions have been made which may make some of us feel better but may store up more problems for the future. And while I have huge admiration for the way that the Turkish nation has received, administered and housed over 2.7 million refugees, as Mr Tusk admitted, many of us still have serious concerns about the EU-Turkey deal on a practical level, on a legal level and (some) on an ethical level. Time will tell if those concerns are allayed. But even as the German Chancellor and the European Commission hailed the deal with Turkey, questions are being asked in other countries. We live in an age of instant messaging and social media, and we have to realise that as one entry point becomes less accessible, messages will be sent back telling others to try alternative routes via Italy, Spain or Malta, to name a just few. Moving on to last week’s communication from the Commission on the review of the Dublin system, we saw a mixed bag: two very different options for reform. One option that reinvents the wheel and centralises asylum applications and distribution. The other, which seeks to make the wheel that we have turn better, offers some improvements to help states on the front line. Or to put it another way, now we face a clear decision between choosing an option shrouded in idealism but which has little chance of success, and one based on realism and making the situation better. I suspect the general public would prefer that we choose pragmatism over idealism. So, rather than an idealistic grand plan or what Mr Tusk calls a ‘golden key’, let us make the rules that we have work properly. Let us enhance and improve the laws and agencies already in place, not scrap and replace them through desperation. Let us put our efforts and our money into controlling our borders; returning those who are not fleeing persecution or war or disaster – of course understandably coming for a better economic life – but allowing them to apply through existing legal migration channels; providing dignified detention conditions; speeding up asylum procedures and getting meaningful and voluntary commitment from Member States about helping refugees closer to their homes, or directly resettling the most vulnerable from conflict regions. But let us show anyone looking to come to EU countries that we have asylum systems which are firm but fair, based on compassion and pragmatism. So my message to this House, to the Commission and to Member States over the next few weeks is a simple one: summer is coming. We do not have time to reinvent the wheel, but we do have time to fix it.

I have to tell you that my impression is that this is exactly what is happening now with the Turkey deal. Why with the Turkey deal? Because we tried to outsource our problems to an autocratic leader, Mr Erdoǧan. What is he doing? Well, two days ago, Mr Erdoǧan instructed the German Government to prosecute a TV presenter, Jan Böhmermann, for a satirical poem. I can tell you that I am not Mr Böhmermann’s lawyer and what he produced is also not my taste in humour, but in a free society such satirical poems must be possible. That is the price we pay for our freedom, and we pay happily for our freedom. So, to come back to Erdoǧan: we have already given him the keys to the gates of Europe and now we risk handing over the keys to our newsrooms to him so that he decides and controls our media. I have to tell you that I am not surprised that this is happening. If you put yourself at the mercy of somebody like Mr Erdoǧan and if you outsource your responsibilities to a third country like Turkey, that in my opinion it is only the beginning of what I call Turkish bazaar politics. Why do I say that? Well, Mr Erdoǧan has already declared in the Turkish Parliament that he will call off the agreement he has made with you if, within two months, he does not have the visa liberalisation he requested, regardless of whether he keeps his part of the agreement and complies with our conditions for visa liberalisation. So it is clear that we have put ourselves in the hands of Erdoǧan and, in fact, of his government. I have more and more the impression and the feeling, Mr Tusk, that, while Putin uses energy as a weapon, Erdoǧan uses poor refugees as a political weapon. That is what is happening. And I do not say that in a light way, I have to tell you. First proof of that: in Turkey – that was part of the deal, Mr Juncker, and it is not being complied with by the Turks – they need to change their legislation to lift all the territorial restrictions on the Geneva Convention and to make it possible for a Syrian refugee to have asylum in Turkey. They are not doing it and they refuse to do it. Moreover, and more important, is the fact that there are reports – and nobody is talking about this, we have a debate here – from Amnesty International stating that Turkey is sending Syrian refugees back to Syria against international law. Yesterday this was confirmed by Dutch state television in a programme in which they investigated this and proved that the Turkish authorities are doing that. My question to you, Mr Tusk, is: why are you not examining this? Is this true? And if this is true, can we continue with a deal that is against international law and against our obligations? What are you doing? What is your answer to that? Are you investigating this? Is it true what Amnesty International and Dutch state television said yesterday? Thirdly, let us not fool ourselves. It is true: you say the deal is working. On the Greek—Turkish border, yes. There are no longer 1 700 a day but 50 a day now. But yesterday the Italian coastguard rescued not 50 people, as normal, but 2 154 people. So what is the result of yesterday? We can only take yesterday’s figures. People like to talk about figures here and about the deal. Well, they are the figures – from 1 700 to 50, and from 50 to 2 154. Is that a deal that is working? In the meantime, we have in fact put our position, our freedom and our values in the hands of whom? Of Erdoǧan. Well, I am saying that instead of having a debate here about a deal that in my opinion is not working, we ourselves have to get our act together in Europe. That is the priority now and, in my opinion, that means three things. First of all, the European Border and Coast Guard. Do you know what the reality is? The Commission, rightly, has asked the Member States for a number of people. Do you know the figures? Four hundred people were asked for as interpreters: 37 were sent to Greece. The Commission asked for 472 migration officers: 31, Mr Tusk, have been sent to Turkey and to Greece. The Commission asked for 1 500 security officers. How many have been sent? Three hundred and thirty-nine. So in total, more than 2 300 people have been requested by the Commission as the start of this European Border and Coast Guard, and 400 of these people, more or less, have, in reality, been put at the disposal of the Commission. Is that a deal that is working? I have another idea. I think we desperately need this European Border and Coast Guard and to make an agreement so that it can be rolled out. Secondly, I think we desperately need a European asylum system and, like Mr Pittella, I give the support of my Group to go forward with the Commission’s proposal as fast as possible. And desperately, if you want to fight the smugglers, there is only one way and that is to make legal migration to Europe possible too. That is the only way to stop the smugglers – smugglers in Turkey or smugglers in North Africa.

I think your trick is not working. In view of the harsh criticism in the world about the EU-Turkey agreement, to come here and say: We understand that we ourselves have doubts about the ethical and legal admissibility of the agreement, on the other hand to declare: But that's that what we've got out of here and the key to the holy grail doesn't exist - I don't think it works. Because you have to do more. You can't just say: We won't get the key, and we know that everything doesn't work properly, and we don't move around that cleanly, but on the other hand, then again keep silent about what actually led to this situation. And when, in this situation, Mr Weber, plagued by his nightmares, conjures up the specter of communism again, especially that of Mr Tsipras and others, I can only say: Somewhere there is a loss of reality. We as the EU impose on Greece that with every decision to deport a refugee from Greece to Turkey, the deporting country must ensure that Turkey is a safe third country. We are demanding this from Greece, after we had been beating the drum here for months and accusing Greece that it is not doing enough to protect the external borders, one has to consider whether Greece can still be in the Schengen area at all, they always have it not yet understood - completely away from the realities in this country. Mr Verhofstadt has just listed what the implementation of the agreement actually means and what specific help is to be provided by the EU, what has been promised and what has been achieved so far. We are forcing Greece to enforce an asylum procedure, an asylum test based on the lowest standards. This is a lowering, a lowering of the standards for the asylum check. We finally have to take note of that here. And if that is then supposed to be the standard that will in future also apply as a blueprint for further negotiations, for further agreements, then I can only say: Then we will be far from our standards, from our principles, from our demands for humanity , according to dignity. At least we have to make that very clear here. It is one thing to have inadequacies and also to see that in practice we have not made any progress here, but it is another to pretend that one has to be satisfied with them now and those who criticize it should now please keep your mouth shut. That doesn't work, and I'll tell you very clearly: We are still strictly against evaluating this Turkey as it is now - and I always talk about this Erdoğan Turkey - as a safe third country. Even the scientific service of the Bundestag has expressed doubts and declared: Yes, in order to be a safe third country, one must guarantee refugee rights, effectively guarantee them in practice, and that is not done. The reports are available that hundreds of refugees have been deported across the border every day since mid-January, that the border is being closed, that Syrian refugees are being refused registration, that people are being shot, and that children are among the dead. When do we address this here? For me that is the question, and here I can only say: Please face an aggressive asylum policy! Put the responsibility on the Member States, even more than before!

The idea that was put over the result after the last summit was: we want to work together to ensure that there is order, reliability and the rule of law in the process of immigration and flight to Europe. We also want to guarantee reliability and the rule of law for people on the move. What we have been seeing day after day in the morning and evening in the news from Greece for weeks now shows a situation in which a kind of order is being established, but humanity and the rule of law disappear completely behind it. For example, there were really sensational reports from Idomeni from a former German minister, Norbert Blüm, who insisted again and again: If you want to do something better, then do it in accordance with the European idea of ​​humanity and in accordance with our own laws. And you said earlier, Mr Tusk, that is not all at 100 percent. I believe that at the moment in Greece there is absolutely no mention of the rule of law in the process, and that is Europe's first responsibility. Before we talk about the difficult situation in Turkey, we must first be able to guarantee the rule of law for people who have fled, at home in the European Union. I don't know whether that will work before we have established coast guard and border guard across Europe - because I believe that this is the most important requirement in this context - whether that will work one hundred percent. But letting go of the current situation - I know that won't work. And I believe that the European Union, together with the Greek authorities and Greek politicians, is asked to establish something else, because my impression is that what is happening now discredits the entire EU refugee policy and that the impression is solidifying that this misery is tolerated as a means of deterring people who would otherwise want to make their way to Europe. I think that we in Turkey - because there is this arrangement on refugees - also have responsibility for the rule of law. The fact that an agreement has been concluded does not mean that we can let it go, but that the European Union has had to clarify for weeks - since the news came that Syrian refugees were being pushed back to Syria - whether that was the case, and - if that is the case - would of course have to review the agreement and, if in doubt, withdraw it. I am - and I am now contradicting Mr Verhofstadt, with whom I completely agree on asylum guidelines and border and coast guard guidelines - not of the opinion that the EU has already thrown itself at President Erdoğan's feet.

We are here in what I have been told repeatedly is the home of European democracy, so surely we could have taken the opportunity this morning to celebrate the Dutch referendum last week, in which the people said ‘no’ to EU enlargement, ‘no’ to the deal with the Ukraine, and no doubt had it been Turkey, an even bigger number of people would have said ‘no’ to Turkish accession. It was a victory for democracy but, in particular, it was a victory for a little organisation called GeenStijl, a group of young bloggers who managed to get together 427 000 signatures. So it was also a victory for direct democracy, in the week when we remember that Gianroberto Casaleggio, the genius behind the Five Star Movement in Italy, has died. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new politics. We were told by Mr Juncker that if the Dutch voted ‘no’ it would be a disaster, but he has not mentioned it today at all. Indeed, his predecessor, Mr Van Rompuy, my old mate, says we should just ignore the Dutch and carry on blithely. So, what we are seeing is the big battalions of vested self-interest doing their best to completely ignore the will of the Dutch people. I think things are changing. I do not believe these institutions can survive 21st-century technology. I think the will of the people is changing politics in a way that makes all of you in this room deeply fearful, and so you should be. As we, in the United Kingdom, enter the final countdown of our referendum, all eyes are on this Turkish deal. What we see is the bosses of the EU bowing and scraping before Mr Erdoğan, who gleefully walks all over them and tramples over human rights at every level. Mr Juncker tells us this morning that we are making progress. Let us just examine that. 1.8 million people have come to the EU in the last 18 months and we have sent back 300. It does not sound like it is going very well to me. The one group that will be pleased, though, are ISIS. They have now managed to put 5 000 of their operatives into the European continent, according to the boss of Europol: something that should send a shiver down our collective spines. I have to say that, in the end, I think it is what the British referendum will turn on. I think we will vote for Brexit, and the reason is we will vote to put our own safety first. It is going to be as it was in the Netherlands last week – a battle of people versus the politicians. You may have the big money, the big businesses and Goldman Sachs, but we have got our armies of bloggers. In the end the people’s will is going to prevail. This place will not survive.

I cannot help but make a few remarks on previous speakers from the Social Democrats and the European People's Party when a Mr Pittella seriously claims that Austria must be criticized because, as he says, 25 migrants come to us every day. I can only assure you that last year there were 90,000 who sought asylum here in Austria, that this year there are already 35,000, and last year, with the help of Austrian Chancellor Faymann, a million people passed through Austria that were smuggled through towards Germany. And when, under pressure from my party - the Freedom Party - border protection measures are finally implemented in Austria, then I ask that you speak badly about it. I would also like to say a few words about the head of the European People's Party. If a Mr. Weber here in all seriousness keeps talking derogatory about the rights - yes, Mr. Weber, what are you? I think you are a CSU member. When I hear the words of your Bavarian Prime Minister, he is making conservative politics. What you do is somewhere between red and green. But it's good that the AfD in Germany is just overtaking you and that you will soon be just a part of German party history. And a Mrs Harms from the Greens, who recently claimed in all seriousness that democratic referendums should be held back on European affairs - I wonder what happened to your party? You come from a movement that acted on a grassroots basis. Today you are traveling in a pseudo-dictatorial manner and want to deprive the population of the right to decide their own interests. This Turkey deal is another rotten deal that is headed in the completely wrong direction, and its eyes and ears have been closed to what is happening in Turkey. Human rights, the Kurdish problem, the treatment of women in society and so on and so forth, orientate yourself - Mr President, I am done - by what the population says.

Sometimes I don't really understand the world anymore: We have had a lot of debates here and we were upset that we don't have any concrete help on the issue of refugees, that our main job is to take care of the people who live on the Escape is helped. And then we attacked the council and said: These crazy idiots, these egoists are not coming to Potte. Now they decide, now you could say: Thank you, that was okay. That would be an idea too!

The Member States have finally taken on responsibility and said: We are going to do something now. This is not a perfect solution, who said that? Anyone who does politics and has a bit of all their senses together knows that there is never a perfect solution. There never is, there are always only pieces or steps on the right path. And that is an important step, that is an opportunity, that is concrete help. We have a decline in the number of refugees, that's something! And the nonsense that some people say here, that would surrender us to Turkey - I can't think of anything more. What kind of nonsense is that? In contrast to those who accuse us of this, I can only say: I was always against joining Turkey from the start. Many of those who now have different views always said: record tomorrow. Stop gossiping, on the one hand, to take on Turkey tomorrow, and now - if it fits - to criticize! Stay straight! I found Mrs. Harms' contribution to be very impressive. To say there are a lot of things that don't suit me - I share that. I don't like a lot of what is happening in Turkey. But if you now organize cooperation on the issue of refugees, as Jean-Claude Juncker said, and take a step forward, that is progress. You could say: great, great, made progress, next step! But now be careful that we don't make a mistake - of course. But don't just criticize from morning to night! If things go on like this, this Parliament will develop into an institution in the European concert that cannot be taken seriously, if we keep complaining and being against everything.

I want the agreement to work, but in such a way that refugees have their fundamental human rights respected. And not by making our cooperation conditional, by blackmailing refugees into the Greek islands to hear that Turkey is forcibly returning Syrians to Syria? The situation is shocking. There are almost three million refugees in Turkey, most of them on the roads. How safe is this country for these people at all? We know the situation with media freedom, minority rights. The situation on the Greek islands is also shocking, where \"hot spots\" are becoming closed camps. We need to give refugees the opportunity to apply for asylum. Where are all those of our experts? It is also a fact that even such a good agreement with Turkey will not succeed if the countries of the Union do not start implementing resettlement and relocation programs.

First, the deal does nothing to solve the refugee crisis. Instead of providing a just and humane common European solution, Member States are egotistically trying to hide the crisis from the view of EU citizens, pretending that the illegal mass returns of refugees to Syria have nothing to do with the Union. But we know how terrible the human suffering at the Turkish-Syrian border is. The Union should have proposed an ambitious and united approach in asylum matters based on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities. Second, Turkey is not a safe country for refugees. It does not provide basic guarantees of the status of refugees. Moreover, Turkey is not a safe country even for its own nationals. Turkey is engulfed by violence and repression against Kurds and other minorities. The Turkish Government should put an end to censorship and respect freedom of expression. Last but not least, the deal is illegal. By framing it as a statement of the Heads of State and Government, the EU side is trying to avoid the obligations under EU law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It also circumvents the prerogatives of this Parliament to co-decide on asylum and migration matters.

Well, if you had doubts you should not proceed, you should not have proceeded because we are dealing with doubts relating to the risk of violations of fundamental rights. These are doubts that start from facts, from history, even from recent episodes. Of course, we are aware that a solution must be found, we are not looking for the golden fleece or perfection, as President Tusk told us today, but we are looking for a solution and the solution represents for us, it coincides with the modification of the Dublin regulation, but a real change, a real change, not the one proposed days ago by the European Commission. There is no trace of the humanitarian corridors in the proposal of the European Commission and yet we want to fight against irregular immigration, well, then that we give a legal alternative, that we give a legal alternative to reach Europe, that we change the Dublin regulation, also based on the principle that the first country of arrival is the one that has the greatest responsibility in asylum applications. It is by changing this principle that a country is prevented from becoming a huge refugee camp. The Balkan route is still closed, in Idomeni the Macedonian police used tear gas and rubber bullets injuring people, including children, UNICEF reports 22,000 minor refugees, of which 2,000 are unaccompanied, Amnesty International has denounced Turkey as a country not safe for refugees. The situation is disastrous and, unfortunately, it is a summary assessment of the effects of the EU-Turkey agreement.

We already experienced this in the March session, when the details of this contract were not known yet. But we have to say what were the reasons why we had to conclude this agreement. This is the result of losing the ability to protect our external borders. This was due to all those who delayed the development of common solutions, including the restoration of law and control at the external borders of the European Union. The agreement between Turkey and the Union is a difficult, complicated and delicate compromise. We are all aware of this. We are also aware of the logistical, material and legal challenges that we have to face, but it also brings real help to the refugees who are in Turkey. These unprecedented situations also require extraordinary solutions, but this does not mean that the law of the stronger is to apply or that we are to give up our values ​​when fighting for Europe. I would also like to say that we hope that after the agreement with Turkey, in the wake of the Malta summit on November 11, forms of cooperation with other countries will also crystallize, because the internationalization of the migration crisis is the only way to solve it. I would also like to highlight with satisfaction that the European Council is addressing the situation of, inter alia, in the steel sector.

We all agree: the agreement with Turkey is only part of a solution. Turkey is an important partner for us, especially when it comes to migration and refugee issues, but the main responsibility remains with us here in the European Union. Yesterday, with a large majority, we passed an own-initiative report which makes it very clear what we want: we want more solidarity within Europe, we want more legal channels, we want to revise the Dublin procedure and secure Schengen. I think that is still at the forefront of everything we do. The Turkey Agreement can only function properly if the conditions for it are in place. And that's why it's also about management and also about very specific work so that it can work. If I cannot currently apply for asylum, I cannot be deported. It is also about how we support our Greek colleagues. I'm pretty tired, dear Count Lambsdorff, that we keep crying over our government. I ask the President of the Commission whether he can find 200 of his 30,000 employees who, in consultation with the government, he can send to Greece to provide assistance there if the Member States are not ready. I would help him find it if necessary. One last point: we need pragmatic solutions. The pictures we see of Idomeni are not acceptable.

It is enough to be on the ground to already see major dysfunctions and flaws in the asylum procedure in Athens. Greece, in fact, is facing an explosion of asylum requests, with 500,000 migrants and refugees on its territory and, faced with this situation, there is a cruel shortage of personnel on the ground, and the experts promised by Member States are not coming.

In my opinion, the answer is no. Those who decided on this arrangement, however, spared no efforts to wrap it all in pretty wrapping paper. On paper, we repeat that it is fully compliant with Union law and international law, but on the ground, the implementation raises questions. Questions about the legality of the proposed scheme - I am not the first to say so. The referral mechanism to Turkey is based on the concepts of \"first country of asylum\" and \"safe third country\" and, in both cases, the protection which asylum seekers or refugees can availing oneself in this country is not really satisfactory. It is obviously up to the judge to decide all this, but the first assessments, at this stage, tip the scales in the “no” side. Questions about the applicability: the referral mechanism poses a large number of logistical problems in Greece, in particular to guarantee an individual examination, an appeal procedure and a dignified reception of the populations. Here again, the implementation of the agreement does not seem to comply with the guarantees announced on paper. Questions about effectiveness: this plan seeks at all costs to dry up the flow of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea. It's a safe bet that other routes will open up, and there is also an increase in flows from Libya to Italy and Malta, and there are even reports of passages via Ukraine. More and more, this agreement takes on the air of an infernal machine which could get carried away and become uncontrollable and uncontrolled, participating in the unraveling of European values ​​and foundations.

Let me clarify some points. Our relationship with Turkey is not about antagonism in terms of power dynamics. It is about an agreement to address an issue in a joint way. Both Europe and Turkey are under great pressure. We are confronted with the same challenges and an unprecedented situation. Cooperation is necessary. It is true that Turkey considers this cooperation to be a catalyst to reenergise our relations as well as its European perspective. This new chapter in EU-Turkey relations is not interpreted as a concession on our basic principles and values of European democracy. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for Turkey to come closer to European standards on all issues: democratic values, rule of law, freedom of expression, respect for minority rights, and resolution of the Cyprus issue. It is in Europe’s interest to have a democratic and stable Turkey as a neighbour, and it is in the interest of Turkey to have the European Union as a stable supporter and partner.   The refugee crisis brought us closer in a spirit of mutual understanding. It needs to be proved whether we mean what we say and what we agree. We are monitoring to ensure that every single aspect of this agreement happens in full accordance with European Union and international law. I do not have any doubt about it, and we persist on that. For example, the Turkish authorities have passed legislation to ensure protection for Syrians. We told them very explicitly that guarantees are needed for all those who are in need of protection, whether they are Syrians or non-Syrians. On visa liberalisation, 35 out of the 72 requirements are fulfilled, but the Commission has been crystal clear: we can only make a proposal to lift visa requirements if all benchmarks are met. Turkey knows this, and it is making efforts to further accelerate the fulfilment of the benchmarks so that we can lift the visa requirements by June 2016. The deal has only started being implemented, with just over 300 people who had not applied for asylum being returned and 74 Syrians resettled directly from Turkey so far. This is only the start. Next week the Commission will formally report on the state of play of implementation of all elements of this agreement. Let me say this: this agreement is an important step for a long-term renewed relationship. A common goal is also to come closer to one another when it comes to values, as I stressed at the beginning of my remarks. In the meantime, the Commission is heavily involved in the situation on the ground in Greece. We are doing everything to support Greece in expanding reception capacities and in making sure that vulnerable applicants, such as women and children, are being treated appropriately. Our people are there, deployed all around the Greek islands, as well as on the Greek mainland, providing our help to the Greek Government and the Greek authorities. Member States need to continue relocating massively from Greece, and I fully agree with what was said in this House today, that all Member States must take their share of their responsibilities. Of the more than 50 000 people stuck in Greece, at least 70% are eligible for relocation. This is important for those who were stranded in Idomeni and Pireus before 20 March. Let us also look at other routes. The arrivals from Libya to Italy show that as long as there is instability, as long as there are smugglers taking advantage of this situation, people will continue to migrate. It is as simple as that. So we have to keep working on the bigger picture. This means continuing our political efforts to bring back stability to Syria and Libya. This also means turning into reality our proposal for a European Border and Coast Guard. We are very happy that this House has presented a draft report and has a timetable which reflects our commitments. We have no time to lose here – indeed, summer is already here. This also means enhancing legal pathways so that people do not have to resort to irregular arrangements. I would like to thank those Members of this House who have raised this and who support our view. Stepping up our efforts on resettlement is an essential part of the solution, primarily from Turkey now but also from Lebanon and Jordan, which are hosting hundreds and thousands of refugees. I have said this before: if we genuinely want to close the irregular backdoor, we have to open a safe and legal window. Fortress Europe is neither desirable nor feasible, simply because as long as people have reasons to flee, they will continue to do so, and they will continue to try to come to Europe. And not only is it our moral and legal responsibility to offer a safe haven for those in need, we also need to make our policies and our approach future-proof. Resettlement is the way forward to ensure orderly, legal and controlled admission from third countries for those who are in need of protection. Some of you also mentioned Dublin. We do not want a cosmetic reform. The President was very clear today on that. We need to reform and improve Dublin to ensure that solidarity and a fair sharing of responsibility is engrained in the new system, because the current one is simply not sustainable. We all know that there is no easy solution to the challenge we face, but one thing is sure: we have to work together and not against each other. This is valid for the European Union institutions, the Member States and also our relations with our neighbours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 101, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President of the European Council. – Madam President, there are several aspects of our debate to which I would like to refer. Firstly, regarding relocation: this is – and will be – one of the key elements of the European solution to the crisis. In this aspect, of course, we need solidarity. I have no doubt about that. But we would be making a mistake if it became the main tool of our policy, because it would be a simple incentive for further, even greater, migration flows, something like an encouragement for possible new migrants. This is why I think we have to be very cautious, especially when it comes to communication with the outside world. In the debate, Mr Kamall and Mr Verhofstadt referred to statistics on irregular migration in the context of the Mediterranean route. I am always very cautious when it comes to statistics. I have some reason to be cautious, but today it is indeed worth considering them. First, concerning the Balkan route, it is true that 150 000 irregular migrants have arrived in Europe since the beginning of this year, but the numbers are falling, month after month, from close to 70 000 in January, to 50 000 in February, to 30 000 in March, and to about 1 000 in April. Just imagine if only in the month of January, in the middle of winter, there were 70 000 migrants, how many of them would have come in April if we had not taken action? Second, it is also true that since the start of this year, 20 000 irregular migrants have come to Europe via the central Mediterranean route and that the numbers are growing. But no Syrians are among them. They are nationals of Africa and countries such as Nigeria, Somalia, Gambia, the Republic of Guinea and Ivory Coast. What does this mean in fact? If we had not closed the Western Balkans route, we would now have three or five times more migrants – those from Africa coming to us through Libya, as well as those who have now been stopped at the border or discouraged from crossing the border. Many have said today that our priority should be to set up the European Coast Guard. I am in favour, even if this Coast Guard will not be operational this year. That is obviously impossible. But we must ask ourselves the question: what exactly should the EU Coast Guard do? Let all through who want to enter Europe, or stop and control them? I think it is obvious – not only for me – that they should stop and control them, which means in fact the same very controversial action that we are applying right now. In the first place we must expect national coastguards to enforce our law on European borders. The European coastguards should support those who need help but cannot replace them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 102, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "The debate is closed.

It goes beyond the ongoing differences that relate to Europe’s critical views about authoritarian developments and human rights issues in Turkey’s governance; the Kurdish question; and the problem of a divided Cyprus. Even if all these issues were resolved, the bad faith would persist. There is still a lack of clarity and honesty regarding Turkey’s future as a member or non-member of the European Union.

Ich danke Ihnen, Herr Präsident Martin Schulz, dafür, dass ich die legitimen Vertreter der europäischen Bevölkerung ansprechen darf, die ich jetzt bestätigen möchte. House of Democracy because no other European institution on this scale underlies the principles of freedom of security, humanism, citizen participation, which this Assembly - and each of its members - represents and guarantees. Being able to be here today is a sign of the relevance that European integration assumed in the birth and affirmation of Portuguese democracy. But it is also a sign of personal commitment, born out of a very old design. I belong to a generation of Portuguese for whom Europe and integration in it were a dream, inseparable from democracy, decolonization, economic development and Social Justice. The conversion of the dictatorship into democracy passed through the end of the Empire, but not less by the affirmation of Portugal's belonging to Europe, its geographical, historical and cultural cradle. And, more clearly from the 60s of the last century, the destination of its main emigration and origin and destination of its trade. We believed in Europe in itself, for what it represented as an example of peace, solidarity, growth, social equity, cultural experience. But we still saw it as an incentive to build a new Portugal. For this reason, I remember with longing the first university delegation to the Communities, which I integrated, in the most complex period of the Revolution; or the European influence in my activity, in my early twenties, as a constituent deputy, between 1975 and 1976. And for that reason, I was thrilled with the application for membership in 1977, with the long negotiations until 1985, with the laborious construction of the single currency, which, as leader of the opposition, led me to make three state budgets feasible for a minority government, thus contributing to Portugal's entry into the euro zone. And allow me to confess to you the joy and pride I felt with the election of a Portuguese - José Manuel Durão Barroso - for the presidency of the European Commission; and tell them of the particular commitment and pride that I feel with the activity of Portuguese deputies - of strictly all Portuguese deputies - in this Assembly. Old, strong beliefs never change. I remain convinced of the irreplaceable role of the European Union, in Europe and in the world. And, since there is democracy, Portugal remains faithful to this constant of its national strategy, with all its presidents and with all their governments. (Applause) This year Portugal celebrates 40 years of the Constitution, the founding charter of freedom and democracy. For the consolidation of Portuguese democracy, the European Communities played an essential role. The European Union's contribution to the development of my country and to the improvement of the quality of life of its people was - and continues to be - essential. Portugal was able to successfully take advantage of structural funds from Europe, modernized the productive fabric, qualified the labor force, built essential infrastructures. But, in order to adjust to European rules, Portugal was forced to take in 12 years the steps that strongest economies had taken in more than 40 and, in the middle, decolonized in two years and welcomed and integrated, in a population of nine million , 700,000 Portuguese-speaking Africans and nationals, saw military power remain until 1982, moved from a partially colonial, rural and closed economy to a European economy, globalized, open, progressively re-privatized, with more services and new industries. The price of these changes in a short period of time was immense and neither the use of funds demonstrations of understanding and European support for Portugal, was sufficient for the necessary consolidation. The global and European crises of 2008 and 2009 joined the structural problems still to be solved and, for three and a half years, an Adjustment Program, in which the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund intervened, tested the historical capacity of the Portuguese to withstand crises and personal sacrifices so that the internal and external financial balances could succeed. As President of the Portuguese Republic, I am proud to be here today before this Assembly and to be able to say: Europe did not fail to help Portugal and Portugal honored its commitments, leaving the Adjustment Program cleanly. (Applause) Today, Portugal wants to continue to guarantee financial equilibrium, control of the deficit, control of public debt and, at the same time, begin to compensate for the most sacrificed social sectors in the recent past, believing that, in addition to private investment and exports, household consumption can also help to create growth and jobs. It is a path that aims at the same macroeconomic and financial goals, but which is, in part, different from the previous one, led by a government that is also European, respectful of internationally assumed commitments, supported in Parliament not only by one of the two main European political families, but also by parties of another relevant European family, which, until now, had been outside the area of ​​constitutional executive power in Portugal. Although with roots that come from a doctrinal area different from those in which the current parliamentary majority is inserted, as President of all Portuguese, which I am, I feel that it is essential to pacify, to de-dramatize, to heal wounds, to rebuild consensus. My message is therefore clear, ladies and gentlemen: stability, refusal of political crises to add to economic and social issues, search for broad convergences, strengthening the financial system - that a recent step may be a good sign - , capacity to carry out administrative, judicial, human qualification, capitalization of companies and social cohesion reforms and the sincere desire that the demanding path of reconciliation between financial rigor and social concerns, based on growth also due to the dynamism of the market, is fully successful internal. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am an incorrigible Europeanist. The Europe I dreamed and dreamed of, and the overwhelming majority of Portuguese dreams, faces new challenges, much more complicated than those they have faced in the past. They are the ones who tell us that it is not time to falter or to limp. Reflection on the future of the Union must give new life to a model that has allowed Europe to go through a period of peace and prosperity, previously unknown in its millenary history. We must continue, bypassing xenophobic behaviors, combating exacerbated nationalisms, rejecting sterile chauvinisms, refusing isolations from the past. It is by itself, already, an immense and enviable legacy that needs to be expanded and prolonged. The debate on the European Union, bearing in mind the new challenges, will only be fruitful, however, if it is based on a constant dialogue with the citizens of Europe, respecting their legitimate aspirations to live in an area of ​​security, freedom and justice, growth, employment, being and solidarity. And it is therefore also essential that European and national leaders are attentive to these aspirations, looking at the will manifested in terms proper to our democratic societies, which requires greater European pedagogy and greater proximity to citizens. The Europe I dream of wants to remain united and supportive, internally and externally, attentive to possible arrivals, wishing there are no departures. Always looking for joint solutions to the social effects of wars in neighboring areas, namely in the case of refugees, in which case Portugal has been an example. In proportion to its population, being, perhaps, the main European country or countries to show readiness to welcome and include refugees within Portuguese society. This situation requires that the fundamental issues are not forgotten, under the urgency of mere short-term agreements, which we all wish not to be questionable or insufficient. The Europe with which I dream, which has so often triumphed over barbarism and totalitarianism, will also be able to overcome the threats of religious and political fanaticism and terrorism. To this end, acting in solidarity in the face of difficult contexts and dramatic effects, translated into attacks that under no circumstances can fail to be unconditionally condemned. And here, again, my solidarity with France and Belgium is expressed. The Europe with which it aspires to have a global political weight corresponding to its commercial weight, for which it is important that its voice is increasingly heard and that it continues to effectively lead universal causes, such as, among others, that of financial transparency, which agree with the discrediting of democratic systems, institutions and protagonists and that of intergenerational environmental justice. The Europe I dream of wants to see politics and law keeping pace with scientific, technical, economic, social and cultural reality. A Europe that recovers the peoples, the electorates, the youngest, those forgotten at the end of their professional careers, for a cause that combats pessimism and militant skepticism. The Europe I dream of has in Portugal and for that Union it was an immense legion of dreamers sharing the same dream: a Europe with a project that brings freedom, justice, democracy, solidarity, transparency and popular roots. The Europe I dream of has Portugal at the forefront of this fight and is - and must be - optimistic. Otherwise, it is no longer Europe. Otherwise, it is no longer a symbol of the future. The Europe that I dream of keeps in its memory what Portugal in the strength of its simplicity brought to and from other continents, cultures and civilizations, and that enriches us so much. The Portugal that I have brought with me today crossed seas and faraway lands but never forgot that it belongs to the lands of Homer, Shakespeare, Goethe, Proust, Cervantes, Dante, Joyce, Strindberg, Kundera, Kafka, Szymborska and Pessoa, and many , many others. We are Europeans; we will always be Europeans. Thank you very much.

The work of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund is extremely important to maintaining the competitiveness of European workers in the labor market. The fund supports redundant workers from large enterprises, who are often the main employer in the region, offering them the possibility not only to improve their qualifications within a given profession, but also to completely retrain. In the case of Volvo's Umeå plant, the layoffs were due to a decline in production and exports of heavy trucks to new Asian manufacturers. Moreover, the region whose capital city is Umeå is known for its highly skilled industries, while most of the dismissed workers have only secondary education. The mobilization of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund was therefore necessary in this case. However, it should be remembered that globalization also has a huge impact on the functioning of small and medium-sized enterprises.

I am generally in favour of mobilising this fund, although I am aware that this is probably not the instrument that best can help redundant workers, but in the absence of viable alternatives I nevertheless believe that it should be supported.  The issue of technical assistance is slightly different, because I believe that this should be provided at no extra cost by the European Commission, leaving all the resources of this instrument to support companies and workers affected by the crisis; The Novakov report stresses the need to make certain changes on this point, but without specifying precisely in which direction we should go.

We also learn, by the way, that the financial mechanisms of the EU-Turkey agreement on migrants lack a legal basis in the European budget.

I also believe that Mikhail Kozlovs' work will further improve the court's reports so that the European Parliament receives all the necessary information on the accuracy of the data provided by member states to the European Commission.

In spite of all this, the Commission's intention would be to extend the licence. This is an absurd position when it comes to the health of our citizens.

I have therefore proposed amendments, on behalf of the EPP Group, limiting and framing the authorisation to market: 7 years instead of 15 (proposed by the Commission), which will have to be reviewed according to the analyses of the European Chemicals Agency by the end of 2017; Certification system for professionals; limitation and/or prohibition for non-professionals; accelerating the work of the Commission and Member States on the list of co-formulating to be banned; strengthening research and innovation towards alternatives to glyphosate. As these essential points were adopted by my colleagues, I voted in favour of the resolution. On this issue it was important to have a more pragmatic than political approach in order to propose a solution to the ongoing deadlock between the Commission and the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1120, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Andor DELI", "mepid": "124714", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 A number of worrying research findings have been published on the carcinogenic effects of a pesticide called glyphosate and special attention should therefore be paid to the extension of the EU authorisation for the active substance.

There are also known concerns that glyphosate, in addition to its cancer-forming properties, disrupts the endocrine system. The decision to approve or not to approve glyphosate is very important, since if it is included among the approved substances, the population will be in contact with it directly and frequently, especially in close proximity to dwellings, for spraying, since glyphosate was commonly used in spraying with the intention of destroying different types of herbs.

Currently, of all herbicides, glyphosate is the most popular drug in the world, whose global use has increased dramatically over the past 40 years. The problem is that in many Member States, from large-scale agricultural production to forestry and hobby gardening, almost anyone can use this plant protection product without proper qualifications or restrictions on use. In my opinion, the compromise offered by the PpE Group is capable of strikeing the right balance between the concerns of European citizens and the legitimate interests of agricultural operators. According to the amendment adopted, the European Commission should only renew the marketing authorisation for glyphosate for 7 years instead of 15, subject to strict restrictions on professional qualifications.

The numbers are dramatic. The use of this agricultural chemical in the world has increased 260 times in the last 40 years. Glyphosate is one of europe's most used weed-destroying products, or herbicides. The most well-known is the round. Farmers are increasingly using the round to make it easier to prepare fields for the coming season, destroy weeds or speed up grain drying. In the plants after their harvesting, there remain round-the-foot traces. Everyday, by eating flour-making oat flakes, bread, cookies and other products, we take a round. A few years ago, a study showed that the level of glyphosate in the urine of the Latvian population is one of the highest in Europe. At the same time, concerns are growing about the effects of glyphosate on the hormonal system and the reproductive system, as well as its effects on pregnancy. Glyphosate and its residues have also been found in water, soil, food and beverages, as well as in non-food products. It harms the environment and nature by reducing the biodiversity of agricultural land and destroying the feed sources of birds and insects. Given that glyphosate destroys not only unwanted weeds, but also plants, pollutes the environment in which we live and poses a serious threat to human health, I voted against extending the licence to glyphosate.

He is also convinced that the EU should step up its diplomatic action to de-escalate the situation, especially in the southern neighbourhood. Parliament is of the opinion that, in order to build stability and peace and to promote human security, the rule of law and respect for human rights and democratisation, the EU should fulfil its enlargement and integration commitments based on policies that foster economic growth and an inclusive society, and should continue to work with very closely associated countries in the context of the newly revised European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).

Therefore, I believe that in order to deal with the threats and challenges facing the EU, there must be greater cooperation between The Member States in implementing a common framework for defence policy.

This becomes clear at the latest when the European Parliament criticises those Member States that, in the Council of Foreign Ministers, do not wave through what Brussels is asking for. They are being urged to \"show more flexibility\" – that is, to put aside legitimate national reservations in favour of the EU.

The EU must speak with one voice on issues relating to our common security, namely the migration crisis, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, or energy security.

The Zika virus is a danger that threatens women in a pre-proportional way. There are inappropriate calls for women to refrain from becoming pregnant because pregnancy is often not a matter of choice, especially in poorer and more underdeveloped corners of the world. I also support un recommendations regarding access to sexual and reproductive health services. Women in poorer areas often do not have access to information, tests and medicines. I therefore call on the Commission and the authorities of the affected countries to take into account the specific challenges and difficulties faced by women.  At the moment, the danger to Europe is relatively small, but with the arrival of warmer and wetter weather, there is a chance that mosquitoes will start spreading the virus in our part of the world. If that happens, he won't be stopped by national borders. Therefore, Member States, regional authorities and the Commission must be ready to respond in a coordinated and effective way.

In terms of communication and management by WHO, there is an inadequate response, particularly in terms of communication. Many mothers-to-be are very anxious, even though the epidemiological data are not as alarming as the media suggests.

As a co-author of the adopted text, I was able to participate in its text from the very beginning. When negotiating the proposal, I was based on information provided by the Agency as the European Parliament's contact person for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Unfortunately, it is already a rule that we encounter a terrible new epidemic of some kind of virus every year. Last year it was Ebola, today it's Zika. Contrary to the first reports of this virus, we are now discovering the shocking truth that Zika is an even bigger problem than originally thought. In addition to severe developmental disorders manifested by stunting or ending brain growth, or the entire head, the fetus (called microcephaly) is found to be likely to cause other disorders and brain damage. I am pleased that the proposal welcomes the greater mobilisation of resources for the investigation of this virus and its effect on the human body.

As an effective antibody is not yet known, it is essential that the EU, like the entire international community under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, spends the maximum possible amount of resources (both financial and human) on research and development of vaccines, but also on combating it. However, it should be remembered that the mother's infection does not necessarily mean that the disease is passed on to the fetus. I am harshly distancing myself from the claim that Zika automatically causes damage to the central nervous system of the fetus, as we know many cases where babies are born perfectly healthy. In this context, I therefore see the proposals towards the blanket liberalisation of abortion as unfortunate and medically totally unfounded.

This report calls on the Commission to present a virus prevention plan in Europe and stresses that research should be linked to three strands: research into the strong suspected links between the virus and congenital brain malformations, the development of treatments and vaccines and the creation of tests to enable rapid and effective diagnosis. In addition, it wants eu public funds to be invested in research if eu public funds are invested, its results are exempt from intellectual property rights and there is a guarantee that patients can benefit from affordable products.  The document also welcomes the Commission's decision to mobilise EUR 10 million for research, recommending that it be included in cases of severe congenital brain malformation in Latin America and the suspicion of its relationship with Zika virus infection.

The Zika virus was detected in 1947 in rhesus monkeys in the Zika forest in Uganda. In 2007, the virus was first recorded outside known endemic boundaries (an epidemic on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia). In 2015, the virus erupted badly in Brazil (especially in the north-east) and has been linked to an unusual number of babies born with microencephaly. Now the Zika virus, caused by mosquito-borne sting, is becoming more prevalent. There have also been \"imported\" cases of Zika virus infection in various European countries. A case of microencephaly has been reported in a pregnant woman from Slovenia who has become infected with a virus with similar symptoms to the Zika virus during her stay in Brazil. The European Commission has therefore earmarked EUR 10 million for research in the field of this virus. The report states that the results of this research are free of intellectual property rights and that patients are afforded the affordability of such developed products.

This reform now makes it possible for unconstitutional laws to be passed without constitutional control and to remain valid for a long time.

Personally, I am mostly strongly opposed to any interference by the European Union in internal political processes taking place not only in any Member State, but also outside the EU. However, the current constitutional, political and social crisis in Poland can no longer leave me cold. In Poland, citizens are now constantly mobilizing against their own government, which is gradually questioning some fundamental human rights, restricting the functioning of fundamental constitutional institutions, and attacking women, and some minorities are returning to the dark era.

To that end, I was in favour of the adoption of this motion for a resolution of the European Parliament, which calls on Poland to fully respect the rule of law and fundamental European values, as well as to publish and fully implement judgments which give the Constitutional Court the role of guarantor of the supremacy of the Constitution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1944, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Tokia SAÏFI", "mepid": "4345", "text": "  In writing.

It was welcomed that the Polish asked the Venetian Commission on its own initiative to assess the situation. A month ago, the Veneto Commission sent Poland a document that reliably analyses compliance with the rule of law and formulates proposals for action for the Polish government. Unfortunately, in practice, not a single of these proposals has entered into force and the stalemate around the Constitutional Court continues. In this situation, the EP is obliged to express its opinion on the situation in Poland. The paralysis of the activities of the CTM cannot be reconciled, as this weakens the independence of the judiciary, one of the pillars of a democratic state and the legal security of citizens.

The actions subsequently taken by Law and Justice were aimed only at restoring normality, in which the Constitutional Court will not be a tool for fighting the opposition against the government, but an independent and apolitical constitutional court.  We listen attentively to the advice of our partners, but whether and how they will be taken into account is only a decision of the Polish authorities. The crisis that we are currently facing in Poland is political in nature and its escalation is clearly beneficial for opposition parties, as demonstrated by the rejection of many of the compromise proposals put forward by the parliamentary majority.

It is the result of intense negotiations in both legislators’ bodies and in the course of a trilogue on the basis of our first reading in March 2014 and a general approach in the Council from June 2015. The agreement found in December under the Luxembourg Presidency is an important signal, as the finalisation of this file by the end of 2015 was announced by the Commission and Parliament’s Presidents, as well as the heads of state in the European Council several times. Its adoption by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and the Council of Ministers, both almost by unanimity, shows that we struck the right balance between the high level of protection for the fundamental right to data protection, as well as strong consumer rights in the digital age, on the one hand, and the need to create a fair and functioning digital market with a real chance for growth and innovation on the other. Having said this, I want to emphasise once again that I did not believe, and I will not believe, that these two aspects are mutually exclusive. I am convinced that respect for data protection is not only a precondition for trust and innovation in a digitalised economy, but it will be an important key for the success of our European economies in the future. We Europeans not only export a high protection of privacy and consumer rights online. We will also be able to set a gold standard for the digital market of tomorrow, when these standards will be essential for each and every new technology product and service. At the same time, we are for the first time in European history regulating the application of a fundamental right for the whole European market by a directly applicable EU regulation. We are deepening and harmonising the existing rights and standards from the 1995 Directive on Data Protection and creating a single legal standard for the protection of personal data which is fit for the digitalised society of tomorrow. With new rights such as data portability and new principles like data protection by design, we are further developing the protection of our privacy and self-determination in times of big data and the internet of things. Stronger consumer transparency and choice is building new opportunities for trustful, secure and consumer-friendly products and services. The newly-built consistency mechanism in the future EU Data Protection Board and a strong sanction regime will ensure that there will be equal opportunities, effective rights and legal certainty for everyone on our market which, as the biggest common market in the world, nobody will be able to ignore. This compromise, which we have found in an intense democratic debate in a legislative process throughout recent years, is a huge step forward towards creating a single legal environment for the digital world of tomorrow, and this is our chance as Europeans to have a significant effect on it. I want once again to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the rapporteur for the Police Directive, Marju Lauristin, and all the colleagues here in Parliament, in the Commission and in the Council, as well as all the people involved in this democratic process, for their hard work, their honest and open engagement and contribution to this result. I also thank our staff, the secretariats, translators and lawyer linguists who made it possible for us to ensure final adoption this week. Everybody out there is waiting for us to formally finalise and present the long-expected EU Data Protection Regulation, and data controllers, their consultants, Member State governments and data protection authorities are eager to do what from now on will be the most important thing: to get this single data protection law of the European Union into practice as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1976, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Marju LAURISTIN", "mepid": "124698", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to start by endorsing Jan Albrecht’s words on thankfulness. We are really very thankful for the tough work we have done together with shadow rapporteurs from all Groups, with our secretariat, with our assistants, with the Commission and its team and with the Council and its team. It has been tough work, and I suppose that half a year ago we were not very optimistic as to the prospects of managing to do the whole data protection package in time and being ready together here now. Concerning my specific area, the directive on the data protection in the field of law enforcement or ‘police directive’, as it is called: this is part of the general data protection package which covers the specificities of police work. All elements of police work not directly related to crime investigation or prevention, including public security issues and crimes against public security – in short, ordinary work which is not criminal –  belong to the regulation presented by Jan Albrecht. What is specific in this directive? We see that police work contains more and more international aspects. In the present situation we all have experience on how important it is that police in different Member States work together, trust each other and transfer information quickly and smoothly. In order to do that they need common rules and a common framework, and this directive is presenting this common framework. It is important that, even in these times of common insecurity, we do not forget about basic fundamental human rights, and privacy protection is one of those. Nor should we forget about non-discrimination and fairness, and this directive also takes that into account – to have a good proper balance to secure personal data and also to give police, in their specific work on criminal investigation, enough space to be effective, quick and also cooperative. What are some of the main innovations for the police? We do not currently have a common framework for data protection or data processing in 28 Member States. We had a general directive that we replaced by regulation, but in the police field we did not have anything like that. This is the first regulatory act which will provide police in all Member States with their common rules. In this framework, the very important thing is that the general principles of proportionality, legitimacy and purpose-limitation are included in police work. That means that no form of mass surveillance is possible. The collection of data is not possible. Retention for an unlimited or unclear period is not possible. Another important point is that we foresee the inclusion of data protection professionals in the police institutional setting: specifically, in police work. This will bring everyday concerns about data protection and privacy protection into police work. There will also be quite a strict and strong regime for recording all excesses and all usages of data. All these principles are very important. We will have the opportunity to have more effective police work and provide more security and confidence for citizens that their privacy will be protected.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1977, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT", "mepid": "28176", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I attend today’s plenary session on the Data Protection Package. As you know, the Council very much welcomes the agreements that our two institutions reached last December on the General Data Protection Regulation and the directive on data protection in the field of criminal law enforcement. In the negotiations on the regulation and the directive, Parliament and Council have consistently acknowledged that protection of personal data is a fundamental right. As a result, we agreed to empower individuals with strong and enforceable data-protection rights. Parliament and Council recognise the importance of a coherent data protection framework for the digital economy, backed by strong enforcement. This resulted in a general data protection regulation laying down harmonised rules for processing of personal data. These new rules will end the fragmentation stemming from differences in implementation of the current directive. The new legislative framework enhances legal certainty, creates a level playing field for companies and reduces administrative burdens. Furthermore, the directive on data protection in the field of criminal law enforcement will ensure effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. An important element is that it will cover both cross—border and domestic processing of personal data. The directive will facilitate the exchange of personal data between law enforcement authorities. At the same time, it will guarantee a consistently high level of data protection. Tomorrow’s vote will make the EU’s data protection rules ready for the digital era. On behalf of the Council, I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular its rapporteurs, Mr Albrecht and Mrs Lauristin, for their excellent work and close cooperation with Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1978, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am really pleased to stand in front of you today at the end of our common journey to the final adoption of the data protection reform package. The Commission welcomes the final text that is before you. You are about to adopt data protection laws that will allow us to take full advantage of the digital single market because this is a key basis for the creation of the digital single market. Let me now take you through the various benefits of the new rules. The regulation will reinforce the tools to allow people to regain control of their personal data. It means that individuals will have more information on how their data is processed, and this information will be available in a clear and understandable way. It will also be easier for people to transfer their personal data between service providers. The right to erasure and to be forgotten will be clarified. An individual has the right, under certain conditions, to ask that search engines remove links leading to personal information about them. This right will be balanced with other rights, such as the right to freedom of expression. Individuals will have the right to know when their data has been hacked. Companies and organisations must notify the national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible so that users can take appropriate measures. Businesses will equally benefit greatly from this reform. The reform will boost legal certainty for businesses with a single set of rules across Europe. The new regulation will remove the differences between the current national data protection laws. Thanks to the one-stop shop, companies will only have to deal with one single supervisory authority. There will be a level playing field, and non—EU companies, when offering services in the EU, will have to abide by the same rules as EU companies. Other rules are also fit for innovation. Privacy-friendly techniques, such as pseudonymisation, will be encouraged, as will data protection by design. Let me turn now to our police directive. The rules will improve cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime in Europe. Criminal law enforcement authorities will no longer have to apply different sets of data protection laws according to the origin of the personal data, saving time and money. The new data protection requirements will apply to both domestic processing and cross-border exchanges of personal data. Having more harmonised laws in all the Member States will make it easier for our police forces to work together because crime has no borders, as the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have unfortunately shown again. Member States will need to share more information with each other and with EU agencies like Europol and Eurojust. This was also one of the conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of justice and home affairs ministers two days after the Brussels attacks. The new police directive will allow for smoother exchange of information between Member States’ police and judicial authorities, while ensuring a common and better standard of data protection. This directive is not about constraining law enforcement. It is about ensuring the correct and lawful treatment of personal data in the law enforcement context, which also includes the personal information of victims or witnesses of crime. The directive also sets a standard that has to be met by any future data—sharing instruments at EU level. As the Commission said last week in its Communication on interoperability of information systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, we need to fill the gaps left by our current information systems, but this does not mean mass gathering of data without purpose. On the contrary, it means that we need to make sure that the relevant data is available for the relevant law enforcement officer and for the right purpose. Getting this balance right will be a key priority in the years to come, and the police directive will be a strong framework for this work. Let me now say a few words about the Commission’s strategy for the next steps after this week’s historic adoption of the data protection reform. Following publication, Member States will have two years to prepare for applying the general data protection regulation and to amend or repeal their national laws. Member States will also have two years to transpose and implement the police directive. Because the new rules become applicable in spring 2018, this timeframe gives Member States and companies enough time to adapt to the new rules, but we need to ensure these two years are used in the best possible way to get ready. So the Commission will work closely with Member States to make sure that existing laws are adapted or repealed as necessary. The regulation in fact replaces 28 national laws, while the directive has to be transposed into national law. We will work in particular with data protection authorities to ensure a uniform application of the rules. The future European Data Protection Board will have a key role in ensuring coherent interpretation and enforcement, building on the work of the Article 29 Working Party. The Commission will work with them to ensure they are well prepared for their new tasks, and we want to have an open dialogue with other stakeholders, notably businesses, to ensure they are aware of their obligations and also that any doubts about the application of the new rules are verified. We may need best practices or guidelines in specific sectors such as energy and health, which make increasing use of personal data and need to develop privacy—friendly solutions. The Commission wants to ensure a dialogue between the actors to make sure we are all ready for the big day in 2018. Closer to that date we will also conduct awareness—raising campaigns so that citizens know their new rights and know how to exercise them. This is also the right moment for giving sincere thanks, so I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Albrecht and Ms Lauristin; the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE); the Dutch Presidency, and also the preceding Luxembourg Presidency. The Member States’ special thanks must go to my predecessor, Ms Viviane Reding. I would like also to thank my DG JUST colleagues and all those who have played a role in this monumental agreement, and I would like to invite all Members of this Parliament to endorse it tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1979, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   We will now move on to the group's key spokesperson.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1980, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Axel VOSS", "mepid": "96761", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Minister and Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her work and for her part in the I would also like to thank all the rapporteurs for their very intensive work.

I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks for this. This has developed well, and I can only hope that this directive will also be valid in the case of the emergency situations to which we are sometimes now also exposed, in the case of the terrorist matters that are coming to us, also with regard to the principle of legal protection. It is no secret that I am critical of the General Data Protection Regulation. Yes, it is in any case better than the law we had in the Data Protection Directive. Yes, the rights of individuals are also clearly improved and modernised here, and yes, the market location principle is also a good institution with which we can document that the processing of European citizens' data is also based on European data protection law. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the General Data Protection Regulation is too complex, too vague in many places, has a great deal of room for interpretation and thus leads to legal uncertainties. We have clearly failed to achieve full harmonisation with 65 opening clauses. The further processing of data is permissible, but difficult to reconcile with data reality. Big data applications are actually the future and offer a number of benefits and for research. However, the General Data Protection Regulation imposes obstacles on precisely these applications here, which should not have been. Here, a new data category in the form of pseudonymized data would have been better in a clear solution.

This is historic: let somebody say it. This is one of the biggest pieces of legislation Parliament has ever enacted, and I think we should be thankful for something that Parliament does very well, and that is quietly and deliberately, Members of this House, the rapporteurs Jan Albrecht and Marju Lauristin – but let me just say it because I know all the work they put in – all the shadows , Members who have sat here, Ms Reding and others – I realise I have just used up my whole two minutes now. But let me just say that this is what Parliament does very well: to enact a piece of legislation which – yes, as Mr Voss said – still has some problems on the research side, on the issue of parental consent. We did not all agree with many of these very difficult issues, but at the end of the day we have a directive and a regulation which is the only one of its kind in the world, and I think for cross-border legislation, that is something of which we should be proud. It comes after four years of negotiation with the Council, and for that it is a major achievement. The regulation gives EU citizens new positive rights, including the ability to know when your data has been hacked, the use of plain language in requests for personal data, the appointment of data protection officers, and the fines – which really were needed, because now people know that this is real legislation that will last and stand the test of time. The data protection directive will complement the regulation by providing new safeguards for all EU citizens and ensuring that protections are in place for the processing of data for law enforcement purposes. For my Group, I am particularly proud that the directive has come with the package. This has meant that we have created a package which has been comprehensive.

It has become vital to our economic and security interests. However, we currently operate under a legal regime that was created before Twitter, Uber and Amazon were twinkles in any billionaire’s eye. My Group and I have at times had serious reservations about the content of these proposals and the direction negotiations took on certain issues, but I hope that, now we are at the end, a pragmatic and workable solution has been put in place. This data protection legislation will only last up to another 20 years, like the last, but if it is capable of establishing technology-neutral and principles-based rules, it will be successful. This regulation is without doubt a comprehensive change to many issues surrounding the processing of data, and the implementation of the regulation is key. What businesses do not want is heavy-handed regulation, and what consumers do not want are complicated rules that give no greater clarity on what their rights are. We – thankfully – ended up with a far more sensible and workable set of ideas, related to consent, fines, notification periods, scientific research, direct marketing in legitimate interests, and derogations for small and medium-sized businesses. These issues were key for my political group, and my hope is that the new rules will increase consumer trust and create a level playing field, legally across the EU, where businesses know exactly what they can and cannot do, which in turn will attract future investment in the digital single market from outside the EU and allow innovation and industry to flourish.

The directive is also very important as the first comprehensive instrument to regulate data protection for law enforcement. This instrument sets rules but allows law enforcement to carry out its duties due to a balance between privacy and security. The package is not perfect, but we have two years of implementation ahead of us. This time is crucial for some points. Firstly, GDPR leaves certain technical issues for the implementing and delegated acts and flexibility for the national solutions. We should make sure that we do not lose the harmonisation and that we will not end up with 28 different frameworks again. Secondly, while implementing GDPR we need to allow innovation to flourish. The use of big data is important for business but also for science and research, and in the end for personalised products and services for us as users. Thirdly, be careful about SMEs and ensure that their obligations are not too excessive. The least we can do is make sure that appropriate guidance is prepared regarding obligations for SMEs.

A package that makes up a legislative framework that represents a step forward in clarifying the fundamental rights to privacy and the protection of citizens' personal data in the European Union and, in fact, globally, in the face of the risks and threats arising from the digitisation of our communications, our behaviour and our economies.  We Socialists have always argued that parallel negotiations were needed because data processing and use by the private sector, but also by the public administration and law enforcement authorities, was at stake. This is the only way to ensure common, clear rules for all Member States to share data, in particular by enabling law enforcement authorities to cooperate effectively in the fight against terrorism.  I have reservations, though. As regards the PNR, by imposition of the Member States, the sharing of information becomes neither compulsory nor automatic, leaving it up to each of them to define what it considers necessary and relevant. This only consolidates mistrust between partners, the reluctance to share information, the inability to act effectively and concertably. Therefore, against the very essence of what was intended with the Directive. We run the risk of ending 28 different NPRs, without coordination, and unsquared a European action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist networks.  Furthermore, the Council is responsible for a significant gap which seriously weakens the system. It rejected Parliament's proposal to include in the PNR the control of private civilian flights, those in which any drug or arms trafficker has no difficulty in travelling, making himself a marchand d'art or not.  Let us be clear: the PNR instrument now regulated by itself will not be effective in combating terrorism and organised crime. Investment in counter-terrorism resources and training is needed. It is above all necessary to commit commitment on the part of the States of the European Union to their agents to commit themselves to the use of existing European mechanisms.

And the PNR, because it is an additional tool in ensuring the security of Europeans against serious threats, against transnational serious crime and against terrorism, without any panacea.

I would like to mention some of the big dilemmas that we had when we were seeking a proper and right balance for our solutions. One of those dilemmas is a big question these days – the dilemma between privacy and security – and many of you mentioned it here today. This is a question that everybody has to reply to personally because it is a very private question: to what extent am I willing to give up my privacy in the interests of being more secure? This is the basic question, and very probably I will answer myself as a person who lived part of my life under a totalitarian regime, when I knew I was being spied on by state police. My reply will probably be different – because I am more sensitive about this – to the reply of the young people sitting over there in the audience who have not had such an experience. Now we are preparing the legislation which will balance this properly for everybody in Europe. This is a really difficult task, and especially these days we must be aware that after every new terrorist attack people will be more and more willing to give up their privacy in the interests of security. That is why we must be so vigilant and careful and protect fundamental rights and the right to privacy. So we are in a situation where we have to let law enforcement bodies act properly, using data in the necessary and proportionate way – and this is the formulation that the Supreme Courts use when identifying the balance and the right of access to data on the part of law enforcement authorities. So we are now in a very sensitive period when we must be especially careful about the protection of privacy and private data. The other dilemma which was also mentioned here, I think by Mr Polčák, concerns the issue of paternalism – whether the individual has to be responsible, or whether he or she should rely on the public sphere to care for his or her protection. I mentioned that the Commission will work very strongly and intensively on guiding people on how to use their new rights. We will always stress that individual people should be the first to care about their privacy and their private data, and we will warn them not to send data to places, especially in digital sphere, where their privacy might be endangered. Then the secondary measure is legislation. There is no legislation which can protect the privacy of people 100%, and we must be clear about that and also educate people in Europe to be and to retain the position of ‘data subjects’ and not to become ‘data objects’ who expect others to protect them. I think this is very important. The third dilemma is between opening and keeping a space for innovation, and protection. You know that the digital sphere in particular is the sphere where technology is driven by the economy, by big business interests, and here we see that the law comes third and is the slowest. So this is what we need to do now, to catch up with this sphere of economy and technology while keeping a free space for innovation which is so necessary for economic growth and filtering out the risks in that sphere for individual people, and to act only there in that sphere of possible risk and to offer the proper instruments to protect people’s privacy. I also admire the fact – and I think it was Mr de Kerchove who mentioned it here – that the directive from 1995 proved to be future-proof. Look at it: it was created before the digital boom, and still we use this directive. But we all know that we need to come up with a new set of rules which will be unified for the whole of Europe, because digital does not like borders and we have the duty to remove borders. Here I come to what you mentioned in relation to the rest of the world. I am convinced that this unified and unique set of rules for the EU will lead to the EU becoming the world leader, setting the standards also for the rest of the world. We will have to review all our adequacy decisions which relate to the transfer of European citizens’ data to third countries. This is the hot topic of today, which some of you mentioned as well, and I would like to use this opportunity to inform you about the position of the Commission on today’s opinion of Working Party 29, because this working party, which brings together the data protection authorities from all the Member States, today published its opinion on the results of our negotiations on the new regime for data transfers to the United States. It was mentioned several times, so I will use this opportunity to give you, for the first time, the Commission’s reaction. I would like to say that, as we understand it, the European data protection authorities, i.e. the Article 29 Working Party, today welcomed the significant improvements that the Commission has obtained in two years of negotiations, leading to the EU/US privacy shield, compared to the old safe harbour framework, especially regarding the transparency of the arrangement and safeguards for national security access. The data protection authorities also mentioned some areas that should be further clarified in the Commission’s draft adequacy decision. So the Commission will now examine the opinion in depth and address the working party’s recommendations in its final decision. I already discussed this with Ms Falque-Pierrotin, Chair of the Article 29 Working Party, when I spoke with her by phone earlier today before this plenary session. One point I can mention is that the Commission will produce a Citizen’s Guide to make sure that individuals have easy-to-understand, practical information on how to obtain redress in case of complaints. The next step is for the Member States to discuss and vote on the privacy shield in a committee of experts, the so-called Article 31 Committee. The first discussion will take place on 29 April. As I said before, my aim is that we can put the new arrangement in place by June. We urgently need strong protections for our citizens whose data is transferred across the Atlantic, and we need legal certainty for the many European companies that carry out transfers to the United States as part of their business operations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2014, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT", "mepid": "28176", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you very much.

I hope that tomorrow’s result is a positive one. We have created a directive which I know is going to save lives, protect rights, catch criminals and make Europe a safer place for our citizens. Throughout this process there has been more than enough finger-pointing, enough games and enough politics, but today I hope to add some facts and the arguments for why I feel we need this instrument – a view shared by governments of all political persuasions and by all law-enforcement authorities across the whole EU. There may be people here in this debate today who still want to vote against this report, but I believe this is the best deal we could have reached. Too often politicians come away from negotiations in possession of a piece of legislation which feels like the lowest common denominator, something they can live with, something which could have been worse. I do not feel that way at all. I can say with my hand on my heart that I am proud of what we will vote on tomorrow. I know that we pushed for sound data-protection provisions which mirrored those of the Data Protection Directive and which provided specific rules for PNR data exchange. I know we allowed for the ECJ judgment on retention to have resonance and to be a meaningful basis for any review. I know that we have retention periods which are proportionate and that we are collecting PNR data to combat a list of crimes which we must prevent and prosecute. Never have the challenges Europe faces been so prevalent, and inevitably the fight against terrorism has become the focus of this directive for many, given its value in combating EU foreign fighters. But I have been urging this Parliament to support PNR for nearly five years, not just because of terrorism but because it tackles the worst and darkest kinds of criminality as well – human trafficking, child trafficking, drug trafficking, paedophiles, murderers and rapists. PNR does not just help bring perpetrators to justice, it can also save people from the horrors that criminality brings. There are many examples from the UK where PNR has helped rescue children and women from a life of exploitation and suffering. PNR is not a hypothetical instrument and the UK has had a system in place for a decade. It works, it saves lives, it puts criminals where they belong: behind bars. To the critics who say we are sacrificing civil liberties in the name of security, let me emphasise that without this PNR Directive there would be no European standards whatsoever specific to PNR, no specific rights of redress, no rules on data retention periods, no rules on who can access the information, no rules on pseudonymising data, no rules on keeping logs , no rules on reviews or compliance with the principles of proportionality and necessity and ECJ rulings. For those who ask why we need a European solution, on this I have listened to the experts, to Europol Director Rob Wainwright, to anti-terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove, and to law-enforcement experts from around Europe. By having a single set of rules at a European level we close the legal loopholes criminals seek to exploit under different legal jurisdictions. By collecting and sharing the same information across the EU we make data comparable and relevant. We cut down the lengthy delays of exchanging information through bilateral agreements, allowing for an expediency which is so vital today in criminal investigations. And to those who say we need mandatory sharing of all information for a centralised EU database, I would say that mandatory exchange of personal data without regard to necessity and proportionality would be contrary to the fundamental principles of data protection. But sharing relevant information with law enforcement agencies in other Member States and with Europol should take place whenever necessary. Irrelevant or unnecessary processing of data would undermine individuals’ rights and will make it more difficult for authorities to prioritise the most relevant and serious cases. But throughout this process I have always welcomed positive contributions from my colleagues.

There is no such thing as a single solution to stop the terrorist threat – but surely it will be a valuable tool. As pointed out by Mr Kirkhope, experience shows us that organised crime and terrorist activities often involve international travel. This includes the smuggling of persons or drugs, as well as access to terrorist training camps outside the EU, with foreign fighters leaving for Syria or Iraq and coming back to the EU. Some Member States already use PNR data according to national legislation. Common EU rules will bring about a level playing field – and to me this is important – a level playing field with more transparent procedures. A directive at EU level will harmonise Member States’ legal provisions and avoid legal uncertainty as well as security gaps, while at the same time safeguarding data protection.

I really count on wide support by this House. This will send a strong message about the contribution of this Parliament to our common efforts to strengthen the European framework in an area that used to be dealt with at the national level only. Let me start by expressing my warmest thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Timothy Kirkhope, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) for their valuable efforts in securing a solid compromise on PNR. All political groups have worked to shape a balanced text addressing our common goal: to have an instrument, a tool, that is effective in preventing and combating terrorism and serious crime. The Commission will be putting pressure on Member States to implement it as soon as possible: we cannot wait for two years. We have no time to lose. We are having this discussion in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Brussels, but we also had it after the two Paris attacks. I truly hope we will not have this discussion in similar circumstances again. The Directive will now put in place a coherent framework for the necessary PNR data exchanges between Member States. This is an essential aspect. The EU PNR will allow our security services to connect dots, to do more complete searches and to identify possible foreign terrorist fighters when they board planes to, in and out of Europe. We will continue supporting the Member States to ensure the national passenger information units are inter-connected. The protection of personal data is fundamental in this framework. We do not want to exchange information at the expense of fundamental rights. The final compromise includes a well-defined purpose limitation: the Directive explicitly lists the offences which justify the use of PNR data; strict data access; limitations on onward transfers of data: the conditions for sharing PNR data with other national and foreign authorities are strict and clearly defined; limited retention period: data is masked out after six months; prohibition of sensitive data: such data must be deleted immediately upon receipt; and oversight: the processing of data is supervised internally by a data protection officer and, externally, by an independent supervisory authority. With these elements, the European Union’s PNR Directive strikes the right balance between security and privacy. Let me now turn to the external dimension of PNR policy. Parliament decided to seek the opinion of the Court of Justice on the draft PNR agreement with Canada. This opinion will be critical in setting the legal parameters for any future PNR agreement between the European Union and third countries. Based on the EU PNR Directive, our Member States will collect PNR data from flights coming from third countries. As a result, it is expected that an increasing number of third countries will request PNR data from EU air carriers. We therefore need to have a coherent approach to PNR requests from third countries. The Commission plans to present its ideas on this subject after the Court of Justice has delivered its opinion on the draft PNR Agreement with Canada. In any event, the EU PNR Directive will set a standard which will have to be followed by any future legal instruments regulating the transfer of PNR data to third countries. And it will help us a lot in the fight against terrorism. Of course, by itself it will not solve all our problems with terrorism. Much more needs to happen, such as better information exchange, better implementation of the tools we have in place and tackling the roots of radicalisation. It is, however, an important and very useful instrument, which, together with other tools, will strengthen our position in preventing terrorist attacks and dismantling criminal networks. That is why coming to an agreement on this proposal today is so important. In the wake of the tragedies in Brussels, this is a good example of joint operational action to ensure the security of our citizens. PNR is one critical tool, and we will need all the tools we have at our disposal. Let us continue in the same way for all other pending proposals on the table.

Many of you tell us that the PNR would not have prevented the attacks in Brussels and Paris. I find this argument, to put it bluntly, very questionable and almost indecent, because no one is in a position to say exactly what could have prevented or not the attacks in Paris and Brussels, knowing that the networks that fomented them have not yet been completely dismantled. If we find in the future any evidence to say that, on the traceability of a particular suspect, we could have intervened thanks to the PNR, many of us will regret having procrastinated so much.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The directive on the storage of passenger data will also be adopted tomorrow by a large majority of my group. I understand and respect this decision and would like to express my thanks to all my group colleagues for their commitment. However, I myself cannot agree with this text. In 2005, data retention was adopted under the influence of the Madrid and London attacks. The European Court of Justice declared them to be contrary to fundamental rights in 2014. Indiscriminate mass surveillance without differentiation by geographical area or period is incompatible with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. But that is precisely what the text now before us will do through the storage of European passenger data. And as a reminder, yes, the agreement with Australia was widely supported here, including mine. For the US, support was already much lower. A first attempt at a European directive failed in the last mandate, and the Canadian agreement is currently before the European Court of Justice. At an oral hearing last week, experts there were highly critical of the indiscriminate monitoring of passengers. Terrorism and organised crime know no borders. Security policy must therefore be designed as a common European challenge. However, the focus of many actors on data collection misses the core problem of European security policy. We have many instruments, but the Member States are not prepared or unable to work together with confidence to protect our citizens and to exchange relevant information in good time.

I agree with all those who say we need to deliver whatever is necessary and proportionate to get a higher level of security – but what is proposed here? The proposed blanket mass surveillance of all travellers is exactly the opposite of that. It does not deliver that. Instead, you are delivering a symbolic measure at the cost of effective security and the civil liberties of EU citizens. Even before the Brussels and Paris attacks it was possible to know who was travelling on which plane. We already know that. For decades we have had airlines transferring advance passenger information data. It is there, we can access it and we can know who is on which plane. In the case of known suspects – and 15 out of 17 attackers from several attacks, in Brussels, Copenhagen and Paris, have been known suspects – we can follow them and collect more information. So why are we not focusing on those known suspects? Why do we not focus on the risk? That is what we should do in this directive, because that would be a focused and effective approach towards more security. We need to strengthen the capacity of police officers and security personnel locally, regionally and at European level to analyse this information. We need to be able to connect the dots. That is exactly what has been missing in the past and what has led to the insecure situation we have today. But the problem is that we are spending all our money on blanket surveillance measures like data retention of passenger name records. This money is instead urgently needed for the police everywhere in Europe and for the coordination of European security and police authorities. Europol has just a small amount of money to set up joint investigation teams. We need to invest the money there. That is what we need to do. So we Greens are not convinced by these proposals, and many people out there are not either. The Court of Justice, as well as the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg, has clearly and repeatedly said that it is not in line with our fundamental rights and freedoms to just put everybody under surveillance. You have to choose where you are looking. You have to choose who you are going after. You have to create some determining criteria and indicate where the risk or suspicion is.

Firstly, those who vote for PNR vote in favour of common European rules, they vote in favour of common data protection standards, and they are voting in favour of more and coordinated cooperation and against 28 completely uncoordinated systems that are not even technically interoperable. Secondly, PNR is an instrument against many types of serious crime. It is not the miracle instrument against terrorism, but it is directed against many of the most serious crimes that our people will suffer. Thirdly, there is only limited access to the data. It is definitely wrong to say that people's data is being viewed en masse here. Targeted search algorithms are sent through. Welcome to the age of modern technology! We are no longer in 1960, but we are in 2016. We must give the police and the security institutions modern technology in their hands, in order to be able to fight against the modern technology of criminals. There is special training for experts, only specific processes may be entered into the data and more than 99% of the data are never consulted.

There is an established monitoring mechanism with a strong position for the data protection authorities, and a list of serious crimes.

Needlessly, more than 100 people had to be killed and hundreds injured. For me as a legislator, this is the terrifying cost of not having the political will to make a decision. The Directive does not in itself prevent future terrorist attacks, but is an important component in the overall package of counter-terrorism measures. The presence of foreign fighters requires law enforcement to have a complete picture of who crosses the air borders so that they can take the necessary measures before carrying out the attacks. The latest developments in the Paris investigation also demonstrate why Member States have taken the right decision to include intra-European Union flights within the scope of the Directive – ensuring security in Europe requires measures within the European Union, not just at the external borders. I believe that the Directive will facilitate cooperation and, in particular, the exchange of information between Member States, which we have been talking about for so long in the context of the fight against terrorism.

Madam President, thank you, first of all, for your views and comments. I am now looking forward to tomorrow’s vote. Let me reiterate that the PNR Directive is a key tool in our toolbox to enhance the safety and security of our citizens. The political compromise reached last December manages to find the right balance between security and fundamental rights. Concerns as to whether the directive will sufficiently ensure the exchange of information between Member States have been raised. I find that the directive now provides for the sharing of all relevant and necessary PNR data. We allow the law-enforcement authorities to judge what needs to be shared, while ensuring that strong data protection safeguards are in place. Mrs in ’t Veld submitted a request in March 2014 for access to these documents and she was given access. The Commission will of course provide, upon request, all available information on the implementation of the EU co-funded national PNR projects. I hope that Parliament will now act quickly so as to allow the entry into force of the directive as soon as possible. Once adopted, we need to immediately start its implementation.

I do just want to say that I hope that we will be able to get support tomorrow. I would urge people not to support the amendments that have been put down by Groups, because we are dealing with a package of measures here which I hope we can put through as they now are on the table.

I make no apology to say that some of my constituents want more evidence of where there is added value. Frankly, this is timely. It may have taken five years, but our security and our cooperation in the fight against criminality is something that I strongly believe does add value to our membership. As has been said, it is not just a question of dealing with terrorists or threats of terrorism, important though that is; it is also dealing with all the other major criminal areas: people trafficking, child trafficking, trafficking in drugs, and all the other things that are so important that we should be working together to tackle them. So I am asking everybody to vote for this tomorrow, of course, but I think it will also give a message to our citizens that we really do care about them.

But just as we have many shared interests, we also face many common challenges. This has been particularly highlighted by the migration crisis, and President Tusk reported to you on this earlier today. As you know, accession negotiations are ongoing. We opened the latest chapter – Chapter 17 – in December last year and plan to open Chapter 33 with Turkey in the coming months. And let me underline that in this context, we continue to work within the framework of our existing rules for the accession process, by unanimity, sticking to strict but fair conditionality and without creating any shortcuts. From the Commission’s report it is clear that Turkey has registered progress in many fields of the acquis, and that is good news. It is, however, equally clear that many current domestic developments and worrying events in Turkey give cause for serious concern. Turkey needs to urgently remedy and address major shortcomings, notably in the areas of the rule of law and fundamental rights. The Council has called on Turkey to ensure full respect for human rights, in particular to take urgent steps to work on reversing the undermining of the independence and the impartiality of the judiciary and the significant backsliding in the area of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. These are indeed important and pressing issues, which were also duly highlighted in your resolution. As reiterated by the European Council in March, we expect Turkey to respect the highest standards. In our contacts with Turkey we also take every opportunity to recall these concerns.

It addresses the key issues of EU-Turkey relations and generally concurs with the Commission’s findings in its 2015 enlargement package and the report on Turkey. In the current context of the migration and refugee crisis, the geopolitical situation in the region and many interests jointly shared by the EU and Turkey, it is crucial to further reinvigorate and strengthen our cooperation with this strategic partner. Naturally our relations have recently focused on the migration challenge, but they do and should continue to encompass a much broader range of issues to enable us to tap the full potential of this relationship. The re-energised accession process remains the core of our relations. We share your hope that the opening of chapters will lead to concrete progress in Turkey. In line with the EU-Turkey agreement of 18 March, the Commission is currently working on a proposal to the Council to open accession negotiations on financial and budgetary provisions. We are also preparing for the opening of further chapters, including in crucial areas of the judiciary and fundamental rights, as well as justice, freedom and security. We are doing this without prejudice to the positions of Member States and in accordance with the negotiating framework. In this context, the Commission is encouraged by the progress in the Cyprus settlement talks and we look forward to their successful and swift conclusion. We count on Turkey’s lasting and concrete contribution to such a comprehensive settlement. It would be very good news for Europe and for the security and stability of the region and would also contribute to a major turning point for our accession negotiations with Turkey. Let me also thank you for your strong support for structured and more frequent high-level dialogues. The recent high-level political dialogue and high-level energy dialogue have proved to be successful formats to move forward with our joint agenda with Turkey. A high-level economic dialogue on 25 and 26 April will increase EU-Turkey business contacts and will allow an open discussion on macroeconomic issues, economic policy and investment opportunities. As already discussed in the morning, our comprehensive cooperation agenda with Turkey on migration has started to produce the first results towards achieving our goal of ending the irregular migration from Turkey to the EU and breaking the pattern of refugees and migrants risking their lives. The Commission shares the European Parliament’s concern about respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in Turkey. These concerns have been exacerbated by recent worrying developments, including those targeting the freedom of speech of academics, trials of prominent journalists and decisions affecting private assets in the media sector. We have repeatedly called on the Turkish Government to re-engage in reforms in line with European standards and to actively consult all stakeholders. We believe that defining the opening benchmarks and working with Turkey towards the opening of Chapters 23 and 24 will significantly contribute to Turkey’s renewed commitment and the reform efforts in these fields. The European Union also continues to voice its concerns about the serious situation in the south-east of Turkey. A genuine political dialogue in the framework of the Kurdish settlement process is the only way to achieve a peaceful and sustainable solution. The Union remains ready to support such a process. To conclude, the Commission is fully confident about the benefits of the increased cooperation with Turkey to address the immigration crisis and to deepen our relations in many other areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2094, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Kati PIRI", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. –  Madam President, today the EU and Turkey are facing many of the same challenges. Think about the refugee crisis, the threat of terrorism, and a long-lasting conflict in Syria that creates instability. One thing that has been made clear through these challenges is that Turkey and the EU need each other to find solutions to combat these issues. However, and I want to stress this, we cannot turn a blind eye to the internal developments in the country. Turkey must be stable and more democratic if we want it to be a strategic partner we can build on. Linking the accession process to migration cooperation is neither wise nor fair. Accelerating talks should depend on the pace of the reforms, not on a political tit-for-tat. A lot has already been said this morning on the EU-Turkey deal, so I will just briefly say: the Turkish population has been hosting three million refugees. Many European countries could learn from the hospitality shown in this regard by the Turks. But Turkey is reaching its limits, and it is time that the EU really reached out to help by providing large-scale resettlement of refugees to EU countries. That is genuine burden-sharing; that is genuine cooperation. Many chances to further connect and work together have been missed in recent years. Let our current talks on migration lead to a more intensified and honest dialogue. This means that genuine concerns should not be taken as insults. The situation in the south-east of the country is of great concern to this Parliament. The EU urges that the peace process be relaunched as there is no military solution to the Kurdish question. The current status quo is unacceptable. While we deeply regret the return to violence by the PKK and strongly condemn the attacks against security forces and civilians, we stress, however, that anti-terrorism measures taken by the government must be proportionate and in line with international law. The 400 000 citizens who had to flee their houses because of the violence and the 24-hour curfews in many Kurdish-populated cities have put a very heavy toll on the livelihood of ordinary people. We believe that Turkey has to return to a path where journalists are not imprisoned for doing their jobs and censorship does not become an instinct for journalists. Turkey has to return to a path where academics are not losing their jobs and put in jail for expressing their views. Finally, Turkey has to return to a path where judges do not hesitate to decide and to give a verdict out of fear of being displaced or fired. We need a more stable and democratic Turkey. This is not a threat but an encouragement. It is important that Turkey returns to the path of democratic reforms and grasps this opportunity of closer engagement with the EU. Finally, let me also thank my colleagues and co-rapporteurs for the good cooperation. I hope that we can send a strong signal from this Parliament with this resolution.

We had agreed to be largely guided by last year's resolution, which was essentially successful and which simplified the negotiations somewhat. That is why I do not understand, Kati, that you now only want to keep a certain agreement when the PPE-DE takes over the Socialists' voting list as its own. This is not being done, and the PPE-DE cannot be put under pressure, either by another group or by a wave of refugees. Our task here is to use this resolution to assess Turkey's internal state, with a view to bringing the country closer to the European Union. We must not mix this up with the refugee crisis, however difficult it is. It is therefore important for us to emphasise that there can be no discounts for Turkey. This applies to visa liberalisation, for which all the conditions must still be met. The opening of negotiating chapters must, of course, continue to be linked to Turkey's fulfilment of the relevant conditions. The country is a long way from that: freedom of the press and freedom of expression, freedom of assembly severely restricted, state interference in the judiciary, Kurdish conflict, escalation of violence in the south-east – in fact, only regression. If we want to continue to be good and reliable neighbours in the future, if we want to continue to develop our special neighbourly cooperation, then we must once again talk to each other and also negotiate. But this will only be possible if Turkey takes the European path again. And, of course, the chapters relating to the Republic of Cyprus can never be opened before a solution to the Cyprus question. Turkey must play a more constructive role in this. It must finally recognise the Republic of Cyprus and help it to develop into a reunited state on the basis of European values and principles.

There is virtually no one who still seriously and honestly believes that Turkey can one day join the European Union.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Kati Piri, on her excellent and productive cooperation throughout the discussions. I think, at the same time, that the situation in Turkey far outweighs the debate we are having here on the report. A report which, to a great many, reflects reality.  There are already around 300,000 displaced people in southeastern Turkey. Much of the city of Sor has been completely abandoned. Much of it has been confiscated, expropriated. In fact, they took the fortunes of 60,000 people. Academics and journalists are prosecuted simply for speaking freely. On 22 April, a week from now, these people are being tried in Istanbul and I have already been asked by the accused to attend and watch the trial as observers.  We call on Turkey to immediately enter into a dialogue to resolve the Kurdish issue and to stop persecuting freedom of expression. Deleting and deleting the PKK from the European Union's list of terrorist organisations will help.  The report contains very positive reports on the Cyprus issue, including the report that the solution will be an evolution of the Republic of Cyprus. So far, however, it contains at least indirect reports of the opening of funds, which we disagree with, since Turkey has not implemented any obligations it has undertaken.  On the Cyprus issue, while positive reports are welcomed by Turkish officials, we are obliged to say that these reports have not been translated into action at the negotiating table.

The President who, I repeat, tramples on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of Christians, the rights of the Kurds more than anyone else, or even more so, who is fighting them with brutal police violence, who is waging war in his country against his own people and in his neighbouring country, this man is now seen as the saviour of the EU. Is this not the ultimate oath of revelation by the European Union? How has it always been said about a crisis: we need \"more EU\"! And now it is no longer working with 'more EU', and now it is said to the crisis: we need 'more Turkey'. It's creepy.  Anyone who opens the EU's doors to Turkey is softening European values. I quote Mr Erdogan: 'Democracy is only the train we are on until we reach our destination. The mosques are our barracks, the minarets our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers our soldiers.\"  Let's wake up before it's too late!

Secondly, we support the reunification of Cyprus, which is not supported by our very colleagues in Cyprus. Have we forgotten that Turkey occupied Greek Cyprus? Is it right that we interfere drastically in their internal affairs? Third, the agreement with Turkey is completely unacceptable. The European Parliament is silent about the disregard for the rule of law and the violation of fundamental rights in exchange for questionable cooperation with Ankara on refugees. It's pure hypocrisy. Can't you see that Turkey itself organizes and directs refugee flows and that it sabotages and bends the hands of the European Union.

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Thank you again for this enlightening debate. I believe that everyone here here agrees on one thing today, namely that Turkey is a strategic partner for the European Union. This is due to the geostrategic situation, which is the number of inhabitants. It is therefore obvious that the European Union has a very vital interest in seeking a sensible form of cooperation here. It is clear that cooperation with Turkey has its ups and downs. But it is also clear that this cooperation must be a very comprehensive one. And the situation of interest with Turkey is multifaceted. It is, for example– and has hardly been mentioned today – a very important economic one, because Europe is by far Turkey's most important economic and investment partner. We have around 600 000 employees in Europe who work for Turkish companies. Turkey is Europe's sixth most important partner. So here it is necessary to find a sensible form of cooperation. That is why, for example, the upgrading of the Customs Union is an important task, which we have been devoting ourselves intensively to for over a year and a half. The current challenge surrounding the refugee crisis has given this form of cooperation a new impetus, and it is quite obvious. We have developed an action plan which includes a wide range of elements. Visa liberalisation is an issue and visa liberalisation has already been on the agenda. It was and is about speeding up this issue. But visa liberalisation does not mean that the next step is automatically accession, as is sometimes assumed. After all, we have visa liberalisation with many countries around the world. Nevertheless, no one comes up with the idea that this country can become a member. On the other hand, yes, we have a mandate from the European Council to hold accession negotiations here. This has been an open mandate since 2005. We are called upon to conduct these negotiations and to reach a result, because the mandate says that open-ended negotiations must be conducted. And, frankly, my professional ambition is that such negotiations must be brought to an end. Then an assessment can be made, unless we come to the conclusion that these negotiations are to be interrupted or broken off. I have often heard today how important it is to address and take into account the principles of the rule of law in Turkey and to ensure that they are guaranteed. However, I can also tell you that this is only possible if we have accession negotiations, because only then will we have a lever, because only then can we demand something. It is a qualitative difference whether I am negotiating accession or whether I deal with my neighbour and identify commonalities. At the moment, we have the task, the obligation, as the Commission, to fulfil this task. I have therefore noted with interest what Count Lambsdorff and others have said. However, as I said, this is something that is not the object of our task at the moment, but is the object of our task to implement our mandates, to ensure that we have stability in the region. And I believe that this can only be guaranteed by the fact that we have a very close network of cooperation with Turkey. This can also ensure that, for example, the current refugee problem can be adequately addressed and resolved. I can also tell you on this occasion that the Turkey facility has already started. The occasional statement from Turkey that she has not yet seen a penny is simply not true. It is true in that we do not pay turkey, but we finance projects in Turkey which serve to ensure the additional costs and expenses of Turkey in terms of accommodation, food and schooling and to make a significant contribution to ensuring that the refugees have a chance to stay in the region, especially in eastern Turkey. to return immediately to Syria, if security and the political situation allow. That is why our expenditure is focused on the fact that we are using the funds accordingly, primarily in eastern Anatolia. In this respect, initial activities have started. We have ensured, with around EUR 55 million, that 350 000 people will have food for at least half a year. With EUR 40 million, we can already ensure that 200 000 children can attend school for one year. These are exactly the things that essential. We should focus on this, and they also help to improve mutual trust between Turkey and Europe, hopefully. There is no question that there is sand in the gearbox here, so to speak. But between partners, between neighbours, it is necessary to have a trusting relationship. We should be interested in this together. And how things develop in the future is simply the result of the negotiations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2151, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT", "mepid": "28176", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I am very happy to be here. Let me first of all thank you very much for this very interesting debate and also for the timely exchange of views, which demonstrates that we in many respects share both many hopes and concerns with regard to Turkey. It is important in my view to remember that the EU and Turkey share many ties and that our relationship goes back way longer than the current migration crisis. Closer cooperation is good for both Turkey and the EU, and the EU was and will continue to be an important anchor for Turkey’s political and economic reforms. To be clear, as has been mentioned several times, we are not linking migration and accession talks. These are separate issues. As we have set out, we are aware of existing shortcomings and we share your concerns about negative trends in the areas of rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are firm and we are clear about this. Let me stress once more that we continue to follow these and other developments such as the situation in the south-east closely, and that we will continue to bring up our concerns in all our meetings and at all levels with Turkey. On the issue of visa liberalisation, the Commissioner already touched upon this: there will be no shortcut. As we have agreed in our common statement with Turkey, visa requirements for Turkish citizens can be lifted by the end of June this year provided that all benchmarks have been met. Whether that will materialise, of course, depends on Turkey and the progress it makes. A few words in closing on the 18 March agreement. In my view the agreement has the potential to be a major step towards finding a viable and legal European solution to the migration crisis. It is not going to be a silver bullet. It is not going to be a magic solution, but it is a step in the right direction and an important instrument. This will be done in accordance with the relevant international standards and by respecting the principle of non-refoulement. It is not plain sailing – we are all aware of this, and we are not outsourcing our problems. It is still too early to assess the concrete effects of this agreement, as the concrete measures to implement it only became truly operational as of 4 April.

It was not rejected at the time, but the European Community institutions declared at the time that Turkey must first implement a number of fundamental reforms. Since then, this wording has been repeated in relation to Turkey. The peculiarity of Turkish society since the days of Mustafa Kemal Pash (Ataturk) has always been the strict separation of state and church, the guarantor of which has always been the army. If the military considered that a party was too religiously focused, that party was abolished. So the Islamist AKP has many predecessors. Only today's Turkish President has managed to break this tradition, and the consequence is, unfortunately, the gradual Islamization of Turkish society. Corruption in the judicial system has not disappeared, tolerance of non-Islamic religions has not improved, the rights of national minorities have stagnated, the war against the Kurds is continuing, the women's rights movement has also not made a decision.

Turkey has repeatedly tried to raise its status since joining the membership negotiations, and since 2005 has been conducting accession negotiations that stalled from 2013 until the start of this major refugee-migration crisis.

These are positive signals, showing that Albania is on the right path, and we encourage it to continue these efforts. In addition, we welcome the adoption of the decriminalisation legislation which should enhance citizens’ trust in their political representatives and public institutions. We now look forward to concrete steps and results for its effective implementation. At the same time, I would like to stress that significant challenges lie ahead and further efforts to fulfil the key priorities are still needed. In particular, it will now be essential to swiftly adopt the judicial reform package in line with the Venice Commission’s opinion. Judicial reform is key to further forward movement on Albania’s EU accession process. Progress is also needed to fight corruption as well as organised crime. A solid track record of proactive investigations, prosecutions and final convictions, at all levels, needs to be established. Let me also reiterate the need for effective legislative and policy measures to reinforce the protection of human rights and anti-discrimination policies, including the equal treatment of all minorities. As you know, the European Council will consider the opening of accession negotiations once Albania has met the five key priorities. The Council has invited the Commission to report on these key priorities in a comprehensive and detailed manner in addition to its 2016 report. Let me underline that a constructive and sustainable dialogue between the government and the opposition on EU-related reforms will be vital for the success of these endeavours. I would like to commend Albania on its full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy.

The resolution not only captures the progress that Albania has made over the past months but also the challenges that lie ahead in order to move the country closer to the European Union. I particularly welcome the emphasis that this resolution places on the reform of the justice system. This will help to embed the rule of law in the country. Strengthening efficiency and professionalism throughout this sector while striking the right balance between independence and accountability is a key challenge. As the resolution has emphasised, the preparatory work carried out so far on this important dossier is rather solid. Political parties should now engage in a decisive, constructive dialogue and finalise the reform. This is a long-overdue development that is in the interest of all citizens. Adapting to judicial reform is a crucial opportunity for the country as a whole which is too precious to be subject to any party political manoeuvring. I expect constructive cross-party cooperation from both the ruling majority and the opposition, as this reform should be seen by all political actors as a win-win opportunity. The last mile is always the hardest, especially when we are in the final stage of a very comprehensive and slow reform process. But this is a path worth completing. I made this point very clearly during my recent visit to Tirana for the high-level dialogue on the five key priorities for the opening of accession negotiations. Negotiations opened at the end of March. Let me also point out that, beyond judicial reform, the resolution also provides a clear review of progress on other matters related to the rule of law, in particular the fight against organised crime and corruption. Albania needs to demonstrate further progress with a view to establishing a solid track record of investigations, prosecutions and convictions in the fight against organised crime and corruption at all levels. High-level corruption needs to be tackled more effectively. The same goes for the challenge posed by organised crime. More results are needed to dismantle organised criminal networks that operate locally, regionally and globally. I would also like to commend the emphasis that the resolution attaches to a number of processes that fall outside the scope of the five key priorities but are nevertheless crucial to consolidate the credibility of the state and its institutions. Albania urgently needs to finalise the reform of the electoral system, aligning all the relevant legislation to the recommendations issued by the OSCE/ODIHR. Moreover, integrity throughout the public sector needs to be further strengthened. A lot has been achieved already through ongoing public administration reform. In addition, the process of so-called decriminalisation needs to advance. Both civil servants and elected officials should be subject to the scrutiny mechanism foreseen in the law, and sanctions applied whenever necessary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Albania has undergone an astonishing transformation over the last 25 years. From a communist dictatorship cut off from all its neighbours to a country with a free society committed to democracy and the social market economy, to a country that has built constructive relations with its neighbours and is on its way to the European Union.  The majority of people in Albania regularly express their desire in surveys to further strengthen the rule of law in their country. This includes an independent judiciary that is not impressed by attempts to influence. This includes a professional public administration that is accessible to every citizen and is fairly managed and violent. This includes the successful prevention and prosecution of corruption and organised crime.  The Albanian Government and the Albanian Parliament have set out to adopt a particularly ambitious judicial reform. They have therefore also consulted with international experts, including the Venice Commission. This judicial reform must now be adopted by the Albanian Parliament as soon as possible. Its implementation must be put in place, so that Albania can unequivocally demonstrate, through its self-determined objective, that it is on the right track.  The large majority that was in favour of the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs shows that we are very much in agreement: we want to encourage Albania to maintain the momentum of reform so far and to press ahead with the reforms ambitiously or even more ambitiously. We say: Keep it that way! But we know that much remains to be done, much has not yet been achieved.  The Minister, the Commissioner have mentioned a number of things in terms of electoral laws, corruption and the economy.

I hope that once the reform is adopted it opens doors to the further integration of Albania into the EU. At the same time we also have to look realistically at other areas such as the fight against corruption, public administration reform, media or ongoing electoral reform, the last of which will be particularly important for the upcoming 2017 elections. I hope that the political parties will find a consensus on the reform. Implementation of the OSC/OD recommendation is the key.

In foreign policy terms, Albania has met a small part of the political criteria for membership of the European Union and this is clearly noted in the report we are debating today. However, we need to continue, call on and encourage the country's leading political forces for a more constructive and sustainable political dialogue between them on European Union-related reforms. Political consensus on vital reforms is essential for the country's further progress, and confrontation can undermine this process. The report clearly outlines the challenges Albania faces and some of the positive steps the government has taken to address them. Serious efforts need to be made to reform the judiciary. The country has shown political will to fight corruption, which together with organised crime remains the biggest problem facing Albania. These vices of the young democracies of the Balkans erode statehood. On economic reforms, the government has continued its work, but constructive reforms need to be accelerated. As a result of the low competitiveness of the economy, unemployment remains high and the grey sector occupies an essential part.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the accession path of Albania, a state which according to all statistics is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a real per capita income of EUR 280 and unemployment of 18%.  In addition, the country is plagued by serious problems of corruption and political polarisation. It is for these reasons that, while we support the country's accession process and the will of its citizens to join the Union, we disagree with the policies promoted by the Union in that country. We disagree with the economic and social policies being promoted. What is needed is an open and frank dialogue with the representatives of the country about the specifics of this country.

There is no doubt that an independent judiciary is a cornerstone of the country's progress towards the EU and the reforms needed to achieve such a judicial system, as prescribed by the Venice Commission, must happen with political will, civil support and EU assistance. No less important are the other reforms on the 5 key priorities – the electoral system, free media, transparent public administration and the strengthening of fundamental civil rights and freedoms.

And let me mention the adoption of the reform agenda and its accompanying action plan last year in particular. The Council has reinforced Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU perspective in its conclusions of December 2015. At the same time, it has underlined that meaningful progress in the implementation of the reform agenda is necessary for the EU to consider a membership application. I would therefore like to encourage the authorities to continue the necessary reforms and to consolidate progress – in particular in the area of the rule of law, including the fight against corruption and organised crime, the reform of public administration and socio-economic reforms.  The functionality of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s institutions remains a priority. Moreover, a functioning coordination mechanism on EU matters will be essential for the country to be able to face the challenges ahead on its EU path. The adaptation of the stabilisation and association agreement following the accession of Croatia will allow Bosnia and Herzegovina to normalise its trade relations with the Union. It is, moreover, an important element of the country’s commitment to the EU integration process. Let me commend in this respect the ongoing progress in the current negotiations. The Council will refer to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU membership application in due course.  First of all, Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to deliver concrete and irreversible results in the reform process. When requesting the Commission’s opinion on the membership application, the Council will ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the implementation of the Sejdić—Finci ruling of the European Court of Human Rights. I would also like to reiterate the Council’s serious concern about preparations for holding an entity—level referendum on the state—level judiciary in Republika Srpska. Such a referendum would challenge the cohesion, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Outstanding shortcomings in the country’s judiciary should be addressed with the structured dialogue on justice.  We expect the authorities at all levels to ensure that the challenges the country faces are addressed constructively, in a spirit of dialogue and mutual understanding. It is now central for Bosnia and Herzegovina to seize the momentum gained so far and to keep working hard.

We welcome the text, which is balanced and largely in line with the Commission’s November 2015 report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. It reflects well the state of play in that country, notably when it comes to being back on the reform track and starting to address the outstanding issues on its European Union integration path.  I welcome the support this resolution provides for the renewed EU approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular the focus on socio-economic rule of law and public administration reforms, as adopted by Bosnia and Herzegovina under the July 2015 reform agenda.  In addition, I welcome Parliament’s call for Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure that it has an effective coordination mechanism on Union matters in place as well as to adapt the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) following the accession of Croatia to the European Union.  The Commission is fully dedicated to advancing Bosnia and Herzegovina’s European Union perspective. First, the SAA which entered into force in June 2015 is a springboard for deep reforms in that country. In this context, in December 2015 we successfully held SAA Council and SAA Committee meetings. In cooperation with international financial institutions we are closely following the implementation of the comprehensive reform agenda, which once again started in July 2015. This has resulted in the adoption of a number of key pieces of legislation and strategies and implementation has already started. I expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to further implement the reform agenda, not only as a key condition for the country on its path to the Union but also in the best interests of its citizens. This includes the dissemination of the 2013 population census results. Together with the High Representative, Vice-President Mogherini, we have taken note of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for European Union membership submitted to the European Council Presidency in February.  This is a renewed commitment from this country to decisively advance towards the European Union, deliver on the necessary reforms and meet its citizens’ aspirations for a more prosperous future. The country is also participating in the connectivity agenda and I would expect it to be a closer partner when discussing measures for youth, particularly against the backdrop of massive youth employment – and we are talking here about a youth unemployment rate of 55%.  To conclude, I would like to stress that I witnessed a positive dynamic during my latest visit to Sarajevo two weeks ago. The European Union initiative was launched in December 2014. This initiative has shown that Bosnia and Herzegovina can deliver. At the same time, outstanding challenges remain and need to be seriously addressed, including through the further implementation of the reform agenda. This will require the EU to remain fully engaged in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to support the country in delivering on its priorities in close cooperation with international and local stakeholders such as the international financial institutions and civil society organisations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2191, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

The report you presented in November 2015 is also better than before, and proves that the new European approach is working very well. But the most important proof of progress is the filing by Bosnia and Herzegovina of its application for membership on 15 February, an impossible act a year ago and which was not foreseen by the Dutch Presidency. It should be noted that it has not devoted a single word to enlargement in its programme for the six months of 2016. Moreover, she does not seem to be interested in this subject. In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have reached a very broad consensus on the need to support this country. We welcome the application for membership and call on the Council to review it as soon as possible and send it to the Commission quickly in order to begin the preparation of the opinion. In order for this to be possible, Bosnia and Herzegovina must make the coordination mechanism on European affairs operational and adapt the Association and Stabilization Agreement, as you also indicated, Commissioner, during your last visit to Sarajevo. We also call on the authorities to continue on the path of reforms for the benefit of citizens, in terms of the economic situation, but also to pursue political reforms. The fight against corruption, the independence of the judiciary, the reform of public administration, the fight against terrorism, respect for freedom of expression and the media must be a priority.  2016 is an election year in Bosnia, but I call on the authorities to remain focused on the objective of European integration and to act decisively so that the date they have mentioned, namely 2017, for obtaining candidate status, is respected.  With regard to the Dutch Presidency, I believe that working faster on Bosnia's candidacy would be an excellent response to the referendum you suffered a week ago. That would be a real European response, instead of retreating and being soft and shy in front of our opponents.  Do something for Bosnia, and you will gain support for the European Netherlands and for a united Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2192, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Afzal KHAN", "mepid": "124962", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, over the past year, Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken steady steps on its European path. Twenty years after the end of the Bosnian war the country presented its EU membership application. It was a welcome step forward, and we call on the Council to examine this application at the earliest opportunity and to forward it without delay to the Commission in order to start the preparation of the avis.  How Bosnia progresses should be of importance to the EU as we seek to bring stability and prosperity to our neighbourhood. Euro-Atlantic integration remains the best hope for a stable and prosperous Bosnia. It will be a long journey for the country but it is an important one. Many outstanding issues remain, however. Addressing the socioeconomic problems is an immediate priority. We must keep the government accountable for public administration reform and support initiatives improving economic growth and social justice in Bosnia. That is what ordinary Bosnians want and need. I am particularly concerned about the nationalistic rhetoric that still dominates Bosnian politics. We must be firm against those who attempt to promote secession and undermine judicial and state institutions. Also worrying is the most recent case law and practice of the Bosnian state court and state prosecutor’s office. As part of the structural dialogue on justice, we must work hard to further professionalise and depoliticise these institutions. If we do not ensure respect for the rule of law, backed by a credible judiciary, all our other efforts will fail.  Constitutional change will also eventually be needed for the country to transform it into a fully functional, democratic and inclusive state.

First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Preda for his excellent report and for his work in promoting the European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina in general. Likewise to the Commission, mr. Hahn, on very persistent work on the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the other five countries in the Western Balkans.  On behalf of the ALDE Group, I welcome the steps bosnia and herzegovina has made so far, among which it is certainly most striking to submit applications for membership in the European Union. Bosnia and Herzegovina's path to the European Union has so far been slow and very complicated. It's probably going to stay that way, but it's important that it continues. It is not clear what Bosnia will look like at the end of this journey and this report does not provide answers to some key questions such as constitutional changes, the structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only the requirements in principle, i.e. expectations, are made, but neither is the Task of the European Parliament at the moment to provide solutions and answers to these very complicated questions.  How demanding bosnia and herzegovina's path is is shown by two examples. The first is the coordination mechanism, which is the most complicated that any country has had on the road to the European Union, and the second is just one example from the joint action plan, i.e. a reform plan that talks about budget consolidation, public spending cuts, restrictions on pension, social and health costs, which is demanding for each country, and for Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular. And this is probably not the most difficult task either, and that is why it is important to continue internal communication, to seek common solutions.

The Bosnians took to the streets asking to be treated as citizens, not figures, in an ethnic census; called for more employment and less national pride.

Bosnia has been, is and will be a very hard nut to be in the future of the European Union. And it is clear that she will have to solve the biggest problems above all. Here, of course, the European Union and the European Parliament can help Twenty years from Dayton, we talked about whether it is time to think about how to move forward, whether the status quo and status quo is the only one that can bring Bosnia a step forward, even in terms of greater economic development, lower unemployment, which seriously threatens the stay in Bosnia, and also the brain drain, many young people are looking for jobs elsewhere, outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, even in groups that are not the most, I will say positive.

It is clear that there are also some signs in this resolution that may be positive, and of course we also miss the judgment of Sejdić and Finns, which we consider very important, which is actually based on the position of the European Court of Human Rights and means that Bosnia must assume its duty to tackle the border issue and also recognise equality for those who do not belong to these so-called three entities.

The result is a high-quality and objective progress report on Bosnia and Herzegovina in the past year, which in many respects was special for the country. A year ago, a written commitment was signed by all leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the readiness for reforms, which, after years of delay, resulted in the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in June. Bosnia and Herzegovina formally concluded its year of progress by submitting its candidacy for full membership. I see this as an important contribution to the much-needed exit from the decade to the Brussels phase of that country. The report therefore registers progress, but also lists a number of areas where the right results are needed to be able to evaluate the membership application as successful. First of all, we expect a final agreement on the establishment of an effective coordination mechanism. Two other key preconditions for progress, the full implementation of the reform agenda and the adaptation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, have yet to happen. It should also be mentioned, unfortunately, unresolved issues that delay the final publication of the long-held census. There is also a lack of a number of strategies at the state level, which prevents Bosnia and Herzegovina from starting to use serious funds for the construction of energy and transport infrastructure. Corruption remains a serious systemic problem. Adequate protection for whistleblowers should be ensured, but the best support would be to strengthen the judiciary at all levels. In parallel, it is necessary to prepare work on future political, electoral and constitutional reforms that will shape Bosnia and Herzegovina into a functional, inclusive and efficient state based on the principles of federalism, subsidiarity, equality and equality of all its peoples and citizens. As head of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, I am sorry for the failed constitution of the joint parliamentary body of the BiH Parliament and the European Parliament, but we could not allow the attempt to transpose into the common rules of procedure provisions involving ethnic census.

It is the first report since the historic submission of the application for membership on February 15th this year, which we in the European Parliament strongly advocated, which marks a new phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina's rapprochement with the European Union.  It is essential that the Council and the Commission process the application without delay in accordance with the EU treaty and past practice and that an opinion on the application is started as soon as possible, so that Bosnia and Herzegovina receives candidate status. I call on Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure the adjustment of stabilisation and association agreements through negotiations with the Commission in order to maintain traditional trade between Croatia and BiH. To undertake economic and social reforms and adapt to the EU acquis, it is essential to establish an effective EU coordination mechanism in which all levels of government will participate.

The Commission very much welcomes the resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Cristian Preda, on his high-quality report and to thank all the Members who have actively participated in the debate, not only today, but also in committee, and have shown a keen interest in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s European future. The Commission takes note of this resolution and will take Parliament’s views into account, including those expressed today. We specifically share Parliament’s view that the country’s authorities need to continue with their determination in pursuing socio-economic reforms, including their effective implementation and making steady progress towards the European Union. This would be particularly necessary to enable the Council to decide whether to seek the Commission’s opinion on the merits of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application. At the same time, the Commission is also looking to the country’s authorities to ensure the functionality of the coordination mechanism on EU affairs and to adapt the SAA, following Croatia’s accession to the European Union.  Let me also mention that the Commission has taken note of Parliament’s call for internal reform within the country based on several principles such as decentralisation and federalism. However, in line with our approach to all enlargement countries, including past EU enlargements, the Commission reiterates that the European Union has no competence regarding the internal structure of a state. What matters is the capacity of a country to meet all its obligations as a future European Union member. It will be up to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s authorities and citizens to decide how best to comply with the European Union membership requirements. Likewise, I would like to emphasise that, as is the case with any country aspiring to the EU, the Commission will particularly insist that the country fully abide by the principles of non—discrimination against its citizens, irrespective of their ethnicity, belief or gender, in line with the European Union acquis.  Finally, I would like to stress that the Commission will spare no effort in supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina on its path towards the European Union. This also applies when it comes to using EU money efficiently and in a sustainable targeted manner, but there has to be a national strategy in the relevant areas. That is what we are discussing with the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities: there has to be an idea of how to best use the money in order to ensure not only that it will have an impact on the country, but also that it will provide the necessary European added value.  The Commission will keep Parliament informed in the coming months on further developments regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is noteworthy that for the first time the European Commission has more positively assessed bosnia and herzegovina's aspirations than in previous years. However, it cannot be disputed that the accession process is hampered by a number of factors. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a number of problems to overcome until full membership. The main requirements for accession include reforming public administrations, building an independent judicial system, increasing economic growth and social justice, and, perhaps most importantly, the development of a coordination mechanism for cooperation between the two parts of the country and the District of Brčko in order to join the Union. It is also necessary to a change in the discriminatory electoral law against minorities outside the three constituent nationalities.

Madam President, we are here this evening in the Chamber of Parliament to discuss the draft directive on the protection of professional know-how, know-how, confidential business information, all these things commonly referred to as 'business secrets'. In particular, we are responsible for debating among ourselves the agreement reached in trilogue on this important draft directive. This is the first time that we have had the opportunity to present in plenary the fruit of the agreement reached in the trilogue. Tackling economic and industrial espionage, the plundering of our European companies, protecting our innovation and research, defending our European competitiveness, these are the main objectives of this directive. Of course, it is a question of providing a common legal basis, common European rules to all the economic actors present in the territory of the European Union, in order to ensure a stable and secure legal framework. It is a question of combating the legal fragmentation that currently exists in this European internal market, which we must, of course, complete, and which we need to improve. The patchwork of different, disparate national legislative arrangements leads to instability and legal uncertainty. The idea is therefore to have the most harmonised uniform protection possible at European level of what these trade secrets, professional know-how, know-how, strategic, commercial information, which have value, which represent the intangible heritage of our companies and which are important for their economic development and for the development of our jobs in Europe. We have been committed to supporting these main objectives together in the European Parliament, in particular in the Committee on Legal Affairs. We have, of course, also been committed - and we were very determined in this regard - to ensure that the protection of trade secrets cannot in any way undermine the exercise of fundamental freedoms, nor the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and information, the first of which are, of course, freedom of the press and pluralism of the media. , and that, for example, workers also have the right to be represented by trade union representatives, who may be made aware of trade secrets, or the right to professional mobility. After a very long work - more than 18 months of work in three parliamentary committees - we have managed to agree on these key priorities and to significantly modify, amend, transform and improve the original proposal of the directive as presented to us by the European Commission. We have transformed it, we have improved it, in particular, and especially in a spirit, I would say, very positive, very constructive and of a genuine collegiality of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and then of the european Parliament's negotiating team, which went to discuss, negotiate, engage in a sometimes quite violent confrontation with the Council, strengthen fundamental freedoms, strengthen protection, strengthen protection. , of course, with regard to freedom of expression and freedom of information, which must be granted both to journalists, particularly investigative journalists, and to whistleblowers whose activities must be able to be carried out freely and in conscience. And it is on the strength of this extremely positive contribution from all the shadow rapporteurs who have been with me very active stakeholders in the negotiating team that we have obtained, in negotiations with the Council, a text which has taken up 100% of the recommendations and red lines of the European Parliament. It is now a balanced text, which protects not only what is essential for our companies, their professional know-how, their intangible heritage so precious for their economic development, but also the fundamental freedoms and the exercise of the profession of journalist and the activities of whistleblowers. I therefore call for outspoken and overwhelming support for this balanced and just text that we have worked out together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2218, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the Legal Affairs Committee and warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Constance Le Grip, and the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent and successful work on the trade secrets protection directive. Both the work and the constructive spirit in the negotiations facilitated reaching satisfactory compromise and hopefully, if this House votes in favour tomorrow, the swift adoption of the directive at first reading. Trade secrets are an important part of businesses’ intellectual capital in the knowledge economy. Trade secrets are widely used to obtain a competitive advantage, to undertake research and development activity or to innovate in general. For instance, secret know-how is licensed every day between business partners as part of technology transfer deals, and trade secrets are essential for success. Every patent first started as a trade secret. This widespread use of trade secrets is general to all businesses, but SMEs value and rely on trade secrets even more than larger companies. Valuable trade secrets, however, become worthless if misappropriated by others. The risk of such misappropriation is real and could come from cyberattacks, economic espionage and unreliable partners in extended supply chains, for instance. The new EU rules will provide for effective EU-wide means of redress against such trade secret misappropriation. EU businesses will have better tools to fight against unfair and dishonest behaviour that threatens the value of their intellectual capital. This is an important step forward in allowing our creators and innovators to get profit from their hard work and intellectual efforts. Let me be clear: this directive is not about promoting secrecy in business, it is about trust. Thousands of EU companies, most of them SMEs, are innovating out there, sharing confidential information. The new EU rules will contribute to building such trust, as they will ensure that the risk of sharing information diminishes. This directive is also about the fairer and deeper single market, one of the priorities of this Commission. A deeper single market, because the new rules will provide for more predictability and legal certainty. They will also result in a simpler legal framework facilitating the life of enterprises. Companies will no longer need to research and analyse 28 different and disparate national laws; they can count on a harmonised approach. At the same time, rules will reduce unfair competition from rogue competitors who are cutting corners by not respecting the rules. A fairer single market means saying ‘no’ to hacking, cheating and economic espionage as business practices. This directive is not only about protecting businesses holding trade secrets; it is also about placing limits on the protection of trade secrets, avoiding abuse and ensuring full respect for disclosing obligations established by transparency rules. It is not here to protect potential illegal behaviour of companies. On the contrary, it serves to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms and the legitimate interest of citizens, consumers, employees, honest competitors, journalists and public administrations. A significant added value of this directive lies in achieving the right balance between the different interests in this area. The European Parliament has been decisive in improving the clarity of the proposal in this regard. Thus, considering the overall compromise that has been achieved by the co-legislators and the benefits and significant added value for enterprises and citizens at large, the Commission welcomes and endorses the agreed compromise deal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2219, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Michèle RIVASI", "mepid": "96743", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Madam President, I disagree with what I have heard. I believe that this directive was originally proposed to protect the know-how of companies in the face of unfair practices. However, it is feared that such a piece of legislation will further promote the culture of secrecy and the lack of transparency on the part of companies.  How many health, environmental and human scandals have been ignored because of the inability of institutions to obtain information classified as \"confidential\"? We have new cases every day. For example, with regard to glyphosate, we are unable to obtain studies that are classified as \"confidential\" by companies. As for clinical trials, it is the pharmaceutical companies that say they are trade secrets. Every time a scandal broke out, public opinion was informed and parliament took the necessary steps in response, it was thanks to the courage of a few zealous whistleblowers.  Today, this text calls into question the ability of these extraordinary people to reveal information that they were supposed to keep quiet. For the question is not whether, after a long trial, they will be acquitted. No, the question is whether companies will not abuse this directive to ruin their lives, destroy their families, prevent them from finding a job and plunge them into a distress that few people imagine.  I would have liked - and I am speaking to the Commission - that, in relation to this directive, you had previously proposed a directive to protect whistleblowers.

In 2012 I gave documents to a journalist whose publication triggered the LuxLeaks scandal. I was awarded the European Citizens' Award by the European Parliament last year for this. But both me and the journalist are now being prosecuted in Luxembourg for trade secrets 'violation'. The exemptions foreseen in this directive to supposedly protect whistle-blowers would not protect me or the journalist, because we did not reveal anything illegal, just immoral. This directive will enable companies to sue anyone who accesses, uses or publishes any information that they consider a trade secret, which, according to the definition foreseen in the text, can be almost any internal information. It applies to all citizens and not, as it should, to economic competitors only. Before you vote on this directive, I urge you to reflect on this question: do you really want a society where it is impossible for the public to access information crucial to the public good? So much for Antoine Deltour. On April 26, I will be present at the trial against Deltour. I hope I don't stand there empty-handed.

I would like to remind you that this Parliament awarded Mr Deltour the European Citizens’ Prize just last year for his contributions. We must not now turn around and dismiss his concerns. We must not put more whistle-blowers in court or discourage them from coming forward in the first place. Dear colleagues, let us postpone the vote on this directive until we have actually seen a whistle-blower protection law presented by the Commission. I do not think that simply asking for it without putting on any pressure is going to do any good. I would welcome it if the Commissioner were to prove me wrong on this. There is absolutely no urgency about going ahead with a vote tomorrow. The unintended consequences if we do, however, promise to be dire. Let me tell you: European voters will not understand if two weeks after important revelations we respond to the Panama Papers by strengthening corporate secrecy.

The two key areas of threat, as I understand it, in terms of protecting business know—how, trade secrets and business information, are actually internal theft and internal release and access of information, coupled – or, secondly – in the area of cybercrime. None of what I have heard so far this evening is even beginning to look at that. We seem to be completely and utterly focused on whistle—blowers. I do not see that the European Union has the competency to address this. It certainly does not have the resources, and it is a challenge that faces the global business world in every business sector.

If we want information and knowledge to flow within the territory of the European Union, outside the territory of the European Union, with the rest of the world, if we want confidence, we need clear, sound and precise rules, and we need that common legal basis within the European market that can bring stability and security. Please, ladies and gentlemen, as I said in the introduction, there is no naivety, but also no confusion or mixing of genres. No instrumentalization of recent scandals that have, of course, made headlines, and which continue to do so, and which have nothing to do with professional know-how, with innovation, with know-how, with business information, but which have everything to do with illegal activities and fraud. Let us not take European companies, the work of Europeans, discoveries and innovations hostage, in the name of struggles that are spreading and which lead us to make Europe a land that no longer knows where its interests are and which no longer knows how to protect its interests, protect its producers, protect its companies, protect its researchers and its workers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2240, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.

In this House, it is common knowledge – but perhaps not to all European citizens – that the annual budgetary exercise is triangular. The Secretary-General, the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets are at the top, and the rapporteur is navigating between them according to the rules of procedure, which, in their most rigid interpretation, might be said to define the time slot for deep, detailed and constructive discussions as very short – even too short, I must say. However, there are other players in the outside world, like the European Commission, who rightfully expect Parliament to meet the agreed deadlines. If a report is adopted tomorrow in plenary, we may send it out and say better late than never. The second aspect is that there are lots of regulations, interinstitutional agreements, gentlemen’s agreements, inflation estimations by the Commission, etc., which have been decided on and agreed by the generations before us. These really affect the outcome of our budgetary negotiations, because you can neither go higher than that nor reduce the amount of money than that, even in cases when it seems necessary. From a personal point of view, that has been for me the most difficult aspect of preparing this report. Nevertheless, for the great flexibility shown by the numerous director—generals of Parliament’s services, the budget secretariat, the Secretary-General and his office staff of different political groups, the accredited assistants and, last but not least, the main actors – the shadow rapporteurs, coordinators and the president of the committee: thank you all.  We are here. We stand here right now, and the report is ready. The generally contradicting wishes, the need to make savings corresponding to the economic dire straits outside the European institutions, and on the other hand to manage the needs of a properly functioning House have been tackled at the – sometimes quite heated – debates and consultations. Compromises were sought and mostly found; the rest of the text is purely the outcome of a democratic vote in the Budget Committee. As usual, I can live with the outcome of a democratic vote, and hence I recommend that the Members vote in favour. There seems to be a minor problem, and that is the notorious internalisation of transport services. The Committee on Budgets discussed the matter, as did the Bureau. The committee tasked the rapporteur to put a sum of money in reserve, which means that we will come back to the issue later, in autumn or sooner if so decided, and define on the basis of various information whether to release the funds or hold them back. When I now look at the Annex to the report, the conditionality has been given to the discretion of the Bureau. That is not in accordance to the agreement of conciliation; moreover, this is in my opinion against the very same rules of procedure. I will see how to remedy that injury, and I do hope sincerely that I am not forced to add insult to it. On a more positive note, we have discovered that our excellent translation services are the primary source for the well-known corporation called Google. They develop their product, Google Translate, very much based on the European Parliament’s translations into 28 languages, and earn quite good money. I also hear that they are also very eager to optimise taxes, so my proposal is to ask them to make a voluntary contribution to the budget of our institution – perhaps then they will understand the nexus between paying maximum taxes and keeping middle—class jobs. That will also be a step towards the EU’s own resources. To conclude, I am proud and happy that the green initiatives, such as a more transparent depiction of the very poor distinction between investments and running costs, green public procurement, and more fuel and cost—efficient transport have been included in this report.  I would like to thank again every each and every person who has been part of this difficult and somewhat obscure exercise, and I hope we will pass the report tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2243, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Paul RÜBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would also like to thank Mr Tarand in particular. As rapporteur for the European Parliament for the 2017 budget, he has taken a good, balanced position. It has done a great deal to ensure that we have been able to agree on a budget that has already been cut by 4% by the Heads of State or Government for the seven-year period and which provides for 1% savings in the posts every year. In this respect, we in Parliament have also committed ourselves to using taxpayers' money as sparingly as possible. We have reduced the 20% share of expenditure that we normally have in administrative costs to 19.17%. This is actually unique. I do not remember that we have had similar figures in the last eight years. The increase in the safety surcharge, which we only made last year, is 0.6%, well below the rate of inflation. And even if you actually compare the ordinary expenditure, it is 1.4%. So I think it's a very frugal budget. Nevertheless, I would ask all my colleagues in the House to take advantage of their own savings. We have many areas where there are ceilings, and not everyone has to take advantage of all borders at all times. We have many free choices. The beauty of this European Parliament is that the individual Member of the European Parliament has a great responsibility in how it handles its expenditure situation, whether it works a lot, whether it works little.

Discussing bowls and cans is not always an exciting subject for the crowds, but it is still an obligatory part of the overall budget procedure of the European institutions. As such, we can be pleased to have contained current expenditure to limit it to a slight increase of 1.4%, which will have to absorb the entire structural share of changes indexed to the cost of living, but also the expenditure of multilingualism due to the introduction of the Gaelic language, as well as, of course, the expenditure related to security issues. For my part, I stressed the need for a strict separation between investment and operation.

The process around the estimates for the parliamentary budget for 2017 has been, to put it mildly, a very interesting one. Has it been transparent or should it be transparent? We tend to believe that politics in general and the use of monetary resources in particular has to be transparent. That is at least what we usually say back home. The truth of the matter is that Parliament’s budget is opaque to a degree that is not actually acceptable. There are a lot of structural problems: no differentiation between investments and current expenditure, no detailed information about how extraordinary expenditure is used in reality and no control on how different budget lines are used outside the original intention of the budget. In a way this resembles something that was published in 1494. Sebastian Brandt was born in Strasbourg around 1457. In 1494 he published the book Das Narrenschiff, the ship of fools, where an identifiable crew of persons left for Narragonia. We immensely dislike being treated as the fools on the Narrenschiff, where you get piecemeal information on a process which is very important. We have decided to vote against this file in tomorrow’s vote. We will not be part of a crew on board a ship that does not know how a ship should be navigated in dangerous waters. We have good reasons for this approach. We see a growing distrust concerning the EU, and we would like to remedy this mistrust.

You may not realize the fact, but as the EP becomes increasingly important, it also increases its threat on its own. In the future budget, we must therefore not only ensure sufficient funding for the safety of our buildings, but also some flexibility in implementing ad hoc security measures, as we could have faced this year. There is another aspect to this. There is no point in debating the ineffective use of European taxpayers' money by our travels here to Strasbourg. That's just a fact. The EP does not have one or two buildings, but three buildings, ladies and gentlemen, in which they must increase security measures to ensure the safety of all those who work there.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the aim of this question is to contribute to the process of reviewing the EMS supporting factor, which is a fundamental measure for access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises.  SMEs are the engine of our economy, generating 55 % of Europe's gross domestic product and employing almost 80 million of our fellow citizens. In order to continue to contribute to growth, however, small and medium-sized enterprises need to be supported with funding that allows them to internationalise, to keep up with the times, to invest in new projects, to hire new employees. However, the monetary policy of the European Central Bank is not sufficient to achieve this objective. Quantitative easing, for example, and rate cuts, can only support policies in favour of the real economy, but they cannot replace them.  In order to prevent deflation – or worse, as the International Monetary Fund warned us just yesterday, secular stagnation in Europe – we need concrete measures, such as the EMS supporting factor, a virtuous example of a balance between regulatory constraints and flexibility. Thanks to this support factor, bank lending to small and medium-sized enterprises has increased by 2 % over the last year and a half, compared with a 7 % reduction in that granted to large enterprises, and interest rates have been reduced by about 20 basis points.  In view of the end-of-year review, we call for the EMS supporting factor to be confirmed and strengthened, extending its application to credits of more than EUR 1.5 million, thus removing the threshold currently provided for. This would allow more companies, especially medium-sized enterprises, to benefit from the discount factor.

It is this process that explains the current situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs and micro-enterprises; the forced disappearance of the Banks and the concentration in the banking sector have diverted credit from the real economy to speculation, in a model of transnational banking that will culminate in the banking union. SMEs, however, are productively anchored to their territory, to local employment, and therefore no longer of interest to this new banking. And I have no doubt that if SMEs have to go public for credit — as the Commission intends - they will further increase the risks and interest paid for the benefit, precisely, of finance.  In addition, economic volatility and the serious deterioration in the social conditions of the working majority – the victim of unemployment and wage falls – have added a horizon of uncertainty for SMEs. For large companies, the precariousness of work is another tool in the fight for global competition. For SMEs, their workers are also their consumers and only improving working conditions will ensure a market for their products. We are lost in a technical debate on credit factors when the European Banking Authority itself has already stated that little or nothing will come out of it. Let us truly address the debate on the financing of SMEs within its overall framework; the instability and economic stagnation that you have imposed on countries intervened and rescued by their austerity policies. Only in this way will we be able to progress towards truly transformative policies, weaving alliances against our common enemy that, believe it or not, is the great capital.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2264, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Michael THEURER", "mepid": "96871", "text": "  Author. Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In adopting CRD IV and CRR, the European Parliament and the Council were right to ensure that there were lower capital requirements for small and medium-sized enterprises. Now there is a report by the Basel Committee which finds that, in some cases, in a sample of nine Member States examined, the banks are partly incompatible with the Basel legal framework. That's what got us on the map here. As the European Parliament, we want to make it clear that we believe that the lower capital base for small and medium-sized enterprises is absolutely necessary in order to ensure the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises in the future. And it is not the case that there are no financing difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is not only in the periphery, even in those countries that are doing well economically at the moment, that there are companies that are very, very difficult to get financing. The vast majority of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises – 99% of all enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises, 23 million in Europe – is financed by credit. In other words, we also need credit financing here in the future, because it is not to be expected that small and micro-enterprises will be able to place direct bonds with the Capital Markets Union. So, a very clear signal at this point from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats that we, together across all political groups, are calling on the Commission, as a whole, to find ways of ensuring that lending to small and medium-sized enterprises will also be ensured in the future. The banks complain about high regulatory requirements. The Goethe University in Frankfurt has presented an interesting study which shows that small and medium-sized banks are also disadvantaged here. There is therefore a need for action, and we ask the Commission to keep the ball on the ball here in terms of jobs and small and medium-sized enterprises.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2265, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Kay SWINBURNE", "mepid": "96920", "text": "  author. – Madam President, Europe’s SMEs, including in my own constituency of Wales, have shown remarkable resilience in times of recent financial troubles, but now need capital to fuel their expansion and growth. In much of the regulation that was negotiated during the aftermath of the financial crisis, there was emphasis placed on higher capital requirements for credit institutions across the board. However, we sought in this House, where possible, to minimise the impact that this would have on lending to the real economy. Part of these measures included the SME supporting factor, which was intended to provide an incentive to banks to lend to SMEs as they would receive a slightly lower capital charge for this type of lending. However, the European Banking Authority (EBA) report on how this has been implemented suggests it is having little impact. I quote: ‘SME bank lending has suffered a significant backdrop in volumes from a peak of EUR 95 billion in 2008 to approximately EUR 54 billion in 2013-14. Bank lending to larger corporates, on the other hand, has already recovered to its pre-crisis volumes. The EBA analysis questions the effectiveness of the entire SME supporting factor. However, I do not think it is fair to look at this factor in isolation, as other factors affecting lending, such as reduced demand and confidence among the SMEs themselves, have also got to be taken into account.  Both anecdotal evidence in my own constituency and data analysed by the Bank of England suggests that nearly 77% of SMEs in the last year that have applied for bank loans have received them; so I am concerned that the EBA only looks at the level of capital supplied, as opposed to the level of capital requested, and therefore its conclusions should be treated with a healthy level of scepticism. Can the Commission therefore explain how the Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (DG FISMA) is working with the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) to look at the wider confidence issues in the SME sector, and bear these measures in mind when reviewing the very important SME supporting factor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2266, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission is aware of the importance of the role played by small- and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to economic growth and job creation in the European Union. The Commission is fully committed to identifying the most appropriate policies and tools to address their funding needs. SMEs face structural financing obstacles – as has been said several times now – as they are largely dependent on bank financing, whereas larger companies have a more diversified source of funding thanks to their access to capital markets. Their dependence on bank loans and less-diversified sources of income make SMEs more vulnerable to downturns in the economic cycle. European SMEs have experienced huge difficulties in accessing finance in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The problem is especially serious in some Member States, which has led to the concerns voiced by this European Parliament. In this spirit, the Commission has supported the inclusion in the Capital Requirement Regulation of a measure – the SME-supporting factor – aimed at granting loans to SMEs and giving them more risk-sensitive potential treatment, and thus reducing the potential impact of the tougher capital charges introduced by the Capital Requirements Regulation on lending to SMEs. The SME-supporting factor has been in force since 1 January 2014. Thanks to your and the Commission’s efforts, the importance of the issue has also been acknowledged at global level, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is now also considering lowering capital charges for exposures to SMEs. The Commission is currently assessing the effects of the SME factor in the context of the review of the Capital Requirement Regulation, which will be published towards the end of the year. In particular, we are looking at its impact on the volumes of SME lending since its introduction, compared to other factors, for example, the macroeconomic environment or the SME’s credit history. Moreover, we will be looking to verify whether, according to the available evidence, the SME factor remains potentially sound, taking into account its features in terms of the definition of an SME and the size of the loan. We are drawing on various sources of information for this exercise, such as the recent public consultation on the impact of the Capital Requirements Regulation on banking financing of the economy and the call for evidence on financial regulation launched in September last year. The recently published European Banking Authority report on SMEs and the SME-supporting factor has also provided the Commission with useful elements for its forthcoming policy recommendations. Finally I should stress that, in future, bank lending should not remain the only – or at least the largely dominant – response to the financing gap of EU SMEs. An appropriate degree of diversification of funding sources should be sought and the dominant role of banks reduced.

There is a very large majority in the ECON Committee, in the European Parliament, which says that the EMS supporting factor must be maintained and that, indeed, it must be strengthened. This is a political fact which, of course, the Commission and the other bodies of the Union cannot but take into account, and we have a firm political will with regard to which we read with interest the considerations made by the EBA in its report, but they do not seem to us, shall we say, to support and support the need for any change in prudential policy towards small and medium-sized enterprises.  The European Parliament has had this initiative during the definition of crr – crd IV and now what we are saying clearly is that it must be maintained and indeed strengthened. The evidence that is carried out here can also be overturned, because for example the fact that the difference in credit risk on one and a half is not evident, also supports the idea of raising this threshold, not necessarily lowering it as the EBA alludes.

Investment by small and medium-sized enterprises is the risk and economic buffer for Europe's economy and, ultimately, for financial markets.

Moreover, in countries such as Greece, which has been impoverished by the Memorandums, only 18% of small and medium-sized enterprises apply for a loan, while 38% face increased difficulties in accessing bank lending. Furthermore, Mr Hahn, in Greece, the troika in which the Commission also participates requires the sale of non-performing loans of small and medium-sized enterprises to aggressive funds, with the result that many small and medium-sized enterprises are at risk of dismantling and divestment of their assets.  How about that, Mr. Hahn? How do we reconcile what is happening in Greece with what we are discussing here? Will you continue this aggressive policy as a troika for the red loans of small and medium-sized enterprises in Greece? You have to answer that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2276, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at least those who are still there! I would like to express my sincere thanks for your committed discussion and I regret that so late in the evening we are talking about something as essential as small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, because they are indeed the backbone of the European economy. I would just like to remind you that we have some 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and about as many unemployed, and if only each of these companies were to take in an unemployed person, then the problem of unemployment would be eliminated.  If this were to be left to the 500 largest European companies, each company would have to create around 50 000 jobs, which is probably not possible in theory. This shows how important small and medium-sized enterprises are, and I can therefore assure you that the Commission will continue to work intensively on the development and strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. However, I can also assure you that our approach is to create conditions and not to act in a dirigiste manner, but to ensure that the European economy can develop, and it can only do so if an appropriate framework is in place. But entrepreneurship must be guaranteed. Only then will a successful economy be possible, which ultimately secures or creates jobs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2277, "date": "2016-04-13.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   Thank you, Commissioner; you have given us food for thought.
