I started with my State of the Union address on the future of Europe here in this House, where I laid out the road map for a more united, stronger and more democratic Union. This debate on building a more united, stronger and more democratic Europe continued at the Sorbonne in Paris: President Macron gave a very bold and a very European speech, and I would like to congratulate him and thank him once again. Prime Minister May’s speech, on the other hand, was about separation. In Florence, she struck an optimistic tone on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the Union. When it comes to Brexit, we still cannot talk about the future without real clarity. This is because the condition of Article 50 and the mandate given to us by the leaders of the EU 27 are very clear: we first need to agree on the terms of the divorce and then we will see if we can, half-lovingly, find one another again. The Prime Minister’s speech in Florence was conciliatory, but speeches are not negotiation positions and, as Michel Barnier, the Commission’s excellent chief negotiator, said last week, work still remains to be done. We have not yet made the sufficient progress needed. The negotiators have made good progress on citizens’ rights, but the indispensable role of the European Court of Justice in guaranteeing those rights still needs to be agreed. I am pleased that Prime Minister May and her team recognise that the UK has financial obligations which it must respect. The devil will be, as always, in the detail, but the taxpayers of the EU 27 should not pay for the British decision. And when it comes to Ireland we can only talk of solutions that fully respect EU law and the Good Friday Agreement. I will not go into any more detail here, as negotiations continue next week and Michel Barnier will complete what I have just been saying. For those who think that the UK should just go over Michel Barnier’s head, I would remind them that the Commission was appointed by the 27 Member States, and my choice of Michel Barnier was welcomed by them. He acts on their behalf on the basis of clear negotiating mandates and he will report to them at the next European Council. To date, I cannot say that we are ready to enter the second phase of the negotiations. Monsieur le Président, après le départ du Royaume-Uni, une page de l’histoire européenne se tourne et une autre est en train de s’écrire pour décider de l’avenir que nous voulons construire à vingt-sept.  Trop longtemps, nous avons repoussé des questions cruciales à des lendemains incertains. Trop longtemps, nous avons préféré nous livrer à de longues discussions institutionnelles au lieu de débattre clairement avec les peuples d’Europe de la finalité de notre Union. Tout cela doit changer et tout cela est en train de changer. Les débats sur l’avenir de l’Europe se multiplient dans tous les États membres. C’est bon signe car cela témoigne de la santé et de la vigueur de la démocratie européenne. C’était l’objectif que visait la Commission avec le livre blanc sur l’avenir de l’Europe, les documents de réflexion et les nombreux dialogues citoyens qui se sont multipliés dans tout le continent. Mais il ne faut pas se disperser. C’est pourquoi j’ai voulu placer la poursuite de ce débat public dans le contexte d’une feuille de route structurée avec des échéances précises sur des propositions concrètes. Cette route nous mènera jusqu’au 30 mars 2019, au sommet spécial de Sibiu-Hermannstadt, en Roumanie, où nous donnerons notre vision d’avenir pour l’Europe et où nous déciderons de ce que nous serons prêts à défendre et à construire ensemble, à vingt-sept.  Notre avenir ce n’est pas le Brexit, c’est l’Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen presidents and parliamentarians, dear Matti, I am very happy to be with President Juncker, whom I thank for his personal trust and support, and alongside Matti Maasikas, whom I congratulate and thanks for the quality of the Estonian presidency, throughout the past weeks. We were gathered in this hemicycle to debate the same subject on April 5, 2017, when you adopted your first resolution. You then set the political course for this negotiation, as the European Council did, under the leadership of President Tusk, by adopting very precise guidelines shortly after. Six months later, while the clock is ticking, and a few days before the European Council of 19 and 20 October, we are therefore taking stock of this negotiation again, and your draft resolution demonstrates today, beyond the concrete subjects it addresses, the full involvement of the European Parliament in these talks. I often remind people outside this Chamber that your Assembly will have the last word, when it comes to ratification. From day one, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have known that this negotiation is extraordinary, that it is extremely complex, that it is fraught with human, social, legal, financial, technical, economic consequences, and often for that matter. , these consequences are underestimated. As negotiator of the Union, it is up to the Commission, with your confidence, to negotiate on behalf of the 27 and all the institutions of the Union. Our greatest asset, I can tell you, instead of where I am, is our unity. We know that this unity cannot be decreed, it does not fall from the sky, it is built day after day by the transparency that we have every day with President Juncker, by public debate and by trust. I want to thank you personally, Mr President Tajani, as well as Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator, the group presidents and the members of the Brexit Steering Group, whom I meet very often, as was the case yesterday. again, for the quality and the frankness of our exchanges. Encouraged by your support, since the start of this negotiation we have endeavored to implement the mandate given to us by the Council, in full consistency with your resolution and with the guidelines adopted by the European Council. This mandate is simple: it consists in agreeing with the United Kingdom, as soon as possible, on the conditions of its withdrawal - an orderly withdrawal from the European Union - and on the principles of this withdrawal, in order to start the next stages of the negotiation as soon as possible. You know, Ladies and Gentlemen, in the context of this withdrawal, there are many subjects which are not negligible - Euratom, legal procedures, administrative procedures, assets placed on the market, governance - but the three main subjects of this orderly withdrawal concern first the citizens, that is to say 4.5 million people, then Ireland and finally the financial regulation. These three subjects are inseparable, and constitute the three key subjects of this orderly withdrawal. As you yourself say in your draft resolution, and as President Juncker has just recalled, Prime Minister Theresa May proposed several overtures in two speeches she gave last Friday in Florence. The negotiating team, as I wished, began last week to translate these openings into concrete proposals and to provide a number of clarifications, which I will come back to briefly in a moment. We were therefore able to make progress in particular on our priority, which remains the protection of citizens' rights. We also converge on the common principles that will guide our response to the sensitive questions raised by Ireland’s unique situation. Alongside these positive points, which I must mention, in order to draw up an objective assessment of the state of negotiations, we still have serious differences, in particular on the financial regulation. On this issue, which I have already discussed here, things are also simple. We will not agree to pay 27 what has been decided at 28, it’s that simple. Taxpayers in the 27 Member States of the Union do not have to pay the consequences of a decision they have not taken, nothing more, nothing less. (Applause) We also have differences on how to guarantee citizens' rights. We know and share, just as you know, ladies and gentlemen, since you represent them, the concern of these 4.5 million citizens, British and from the 27 other countries of the Union, who today wish just continue to live and work where they are, with their families, like before Brexit. This concern, as you recall in your resolution, is further aggravated by certain discriminatory measures taken over the past few months by the British authorities, and we are concerned about this. To guarantee these rights, indeed, we need several elements. First, the Withdrawal Agreement must have direct effect to allow UK authorities and judges to rely directly on it, otherwise, of course, those rights could change over time. Second, we need a coherent interpretation of the agreement across the Channel, which, in our view, only the Court of Justice of the European Union can provide. Beyond this As a matter of governance, we are also awaiting guarantees from the United Kingdom on family reunification and on the enjoyment abroad of social benefits acquired in the United Kingdom. Regarding the second main issue, that of Ireland, both the European Union and the United Kingdom recognize that they are in a very exceptional situation and that any solution will have to take this fully into account. As I have mentioned on several occasions, the solutions we must find will have to respect both the integrity of the Union's legal order and the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. At this stage, the aim is in particular to develop concrete modalities that will make it possible to sustainably pursue the very numerous North-South cooperation arrangements provided for in this agreement and to perpetuate the common travel area. And this task still requires precise and detailed work, in which we are engaged with the British delegation in a constructive manner. In the end, ladies and gentlemen, and you rightly say this in your draft resolution, with regard to these three key inseparable subjects, we have not yet made sufficient progress today to start with confidence. the second phase of negotiation. It will first be a question of providing for a possible transition period, under conditions which have been clearly defined by the European Council and to which you yourself are attentive, then to define the framework of our future partnership relationship with this big country. A fifth round of negotiations will be held next week in Brussels. Our attitude will remain resolutely constructive, because we want to complete both the agreement on the orderly withdrawal and the discussion on our future relationship with the United Kingdom. With the United Kingdom, which will become a third state, in any event, since that is its choice, on March 30, 2019, we want establish an ambitious and lasting partnership, of course in trade matters, since that is its request, through a free trade agreement under conditions which we will discuss, but also beyond trade, in terms of security, the fight against terrorism and defense, as well as research and innovation. The sooner we agree on the principles of this orderly withdrawal, the sooner we can focus on this fundamental objective which is in our common interest, namely the building of this new partnership with the United Kingdom. Ladies and gentlemen, our approach is based on the fundamental principles of our Union: unity, the interests of the 27 Member States and the institutions, our decision-making autonomy, the integrity of our internal market and the four freedoms of movement which are its foundation. These four principles have been at the heart of our political project since its inception. The UK knows them well having shared them with us for 44 years, and they are not negotiable. Once again, as the German Chancellor said a few weeks ago and as President Juncker just reminded us, we now know that the future of the Union is much more important than Brexit. It is the responsibility of the 27 Member States and the European Parliament to build this future together and to meet the challenges together; we can see in the news that they are serious and numerous. A page turns, or will turn. It is the sovereign choice of the UK, and we respect it. It is up to us to ensure, as Jean-Claude Juncker has just said, that we write new pages for the European Union.

The matters under discussion are serious ones with an impact on the rights of millions of citizens, on the budget of the Union and on the continuation of peace in Ireland. Following Prime Minister May’s speech on 22 September, we have noted a more constructive spirit and it seems to be providing new momentum to the negotiating process. However, we can only assess progress based on official negotiation. What actually matters is the position paper presented at negotiations as an official position. When reviewing progress, we take as a benchmark the guidelines set by the European Council on 29 April and supplemented by the negotiating directives of the Council adopted on 22 May, both setting principles and priorities shared in the European Parliament resolution of last April. I am confident that, this time, the views expressed in the resolution due to be voted on by your institution right after this debate will again tally with ours, and with the assessment of the Union negotiator, Michel Barnier. Indeed, it is on the basis of this assessment that, on 20 October, the European Council will consider the state of play in these negotiations and how to move from there. We have noted that the UK is now acknowledging the need for a transition of sorts. The principle of transitional arrangements is indeed recognised, subject to clear conditions set in the European Council guidelines I referred to earlier. A transition could be welcome in easing the impact of the withdrawal and mitigating the uncertainties affecting citizens and businesses but, again, in order to be able to consider transition in good time, we need far more clarity than has been provided so far. Likewise, concerning citizens’ rights, we do see improved convergence on key rights and on how to ensure they can actually be enjoyed by European citizens in the UK on the basis of simple procedures. But a number of issues remain open and there is not yet any satisfactory assurance that these rights will be implemented in a consistent manner on both sides of the Channel. Turning to Ireland and its unique situation, both sides are certainly close in terms of principles and continued support for the Good Friday Agreement and what could be achieved within its framework, and on the continued operation of the Common Travel Area and what it means for Irish citizens. But this is not enough in terms of certainty. Last but not least, the financial settlement is also one of the key issues on which sufficient progress must be made before moving to the next phase of the negotiations. No doubt, positive words have been said but we are still awaiting concrete proposals. All this leaves us still wondering about the conclusion we can draw as to progress – an uncertainty which I read, too, in the draft motion for a resolution before you. European Parliament resolutions are valuable for the Council. As I noted earlier, there are still 15 days and one round of negotiations to go. I was glad to conclude the meeting of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 25 September by noting that the EU 27 is united, that we have a single line of negotiations with a clearly defined mandate and we fully support the work of Michel Barner. A certain new momentum has recently been instilled into the negotiations. Let us build on it. Let us achieve watertight solutions for our citizens, for our businesses and for our Union.

On reading Johnson’s attacks against his own prime minister, he shows that the British Government is trapped by their own party quarrels and political contradictions. First Florence, then Manchester: we are listening to a lot of speeches but substance, dear friends... London is being very creative in putting red lines on the table in order to please party supporters. However, it is failing to give any solution to the voters and citizens. I fully agree with Theresa May on at least one single point, when she said ‘we can do so much better than this’. Theresa May, please do not put your party first; please put Britain first, please put the citizens first; and please, no more speeches. Show leadership on content. And the best thing would probably be to please sack Johnson, because we need a clear answer as to who is responsible for the British position. (Applause from certain quarters) A second point is the perspective of the citizens in the European Union. They can see what leaving the European Union means. We have a downgrading by the rating agencies. We have a lot of European companies who are saying they will not invest any more, and the growth rate in Great Britain when we look at the OECD data is going down from 1.6% to 1%, so only half of the gross rate which we have today in the eurozone. That is the result when you do a Brexit. The third point I want to put on the table is what are we doing in the next steps? First of all, the British Government has to understand that cherry-picking is over. What we saw through the summer break was the British Government presenting a lot of new ideas, but with these ideas they showed that they want to keep ties, they want to keep contact. They did not explain to us what leaving the European Union really means. Another point is that we should not speak too much about the transitional period because we are already in a transitional period, dear friends. We need clear results in 2019; otherwise the consent of the European Parliament is not guaranteed. A country outside the Union cannot have the same advantages as a country which is a member of the club.  (More general applause) The last two points: I think it is obvious to everybody what the Commission President and Michel Barnier underlined, that for the moment there is not sufficient progress on the negotiations on the table, so I think the EU leaders, the European Council, has to understand that there is no chance of entering into the second phase of the negotiations.  Finally, I want to thank Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier for their great job, for keeping the European Union together. I also want to thank Guy Verhofstadt for doing a great job for us as an institution, as the European Parliament, in bringing our voice to the table. We are prepared and we can be proud of the job we have done in the last months.

Yes, a very short walk of just 500 days. And there is still thick fog around the negotiations and the responsibility - as has been mentioned - lies with the conservative government and its divisions. But we want to be positive. The interests of the citizens are at stake. It was recalled by President Juncker and negotiator Barnier that Ms May gave a more constructive speech in Florence. We are pleased: but there are still many obscure points on the merits. First of all, we must respect the order, the sequence of negotiations. When two spouses go to disunion, first they negotiate the terms of the divorce and then the future relationship and then first we need to negotiate the issues of withdrawal and then we can talk about the transitional period. And it must be clear that even in this transitional period, if and when there will be, the four freedoms will apply and the Court of Justice, as President Juncker said, will remain competent. I must say that even on financial commitments, the British government is too vague, it plays on numbers without ever making specific commitments. And on Northern Ireland I really struggle to understand how the British authorities can oppose the single market and want a light border with Ireland at the same time: they want the benefits of the single market without being officially part of it! Peace in Northern Ireland is a pillar of Europe, so I urge London and the British Government to take a responsible and realistic attitude on this point. The Withdrawal Agreement must recognize all the rights of citizens, as well as those of their family members, and it is unacceptable that the British authorities already impose administrative and bureaucratic obligations on European citizens living in the United Kingdom that in fact discriminate.And I want to say on behalf of my group that we will never accept that there are Serie A citizens and Serie B citizens and we demand the same commitment from London too.As long as the British Government does not make clear and irrevocable commitments on these points, the negotiations on the future relationship cannot begin.I don't have to advise anyone, much less Mrs May.We speak through the vote of our resolutions: once again Parliament is strongly united, thanks to the work of Guy Verhofstadt and our negotiators, together with his friend Barnier and President Juncker.However, if I may allow myself, let the British government follow our path: the path of balance and wisdom, the path that leads to success for Europe and for the United Kingdom itself.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Raffaele FITTO", "mepid": "4465", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has now been more than six months since 29 March, the day on which the British Prime Minister activated Article 50 for the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. In these six months the negotiations have not produced what all of us were hoping for but, as Commissioner Barnier recalled a few days ago, Theresa May's speech a few days ago in Florence and the timid, even if not yet sufficient, progress of the fourth round of last week's negotiations lead us to be more optimistic about reaching an agreement. It would be a grave mistake to persevere in trying to divide both sides, to make one prevail over the other, a mistake we cannot afford. Our fellow citizens and our companies ask for certainties in their daily life, they ask for an agreement on a relationship that is as close and balanced as possible in terms of rights and obligations. That is why I do not honestly think, even having listened to him this morning, that it is useful for anyone to argue even within a government and create elements of contrast and opposition, which certainly do not facilitate the path we are going on. I have heard from Commissioner Barnier this morning very positive and constructive words, which do not correspond to the words I have heard later and I am very sorry, because I do not think that this is the right climate for reaching this important agreement. On the other hand, as reiterated by the British Prime Minister, the United Kingdom leaves the European Union but does not abandon Europe: problems such as immigration, terrorism and global security can and must be addressed and resolved only if we are able to to be all together, regardless of the juridical positions that see us divided on one side or the other. These are the challenges of the future that come before us and on these challenges it is time for clarity, concreteness and responsibility. It is now close to 2019 and we cannot allow ourselves the luxury of a non-agreement or a downward agreement: the consequences would be unimaginable and would certainly weaken both parties and the citizens would not forgive us. Let us put aside at this moment, in this Chamber, in the relationship between the different institutional levels, in the relationship with the British government, and let us commit ourselves to overcome this phase of negotiations, where it is the details and not the principles that create divisions. We all agree to avoid the restoration of physical barriers between Ireland and Northern Ireland. We are all convinced that we must guarantee continuity and stability to the peace process and we all believe that the commitments made in financial terms, in the end, on the basis of a confrontation must be respected. The rights and interests of citizens of the European Union and of British citizens residing and having resided in the Member States or the United Kingdom must be the priority. We create the conditions for the status of these people to be subject to the principles of reciprocity, equity and non-discrimination. For this reason we must be much more realistic than politics often leads us not to be: I want to say this very frankly. We need to find a compromise and take into account that in 2019 the UK will, in fact, be a third country. As a group of the ECR, we regret that Parliament, precisely through this resolution, while understanding the reasons that have been indicated, did not speed up the start of the second phase of the negotiations. In fact, delaying the start of the second phase is not a solution; on the contrary, it risks complicating the situation. And we have a duty to clearly define the future relationship and to guarantee a certain legal framework, at a commercial and economic level, both for our businesses and for future relations between the European Union and the United Kingdom. We cannot allow to leave the production and commercial system of the European Union and the United Kingdom at the mercy of total uncertainty: here, as has been mentioned, the present and the future of millions of workers and their families are at stake, which must be guaranteed. At the same time, here too, as with regard to citizens' rights, the solution cannot be the imposition of one position over another, but must necessarily be an opportunity for agreement. What we had already stated in the Chamber a few months ago we want to reiterate today: for us Brexit, which is a fact decided by citizens, like it or not, must not be a reason for conflict but I hope that there may be an opportunity to become an opportunity to establish future relations, which it seems to me that this European Union badly needs.

Our idea – and I think Michel Barnier’s also – was that by October we would see sufficient progress. But Mr Weber is right in his analysis of the situation on the other side of the negotiating table: there is a lack of clarity; there is even disunity. There is opposition between Hammond and Fox, and opposition and divisions between Johnson and May. It is difficult to make sufficient progress and it is difficult to take the steps towards the second phase of the negotiations. So I deplore the fact that we cannot put before the plenary a resolution other than today’s resolution. On the other hand, it does demonstrate the unity among ourselves – and I hope, Mr Fitto, that we can keep that unity in this House, and even that you can join it when we vote in a few moments’ time, because that unity is absolutely needed. Parliament and Council – not Parliament only, but Parliament and Council – for once, and I have never seen it before, I have to tell you, in my political life, are going beyond national differences and considerations of party obedience, and are really defending, together with the negotiator, the interests of the citizens in all 27 Member States. So my call to you, and to everybody in the plenary, is to join this unity: let us keep this unity. I have three worries – three points that I think need to be addressed in the debate. The first is Northern Ireland. I have to tell you that I went to Northern Ireland. I had never been in Northern Ireland before, I had never been in Belfast before, but I went there. I had thought: ‘Yeah, it’s been 20 years now since this has been on our television screens and the problems are solved. It’s a bit like Berlin: the Berlin Wall has disappeared, and everything is going well.’ So I can tell you it was a shock to come to Belfast, because the reality is that the problems are not over. There is peace, due to the Good Friday Agreement, but there are still these tensions. There are fences that are 12 metres high – today in the 21st century! I have to tell you that keeping this Good Friday Agreement is key. It is a ceasefire. It is a little bit of a guarantee in a frozen conflict. The worst thing what can happen is that we lose the peace that Europe has brought there, to Northern Ireland, with the efforts that we in the European Union have made. I stood next to memorials where you see pictures of young people aged 15 or 16 who died in a conflict based on nationalism, based on extremism. So, to ensure that the violence does not return is, I think, an absolute priority for this House. (Applause) And that means – and this is a question I would put to the negotiator – why not attach the Good Friday Agreement as a declaration to the withdrawal agreement that we are going to secure? And, of course, let us not return to a border there on the island of Ireland because then the violence will certainly return. My second worry is about citizens’ rights. You will be aware of the so—called deportation letters that were sent out by the UK authorities a short time ago. There have been excuses by the UK Government, saying that it was a mistake, but I have difficulty believing that. Why do I say that? Well, when it comes to collectively securing the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, the UK authorities tell us it is not possible: they don’t know them and they don’t know where they are. Yet, when it comes to sending a deportation letter, they find their addresses! So I want to say – in all honesty and very calmly – that I do not think we can accept a situation in which three million of our citizens would need to ask for settled status in Britain, with the huge administrative burden that would entail. Our proposal is very simple: let us recognise this collectively; let us give EU citizens living in the UK the same rights that they have now. And let’s do exactly the same for the UK citizens living on the continent. (Applause from certain quarters) I am asking myself why we are still discussing this. This can, in fact, be solved immediately by recognising their rights – recognising the rights of all citizens. Lastly, on the financial settlement, I will not repeat what has already been said. We are fully in agreement that you cannot pay with 27 what has been committed by 28. To conclude, it is true, Mr Fitto, that Ms May made a number of clarifications in her Florence speech, but not enough – let us be honest – for even you to say that there is sufficient progress. So what I hope is that, in her address tomorrow to the Conservative Party conference, she will bring further clarity so that, on that basis, concrete proposals can be put on the negotiation table before Michel Barnier. Finally, I hope that the ECR Group too will show massive support for this resolution in the vote at midday.

You know where we Greens, and the European Free Alliance, wanted your country to be: to remain at the heart of the European Union. But the majority of those British citizens who voted decided otherwise. While we accept the result of the referendum, this decision will produce no winners. Not only the business we do with one another but also the interests of both UK citizens and citizens of the EU 27 will be harmed by the separation. British citizens come to see me every week, to alert me to the damage that will be inflicted on your healthcare system or on the quality of research in your top universities, where so many EU nationals are working day in, day out. Above all, both British citizens in the EU 27 and UK citizens on the continent have been thrown into total disarray, and Europeans in the UK have started experiencing administrative vexations before Brexit has even started. If we want to limit the inevitable damage that will be caused by this lose-lose situation we should waste no more time, and negotiate in good faith. But make no mistake about it, no deal by March 2019 would be the worst deal for everyone and, firstly, for our respective citizens. Allow me at this stage to point to two contradictions in the position of your own Prime Minister. The first concerns Ireland. How can she say, on the one hand, that there will be no border and, on the other hand, that she will take the United Kingdom out of the Customs Union, the single market and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice? This will create a border, and I do not know where to place it while at the same time respecting the Good Friday Peace Agreement. The second contradiction is this idea that in order for Britain to become global it needs to cut its ties with its closest neighbours, with whom it shares history and geography. I believe that, rather than being an impediment to Britain being global, the European Union is the only way for it as a European country, and one of a number of former imperial powers, to have any influence in a world where it represents barely one percent of the population. In the 21st century, more than ever, size matters. Let me conclude with a few words on democracy. As your Prime Minister explained, the decision to leave the European Union is a statement as to how you want your democracy to work. I take exception to the idea that only if the UK leaves the EU would decisions that affect your daily lives be taken by people directly accountable to you. Who adopts EU law? On the one hand, this European Parliament was elected by, and is accountable to, the very same people who elect your national parliaments. On the other hand, the Council is 28 governments who are accountable to their citizens via their national parliaments. In other words, every EU law is decided by people who are directly accountable to you sitting at the table and taking part. But let’s be frank with one another: what seems unacceptable to some is that, in certain cases, Britain might be outvoted. That, I am afraid, is a rule of democracy, and one that your own government has no qualms about invoking by remarkably overruling the pro-remain majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland. If democracy can be had only at the level of the nation state, I know many regions which would immediately aspire to become one. (Heckling) Indeed! And if a democratic union is possible, Mr Farage, between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, then it can certainly be possible between European nation states. A majority of the British voters instructed Her Majesty’s Government to negotiate Brexit. Let us respect the democratic vote and do just that, without further delay. But if we want to be fair to those same citizens, let them, or at least those people who have been elected to represent them, have the last word on this story.

One of the reasons why I always wanted Brexit was because I thought the system of law-making whereby the Commission has the sole right to initiate legislation was something that would in fact damage, and in the end destroy, any concept of national democracy. And yes, I’ve called the European Union undemocratic; I’ve called it anti-democratic, but never in my fiercest criticisms here did I think that we would see the police of a Member State of the Union injuring 900 people in an attempt to stop them going out to vote. Whether or not it was legal nationally for people in Catalonia to have a vote, surely, people are allowed to express an opinion. We saw women being dragged out of polling stations by their hair, old ladies with gashes in their foreheads. It was the most extraordinary display – and what do we get from Mr Juncker today? Not a dickey bird. In fact, previously we heard that the rule of law must be maintained, and it is quite extraordinary to realise that this Union is prepared to turn a blind eye.  Can you imagine if the British police roughed up a couple of Scottish National Party protesters, or if something happened against a pro-Brexit rally? You would all be screaming blue murder. Indeed, the calls would be that the United Kingdom must go before the European Court of Human Rights, and yet you don’t even want to talk about this. Knowing, as I do, your advanced plans, with seven of the Member States here having their military police – your European Gendarmerie Force – all I can say once again is ‘thank God we’re leaving’. Brexit was an act of liberation. It was a voice of national self-determination that cannot, and will not, be stopped. But throughout this negotiating process, you have treated us as if we’re some kind of a hostage from the start, and unless we pay a ransom, unless we meet all of your demands, then you won’t even have an intelligent conversation with us about trade heading on from here.  There are no guarantees that – whatever Ms May says or does – you will ever come to us, even when we have met your demands, and want to have a sensible trade agreement. It was sad, in fact it was pitiful, to see the British Prime Minister in Florence. I have heard you saying that she is being conciliatory, that she is being grown up, that people are happy with what she said. Actually Ms May, I am sad to say, is not worldly enough to recognise that when you face up to a bully, the one thing that you do not do is try to appease them. She is begging you to give her a transition period and there is no guarantee that you will do it, so I do actually agree with the criticisms that I have heard around the room about the mixed messages coming out from the UK government. I just hope that in Manchester the Conservative Party starts to say in public what they are all saying to me in private: that she is a waste of space, that she needs to go, and that we need a proper prime minister who says to Monsieur Barnier ‘okay, here’s a deadline, here’s a date, we work towards that date. If we can’t reach a sensible deal on trade and everything else, then we are simply leaving and reverting to WTO rules’. This charade cannot go on year after year. After all, we voted Brexit.

A lot of time has been lost, and we now see a more positive dynamic. At the same time, a number of fundamental issues have yet to be clarified, and problems remain to be solved. For this reason, it is very important that the message that comes from this Parliament is clearly heard and understood. A positive conclusion of the first phase of the negotiations is possible, but we are not yet there. The Parliament is, and will be, open and constructive in its assessment, but we are, and will be, equally firm on our principles. First, of course, a full safeguard of citizens’ rights, which is our first priority. The positive principle of direct effect of the agreement must be underpinned by an effective mechanism which allows the Court of Justice to ensure a consistent interpretation of its provisions. Second, as we are safeguarding existing rights and not discussing future UK immigration rules, we will not accept to depart from any of the current provisions, in particular about future family members of eligible citizens that should have the same rights as current family members, about the declaratory nature of documents, about the need to avoid any burdensome administrative procedure, and on the possibility to export social benefits. On Ireland, our resolution is extremely clear, and on financial settlement it is extremely important that the now-shared principle, apparently, that all commitments made by the UK during its membership of the Union shall be honoured is implemented fully and consistently. On the basis of this short analysis of the points, it is clear that, despite some positive steps forward, a lot of work is still required in order to move to phase two of the negotiations. So, as we say in the resolution, unless a major breakthrough takes place next week, the European Council should postpone its assessment of sufficient progress. By stating this obvious element, we are not closing a door. We are pointing out a way forward that is fair for both the EU and the UK. In this respect, we have to be clear on the transition. First, it can be discussed and agreed only after sufficient progress on the withdrawal agreement. Second, it should be based on the full existing EU regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and should, of course, fully include the free movement of citizens.

I will always remember, at the time of the ceasefires in 1994, when I went with my other two MEP colleagues from Northern Ireland to the meeting with Jacques Delors which brought about the Peace programme. At that time, over GBP 2 billion in extra funding was given to Northern Ireland and to the border counties in the Republic. However, in this resolution, it is clear to me that you are now taking sides in Northern Ireland, Mr Verhofstadt. Let me make it clear to you, Mr Verhofstadt, that peace in Northern Ireland was won by the leader of my party, now Lord Trimble, and the leader of the SDLP, Mr John Hume. They bore the brunt at a time when the other party leaders, represented on both sides in this House, who are now that the lead parties in Northern Ireland, stood on the sidelines and did nothing to help to bring peace in Northern Ireland. In fact, they have messed it up big time, which does not make the situation we have today any easier. Shortly after those ceasefires, by calling for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and the customs union with the rest of the United Kingdom, Mr Verhofstadt is essentially calling for an international border to be placed between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain. Let me make it very clear: I will not accept any attempt by anyone in this Parliament to use Brexit as an excuse to break up my country. At its heart, this proposal goes against the Belfast Agreement the Parliament is mandated to protect and defend. The Belfast Agreement is clear: Northern Ireland is a full part of the United Kingdom, and we entered into the then EEC as one United Kingdom and we will leave the European Union as one United Kingdom.  This is a sad day for me. If the Parliament supports this text, it will be turning its back on decades of good relations with all communities in Northern Ireland. Mr Verhofstadt, you can no longer be deemed to be neutral after this resolution. That is your mistake. It is a huge mistake, and today I have heard nothing new. Unless we have a change in the direction this is heading, we are heading for a crash.

I know how important it is that realism and pragmatism is allowed to inform and shape the debate and the negotiations, and we are lucky to have an excellent negotiator in Michel Barnier. In this context, the European Parliament proposal of a transitional period is very much welcomed, because it ensures that we have sufficient time to ensure that we have an orderly and civilised divorce at the end of the process, where citizens’ rights are secured both for the EU citizens residing in the UK and vice versa, the UK citizens residing on the continent. I really look forward to a more dignified debate after this. I pay attention to Mr Farage, who has now left the room, but he is not willing to discuss Brexit; he wants to discuss anything but Brexit.

How can we protect them from sudden regressions dictated by the principle that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\". Will we really be willing to ask the Europeans in the UK and the British in the Union to put their future on hold pending the final agreement? Another question concerns freedom of movement: what I fear is that Brexit will take advantage of reducing this freedom for us too, especially for unskilled jobs.

I commend our coordinator, Mr Barnier, for keeping that unity in check. But where the EU is united against the UK, I assure you the UK is anything but united.  I represent Scotland within this House. We desire to remain within our family of nations; 48% of the UK population want to remain. The idea that Theresa May leads a united government is a risible proposition, as we see on a daily basis from our own colleagues who are treating her as a Viking longship that they are going to float out into the North Sea, having piled as much nonsense onto it as possible, and then they’ll set fire to it. They’re fighting amongst themselves like ferrets in a sack, while the UK’s national interest, however we define it, is ignored by them utterly. Shame on them. It is not good enough for Europe, it is not good enough for the UK either.  And from Scotland, we agree with the tone and content of this resolution. We have seen nowhere near enough progress on citizens’ rights, on Ireland or in the financial settlement. On citizens’ rights, I am receiving emails on a daily basis that would break your heart – people who have made choices about their lives, about their residence – on the basis of rights which they face having taken away. Our first duty in this House is to them. On Ireland, north and south, Scotland’s close neighbours and friends, solutions are possible; solutions could be found, but we need to see a lot more seriousness from the UK government than we have seen to date. The Good Friday Agreement is fragile; it must be respected. We need to see seriousness from the UK administration. And on the financial settlement, it says just how far the UK’s reputation has been trashed, that the idea that the UK will meet its financial obligations is news. If Global Britain’s first act is to walk away from international financial contributions, it is just not a serious prospect. I fear for the future unless we see some real seriousness in these discussions. Scotland wants to find solutions, colleagues. We must see more seriousness from the UK in that endeavour.

The second reason, of course, is Mrs May, who simply doesn’t have a clue. She has neither the courage, the will nor the resolve to actually see these so-called negotiations through. But Mrs May has made some very serious and dangerous concessions already. What has she actually said? 15 months already after the referendum, nothing much has changed. She intends that we should leave the European Union on March 2019. We will leave the Commission, we will leave the Council, we will no longer have members of the European Parliament. We’ve left. But nothing much very changes, nothing much at all changes. She’s said that we are going to incorporate all EU law into UK law. And then she wants another two years transition period, which will take us up to five years from the referendum, during which case nothing much changes on immigration, the laws don’t change, and she has made one very, very, very dangerous concession, which is talking about an EU treaty on security and defence. We will continue to be bound to your military ambitions. We will continue to be bound to your security policy and foreign policy and to all the police and criminal justice measures like the hated European arrest warrant. She has not got a clue. And what she’ll end up with is a withdrawal agreement whereby we leave in name but we do not leave in reality.

Mr Barnier, you will recall the very first meeting of the negotiations, one year after the referendum. The British Government did not put a single position paper on the table at that meeting. Here we are, six months after triggering Article 50, and we have no agreement on the issues in the first phase of those negotiations, despite David Davis, rightly or wrongly, accepting the sequencing that was proposed for those negotiations. This is just not good enough. The motion for resolution before Parliament hopes that progress can still be achieved by the next meeting of the European Council – only two weeks away. There is indeed another negotiating round. I suppose this hope is based on the fact that maybe, after the Conservative Party conference has finished this week, there may be some movement in the Conservative Government. I would say, ‘don’t count on it’. Mrs May’s Florence speech was not so much to improve and clarify her positioning for the negotiations with the 27, it was to improve her negotiating position within the British Conservative Party, and it has clearly failed even to do that. They are still at loggerheads, they are still divided, and sometimes I wonder whether they don’t even want to move on to the second phase of the negotiations because they do not yet know what kind of relationship they want to secure for the future.

Chairman! This week there were visits from Copenhagen in London. The Danish Minister of Business and Economy left with the Danish Governor and with him 20 CEOs from the largest Danish financial houses and pension funds. So what were they going to do in London? Yes, they should be in the fight to attract some of the 30,000 financial jobs currently on the way out of London to other parts of Europe. From all over Europe - Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and everywhere else - the financial bosses are now in London to find out how to attract all these people. It seems that in some parts of the UK, people have found out that this is the wrong course to take and that they are paying the price for the consequences of what is happening. In the year and a half that has passed since Brexit, I have been shaken by the predictability of moving out into the swamp from the British side. I still need to hear what the British Government will do with the 759 agreements with 168 countries outside the EU that are to be renegotiated.

Many previous speakers have already pointed out: Sufficient progress with regard to the divorce conditions has not yet been ascertained. The British side has to deliver on this. And even if some progress has been made through the speech in Florence, it remains Mrs May's task to create a little more clarity tomorrow at the British Conservative Congress. And then we have to see what begins in the next round of negotiations. Otherwise it won't work in October, as has already been mentioned several times. But it is also in our own interest that we organize future relations with the United Kingdom properly and that we continue to cultivate a strong economic and political partnership.

Second, the United Kingdom never seems to have believed that the EU 27 would preserve its unity. Indeed, the UK made a serious diplomatic effort to split that unity. This failed.  Third, the EU’s position was made very clear indeed in the Council mandate and in the various statements by Michel Barnier. Despite the clarity, the message never seems to get through. The UK side, when it responds, does so in vague all too often unfocused language or makes complaints of inflexibility or punishment. Fourth, the discussion in the UK itself seems to be entirely unaware of what the EU is saying. It is as if the UK has become another planet. From the outset, in the 1970s – and I was there – the UK never sought to understand what the EU was for. The attitude was entirely transactional. Equally England – and I mean England, and not the UK as a whole – has become intensely focused on itself, thereby making it very hard to see the EU as it is, a body of values.

Some progress has been made was in relation to a transition period. This has now been recognised, and I appreciate that. However, one thing I would say is that a transition period needs to be open-ended, with a target minimum length of maybe two years, without setting a maximum, because it is during that transition period that people will realise what Mr Barnier has said today and what has not been realised up till now: that the consequences, like the extraordinary complexity of the issue, have been underestimated. Given enough time, people will realise that, and then come to an arrangement that would be in the best interests of the EU and the best interests of the United Kingdom and of Ireland. The other point I would like to make is that an awful lot of speeches, even here today, have to be taken with a pinch of salt, because they are aimed at constituents back home. This is grandstanding.

The UK in this way abandons a community of more than 500 million people, a community that has an essential role in the future of our continent and the world. The economic impact of that is just one small part of the problem, but it is an important one. Let me illustrate that in numbers: the UK, by leaving the single market, will make it complicated for its businesses to join and use the market of 450 million people, while the opposite way around this is just 65 million people.  In today’s interconnected and highly effective world, any uncertainty means job losses, lower wages and budget and investment problems. Unfortunately, for the time being, it seems to me that we are not on the way to reducing this uncertainty. The reason is that while the EU 27 has quite a clear negotiating position, it seems to me that the UK side of the negotiation table is trying to square a circle. We know that squaring a circle is not possible, and we have known that for more than 100 years.  It is time to act. It is important that we can move forward, and the recent speeches by the UK Prime Minister show the possibility to get improvement, but they must understand that there are some limits and some conditions that must be fulfilled.

Britain will still live, but has, as it were, said that they want to move down to the basement, maybe live on the couch. I have been following trade negotiations in this House for 13 years. This is really exactly the same thing, but the opposite. Because in trade negotiations, everyone is a winner. It removes barriers to trade and borders that everyone benefits from, regardless of who gives in. But here we do the opposite. Here we negotiate what trade barriers and borders we should travel - a negotiation where everyone becomes a loser. The question is just how much. And we do not know, because the United Kingdom has no idea what trade barriers or borders it wants to impose. But to succeed, we must always have the same thing: a clear mandate and broad political support. The EU is a role model there.

There is an urgent need for the United Kingdom to commit to safeguarding the rights of resident European citizens.

We need this support and this confidence, and also this unity shown by the overwhelming majority of Parliament. At the end of this debate, during which I have listened to you all carefully and apologizing for not responding, as I usually do, to each of you, I would like to say a few words briefly. First, I would like to make it clear to many of those who have spoken, that there are two words that I cannot accept because they do not correspond to my state of mind or my attitude. These are the words of revenge and punishment. I have admired the United Kingdom for a very long time. I often even remember that in 1972, for my first vote as a young French citizen, I was then 21 years old, I campaigned in favor of the referendum organized in my country for the accession of the United Kingdom, of Ireland, Denmark and Norway. It was not easy for the young member of the Gaullist party that I was at the time, and I have never regretted the vote. I have great admiration for your country, ladies and gentlemen of the United Kingdom, and you will never, ever, find in my attitude the slightest spirit of revenge and the slightest intention of punishment. Never! (Applause) Mr. Farage, there is another word that I do not accept and that you have said again, which is ransom. There is no ransom, there is no exit bill. There is just the fact that when you decide to leave, we ask you to settle the accounts. No more no less! To pay for what you have agreed to! (Loud applause) I would add that this point is important if we want, as you yourself wished, to build in the future a different, but solid and lasting relationship in terms of trade, in terms of protection of security, counterterrorism and defense. We need trust between us for a lasting relationship in the future. The key to this trust is also that you objectively agree to settle the accounts. There is something that both of you said that I do not understand. It’s the idea that the European negotiator that I am or the European Union would like to drag things along or would want to hold you back, that it would play time. But, Ladies and Gentlemen, the referendum in the United Kingdom took place on June 23, 2016. We received the letter from Theresa May notifying this desire to withdraw on March 30, 2017. We have, due to the elections in the United Kingdom, waited until the end of June 2017 to start this negotiation. We are not playing for time. You took the time. We respect this time, but frankly I cannot accept this criticism. (Loud applause) We are even ready, and I am ready, to speed up and intensify the pace of the negotiations as much as we can. Ladies and gentlemen, there are a few points that I would like to be understood by telegraph or better understood. The UK has decided to leave the European Union. This is his sovereign choice. At the same time, according to what the British government says, he is leaving \"the single market and the customs union\" after 44 years of integration. I recommend that no one, really no one, underestimate the complexity, the legal, human, social, economic and financial difficulties of this decision. I also recommends that everyone who made this decision agree to accept the consequences. (Applause) Second point, we respect the sovereign choice of British citizens. We implement the withdrawal you have chosen. We want this withdrawal to be orderly, and for a lot of reasons I think it's better that you leave the European Union on March 30 with an agreement rather than without an agreement. It is in the common interest. We respect this choice, but we ask you to respect the European Union. We ask you to respect the fact that we will be intransigent on the integrity of the single market, respect for the operating rules and the decision-making autonomy of the European Union. Brexit cannot have consequences paid for by European Union taxpayers. Brexit cannot have the consequence of weakening the single market and the four freedoms that are intrinsically part of it. (Loud applause) Finally, we will have each other, and you ladies and gentlemen deputies as elected representatives of the peoples, to be accountable to the citizens, who are our priority, when it comes to their rights. We will be accountable to taxpayers. We will be accountable to businesses. We will also be accountable to those who have built this European Union for 60 years and of which we are the co-owners and co-responsible. I simply want the accounts that we are going to render at the end of these negotiations, ladies and gentlemen, to be fair and true. I will not come back to the various points of the negotiations which are pending. We have made progress, clarified a lot of points. I say that the general interest requires moving forward in stages. We have little time between now and October or November 2018 to come up with this Brexit treaty, that is, on divorce or orderly withdrawal, and the case appropriate, since this was requested by the British government, over a possible transitional period, the conditions of which were clearly framed by your resolution of last April and by the Council guidelines. It will be a short, structured period, during which we will maintain, because it is our raison d'être, the entire regulatory architecture of budgetary, legal conditions and the role of the Court of Justice. It is your request to have this short transition period, it is our right to say that it will be done under the conditions which are those of the single market. We are not surprised by this transition request, we planned it, we will discuss it when the time comes, and I will need a mandate to do so. I'm also just clarifying a legal point for Mr. Farage. The trade agreement you want cannot be signed with a member state of the Union. You have to be legally out, you have to be out, for us to sign this agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, throughout this ongoing negotiation, we will keep the hope that the constructive tone adopted by Theresa May in her speech in Florence will be maintained and consolidated, and that we will be able to make further progress from next week. . As far as I am concerned, in the responsibility entrusted to me, with your trust and support, throughout the months to come, I will ensure that the negotiations remain dignified, calm and firmly committed to the principles of the European Union.

The fact is that Britain can leave the Union without a real agreement to resign, because, under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TFEU), mere notification is enough. It is therefore in the interests of all EU countries and citizens that a divorce agreement be reached. British Prime Minister May has said that it is better to leave without an agreement than with a bad agreement. The EU should strive to avoid an unconventional situation, as this would make it more difficult to foreign trade and the status of citizens. It is clear that Britain requires a comprehensive free trade agreement in addition to a severance agreement. It would therefore be best to move forward quickly in the negotiations and ensure that a free trade agreement that benefits all parties can emerge. In this way, it is possible to reach a resignation agreement on the basis of which Britain will be able to meet its financial obligations for a longer period of time. If the costs were to increase because Britain would not meet its obligations after March 2019, the consequences would be disproportionate for the taxpayers of all the remaining EU countries.

Therefore, any negotiations on the post-Brexit status of Union citizens in the United Kingdom or of Brits in the Union should be based on this right. Therefore, there can be no consent to any changes in their legal or factual position. London's new proposals do not comply with this law, as they allow limitations, for example, in the law to family reunification, and also introduce a new, not fully defined category of a settled person. The negotiating progress made in this regard is therefore far from sufficient. The prolonged talks increase the uncertainty among ordinary people, neither the citizens of the Union living in Great Britain, nor the British in the Union know what the future awaits them.

Europol’s assessment of the threat posed by cybercrime is that it has affected the fundamental rights of individuals and that 80% of companies in Europe have experienced at least one cybersecurity incident. Children who are using the internet at an early age are particularly vulnerable to cybercrime. The proposals outlined by this report aim to address these challenges. They include improved responsibility and liability of service providers, and enhanced cooperation among police and judicial authorities, etcetera.

Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, the last few years have been particularly intense for our relationship with Moldova. There are several reasons for this, including geography and the close ties between our people. But there is one reason in particular I would like to focus on, and that is the kind of relationship that we have proposed to Moldova. A partnership with the European Union is not about spheres of influence and geopolitics. We do not ask our partners to pick sides. They do not have to choose between us and other global powers – this is not how our partnership works. Our partnership is always about improving the life of our citizens, inside the European Union, and of course inside Moldova. It is a partnership for, not against. It is about the economy and trade. It is about democracy, human rights, the rule of law and the fight against corruption. It is with this attitude that we are heading towards our Eastern Partnership Summit next month. This is the spirit that led to the new association agenda that we adopted with Moldova last August, setting out the priorities for the implementation of the association agreement in the coming two years. And this is also the spirit that leads us to speak out when we see new challenges emerge for democracy in Moldova. This is what we did last July when a new electoral law was adopted. Commissioner Hahn and the Vice-President/High Representative said very clearly many times that the new legislation contradicts the recommendations of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Both these institutions had pointed towards the importance of broad political consensus on the reform, and of avoiding a system that would expose candidates to the influence of business interests. These suggestions have not been addressed by the new electoral law. Since then, the law has not yet been implemented. The effects of this law on multi-party democracy will depend on how it is implemented. From our side, I can assure you that we will continue to closely monitor developments, particularly on the definition of single-mandate constituencies. I know that you have discussed the electoral law within the framework of the decision on a macro-financial assistance programme for Moldova. This decision has been adopted in agreement with the European Parliament, and entered into force on 23 September 2017. Any payment, though, will depend on the respect by Moldova of political preconditions and by the implementation of a Memorandum of Understanding that we will sign with Moldova. These conditions will include reforms that are necessary to guarantee macro-financial stabilisation, together with the implementation of our Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. Turning now to reform for business, a healthy economy requires transparency in the financial and public sector; it requires a strong fight against corruption and money laundering; it requires a positive business climate. These are the reforms we will be asking for, because these are the reforms that the people of Moldova expect. As you know, a massive banking fraud was recently unveiled in the country: a comprehensive investigation and the recovery of the diverted funds are also essential to the credibility of Moldova’s economic system. Last year, in 2016, we saw important reform in the energy sector, including on the use of renewable sources: it is now crucial to complete this reform process, with the swift adoption of the energy law. But a strong economy also needs to be supported by a strong and functioning democracy. For this reason, we will continue to monitor how Moldova implements recommendations of international partners regarding the new electoral law. A healthy democracy does not only depend on a good electoral law: it also needs a strong judicial system, a serious fight against corruption, and of course a free and open space for civil society organisations. These are the issues that matter to the people of Moldova, and so these are the issues we care about. Our budget support aims precisely at supporting good reform in these fields. For instance, we have a budget support programme to support reforms in the justice sector, and for the moment we will not transfer any funds related to this programme since there has not been sufficient progress to justify these payments. There are also other pending budget support payments that are linked to democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Turning to assistance now, this is how our partnership works. If you look at our package of assistance for 2017 to 2020, it has a strong focus on projects directly benefiting citizens, for instance on rural development, infrastructure and women’s empowerment. Our assistance aims at supporting the reforms that will move Moldova forward, particularly towards the goal of political association and economic integration with the European Union. The more Moldova does to address its citizens’ needs, the stronger our assistance and support.  When we discuss budget lines and reforms, it may sound like we are talking technicalities. But everything we do has a very concrete impact on the lives of many – in the European Union and in Moldova. It is a partnership for our people, with very practical benefits for both sides. Take the visa liberalisation that allows our citizens to travel freely between the European Union and Moldova, or the reforms that were adopted last year after our Council Conclusions on the Republic of Moldova of February 2016. The European Parliament has been very active in shaping our partnership and making sure that we always focus on what truly matters: helping Moldova become a stronger country with stronger democratic institutions and a stronger economy: a country that can truly address its citizens’ needs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 163, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, in the pre-holiday session we discussed in this Parliament the macro-financial assistance provided to Moldova.

What happened two weeks after our discussion and vote in Parliament, with which the Commission and the Council agreed in Chisinau, despising all these references, Parliament voted to amend the electoral law. Why did this happen? We have an explanation at hand because, publicly, President Dodon, a close associate of Putin, and the leader of the Democratic Party, a close associate of our European socialist colleagues, considered that Moldova's number one problem was the elimination of all parties except those on which they themselves lead. In these circumstances, I think it is reasonable to ask the Commission to strictly apply the precondition set and to suspend the transfer of macro-financial assistance.

I heard today in the speech of my Romanian colleague the same thesis, an alleged complicity between the Democratic Party and the pro-Russian president Dodon, and I invite you to discuss the facts. I will not discuss the economic part, you know better than me, the economic situation is in favor of the Republic of Moldova and this has been confirmed by the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. First of all, the Government of the Republic of Moldova participated with military forces in the maneuvers organized by NATO in Ukraine this summer in response to the Zapad 2017 maneuvers. This was done with the opposition of President Dodon. The President of the Republic of Moldova, the pro-Russian Dodon, systematically opposed the two-time nomination of the Minister of Defense. The government of the Republic of Moldova asked the Russian troops to leave Transnistria and did so from the tribune of the United Nations in New York. What is even more important, these days, in the Republic of Moldova, the amendment of the Constitution is being discussed in order to introduce a special article on European integration, so that a future Dodon cannot divert the course of this country. Are these facts complicities with Russia or are they exactly the opposite?

As a standing rapporteur, it is not the kind of attention I would like to see for Moldova so repeatedly.  Let me start by addressing the Moldovan authorities very frankly: the main thing that I miss in Moldovan politics is a critical lack of a real consensus in the national political field. Do not expect Brussels to do it for you. Consensus must be built on a daily basis in Chișinău, Bălți and Comrat. The newly adopted election law was clearly a bulldozer-type move – not what we expect from an EU-associated partner. As a result, respectable international bodies – the Venice Commission and the OSCE – are ignored and bypassed. At home, smaller political parties feel unfairly pressed and even eliminated. Moldovan citizens are waiting for a different type of politics. People, including us in this House, want to see the unimpeded publication of the Kroll 2 investigation report. We all expect no further delay in the identification and bringing to justice of those persons or politicians who are hiding behind this unprecedented bank fraud scandal. At the same time, we continue to be concerned to see biased legal proceedings, such as in the case of Chișinău Mayor, Dorin Chirtoacă. We stress that only an independent and depoliticised judiciary can deliver justice and trust.  I will keep repeating that I see today many missed opportunities for Moldova. As a true friend, I am critical of idea of the European future of Moldova. However, the country will continue losing until the moment when its authorities finally come to the conclusion that building a national consensus in a European way is exactly what makes Moldova’s statehood stronger and consolidates its society.

The state of crisis of 2015 has been replaced by steady progress on important reforms. The economic situation has stabilised with many indicators showing solid improvement. It is a fact! Political association and economic integration with the EU through the provisions of the Association Agreement and the DCFTA are proceeding at a stable pace.

The Republic of Moldova needs profound judicial reforms, the fight against corruption, public administration and many other areas. People are waiting for these reforms, and we must use all the tools at our disposal to accelerate the pace of reforms. We must not be afraid to apply conditionalities for the financial support we apply to the Republic of Moldova. On the contrary, conditionality is what the citizens of the Republic of Moldova expect. Citizens of the Republic of Moldova no longer want to give blank checks. Only by being firm in supporting these reforms will we have the support of the citizens. We have to be honest. The parliamentary majority in Chisinau changed the electoral legislation despite the opinion of the Venice Commission and the alarm signals sounded by the European Commission and lost, as such, our confidence. Satisfying ourselves with mimicking the reform process means being naive and losing the support of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova for the European integration process.

Both boys and girls suffer from child marriage, but girls, who make up 82 percent. married children are at greatest risk. And this problem is relevant not only in third countries, but also in Europe. Under Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU promotes the protection of the rights of the child, but early and forced marriages of children are a violation of these rights. One of the goals of the United Nations for sustainable development is to eliminate all harmful practices, including early and forced marriages of children. In addition, the elimination of early and forced marriages of children is included as one of the EU's priorities in the Joint Staff Working Document \"Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment: Changing the Lives of Girls and Women in EU External Relations (2016-2020)\", 2015-2020. 2019 The EU Action Plan on Human Rights and the Action Plan on Gender Equality, which emphasizes the need to ensure that women and girls can fully enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The EU has recently decided to sign the Istanbul Convention, which considers forced marriage to be a form of violence against women and calls for the measures set out therein to be extended to boys and men, as they may also be victims of forced marriage. The Convention requires the coercion of a child to marry and the lure of the child to another country in order to compel the marriage to be considered a crime. Early and forced marriages are highly detrimental to the overall realization of and access to the rights of girls and women, as well as to the health of girls, including the high risk of complications of pregnancy, often resulting in death, and HIV infection. Premature marriages put girls at risk of becoming victims of sexual abuse, domestic violence, and even honor killings. We must also appreciate the fact that there are very different officially registered ones the number of cases and potential victims requesting assistance, which shows that many marriages of children can take place without the attention of the authorities. It is therefore essential that social workers, teachers and other staff who deal directly with potential victims are provided with specific training and guides that explain how to identify victims and initiate assistance procedures for them. I would also like to remind you that Parliament condemns the renewal and extension of the non-funding rule for abortion support organizations and its impact on global health care for women and girls and their rights. And here I want to call once again on the EU and the Member States to fill the funding gap that has already opened up in the field of sexual and reproductive health with national and EU development funds. So the questions are for the Commissioner: how does the Commission assess the impact of projects and campaigns to combat child marriage and the level of funding allocated to this purpose in all the European Union's external actions? Does the Commission take account of child marriage rates in its cooperation agreements and does it set specific benchmarks to eradicate this phenomenon? What steps are being taken to ensure the protection of the rights and health of all children in the Member States of the European Union, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, in the event of child marriage and to apply harmonized legal standards, including the European Union's intention to ratify the Istanbul Convention? Finally, how do the Commission and the Member States deal with the issue of child marriage, especially with regard to refugee minors and asylum seekers?

We cannot accept or tolerate any kind of violence, including forced marriage. But it is a complex problem which cannot be solved at one stroke. As for question 1, we are participating in comprehensive programmes to put an end to harmful practices such as child marriage. Their impact can only be measured in the long term over generations. For example, in 2016 the EU contributed EUR 6 million to the UNICEF United Nations Population Fund Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage. This programme works at local, national and regional level and targets the communities of 12 countries. The objective is to improve access to services, strengthen enforcement mechanisms, increase girls’ empowerment and challenge social norms, so that girls can fully enjoy their childhood and grow up to control their own destiny. In 2019, when this programme comes to an end, we shall evaluate its quantitative impact using the quantitative indicators. The same applies to other ongoing projects to address child marriage which we are supporting in Tanzania, Niger, Mali, Malawi, Lesotho and Sudan. Beyond this targeted support, the EU also contributes to programmes dedicated to social protection, access to education, violence against children, and access to justice and health, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. They also contribute to a reduction in child marriage. As for question 2, accession to the Istanbul Convention is a priority for the Commission. The criminalisation of forced marriage based on the definition of the Istanbul Convention will remain a matter of Member State competence. However, many victims of forced marriage, especially underaged, may fall victim to other serious forms of gender-based crime, such as rape. This offence is criminalised in all EU Member States. The Victims’ Rights Directive provides for targeted and integrated support for victims with specific needs, such as victims of sexual violence, victims of gender—based violence and victims of violence in close relationships, including trauma support and counselling or shelter for victims in need of a safe place. The EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention would further strengthen the Union’s framework on protection of and support to victims of forced marriage and other crimes covered by the Convention. For instance, the Istanbul Convention will require the EU to ensure that resident status is granted to victims of gender-based violence, which could be independent from that of the spouse, and that victims may obtain the suspension of expulsion. The Convention requires that gender-based violence against women be recognised as a form of persecution under the Geneva Convention and that the obligation of non—refoulement is applied to women victims in need of protection where they might be subject to torture or inhuman treatment or punishment. As regards sexual and reproductive health, the Istanbul Convention provides for a prohibition of forced abortion and sterilisation, for instance, abortion without full and informed consent. It does, however, not contain provisions regarding rights to safe abortion or as to whether abortion in unsafe conditions constitutes violence against women. On 25 November 2016 the Commission launched a year of focused actions to combat violence against women. The focused actions, which involve local, national and EU-level initiatives, aim to mobilise, connect and support all relevant stakeholders in combating the problem and to ensure the dissemination of good practices across the EU.  Let me now answer question 3. Married minors are also considered vulnerable under the EU asylum acquis and therefore benefit from special rights and procedural guarantees. It will often be the case that the law or practice of the responsible Member State does not recognise an adult spouse as being responsible for a minor spouse. Therefore, if the minor spouse travels only with the adult spouse and is not accompanied by her parents or tutor, the married minor would often be considered unaccompanied and thus in need of special guarantees. Moreover, non—consensual child marriages are prohibited by international law. The authorities of the Member State of arrival have an obligation to verify if the minor has consented to the marriage. If this is not the case, the child must be offered protection. This issue is to be distinguished from the separate matter of whether the legal effects of the marriage undertaken in the country of origin or prior to arrival in the EU can or cannot be recognised according to the national law of the Member State responsible.

Let’s say together: enough is enough! Child marriage is child abuse. Girls are exposed to rape, domestic and even honour violence. It can be devastating for their health, with serious risks concerning pregnancy and infections.  Child marriage is a crime recognised under the Istanbul Convention on Violence against Women. Once again, I call on all Member States to ratify and enforce the Convention, to combat impunity and protect girls. Many girls seeking asylum arrive in Europe married – in Sweden alone there are132. Authorities must consider the best interests of the child. A child is first of all a child, and we cannot have parallel communities in Europe where child marriage is tolerated. There is no tradition and no culture that can justify child abuse.  Girls forced to marry are forced out of school. Desperate parents give away daughters to older men to save them from poverty. But on the contrary, early marriage condemns girls to poverty and discrimination. Education is the best chance for girls to be empowered. No child should be deprived of their childhood.  Civil society plays a key role. The Girls not Brides global partnership, UNICEF, ombudsmen and many others in civil society deserve more support. President Trump’s global gag rules will affect projects for thousands and of girls who are victims of child marriage. Europe should step in and provide resources.  I call on the High Representative on the Commission to do more in all EU external action to eliminate child marriage by helping countries to adopt and to enforce legislation. We need to combat stereotypes, change mentalities, work with family and community leaders and break the vicious circle of submission and violence.  Mr President, in conclusion, as author of the European People’s Party Group resolution and co-Chair of the Intergroup on Children’s Rights, I call for your support.

It's an important question: by choice? Unfortunately, this cannot be taken for granted worldwide. 700 million women worldwide are forcibly married, more than 250 million of them were under 15 years old at the time of the so-called marriage. Every year, 15 million girls around the world are married before they are of legal age - this corresponds to a child marriage every two seconds. And that's not a cultural peculiarity, it's not a trivial offense. No, anyone who forcibly marries children is abusing them. Anyone who abuses children is committing a crime. Europe is determined to fight child marriage worldwide - so it is written. It becomes far less clear when we go to the national level. Most Member States have now banned child marriages, but few take effective action against marriages already concluded abroad. These have increased significantly with the current refugee crisis. My passionate appeal is: zero tolerance against child marriages, even if they were concluded abroad! The well-being of the girls must be our goal, their future must be all of our help.

It denies girls their right to health, education, living safely and choosing who to marry and, if so, when and how. Without economic independence, girls drop out of education and are trapped, along with their families and communities, in a cycle of poverty. In more than 20 countries around the world, a girl is more likely to cross the threshold of the conjugal bedroom than that of her high school class. To combat the phenomenon of girl-brides we need a holistic and comprehensive approach, which is adjusted to local contexts and the particularities of each community. We need true coordination of various sectors, including education, health, justice and economic development. Ending child marriage requires targeting the most affected countries with significant and well-targeted investments, both from international donors and governments. We must also cut development aid to those countries that refuse to limit the minimum age of marriage to 18. Although we should not forget what happens in Europe due to the lack of legal harmonization: in Spain, in my country, the minimum age to marry is still 16 years. But the most important thing is to empower girls. We must work directly with them so that they can acquire skills and knowledge, so that they see the possibilities they have to choose from with real cases, so that they understand and exercise their rights and create their authentic support networks.

It denies them the right to make decisions about their well-being and sexual health, in due course. It robs them of their right to education. It condemns them to a life without prospects. These girls and girls are exposed to violence, abuse, disease and early death. They become pregnant when they are girls. Many die of childbirth. Others are mothers when they should be learning or playing. They are wives when they should be children. They are marked by the violation of someone old enough to be their father. There is no single solution. There is a need for a collective effort. Ending child marriage requires work at all levels. In this respect, the European Union has an increased responsibility with regard to its foreign policy. It implies an action on our part that solves and kills this problem at its source.

Child marriages in third countries and child marriages at European Union level. At that first position, ie. child marriages in third countries, we need to put significant pressure on our partners to accept the Istanbul Convention. But the issue of child marriage as a principle of human rights violations should be much more included in our European diplomacy. In dealing with our partners, we should not just address the issue of freedom of expression, the death penalty or other forms of human rights violations. But we should also address this right, ie. the woman's right to self-determination and the right of an adult woman to decide freely whether or not to marry. It is about our diplomacy in negotiating with our partners, in providing financial assistance to third countries to include this as one of the conditions for us to provide some economic assistance to these countries. The second thing is child marriage in the EU. It has already been said here, their number is increasing with the arrival of other migrants in the EU. And here, personally, I am sorry that the resolution that we are voting on tomorrow merely states in paragraph 14 that child marriages in the EU need to be properly monitored.

It was on that occasion that our new Partnership Priorities were adopted. This was the first Association Council with Egypt in seven years, so the first since the beginning of the revolts in the Arab world. It is precisely in these times of transition that our cooperation becomes more important. It is important for the people of Egypt and their aspiration to security, democracy and economic growth. It is essential for the region – from Libya to Syria – and it is essential for Europe, because we are neighbours and we share many of the same challenges. So we are glad that we have managed to reopen such an important channel for dialogue with Egypt. This does not mean that the European Union and Egypt agree on all files. But precisely when you disagree on something, engagement becomes essential. There is no other way to address any outstanding issue, in the interest of the Egyptian people and of the whole region.  Our partnership with Egypt will be structured around four main tracks. Firstly, support to the Egyptian government’s socio-economic reform agenda. In this field, there has been much concrete progress in the last year: the Egyptian authorities adopted an economic reform plan supported by the International Monetary Fund, aimed at bringing back macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth. This is an important step, and we are eager to support the plan, including through our bilateral assistance programme. We are also keen to support Egypt’s efforts to address the social and economic impact of these reforms, particularly on the most vulnerable parts of the population.  The second track of our partnership is building stronger cooperation on common challenges, such as counterterrorism and migration. Terrorism poses a fundamental threat to Egypt’s stability and security. Time and again, we have stood on the side of the Egyptian people when they were hit by a new attack. It is not just ‘moral’ solidarity; we are ready for more concrete cooperation in this field, and the Partnership Priorities are giving us the opportunity to explore new forms of common engagement. Let me add that, whenever we discuss counterterrorism with our Egyptian counterparts, we always insist that repressive measures are never enough to address this issue. Terrorism needs to be tackled in full respect of international human rights standards and fundamental freedoms. On migration, Egypt has made an important contribution in hosting refugees, not least Syrian refugees. It has also significantly reduced irregular migration flows, through the implementation of the Valletta Action Plan and the Khartoum process. A better and more humane management of migration flows is in the interest first and foremost of migrants, but also of countries of origin, transit and destination. So we are currently working with our Egyptian counterparts to launch a high-level migration dialogue. The third track relates to closer dialogue and cooperation on foreign policy and regional issues. Egypt currently seats on both the UN Security Council and the African Union Political and Security Council. Beyond that, it is an essential partner to address other crises in our region, starting with the conflict between Israel and Palestine. We share an interest in working together more, including on the conflicts in Libya and Syria, as well as to address tensions in the Gulf. Last, but definitely not least, there is a strong political track in our partnership, which includes governance, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Union’s position on this is very clear and we reiterate it constantly in our dialogue with our Egyptian counterparts: sustainable security and stability can only be achieved when human rights – those guaranteed by the 2014 Constitution and flowing from Egypt’s international commitments – are fully implemented. If we want to help improve the situation of human rights in Egypt or to preserve the space for civil society, we have no alternative to engaging with them. It is in this spirit that the European Union Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, visited Egypt in February, to enhance dialogue on human rights with the Egyptian authorities. We continue to pass this message both in public and in private, in all our contacts both at bilateral level and in multilateral fora. This is what we did, for instance, on the possible consequences of the new NGO law. On NGOs, in particular, there is something we should not forget. The European Union is the biggest donor in Egypt. Total ongoing European Union financial assistance commitments to Egypt amount to over EUR 1.3 billion in grants. If Member State and European Financial Institutions’ grants, loans and debt-swaps are included, the figure rises to EUR 11 billion. A relevant part of this bilateral assistance relies on civil society organisations as implementing partners. Our partnership needs a strong and lively civil society, and this is something our Egyptian friends should also keep in mind.  The four tracks of our partnership are closely linked to one another. Sustainable security is linked to sustainable development, which is linked to human rights and to regional stability. This is the approach we have adopted with our Partnership Priorities, and this is the proof that only through engagement can we can address our common interests for the people of Egypt, for Europe and for our entire region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 270, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": ", on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the partnership between the Union and Egypt is important for the stability and prosperity of both shores of the Mediterranean. We have common interests, we also have to face common challenges like the fight against terrorism, human trafficking, migration and instability in our southern neighborhood. On all these fronts, we need more joint action. This is why our group welcomes the holding of the seventh EU-Egypt Association Council on 25 July. This has given additional impetus to this partnership, and we share the general direction of the priorities that have been agreed. I am particularly pleased to see that the section devoted to the principles of cooperation refers to the deepening of political dialogue on democracy and human rights and the need for collaboration with civil society organizations for the implementation of this partnership. Both dimensions are very important, since we know that much remains to be done in terms of respect for human rights and participation of civil society in Egypt. Moreover, when we talk to our Egyptian interlocutors, they are the first to recognize it. And I find it essential to continue working with them to promote human rights and to favor a constructive approach that will allow us to achieve better results on the ground. Thus, a fact-finding mission of the PPE Group, in which our colleagues Elmar Brok and Mariya Gabriel participated, was dispatched to Egypt in November 2016, and one of the main messages communicated to our partners is that the Union will support all measures aimed at the adoption of international human rights standards in Egypt. This is certainly a long-term job that must be constantly supported in order to promote true democratic transition in Egypt.In this regard, the monitoring and evaluation mechanism that will be put in place within the framework of the partnership will play a key role, and it will be necessary to ensure that it is sufficiently endowed to enable us to achieve these objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 271, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Victor BOŞTINARU", "mepid": "39711", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, Egypt is a key partner for the EU and we welcome the first EU-Egypt Association Council after the revolution and the adoption of the partnership priorities for the period 2017-2020.

Egypt is confronted with a challenging internal situation following the revolution and faces terrorism that continues to strike the country, with all its consequences on people, on tourism and on the economy.

I mentioned terrorism. There is no doubt that to defeat terrorism we need a close cooperation with all partners, including Egypt. In this regard, I welcome the efforts of the President el-Sisi to reform Islam and to prevent radicalisation, as well as the strong effort to protect Christians, which has recently prevented attacks being launched against the Christian communities.

After all, a heated debate has been raging in these social media for months about the results of President Sisi's rule and his prospects for re-election in April 2018. This debate is broadly positive for the Egyptian head of state: a broad re-election in April 2018 is in the pipeline. off. However, even among the sympathizers of President Sisi there is undeniably great disappointment about the country's downright dramatic socio-economic situation (bread riots for example). Which brings me to the major role the Egyptian military plays in the national economy. I would like to know from the Council and the Commission, if necessary in writing, how they deal with this military \"business empire\" within the framework of the partnership priorities between the EU and Egypt 2017-2020, which clearly speak about \"strengthening the role of the private sector \". I hope that the Commission will take note and that I will receive a written answer: the role of the military in the Egyptian economy. Consider this compatible with strengthening the private sector. In the official document on the Joint Partnership Priorities I read on page 7 that the EU and Egypt continue to work together in the fight against extremism, discrimination, including Islamophobia and xenophobia.

The circumstances that Egyptians live under and the EU’s relation to this crucial country merit a serious and critical assessment. Considering the increased focus on security, managing migration and now the EU-Egypt partnership, it is shocking and disappointing that the EPP and S&amp;D Groups have blocked this debate for three years and, even now, colleagues have ensured that this House does not express itself in a resolution this month. I consider this to be a cop-out. The human rights situation in Egypt cannot only be relevant for us when it hits home, however terrible the brutal murder of Giulio Regeni might be, and I too echo the ongoing calls for justice in that case. But countless Egyptians face grave injustices and violations of their rights, and we must address their fate too. They face systematic torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, and all of this is happening with impunity. Civilians are still tried by military courts and we have now seen 22 cases of death sentences. Very restrictive NGO laws make the work of civil society, including EU-based organisations, nearly impossible. Journalists and bloggers are harassed – and I want to highlight particularly the ongoing imprisonment of Alaa Abd El-Fattah – and they cannot work freely, and that is unacceptable. Add to that the recent wave of arrests of gay people and the intimidation of LGBT people. That is also unacceptable.  No short-term cooperation in the field of anti-terrorism or ‘migration management’ can compensate for these gross violations, nor can they justify the EU’s ongoing silence. Egyptians deserve better and need better. We know what a boiling point can be reached if the needs of young people are not addressed. There cannot be a partnership without respect for human rights.

Many of you have addressed the different problems relating to human rights. Human rights are an integral part of our partnership priorities and we address the situation not only through bilateral dialogue, silent diplomacy and formal demands, but also through public statements, including in multilateral forums such as the Human Rights Council in Geneva. The European Union, in its position for the EU-Egypt Association Council, has raised clear concerns regarding the blocking of websites and the ongoing pressure on human rights organisations and defenders. It calls on Egypt to comply with its commitments to promote freedom of expression, association and assembly, as well as the freedom of the press, as guaranteed by the 2014 Constitution and according to its international obligations. This position was also expressed in the recent European Union statement at the Human Rights Council, under item 4. Some of you referred to the case of the Egyptian lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly. This is a case that the European Union is following very closely, and one we have raised with our Egyptian counterparts at a high level both in Cairo and in Brussels. We have stressed the need to allow human rights defenders to carry on their work, including cooperation with the United Nations human rights agencies and mechanisms, without intimidation or harassment, in line with Egypt’s international obligations and with the guarantees enshrined in the Egyptian Constitution for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms. This message, as well as the need to shed light on the circumstances of the death of Giulio Regeni, was clearly expressed in our statement to the Association Council, and in the recent European Union statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. You can count on us to continue to insist on this in our contacts with our Egyptian counterparts at all levels. Some of you also referred to the LGBTI situation. The present position is that the arrest of an increasing number of people after the concert of rock band Mashrou’ Leila in Cairo and sentences of one to six years in prison for so-called ‘practices of debauchery’ are not in line with Egypt’s commitments to promote freedom of expression as guaranteed by the 2014 Constitution, nor with Egypt’s international obligations. Freedom of expression is essential in a democratic society, and we call on Egypt to take active measures to promote it and to abide by its national and international commitments in that regard. The European Union wishes to reaffirm its commitment to freedom of expression, and to the quality and dignity of all human beings, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Finally, regarding the situation of Ibrahim Halawa, his acquittal is welcome news and a relief for his family, for Ireland and for the European Union. The Commission was particularly pleased to hear that Ibrahim was finally acquitted after four years in pre-trial detention. This is a case that the European Union has been following very closely and one we have actively raised with the Egyptian authorities, in coordination with and support of the Irish Government’s efforts. Nonetheless we remain concerned about the use of a mass trial in which 442 defendants received heavy prison sentences: this is not in line with Egypt’s human rights obligations. The European Union looks forward to the appeals and expects Egypt to uphold its national and international commitments to due process and fair trials. To conclude this debate, I think that we all agree on the importance of our partnership with Egypt, even if there are different views on how to take it forward. As I have stressed before, we now need to approach it in a coherent and comprehensive way in order to make the best out of it in the interests of Egyptians and Europeans. We will continue to look at how best to achieve progress on the four tracks of our partnership, and to use all the instruments available to us to foster a system of stability, growth and social and economic development in the country. We count, too, on Parliament’s support to contribute to the success of this partnership and its concrete impact on our people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 294, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 295, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The next item is the debate on – the oral question to the Council on the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany (COP23) by Adina-Ioana Vălean, Peter Liese, Gilles Pargneaux, Julie Girling, Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, Estefanía Torres Martínez, Marco Affronte, Mireille D’Ornano and Piernicola Pedicini, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (O—000068/2017 – B8—0329/2017) (2017/2620(RSP)), and – the oral question to the Commission on the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany (COP23) by Adina-Ioana Vălean, Peter Liese, Gilles Pargneaux, Julie Girling, Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, Estefanía Torres Martínez, Marco Affronte and Piernicola Pedicini, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (O—000069/2017 – B8—0330/2017) (2017/2620(RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 296, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Adina-Ioana VĂLEAN", "mepid": "37324", "text": "  author. – Mr President, it has been almost two years since the birth of the Paris Agreement and almost exactly one year since its entry into force on 4 November 2016. 195 parties have signed up to the Agreement to date and 166 of these have already deposited with the UN their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to what one might qualify as the most significant multilateral international agreement of the decade. Undoubtedly, climate change is one of the most important challenges for humankind. Those of us who believe in the science explaining climate change keep on stressing this fact and the associated disastrous consequences for both our present and our future. But we should also act on our beliefs. The Paris Agreement was a major step, but a lot more needs to be done to ensure that this agreement will deliver on its intentions. We all know in this House from our work on European legislation that if it is hard to agree on a common set of policy design and the numbers, it is even harder to implement them in a meaningful way. And this is where we are with the Paris Agreement. For the past year, preparatory work has started that will go on well into 2018 laying down the foundation for the implementation of the accord. We are one month away from the start of the 23rd climate conference in Bonn, which will be a milestone in the technical work on the implementing rules for the agreement. We expect quite importantly that there will be some clarification on the structure of the 2018 facilitative dialogue. This will be a key opportunity to take stock of progress made towards the agreement’s mitigation goals and to inform the preparation and revision, by 2020, of the parties’ 2030 nationally determined contributions. The regrettable decision by the President of the United States to withdraw his country from the Paris Agreement will have numerous implications but, most worryingly, it has an immediate impact on climate financing, which is one of the cornerstones for international climate action. The suspension of US contributions to the Green Climate Fund will open up substantially a hole which we have all been working hard to fill. These are very pertinent issues that we look forward to discussing today with both the Council and the Commission, who will both be sitting at the negotiation table in Bonn in 4 weeks’ time. As every year, in line with our commitment to the international climate process, the European Parliament will attend the Bonn conference and follow the discussion and decisions made there, and through its privileged contacts with parliamentarians from around the world will support the EU position. Tomorrow we will be adopting our resolution on the topic, which sets out the vision, concerns, expectations and aspirations of our institution. This will also constitute our mandate for the Bonn conference. I am looking forward to a fruitful exchange with all of you this afternoon, as well as much cooperation between our institutions in the run-up to and during the climate negotiations in November.

By this step we confirm our credibility and our responsibility. The EU and its Member States have reaffirmed clearly their commitment to continued climate action in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Despite the political changeover in the US, we are encouraged by good news from other countries moving forward on climate action. The international community, including non-state actors, remains committed to implementation of the Paris Agreement. This was also demonstrated during the Hamburg G20 summit held on 7 and 8 July and the recent Montreal Ministerial Meeting on climate action that took place in September.  The upcoming conference in Bonn will be an important occasion to demonstrate the collective determination of the international community on climate action. The EU and its Member States have expectations for broad-ranging progress at COP 23 and we are working closely with our international partners to ensure it is a success.  Firstly, COP 23 must establish a solid foundation for the completion of the Paris work programme by COP 24 next year in Katowice, Poland. This should include making substantial progress on the work programme with a view to finalising it next year and to preparing for the implementation of all provisions of the Paris Agreement, comprising mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation, support and the transparency framework. It is important that we achieve clarity on the process for next year, so that all parties and external stakeholders are reassured that we will deliver on our task. We expect an agreement on the 2018 facilitative dialogue at COP 23. The dialogue will be the key political moment at COP 24 and the first opportunity after Paris to take stock of our collective efforts towards achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. It will help inform the preparation of subsequent nationally determined contributions or NDCs. Therefore the EU considers that COP 23 should result in a clear proposal on how the 2018 facilitative dialogue should be prepared, outlining the work for next year.  In this respect non-party stakeholder contributions will be key in terms of presenting policy options, approaches and technologies with high potential, experiences and lessons learned. They also bring concrete opportunities to overcome barriers in NDC implementation and international cooperation, such as partnerships through the Global Climate Action agenda. With regard to the transparency framework, it is important to have comparable and robust methodologies to track progress and make sure that the chosen policy instruments have the desired impact in terms of reducing emissions or increasing resilience. COP 23 should result in significant progress on the details of the modalities, procedures and guidelines of the framework. Further action by all parties, individually and collectively, will be required to reorient and make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development. The EU and its Member States are the world’s biggest climate finance donor. In 2015 it provided, together with the European Investment Bank, EUR 17.6 billion for climate finance to third countries. The EU will continue to support climate action in partner countries and is fully committed to the implementation of the 2020 climate finance roadmap. We remain committed to scaling the mobilisation of climate finance as part of a global effort to assist developing countries to implement their low-carbon sustainable development, and in particular their NDCs. Domestic implementation, climate policies and measures to achieve intended nationally determined contributions and their full integration into national policies are of crucial importance. At this stage the Council and Parliament are the key actors currently working on completion of the EU’s own legislative and regulatory package that is necessary to deliver our Paris target of reducing economy-wide emissions by at least 40% by 2030. That remains the most ambitious pledge under the Agreement. This is an important sign of leadership as the success of Paris will ultimately depend on concrete action on the ground.

He added that, set against the collapse of ambition in the United States, Europe must ensure we make our planet great again because it is the shared heritage of all humanity. Recently, the European Union, Canada and China convened a Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action. This was the first ministerial meeting of its kind, bringing together three major economies in a leadership role and gathering ministers from more than 30 countries, including both major economies and also some of the most vulnerable countries, to discuss how to advance global action on climate change. For the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn (COP23) the European Union envisages three broad areas of deliverables. Firstly, there should be substantial progress on developing the detailed modalities, procedures and guidelines of the Paris Agreement with a view to concluding them by 2018. Secondly, we need to find political agreement on the design of the ‘Facilitative Dialogue’ that will take place in 2018. This is a clear deliverable expected by COP23 from the Moroccan and Fijian Presidencies, as was mandated by the decision in Marrakech. Thirdly, the European Union attaches great importance to the Global Climate Action Agenda to expand multi—stakeholder action and further build momentum. Let me elaborate further on the first deliverable. The Paris Agreement achieved comprehensive coverage of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation by treating these and other issues in a balanced and tailored way. The delicate balance set in Paris now needs to be made operational through detailed modalities, procedures and guidelines. Priority areas to advance are the work programme that includes the Paris transparency framework and the five-yearly global stocktake. The transparency framework will make it possible to track progress made on all parties’ commitments, for both adaptation and mitigation as well as support, according to common agreed rules and methodology, and to compare and aggregate results in terms of emission reductions and assess progress towards the global goal on adaptation. The global stocktake is one of the fundamental features of the Paris Agreement and it is the key element of a wider ambition cycle that will inform and incentivise processes progressively to enhance ambitious action, both domestically and collectively. At European Union level, the proposal for the 2030 legislative framework provides for a review in 2024, and every five years thereafter, of the overall functioning of the legislation, in order to take account of evolving national circumstances and to be informed by the results of the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement. Coming back to the second deliverable, the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue is intended to take stock of the collective efforts of parties in relation to progress towards the long-term emissions reduction goal and inform the preparation of further or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The European Union sees the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue as an important milestone in promoting subsequent discussions about ambition. Parties will have to consider and explain what the outcomes of the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue imply for them individually in terms of their domestic processes. In the context of the insufficient global ambition currently on the table, the Commission supports the European Union’s active participation in the dialogue as a first important opportunity to take stock of the collective efforts of parties and to demonstrate how we have been preparing for the implementation of our NDC. Looking ahead, and to facilitate the preparation of long-term strategies, the Commission is preparing an in-depth analysis of the economic, social and environmental impacts of pathways coherent with the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement in order to stimulate the political debate in the European Parliament and the Council and with stakeholders. Let me give you some further comments on climate finance. The Commission participated closely with many Member States in the development of the donors’ 2020 USD 100 billion road map. We remain committed to the collective goal of mobilising, from a variety of sources, USD 100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 for climate action in developing countries, and continuing significantly to increase adaptation finance. However, neither the European Union nor any other party acting alone can be expected to fill the gap left by the United States. We need to work collectively and look for innovative solutions and scalability. In that respect the COP21+2 Climate Summit convened by the French Government, the United Nations and the World Bank in Paris on 12 December will usefully complement the COP23 Conference and should help us work better together to redirect public and private investments towards the clean energy transition. Lastly, looking beyond the amount of finance mobilised, we must also consider the important role of technical cooperation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and of NDCs. In that respect, we are mobilising technical support from across Europe to share our experience and help partner countries develop and implement climate policies and measures.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 299, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "Let us now listen to the statements of the political groups.At this stage, \"blue card\" questions are not allowed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 300, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen!

The announcement of this withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement has finally galvanized the 194 other signatories of COP 21. and, since June 1, heads of state and government around the world have consistently reaffirmed their commitment to keep the global temperature rise between 2.4 degrees and 6.6 degrees by 2050. Mr. Commissioner, the European Union is, in our view, the new leader that the world needs to effectively fight climate change. This is why we encourage you to address at COP 23 in Bonn the following seven priorities: The creation of innovative financing to fight against climate change, with the setting of a floor price for the tonne of carbon and the reform of the system European carbon trading; The establishment of a true circular economy and the revitalization of renewable energies; The removal of subsidies allocated to the fossil fuel sector, which will ultimately lead to the abandonment of fossil fuels; Intensifying efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by the transport and agricultural sectors to achieve the targets set for 2020 and 2030; Realization of the financial commitment of developed countries to provide $ 100 billion per year to developing countries by 2020; The promotion of universal access to sustainable energy in developing countries, in particular in Africa, which has an incredible potential in renewable energies, for the moment untapped; The impact of climate change on migration and the international recognition of climate refugee status.

This facilitative dialogue should provide us with a clear picture of where we stand, because Paris was a huge success, but we knew even  while we were still applauding there that it was not enough; that it was not enough to stay within the 1.5 degrees or even the 2 degrees. The facilitative dialogue can therefore lead only to one conclusion: that we have to do more, that we are falling short at the moment. That is why we should not allow the US to renegotiate the commitments that it made in Paris. That is crucial, absolutely. But it also means how crucially important it is that we do our work on both the emission trading system, on the effort sharing, and on the energy package. We seriously have to deliver on Paris, and not only that: we also have to work on proper implementation.

COP 23 is important, our resolution is well done and it is equally important for all the reasons that our colleagues have already said. And then we read precisely in these days the figures that in 2016, as in previous years, the Member States of the European Union have donated to fossil fuels: € 112 billion in funding. 112 billion that are nailed a little to the past and do not allow us to move forward towards change. We don't even know if this figure is correct because there is no transparency on these funds or subsidies; therefore, it could even be a partial figure and the amount could be even greater. But we know that 44% of these funds go for example to the transport sector. This has allowed and allows Sergio Marchionne of FCA to say that electric cars are double-edged weapons and that it is preferable to improve petrol engines instead. Obviously, electric cars are not the only solution, we too know it well, but if Marchionne can afford to say this it is precisely because the market is altered by the subsidies that are given through public money. The European Union puts four billion into it directly, to which are added those that the European Investment Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development put in it: if they seem few to you, know that, in just one year, there are five times what we give, in the period from 2014 to 2020, to welcome migrants.

Clearly, it will be very difficult to make up for the exit of the United States, but Bonn is an opportunity for the European Union to continue to be a leader here. But it is necessary to move from our political decisions really to concrete actions and we must concretize our decisions. In particular, we need to reach 100 billion euros a year or dollars a year by 2020, which we talked about, in order to really be able to implement all these conclusions. What I believe in is energy efficiency, it’s energy security, it’s less air pollution to affect people’s better health. I also believe that it is necessary to use in any case in any diplomatic dialogue, to use as our strategic basis, speech on climate change and the fight against climate change. We also have to fight against all these situations by always putting climate change at the forefront, to fight at the level of the entire planet.

At the end of the summer, in the southern hemisphere, the ice around Antarctica hit its lowest extent ever recorded by satellites. While there is year-on-year variability, up to last year the trend has been towards more melting of the ice caps. Additionally in 2016, the great barrier reef lost 29% of its coral due to rising ocean temperatures. In Port Douglas, Queensland, up to 70% was lost. Rising sea levels, along with an increase in the frequency and magnitude of storm events, will bring increased rates of coastal erosion around the world. My own country, Ireland, and especially the south coast, is particularly exposed. Waterford and Cork are highly exposed to the problem of erosion and the local authorities are doing excellent work in developing coastal management strategies at Cork harbour and Tramore strand. Tramore is particularly subject to coastal erosion. However, we must act at European and global level to ensure that this work and the millions of similar examples around the world are not in vain. Countering these effects is the challenge of our time. Having represented Parliament at COP21 and COP22, I am lucky enough to have witnessed at first hand the coming into force of the agreement that will see us meet the two-degrees target. That target must be met, and I compliment Commissioner Cañete for his role in that matter.

These long-term strategies will have to explore the feasibility of our 1.5°C scenario, which certainly goes beyond the level of domestic reduction we are heading towards with the current 2030 policy framework. For the long-term strategies, we are, however, dependent on further international developments in order to have the necessary science and analytical basis in place. We will have to obtain the science on the 2°C and 1.5°C pathways, including through a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the second half of 2018. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Facilitative Dialogue at the end of 2018 is also essential, as it will show us how countries are implementing Paris and what more is needed.

This clarity and certainty to all actors is crucial to build trust and help solidify confidence in the global commitment to climate action. In that sense I deplore the opening Commissioner Cañete made to the Trump Administration to ‘chart its own path’ within the Treaty and to come back on the terms under which they agreed to participate previously. Such a back step is dangerous and could open a Pandora’s box, since other Parties to the Paris Agreement might start to consider weaker contributions as well.

In the European Union, some 918 million passengers travelled by air in 2015 and this figure is increasing steadily from year to year. Ryanair has grown to become the largest EU airline by scheduled passengers flown, and has carried more international passengers in 2015 than any airline in the world. It currently operates from 84 bases connecting 33 countries across Europe and North Africa. The abrupt cancellation, in the six weeks from September to October 2017, by Ryanair of thousands of its flights in the EU has caused major disturbances for passengers. A large number of them were left stranded at airports and many had to cancel journeys or re—route their flights. There are complaints that in a number of cases the airline has given little or no notice of such cancellations. Furthermore, there have been claims that the limited information dispensed by the airline with regard to reimbursement, re—routing or return, as well as the right to assistance and the right to compensation, may have been misleading to passengers. It is deeply regrettable that the passengers were left in such a position. Airlines operating in the EU must respect European rules. Air passengers’ rights are indeed protected under EU law. The Flight Compensation Regulation sets a minimum level of quality standards for passenger protection, adding an important citizens’ dimension to the liberalisation of the aviation market. When a flight is cancelled, airlines are obliged to inform passengers of their rights. These rights include the right to reimbursement, re—routing or return, as well as the right to care and, in some circumstances, the right to compensation. Any EU airline not adhering to these rules must be held accountable. The national enforcement bodies in each Member State must act to verify that airlines are respecting EU rules and that passengers’ rights are protected. They must also strive to ensure that passengers are aware of their rights.

A few days ago, Ryanair publicly announced that it would reduce its operations by cancelling thousands of scheduled flights, disrupting the travel plans of passengers across Europe. This affected firstly flights scheduled until the end of October, totalling 2 100 flights, and then others due to operate during the winter season. A very large number of passengers will be affected and, just like all of you, the Commission wants to make sure that those passengers are treated fairly. The EU is the only area in the world where citizens are protected by a full set of passengers’ rights, whether they travel by air, rail, ship, bus or coach. All passengers whose flights are cancelled have a comprehensive set of rights. It is essential that they receive correct and complete information about their rights in order to be able to enforce them. Let me recall that these rights include the right to reimbursement, re-routing or return, as well as the right to care and, in some circumstances, the right to receive financial compensation. The Commission has asked the national authorities to be vigilant on this issue, and to try to cooperate with each other in order to ensure that passengers can fully exercise their rights. As guardian of the Treaties, the role of the Commission is to oversee and monitor the implementation of EU law in each Member State. For this reason, the Commission immediately issued a statement underlying, in particular, that Ryanair just – like all airlines operating in the EU – must fully comply with EU air passengers’ rights. We are in direct contact with all the national enforcement bodies to make sure that passengers’ rights are respected, and I specifically welcome the enforcement actions already taken by the UK civil aviation authorities and further actions by other civil aviation authorities, including in Ireland and Spain. I’m also confident that the Irish civil aviation authority will continue to fulfil its oversight obligations and ensure that Ryanair continues to comply with our aviation acquis. Mr President and honourable members: let me also use this opportunity to remind you that in 2016, the Commission issued guidelines on the existing rules to make it easier for passengers and national authorities alike. The Commission also proposed to modernise the rules on air passengers’ rights in 2013 – a proposal which is currently blocked in Council. I hope that we will soon be able to make progress on this for our passengers travelling across the EU. This incident clearly highlights the need for a modern and robust European regulatory framework. Honourable Members, President: the Commission has contacted Ryanair and we expect them to fully comply with its obligations. Together with my colleague, Commissioner Jourová, I have written an official letter to Ryanair to underline our concerns and highlight the obligations under EU law. Firstly, we recalled that the passengers must receive correct and complete information about their rights in due time in order to be able to enforce them, including on re-routing and compensation. Secondly, Ryanair has to ensure that all communication channels are working properly and that passengers can communicate with staff. Thirdly, another important issue is the complaint handling process. Ryanair shall make information available on its website on its complaint handling process and on the relevant contact addresses where passengers can file claims. I am pleased to report that the Ryanair has already responded by giving a number of assurances addressing the issues we have raised. Indeed, for September and October 98% of affected customers have had their claims processed. For November to March 2018, the figure is at 75% and we expect this to go up rapidly in the coming weeks. This is a positive development. I will be pursuing my contacts with Ryanair in the Irish civil aviation authority during a visit to Dublin in a few days, and the Commission will of course remain in close contact with all national enforcement bodies to further follow-up on this issue. President and honourable Members, the single aviation market has many benefits, but also many obligations. We therefore expect all airlines operating in the EU to fully respect European rules.

On 18 September last, Ryanair suddenly announced flight cancellations and it was only last Friday, 29 September, 11 days later, that we seem to have come to a point where we had full clarification on the issue, and – in relation to passenger rights – for the passengers’ entitlements to be communicated directly to them. That followed meetings with the Commission for Aviation Regulation in Ireland and the UK and in Spain, as you have mentioned, so it took that time to ensure that passengers’ rights were outlined clearly and communicated to them directly. Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 has been in place since 2004 and we are all well aware of it, and I am sure a European airline that is benefiting from the liberalisation of European airspace should have been aware of the issue. They have said that they take the matter seriously and have put in place strong communication now with their customers.  All this came from what has been described as a rostering management failure. It is not a safety issue, as some people would like to think or would like to link it to, and we should be clear on that. Flight time regulations were established by these institutions: the amount of time a pilot can fly, and indeed the time that cabin crew can be in the air, in one calendar year was established. In an effort to ensure that they remained compliant and continued to remain compliant, Ryanair had a rostering issue and they had to cancel flights and ensure that they could remain compliant.

Ryanair has announced that 20,000 flights will be canceled by March 2018. Approximately 700,000 passengers will be affected.

After all, it is ultimately responsible for the approval and it must ensure that flight operations ultimately run smoothly. Something must have gone wrong, the people in charge have to put up with that too. Why - the question arises for me - do flights have to be canceled? It is said that punctuality should be increased - that is also perfectly fine - but we know that Ryanair has not only been coming up with positive headlines for some time, but also negative ones - negative ones, especially with regard to the conditions of employment of the pilots. Maybe it is actually because of the employment practice of the pilots, who only get money when they fly? Could it be because of these terms or conditions of employment?

Commissioner! Undoubtedly, low-cost airlines have played a huge role in promoting flying as an important and affordable mode of transport in the European Union.

The current situation, especially the information chaos related to the cancellation of thousands of flights, causes legitimate passenger anxiety and poses a serious challenge to many local airports, for which connections via this airline are often crucial to maintaining profitability. It is unacceptable for Ryanair to avoid or not fully comply with its obligations in the event of cancellation of a flight, especially to provide the passenger with an alternative connection.

I think it is worth saying that clearly something went wrong in Ryanair. To put it bluntly, Ryanair has messed something up. If I were the CEO, I would probably take measures because, of course, the first affected in this respect is the company, with its business and its reputation. There is no doubt something went wrong: it is obvious due to the implications that we are debating. However, the Commissioner said one important thing and I think it is something we should focus on in terms of where we go from here and what the policymaking is to be. That is that, regarding the European Union, our internal market, the rights of consumers and passengers’ rights, if we compare the situation with any other region in the world, or any other country, we have the most protective legislative framework. That goes without saying. I also see that the Commission has acted and has given a response so I am sure that, as far as the competences of the Commission are concerned, it will make sure that Ryanair implements what it has promised and what it has to implement. And of course we also have the relevant national authorities. What I am more concerned about is that, although we have had this most protective legislative framework for 10 years, there are still entities and people that do not know what passengers’ rights are today, what can be reimbursed and what kind of obligations the airline has. That is something else that we need to draw conclusions from. I hope that, in the future, apart from the monitoring of implementation – on which, of course, I will focus – we will be able to bring forward the question of passengers’ rights, not only in aviation but also in other modes of transport, in a combined way.

Commissioner, what responsibility will the company bear? Thousands of passengers have found out that their flight has been canceled and we do not know whether they are aware of their rights under the Council Regulation, whether they have been informed that they can claim compensation and whether they know that they can travel on other airlines at Ryanair's expense. The issue of the company's employees is very important. This raises the question of what was the reason why so many pilots quit their jobs with a relatively good salary, and how the numerous discussions in the European Parliament on rest, drivers 'working time, drivers' salaries and social dumping relate to the functioning of Ryanair. Please note the proposed ticket prices. How is it possible to buy a ticket for two and a half euro for a connection between two European Union countries? Weren't we dealing with social dumping here? Somehow nobody touches on this topic. How is it possible that many of the thirteen thousand employed workers are self-employed, have no paid holidays and no social benefits?

However, Ryanair is today the company that transports the most passengers in Europe and we must demand the highest levels of responsibility from it. These irregularities must be investigated by the European air authorities.

I think, Mr O'Leary, you would curse like Captain Haddock. It was the same with all those who had to experience this now. One speaks here of 400,000 people, there are 300,000 more. In my small constituency, many citizens called me angrily and protested and I was asked: 'What is Europe doing about it, or what can I do as a citizen or as a person concerned?' The answer here is the regulation from 2004. It is a regulation that defines citizens' rights. These rights are good, passengers have to claim these rights. You have to honestly say: the short-term nature of the cancellation was and is a cheek, and it cannot be that way. Ryanair will have to pay for these canceled flights and you, Ms. Bulc, will have to keep an eye on Mr. O’Leary. While freedom above the clouds may be limitless, there are limits to the insolence of such planning. And that's in your hand, Ms. Bulc. Keep an eye on him, and I can only advise every customer to assert these rights. The customer is sitting on the longer lever. If everyone asserts these rights, you will prevent such things from happening again in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 385, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the cancellation of flights across Europe by Ryanair is creating great inconvenience for European citizens. The cause is, in my opinion, to be found in the reckless social dumping on the skin of the employees of this company, which thus tries to outperform the competition. It is worth remembering that only yesterday, the British low cost, Monarch, operational since 1968, went bankrupt. The current layout of the internal market in this sector must probably be rethought, as well as the European rules for the protection of passengers must be enforced. The Commission needs to shed light on how airlines inform travelers. It seems that Ryanair communicates the cancellation of flights between 48 hours and 6 hours before the departure time: it does not seem to me a sufficiently large advance margin.

In my region, in Charleroi, the airport is one of the biggest Belgian economic success stories of recent years, and it has been sufficiently demonstrated. But current events oblige us to reaffirm the protective principles defined by Europe, which must necessarily accompany this development. First, the rights of passengers must be fully protected. The rules are clear: any company that cancels a flight must inform each passenger of their rights, including the right to be compensated under certain conditions. Therefore, Commissioner, I think you need to take an initiative to facilitate this compensation procedure and monitor the process. The clear example of Ryanair shows that this does not work.

It is unbelievable that in the times we live in, there are still people who do not know what rights they have. And here the responsibility is ours. To provide this information in an accessible way, in an accessible language, as people expect. I am surprised to learn that it is common practice for airlines to notify passengers by email. For better or worse, there are people who still don't have email or don't use it as actively. We owe it to each of them to be clear about what they can use and when.

I just want to say that I am sure Michael O’Leary, Chief Executive of Ryanair, is listening to this debate and his ears are burning, and that may be no harm. I hope he has heard the emotion of many colleagues in the Chamber, who have expressed the upset caused to passengers and the fact that we need to take this on board. Ryanair is a very large airline. The statistics, if you bear with me, are these: 131 million customers this year; operating in 33 countries; an unblemished safety record of 32 years. But the cancellations were of such a scale that people did begin to question whether there was more behind this than simply a rostering error. So Ryanair has work to do. On connecting with passengers, they have work to do, as all airlines have. When there is a problem, we need to talk to a human being, and perhaps that is something we could stitch into a regulation. Two further points. Firstly, could the Commission study the follow-up to this crisis? How many people actually claimed their rights? This would be an exercise that would be useful to us, to see if the legislation is working effectively.

Let me now address some of your more specific questions. First on social problems. I'm not here to really speculate on the root causes of Ryanair's decision. At this stage, Ryanair has confirmed that this is solely due to rostering issues and management failure. European rules are really crystal clear. It is the responsibility of the Irish authorities to oversee Ryanair as an Irish airline and I'm confident that they are closely monitoring that Ryanair respects all its obligations. If they discover wrongdoing, I'm also confident that they will act accordingly.  On communication with stakeholders – information campaigns have been present since 2010 including videos, brochures, leaflets and so on. Interactive content is present on Your Europe. Coordination with NAPS ensuring airlines provide info, check-in online and at the airports is also ensured and present, and there are also more mobile applications that the customers can download. Obviously, this still is not enough. I issue a special statement before every holiday, summer and Christmas, and we can still look to see if anything else can be done so that people learn about their rights.  What were we doing on social conditions? There were several questions regarding that. There are concerns regarding the development of social conditions of mobile workers in aviation and I am very committed to moving forward on the social dimension of aviation and it will be the focus of my portfolio and an aviation strategy next year.  As far as state aid is concerned, the rules are the same for all airlines.  My services will soon launch also a study on certain employment and social aspects including bogus employment and alleged pay-to-fly schemes for pilots. The purpose is to understand better the facts on the ground and how they relate to existing legal obligations and EU policy for the future. Our work will take into account the case-law of the EU Court of Justice, including the recent one on the home base of air crews and the determination of the place of work.  The next question was related to intervening and sanctioning Ryanair, and, here, let me say the following. Member States have designed national enforcement body called NAPs, which are responsible for the enforcement of EU air passengers' rights. The sanctions for infringements of this regulation are laid down by Member States. For the time being, there is no reason to initiate any infringement procedures against Ireland and, as I said, I’m confident that they will do the work that they have to do.  And last but not least, EU safety rules – EU rules are the same for legacy and low-cost carriers. The EU has the highest aviation safety standards in the world and I'm also confident all national authorities follow this closely, including Ireland. So let the system do the job.  President and honourable Members, the single aviation market has propelled European mobility forward, bringing Europeans closer together and providing a solid foundation for more jobs and economic growth. Successful reforms played a key role here and the Commission along with national authorities has ensured and will ensure that these common rules are respected by all players, big or small. It is thanks to the EU that all passengers have a full set of rights when flying. This very unfortunate event has only further cemented the importance of these rules and the need for their full implementation, and it is in this spirit that I'm inviting you to see the challenge in front of us, as well. A challenge that we are actively addressing to the benefit of passengers. I can only hope that we can unblock the new proposal on passengers' rights in the Council and get it up and operational as an important tool for even stronger enforcement of passengers' rights. And I really welcome your support, honourable Members, on this point. This is exactly why we put forward guidelines last year to provide clarity and certainty, and yes I do travel low-cost, as a Commissioner and as a private citizen.

The negative contribution of these measures is the large number of cancellations. What the company must keep in mind is the European Regulation 261/2004, which strictly regulates passengers' rights in the event of cancellations. It is very important that Ryanair takes this into account and acts accordingly for harmed passengers. It is not enough to pay compensation to those concerned, but also, where appropriate, to provide hotel accommodation and other services to its passengers stranded abroad in accordance with the provisions of the regulation.

I will speak Swedish because it is such a subject that I feel so strongly about. Endocrine disruptors are found in children's toys, in food packaging, in clothes, in various types of plastics, but also in pesticides that we can get in us through food. These chemicals can lead to several types of ill health, including problems with having children, cancer and the risk of diabetes. Young children and fetuses are extra exposed and sensitive to these chemicals and the effects show up later in life. Nevertheless, there is currently no proper regulatory framework in the EU that provides comprehensive and adequate protection against endocrine disruptors. More than seven years ago, the Commission was commissioned to develop scientific criteria for identifying endocrine disrupting chemicals. The Commission has, I'm sorry to say, handled this very poorly. After several years of delay and after being convicted in the European Court of Justice for failure to act, a proposal has now been presented. The question we must ask ourselves is: does this proposal live up to what it is for, to protect the environment and public health? Unfortunately, the answer is no. We have commissioned the Commission to identify which chemicals are endocrine disruptors - nothing more than that. What the Commission is now proposing is neither compatible with EU law nor provides adequate protection for human health and the environment against endocrine disruptors in pesticides. This is about the basic principle of the rule of law here. The Commission does not have the right to violate EU law with this proposal. This is a violation of the Commission's mandate. However, the Commission's proposal for an exemption for pesticides has been put forward precisely to attack the hormonal system of pests. They are thus endocrine disrupting in design. Nevertheless, the Commission does not think that pesticides should be classified as endocrine disruptors, even though they also have an effect on animals other than the target group. For example, we are talking here about bees, butterflies, bumblebees, crayfish and crabs, all of which have hormonal systems that can be affected by these pesticides.It is not scientifically defensible.Today it is about pesticides, but the Commission states that in the future the proposed criteria can also be used in other areas.Therefore, it is even more important that these criteria are good.We demand that the Commission do the right thing.Remove this irregular exception and come back with a new proposal without delay.Children and bees take precedence over the financial interests of individual stakeholders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 412, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Bas EICKHOUT", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  author. – Mr President, I think my colleague Ms Guteland has already explained the importance of this debate on endocrine disrupters. To be very clear, we have been debating this since 2009 when the Commission was asked to come forward with criteria to define what endocrine disruptors are. This was part of the regulation on biocides and pesticides and it was one of the key debates. What are the criteria for endocrine disrupters? It took many years before the Commission finally came up with those criteria. It actually took the Court of Justice to push the Commission to come forward with the criteria. But another very important discussion that took place in 2009 was to ask what the cut-off criteria were with regard to the definition of endocrine disruptors. These cut-off criteria were crucial because, of course, if you fall outside the scope of the definition, you are not considered to be an endocrine disruptor. That was a crucial debate. An entire annex was drafted to design these cut-off criteria, and one of the key provisions there was that substances should be approved only if they were not considered to have endocrine-disrupting properties on non-target organisms. I repeat: ‘on non-target organisms’. It is precisely this provision that the Commission is now changing – through comitology and a delegated act. The Commission is changing a key provision of a law through comitology, and that is precisely what we are objecting to. The key question is whether the Commission is exceeding its implementing powers and the answer is ‘yes’. We even have advice from the Legal Service saying ‘yes’, the Commission is exceeding its implementing powers. That is exactly what we are discussing here. The Commission will say that we need to hurry up now, as this will delay things. Well, sorry! I say to the Commission: you have been delaying since 2009. Secondly, the Biocides Regulation is putting the same criteria on the table and there is no objection to that one. So we are objecting to the Commission exceeding its implementing powers, and that is a legal question that all our colleagues need to answer. This is not about whether you like it or not: this is about whether we allow the Commission to change a crucial part of the law through implementing powers. If they want to make that change, then they should come forward with a proposal for codecision. That is the way we do it.

It is crucial today for all of us, and I stress it because the Commission is following the mandate from the pesticides and biocides regulation, and of course this Commission started work in 2014 and started to deal with these very complex issues. We are here today debating the draft objection tabled in Parliament against the Commission regulation setting out criteria to identify endocrine disrupters in the context of the pesticides legislation. This proposal was sent by the Commission to Parliament and the Council for scrutiny on 20 July. I strongly ask the honourable Members to support the proposed criteria. I strongly request this. There is no benefit for health and the environment in keeping the interim criteria that are currently applicable. These are clearly not fit for purpose and this is recognised by all the stakeholders. Indeed, they fail to identify those that are real endocrine disrupters. I would like to stress that our proposed criteria are protective of human health and the environment, and are based on the widely agreed World Health Organisation definition of an endocrine disrupter. The criteria are also designed to identify known and presumed endocrine disrupters on the basis of all available scientific information, including human and animal evidence, as well as in-vitro and in-silico data. Furthermore, a ‘weight-of-evidence approach’ is to be used for the analysis of all the available scientific information. The Commission’s proposal is thus based on science and reflects a reasonable approach. It is supported by a clear majority of Member States. In fact, on 4 July this year after more than a year of intense negotiations, a qualified majority of Member States supported the draft Commission regulation setting criteria to identify endocrine disrupters for pesticides. Twenty-one Member States, representing more than 72% of the population, voted in favour, while those voting against, or abstaining, did so for different and sometimes opposite reasons. Some wanted stricter criteria, others weaker criteria or more possibilities for derogation. The proposed criteria are therefore a careful compromise and I would like to draw your attention to that. Yes, we know very well how difficult it is to build a compromise. This one would not have been reached without the inclusion of the specific provision which is at the centre of the draft objection tabled here in Parliament. This particular provision was added at the request of some Member States, during the negotiations – yes, during the negotiations – to improve their policy on sustainable use of pesticides, and was instrumental in getting the necessary support. And here we are discussing necessary support. The Commission did not want to oppose a reasonable and limited exemption for substances which target only arthropods and have no impact on vertebrates (human or animal). The Commission strongly believes that it has not exceeded its powers by including this provision in the draft Commission regulation, as it does not concern an essential element of the regulation. Furthermore, this provision is in line with the general objective of the regulation to promote the development and use of active substances that have, overall, more favourable properties in relation to the protection of human health and the environment. Let me also remind the honourable Members that, with the adoption of the draft regulation under scrutiny, the European Union would become the first regulatory system in the world with legally binding criteria to define what an endocrine disrupter is and to apply those criteria to pesticides, not only with regard to human health but also with regard to the environment. I am aware that some consider the proposed criteria to be imperfect, for different reasons. However, their adoption would be a significant step forward compared to the current situation with respect to better protection of human health and the environment. We are not in a hurry: our concern, as always, is how to protect human health and the environment. I strongly believe we owe that better protection to European citizens and the European environment. Only when the new criteria start to apply and we gain experience with them can we evaluate how they work in practice. The Commission had proposed to evaluate and report on their functioning at the latest in seven years’ time. In addition, the adoption of the criteria would constitute a solid basis for the Commission to advance in developing a new strategy on endocrine disrupters. Without finalised criteria there is no chance of obtaining a horizontal perspective, in relation to various types of chemicals. We need to have final criteria now because otherwise there is no possibility of moving forward. This House has repeatedly asked the Commission to come forward with criteria to identify endocrine disrupters. I believe we now have a solid compromise and criteria which represent a real step forward. Therefore, and to conclude, I invite you to seize the opportunity for better protection of human health and the environment from endocrine disrupters in the area of pesticides by not supporting this objection, and by enabling the Commission to adopt these protective criteria and move forward. Otherwise we will remain in the same situation as now.

It not only takes up the definition of endocrine disruptors given by the WHO, but above all it allows the European Union to once again place itself at the forefront in the protection of health and the environment. Endocrine disruptors are everywhere: in furniture, clothing, packaging, containers and food products. It is therefore essential to set strict and scientifically based criteria. We can't wait any longer. In addition, this proposal will replace the legislation currently in force, which is outdated and no longer responds to the challenges we are facing today. We must ensure an ever higher level of protection for citizens. For this, we must move forward with the technical and scientific knowledge at our disposal and it is therefore fundamental to encourage research and innovation in this area. However, it is manufacturers, SMEs and very small businesses that are developing research and innovation. They therefore need clear guidance on which direction to take and to be able to develop safer products for the future.

The question I face, somewhere in between the extremes in this debate, is whether we are better to go with what the Commission has tabled, so that we make progress – it is better than the status quo, as I understand it, and I listened carefully to the Commissioner’s statement – or whether we should go with the objectors and say that we reject the Commission proposal and start from scratch. My fear with that proposal is that we would then wait another eight years to achieve any progress at all. Perhaps I am exaggerating the case but it does seem to me that that is the likely outcome. I am looking towards an election in the European Parliament, a change of Members of Parliament, a change of Commission, and all the reasons why things get delayed along the way.

I would like to make a few remarks on each of the speeches, but it is unfortunate that some colleagues decided not to listen to my answer, left the Chamber, even though they spoke very categorically. And I would like to draw attention, colleagues, to a few necessary facts. The first thing we know very well is that these proposals were launched in discussions with the entire scientific community in the European Union: endocrinologists, toxicologists, oncologists, cardiologists. I myself am a cardiac surgeon. I know what human health means. And no multinational corporations will help here. It’s not about talking. It’s about scientific criteria and we’ve seen a lot of very different opinions among scientists. As the spheres of regulation are also very wide, we decided to reach a scientific consensus. We are not judges of scientists. They presented their consensus and common view. And they also discussed methodologies and the regulatory mechanism. I would very much like to hear your specific suggestions on methodologies. After all, we have been discussing in the ENVI Committee since 2014, when I came here. We introduced in 2015. positions, then we discussed impact assessment, then it was time for public consultations, we discussed a lot. In fact, we have talked about this more than once in committee, because the profile committee is working on those positions. That is acceptable to me, acceptable to me. Of course, we also discussed legal arguments, and here we started discussions not only with the Council of Europe a year ago, but only in July this year, because we have completed the difficult negotiations, we have coordinated with the Commission's Legal Service, it is not incompetent, because, as you know, it is not possible to submit a proposal without the consent of the Legal Service. I understand that the legal services of different institutions may interpret differently, but I am not a proponent of a legal dispute. And so I think we made a balanced offer and with certain methodologies. In our discussions with the Council, yes, the Member States put forward different arguments, which needed to be reconciled, but this amendment is without prejudice to common criteria and scientific definitions. No more, there is only a common definition by the World Health Organization. We rely on it. Therefore, I think today is a really great opportunity to have a discussion, especially with those who have come out and who are not listening to me now. Discuss because I am open to discussion. A lot of people have talked about democracy, here is democracy - to discuss, but not to express an opinion and come out. I tend to debate. Let me conclude. I am aware that some of you consider the criteria proposed as imperfect. I would, however, like to strongly emphasize once again that their adoption would be a significant step forward compared to the current situation with respect to the better protection of human health and the environment. The current applicable interim criteria are, indeed, not fit for purpose. It is true. We could discuss the theory of the perfect criteria for many more years, as opinions and views on this topic remain deeply divided. However, we will only make progress on this issue if we replace the interim criteria and start to apply new criteria. We will be the pioneering Union in the world. These criteria will provide a unique opportunity to better protect the health of citizens and the environment.

This exclusion affects 95% of the animal kingdom formed by arthropods, with key roles in the balance of ecosystems, in addition to risking the health of humans and other vertebrates.

I thank all my colleagues from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the representatives of the European Commission, the representatives of the Maltese Council Presidency for their fruitful and constructive work. Maritime safety is an issue of vital importance for all European passengers and it is essential that we work to achieve ever higher standards in the Member States, while respecting all the international standards defined within the IMO. It is therefore important that there is congruity and effectiveness of all the rules adopted and that Europe always maintains a proactive and leading role in this regard. Parliament and the Council welcomed the Commission's proposal for revision and simplification in order to clarify several areas covered by the existing legislation and to remove the ambiguities that created problems in the implementation and transposition of the rules. We agreed on the exclusion from the scope of the directive of a number of categories of vessels for which, indeed, the implementation of the required rules was considered disproportionate. I am referring in particular to passenger ships of less than 24 meters in length, to service ships carrying workers to offshore installations, to sailing ships, provided they are equipped with auxiliary mechanical propulsion. I think it was important to clarify and include the concept of aluminum as an equivalent material. It is important that this happens, as we must take into account what are the intrinsic properties of the material and the need to compare them to the fireproofing capacity of similar materials. Aluminum must be considered a material equivalent to steel: passenger safety is at stake in case of accidents and fires. However, as Parliament, we have strongly insisted that there are no gray safety zones for the excluded categories. That is why we have reiterated the need for a commitment by the Commission and the Member States to work, both at national and IMO level, to ensure that safety is always guaranteed. Another important point for us, which emerged in parliamentary proceedings and also carried out in negotiations with the Council, was that of the importance given to the human element and to correlate the social dimension of workers directly with safety on board. The conditions affecting the life on board of the personnel and the social aspects affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the prevention of risks, problems and accidents. It is important that this link becomes a constant and transversal in all EU transport policies. This is why I appeal to the Commissioner to be the spokesperson for this body also in future legislative initiatives. Only if the workers operate in optimal conditions, passengers will be able to have adequate safety standards. Another important point for Parliament was that of transparency: we insisted that any exemptions, equivalences and additional security measures be published on a website accessible to the public and on this issue too we managed to find a convergence with the Maltese Presidency. We accepted the requests from some Member States in order to protect national specificities, in some cases of a geographical nature, in others linked to employment and work aspects. We have therefore managed to reach an agreement with the Council, aware that the provisions adopted by this Assembly must always be an added value for the Member States and not a deleterious element, as unfortunately sometimes happened in the past.In conclusion, I hope that this procedure for revising the legislation in force in the maritime sector will lead to a real benefit to passengers, professionals, companies in the sector and, more generally, the issue of transport safety in Europe.I hope that the Commission will continue in the future to carefully monitor the evolution of the rules adopted to ensure consistently high standards for European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 438, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Izaskun BILBAO BARANDICA", "mepid": "96922", "text": "speaker. - Mr President, improve the safety of passengers in maritime transport, offering homogeneous data to rescue services in the event of an accident throughout the Union, and do so with the most scrupulous respect for privacy and European regulations for the protection of data, is the goal of this report. We collect here an agreement that has been from the beginning with the best disposition on the part of all, an attitude that I want to recognize and I want to thank especially Itxaso and Mae for the work they have done, the shadow rapporteurs and also the Commission. But let me particularly emphasize the role of the Maltese Presidency, which deserves public recognition for the commitment with which it has carried out its six-month presidency. This report also wants to contribute to the shared objective of better legislating, of eliminating obstacles thanks to simpler rules, because, in this specific aspect of passenger data, the regulatory dispersion, organizational conditions and the distance between what they raised The rules and what technology allows was already unacceptable today: a gap that, in addition to penalizing the effectiveness of a possible rescue operation, contributed to legal uncertainty. Thus, this agreement with the Council focuses on the new rules to digitize the passenger registry of ships and offer complete data to rescue services to improve their operation. In this way we protect the right and also respond to the need of family members to have verified and secure information in emergency and distress situations. The purpose is to make the exact number of passengers and other useful information immediately available to search and rescue services in the event of an accident. Nowadays, valuable minutes can be lost, because the data of the people on board is stored by a shipping company. The search and rescue center has to ask the company contact person the necessary information, and, in digital form, the information will be directly accessible. To facilitate assistance to victims and their families, the data recorded will include the nationality of the passengers. Current regulations oblige the shipping company to register the name, date of birth, gender and, if the passenger so wishes, the need for special assistance in case of emergency. In addition, the voluntary possibility is added for the passenger to include a contact telephone number for emergency cases. In accordance with the new requirements, the data will be sent to the competent authority in electronic format within 15 minutes of the ship's departure. Two means of transmission can be used: the national single window or the automatic identification system, subject to certain conditions. I hope that progress in the development of national single windows will serve as the basis for promoting a European single window in the future. The agreement is also characterized by its ability to offer solutions and flexibility and contemplates specific situations for short voyages that affect Germany, Denmark and Sweden. In these cases, data transmission will be accepted up to one hour after the start of the trip. Privacy and data protection is guaranteed by the immediate destruction of these passenger lists, automatically and without undue delay, as soon as the trip is over and the data is no longer necessary to support rescue services in an accident, emergency or for use in court cases. Member States will have four years to carry out the necessary technological and organizational transition and another two from the entry into force of the Directive to be able to incorporate the new rules into their national legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 439, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Dominique RIQUET", "mepid": "96885", "text": ", protractor. - Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, dear colleagues, this report on the inspection system for ro-ro ferries and ferries is an opportunity to recall this terrible accident which took place at one o'clock in the morning on September 28, 1994, between Tallinn and Stockholm. That day, in less than ten minutes, an uncontrolled opening of the loading doors allowed water to rush into the Estonia ferry, which sank, killing 852 people. It was the deadliest passenger ship accident in Europe after the Titanic, and it happened less than 23 years ago. And this is not an isolated accident. A few years earlier, it was off the port of Zeebrugge that another disaster had caused the death, under the same conditions, of 193 people. And four years ago, off South Korea, 454 children were killed in a sinking ferry. In 2015, the ports of the European Union recorded 395 million sea passengers. This is a considerable number, which is why it is essential that the safety of these passengers be ensured to the highest standards. This directive on an inspection system for the safe operation of regular services of ro-ro ferries and high-speed passenger craft is an amendment to the directive on port state control, which becomes the reference directive, and at the same time repeals the directive on a system of compulsory inspections specific to ro-ro ferries. The first exercise was to simplify, rationalize and concentrate the existing standards. We then strengthened and clarified the regulation, the key elements of the report being: clarification of responsibilities between port state and flag state by avoiding duplication and loopholes; definition of the competent authority of the Member State; clarification the frequency of inspections, which must take place twice a year, including one in operation, and at intervals of four to eight months. Another novelty is that inspections of ro-ro ferries and high-speed passenger craft should be considered as an absolute priority in the quota of annual inspections of the Member States. An article has been added on taking into account risks related to passengers and crew, in order to include an additional human element in these inspections. Commission wording allows delegated acts to be adopted as much as necessary under appropriate conditions. Finally, we have an agreement on re-inspections in the event of a change in the use of the vessel. Finally, a database will be set up to allow information to be exchanged as quickly as possible during ongoing inspections between Member States. Let me here thank all the shadow rapporteurs of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their work and excellent collaboration, the responsible Director of the European Commission for his support and expertise, not forgetting of course the Maltese Presidency for its cooperation, its ambition to carry out this triplet of directives and its ability to comply with the remarks and requests of the European Parliament.

We can only applaud the constructive and positive approach of the co—legislators that made it possible to reach a compromise in one month. This clearly shows that the safety of European Union citizens is our principal and shared objective.  The new legal act can still be adopted this year as we regard 2017 as ‘Maritime Transport’ year, during which we are working intensively with all stakeholders and, of course, for the benefit of citizens as is the case when safety rules are reviewed. On Directive 2009/45/EC on safety rules and standards for passenger ships: concerning the safety rules and standards for passenger ships, we welcome an agreement reached on how to deal with an aluminium ship built outside the scope of the directive. The agreed phase-in period provides for a clear direction to influence the business strategies of the shipyards in question in order to adapt and maintain jobs. The duration of this transition still remains long.  On the issue of derogation for land-locked countries with no passenger ships, we are reassured by the agreed solution. While minimising the administrative burden, it provides for strong safeguards that prevent Member States from allowing ships to fly their flag unless they have transposed the corresponding directive.  On Directive 98/41/EC on the registration of passengers, we are glad to see that the Commission’s proposal has been preserved and the vision of electronic data reporting confirmed. However, the six-year phase-in period is a lost opportunity considering the speed of digitalisation in many areas of life. We truly hope that most Member States will not make use of such a long phase-in period in practice. To finish on a positive note, the Commission wholeheartedly welcomes the amendment driven by Parliament to halve the delay in reporting the information on persons on board to the single window. On Directive 1999/35/EC, the inspection proposal means a reduced administrative burden for shipowners. Member States maritime administrations will be able to rationalise their inspection efforts, all the while preserving the same safety level. The new rules should make it easier for the operators to comply with legislation and for the national competent authorities to apply it. It also makes it easier for us – the Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) – to support Member States in implementation and enforcement. We want to take this opportunity to highlight the indispensable contribution of the EMSA in this respect, including its role in enabling the information sharing between Member States.

As part of the simplification process operated by the Commission, many of the definitions contained in the Directive have been adapted to current circumstances, in particular due to the development of technologies in the field of maritime transport. This is the case in particular for ship building materials. In fact, in its initial version, the Directive only applied, for example, to ships made of steel and equivalent materials, but it has not been implemented in the same way in all the Member States. in disregard of safety rules. The proposal therefore clarifies the scope of the Directive as regards the definition of aluminum as an equivalent and resistant material other than steel, in order to achieve high and common safety standards for all these ships.

We must be careful in Europe that we do not have too much overlap of inspections. With the latest proposal, inspections are simplified, simplified and improved. Finally, the service to citizens. That is an important part of these three reports. People know more quickly where they stand. People know more quickly who is on board and that will in turn improve safety.

If we proceed from the arguments of the previous speaker, it is really conclusive that it is necessary to keep updating the safety regulations, especially for passenger shipping, for roll-on / roll-off ships. Safety of Life at Sea - that is the SOLAS agreement. Of course we have to comply. The employers' liability insurance association, which is responsible for the crews, is also behind, so that the working and living conditions on the ships continue to improve. But of course we also look at the passengers in a special way, and the passengers have to be registered as soon as possible when they go on such a ship. This data should be digitized. They should - even if such an IT system is not on board - be transmitted via the automatic ship identification system to the respective port into which this passenger ship is entering. Because especially in difficult situations - when search and rescue is the order of the day, i.e. when marine accidents are looming there - the rescue equipment must be available and land-based rescue units must of course be able to come to such a passenger ship as quickly as possible. Earlier, we heard very specific examples of this from colleague Riquet - whom I would like to thank again for the good work he has done. The ship's construction naturally also plays a crucial role, which is also constantly evolving. Estonia: What was the cause of this unbelievable shipwreck? The bow hatch did not close properly and seawater got into the hold, a free surface, and within a short time this ferry sank and 800 people were killed. We have to have things like that on it. Whether aluminum constructions or steel constructions are the right thing to do - I believe both works very well.And with the high-speed ferries it is of course also necessary that the drive power is appropriate, also with the other passenger ships, so that there is maneuverability, the steering gear is in order, the life-saving appliances are there.In principle, this is how we can shape the future of maritime transport in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 449, "date": "2017-10-03.json", "name": "Isabella DE MONTE", "mepid": "124803", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the tasks we set ourselves as legislators is to check the impact of the rules we are proposing and, if necessary, subsequently revise them to make them leaner.

This revision makes a much—needed update to EU passenger safety legislation and brings our laws in line with the evolving demands and limitations of modern safety standards. The proposal prioritises efficiency and frequency of inspections conducted by national administrations without unnecessarily restricting ships’ commercial operations. With 23 coast Member States and four island Member States, passenger ships play an important role in EU citizens’ mobility. This makes safety regulations in this area all the more important.

But security is not ensured by recording passenger data; it is ensured by using modern ships, boarding and disembarking passengers quickly and possibly having cameras in various parts of ships and ports.

We will also duly respond to the Parliament’s call to assess the need for common European requirements for sailing ships and ship carrier tenders. Concerning the legislation proposal, we are ensuring that the competent authorities have immediate access to accurate data on persons on board in case of emergency, and that they can therefore deal with any accident more effectively. I am sure that you will continue to fully support our efforts to further digitalise maritime transport and to enhance the single window for reporting formalities. This is where the Commission is committed to proposing revised legislation on reporting formalities by next April, which will establish a harmonised European maritime single window environment. The new rules on inspections will ensure that the respective regime brings value for money for all parties concerned. Besides the cost savings, it removes the unnecessary duplication and complexity of existing regimes, which had developed over time and resulted in overlapping requirements spread across different pieces of legislation. The new rules will facilitate implementation, monitoring and enforcement. I am sure that you will continue to fully support our efforts to further improve, simplify and modernise maritime legislation, and Commissioner Bulc looks forward to our future cooperation.
