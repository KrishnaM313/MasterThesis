Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Today, we are actually faced with a very crucial question: to what extent can we still save our concept of ownership into a digital world? How can we adjust that? Do we really want to protect our property as we know it? And does the right of ownership still apply to us at all, or who owns it? Do we want to create a legal framework for the Internet here, so that owners are not basically robbed? That is the big question that we are dealing with here today, and to what extent this needs to be weighed up, balanced between freedom of expression and the theft of property. That is what it is all about. And do we want to allow everything on the Internet in the end, or do we still have the protection of values? I know that the whole discussion hangs on to the famous Article 13 and everything is focused on it. However, I would also like to take a very brief position on the other content that we have enshrined in this directive. That is, we have modern text and data mining, a commercial text and data mining that we implement there, which is very advanced, and also the world's first way in this direction. Through Article 12, we have created a possibility for Member States affected by this to rebalance the Reprobel judgment of the ECJ for authors and book publishers. With Articles 14ff., everything in the old order, we have created an opportunity for the artists – for the small artists, for actors, for all creatives – to get a better relationship with the rights holders, producer labels or even publishers, without always having to go to court, by offering opportunities to improve the relationship accordingly. With Article 11, we have a chance for our press publishers to get a better right. And that is what we are basically doing here, which is to give them only the right. How they deal with the law in the end is up to them, but they have the opportunity to get on a better footing with the appropriate platforms here, because here, too, the possibility prevails on the Internet and this has developed in recent years in such a way that what is available on the Internet is simply considered free and used in a way. , that publishers can no longer benefit from this. If we look at Article 13, there is often a failure to point out that we have created access, a definition, according to which we only drop the platforms under Article 13, which know full well that they are using the property of others and are making a lot of money with it. Ultimately, this becomes a question of how this can actually be implemented technically in the case of platforms that invite everyone to upload everything they want, where the platforms must also have a responsibility that we want to give them today – a responsibility to deal properly with the property of others and also to respect the property of others. That is the question at stake today. We have created a working, good basis for making progress here, which also gives the Member States guidance on how to implement the whole thing accordingly. That is why I believe that this is the right way forward here, in order to balance property rights, freedom of expression and the digital world.

The media bombardment of the last few days has once again attempted to divert attention from the true scope of today's vote.

Behind the fake news of these days hide instead precise interests of those who want the network to continue to be a far west dominated by a few large platforms.

Madam President, dear rapporteurs, dear shadow rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, let me first of all thank you for the constructive debate we have had over the last two and a half years. The Copyright Directive is an essential part of our Digital Single Market strategy. Therefore, on behalf of the European Commission, we are pleased to see that an interim political agreement has been reached on this important issue. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a crucial moment for European culture, for our digital economy and for the defence of our European values. The new Copyright Directive will achieve our common goal of adapting copyright to the twenty-first century. The directive will benefit those who make our European values what they are: authors, interpreters, journalists, press and book publishers, film and music producers, digital services, researchers, libraries and many others. It will help our press and the creative sector, it will strengthen artificial intelligence and make European cultural heritage more easily accessible to our citizens. Finally, for the first time in EU legislation, individual creators will benefit from specific provisions that will strengthen their negotiating position and help them obtain fair remuneration. Ladies and gentlemen, all these actors, all these authors look at us and expect the European Union to keep its promises. Better equipping our creators is to keep our culture alive. Better equipping our journalists is to keep our democracy alive. We believe that the text of the political agreement before you is balanced but also ambitious, it reconciles the different interests at stake. Creators and other rights holders will be fairly compensated, the impact on service providers will remain proportionate and users and their freedom of expression will be protected. Finally, let me mention that the Commission will issue a statement on the situation of the organisers of sporting events accompanying the adoption of the directive. The text of the declaration is attached to the legislative resolution. Therefore, I am pleased to hear your point of view and I remain in this expectation, while sincerely hoping that, through support for the Copyright Directive, we will all send, once again, a strong signal, a signal to our creators, our authors, our values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Zdzisław KRASNODĘBSKI", "mepid": "124891", "text": "  draft opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab A directive on copyright in the digital market is needed – we are all aware of this.

It would not benefit the citizens, the authors, or the SMEs, but simply the GAFA.  What citizens want today is an internet that is fair, where platforms are accountable, where authors are paid, where everyday uses are protected. This is exactly what this text contains, and this afternoon's vote actually raises only one question: yes or no, do platforms have a responsibility to our society?

The Internet is not only access to the works of famous authors and journalists. It's the work of digital wizards, commentators, going into millions every day. It is false to write that there is no general obligation to filter, because at the same time there is a legal requirement that everything be checked for licenses. Someone promotes their product with references to content that, for example, as pastiche should be exceptions. But will machine filtering recognize the nuances? You will end up with precautionary platforms. They have to take on the full burden of recognizing legality. I don't want corporations to decide whether to put content into circulation. This caution will turn into prevention for fear of penalties. In the past, prevention is censorship, in the digital world – it's a mistake, but it's also a loss of opportunity for earnings and reputation.

Madam President, this morning is a very historic moment because, for the first time on a continent, a parliamentary assembly is trying to rebalance the relationship between the GAFA and those who feed them, that is, the creators and the press.  The creative economy, which brews 530 billion euros each year and employs 7.2 million employees in Europe, is seriously threatened by the unfairness of these financial reports. But there is at least as serious, if not immediately dangerous, the press economy is collapsing in pieces and, so far, no one knows how to fix it. The press, ladies and gentlemen, the press, Madam President, is the basis of democracy. When there is no free press, when there are no journalists in Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, or anywhere else, you will have no more information. You will have passions and rumors like the ones we have just had for a number of months.  This text is the only chance for European creators, media companies and journalists to rebalance the situation in their favour and protect their future. That is why we must vote on this text and vote for it in a block, refusing all the amendments. We have to take this text as a whole, because it is only a first step. More will be needed to rebalance this matter.  We are told about censorship, we are told about filtering, we are told about Wikipedia. Wikipedia is protected in the text, there is no censorship, there is no filtering, and why did these ideas reach this Chamber? Because for the first time in my fifteen years in office, we have been bombarded like vulgar cultural intellectual political prisoners by financial behemoths who will take all of our activities.

Firstly, 200 000 people demonstrated against this reform this weekend. Five million have signed a petition against upload filters. There has never been such a broad protest against an EU directive.  Secondly, protests have never been so consistently ignored by this House. Already in the summer, voters faced a massive disinformation campaign. Instead of dealing with criticism, every critical voice was covered in insults. Rumours were spread – as Mr Cavada has just done – emails came from bots, the EU Commission has called critics a mob, and the head of the CDU delegation, Mr Caspary, even says that demonstrators are paid. All these defamations are fictitious and easily refuted.  They were launched by a few lobby groups, and they were disseminated in the feuilleton of certain newspapers that hoped to profit from copyright reform. Unfortunately, this disinformation worked. Today, with images of mass demonstrations going around the world, some still believe that the emails do not come from real people. This belief that all criticism is driven by America has vaccinated her against addressing the substance of the concern. No matter that the warning about upload filters comes from the Federal Data Protection Commissioner, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and from leading research centres.  (Interjections) Thirdly, no one, neither the Union nor the SPD nor the opposition, thinks this reform makes sense. Nobody wants to take political responsibility for upload filters that come with Article 13. The federal government will still vote for it.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to have all your time. I would also like to be able to make my speech. Thank you. Madam President, I am waiting for colleagues to calm down.  (The President asked Members to rest) Nobody in the Federal Government wants to take responsibility for the upload filters, not even Chancellor Merkel. The federal government will still vote for it. And since yesterday, we also know why this might be the case, because the FAZ has uncovered a horse-trading between Germany and France, according to which Germany seems to accept upload filters – in exchange for France's approval of the Nord Stream gas pipeline. The most tragic...  (Interjections) (The President urged Members to rest) Ladies and gentlemen, the most tragic thing about this process is that a new generation, which is going to the European elections for the first time this year, is learning its lesson. Your protests are worth nothing, politics will tip out lies about you and will not be impressed by factual arguments when it comes to hard-hitting geopolitical interests. This experience, this feeling of powerlessness, will have a lasting impact on them. Ladies and gentlemen, that is not the way we can make policy.  This directive must not be allowed to pass without amendment. Not only would this be devastating for freedom on the internet, it would also deprive an entire generation of confidence that politics works and that this Parliament represents the interests of the people. That is why we need to delete Articles 11 and 13.

Now don’t think for a second that the creative industries are uniformly behind this legislation, because they’re not. But the big players are the ones with the money to lobby and I care far more about the voices and views of my constituents, about ordinary people, than the views of lobbyists who are paid to tell us what they want us to think. Now, of course, what we need is a balance between protecting creators of copyrighted material and protecting the lawful rights of citizens going about their daily business. But this legislation, in particular Articles 11 and 13, does not deliver that balance. It is fundamentally illiberal, because in practice tech companies will end up treating citizens as guilty until proven innocent on copyright, content will end up being removed automatically. It will push one size fits all enforcement upon platforms across Europe, despite national copyright law being different from one country to the next. You can’t deal with that minefield, so legal content will end up being treated as though it is illegal.

Apparently, unrelated connections are established, and somehow a swap is made between Nord Stream 2 on the one hand and the upload filters on the other. I do not believe that this is the style in which we should be making policy here. We should ask properly: do we really need these upload filters in order to enforce the completely undisputed copyright protection? Nobody wants to take their income from the artists, but is it really necessary to do this with these filters? And when it is said in this House that the law does not provide any filters at all, that is simply untrue. Because, of course, the law states that each platform must first check whether it actually infringes copyrights before making the content public. This check is a filter, and therefore an upload filter is included in this law. However, this upload filter leads to overblocking, it leads precisely to the fact that the small artists, who do not yet have a distribution, do not yet have a publisher, will not be able to distribute their content.

The new copyright aims to put an end to this by holding platforms such as YouTube itself liable for copyright infringements. As a result, they are forced to ask permission from the author, for which they can ask for a fair fee. In my opinion, the fear of excessive blocking is unjustified. The new directive provides for the necessary guarantees for a free Internet. Many existing platforms were excluded and smaller platforms and startups have a separate arrangement. Moreover, a general filter is not mandatory and further specific exceptions are clearly defined (memes, snippets, hyperlinks, quotes, ...).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, so here we are, with tomorrow's vote, we are delivering a good text to the next Parliament and to the work of the trialogue with the Commission and the Council. The European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund remain europe's largest public investment instruments for the period 2021-2027, despite the budget cuts presented by the Commission and which remain unacceptable to us in Parliament. It is therefore not a luxury, nor a waste of public resources. Regional policy supports job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development and improving the quality of life of citizens in all regions and cities of the Union. They are the essential tool to combat territorial and social inequalities, they work to leave no one behind, be they a person or a territory, a city, a peripheral community. This has been the case with Greece, Portugal and Ireland; this was the case with Italy after the seismic events of recent years, to promote the safety of our territories, starting with that extraordinary heritage that is cultural heritage. Despite the last ten years of austerity, which have reduced the policies of development and massive strategic investments for our countries – a dramatic reduction – in this context, regional policy has become increasingly important, without which public investment in the lagging Member States would have halved. So we are in the new regulation. There are five priorities: firstly, innovative, intelligent and inclusive development; a greener, low-carbon, resilient Europe that can meet the challenge of energy transition; a more interconnected Europe, improving people's mobility; a more social and inclusive Europe, implementing the European pillar of social rights, for new welfare, for a new pact between European citizens and Europe; a Europe that is closer to its citizens, promoting sustainable development and integrating cities and non-urban areas through local initiatives. This is all the choices that are at the heart of the new regulation for the ERDF and cohesion policy: we have established a thematic concentration which provides, for all categories of regions, to allocate at least 30% of the resources of the objective concerning the environmental challenge; we have introduced elements of flexibility to enable those regions that need them to have policies that are more attentive to local development; we have increased the minimum funding limit for urban areas and large cities to 10% and, at the same time, we have introduced an absolute novelty, namely a 5% that will have to be allocated to small municipalities and disadvantaged areas, such as mountain areas; we have introduced the possibility of financing programmes to strengthen public administrations; We have obtained, with the CPR, important instruments to allow ad hoc flexibility to co-finance strategic investments with the Structural Funds. In short, I believe that we have done a great deal of good work: thank you very much to all my fellow Members who have contributed to this important effort. It is now up to us, it is up to the debate, it is up to the vote, to the debate that we are going to have in this House and tomorrow for the vote. I know that there are still open questions, especially on environmental issues, which concern real interests for the lives of citizens: we will debate and vote. But I appeal to all of you: let us keep the vote on this instrument together and give the next Parliament a really innovative instrument that can generate development and growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, tomorrow’s vote is another milestone in the post-2020 negotiations of the shared management of EU funds, as the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund sets up the main investment tools in research and innovation, climate change, connectivity and social infrastructure. On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to commend the rapporteur Mr Cozzolino, as well as the other Members of the European Parliament in the Committee on Regional Development (REGI), and in the other committees, for the efficiency and the quality of the work done in such a short time. We can only regret that the May elections are already so close, that despite this great effort, the timing of the first reading will not permit trilogues to start during the term of this Parliament. When looking into the REGI report, the Commission recognises and welcomes the effort to root the policy deeper in the territorial reality of every region and to ensure that no region is left behind.  However, as much as we share the objectives, we do not always agree on the best tools to achieve them. Allow me to raise two issues which are ‘thematic concentration’ and the ‘scope of support’. Concentration of resources on a limited number of priorities — thematic concentration, if you like — is a key principle that spurs efficiency of investment, avoiding funds from being distributed too thinly. This is why the ambitious levels of thematic concentration should be maintained. Cohesion policy should steer investments towards our common objectives of a smarter and greener Europe.  Concentration requirements at national level does not mean more centralisation. On the contrary, it allowed for greater flexibility in setting up regional concentration thresholds, as richer regions could compensate for poorer ones.  Member States where relations between national, regional and local partners are based on trust and open dialogue could easily achieve that. In terms of objectives, the Commission has proposed a clear vision by defining broad policy objectives of a smarter, greener, a better connected and more social Europe. Specific objectives — second level objectives, if you like — are not intended to describe an exhaustive menu of eligible actions, but rather to indicate their purpose. This was a further step from an action-based to a result-oriented approach. Unfortunately, we did not manage to get a mutual understanding on this issue.  Redefining the content of specific objectives, as proposed by the Parliament, notably in relation to broadband, urban mobility, tourism, natural resources and sports, would have significant policy implications. It would dilute thematic concentration and encourage sectoral project-based investments rather than an integrated approach, based on territorial strategies. The Commission has proposed to exclude from funding a few areas which were evaluated as having low impact and EU added-value, for example investment in landfills, or could have a long-term lock-in effect, preventing the achievement of agreed EU or international goals, for example investment in fossil fuels.  We are afraid that Parliament’s amendments could result in inefficiencies of investments.  Finally, the Commission would like to stress that provisions related to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact should not be introduced through sectoral legislation. The Commission has proposed that the Common Provisions Regulation should continue to regulate the link with economic governance, through the principle of macro-economic conditionality. I look forward to a fruitful debate and thank you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 85, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Jan OLBRYCHT", "mepid": "28288", "text": "  author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for We have listened attentively to the Commissioner and her criticisms of the European Parliament's amendments – which, at the beginning of the discussion, promises to be interesting.

But we also recognise that it is an important fund, and therefore we would welcome most of the proposals put forward by the rapporteur, unlike maybe the Commission.

Cohesion funds support is simply essential to meet these objectives, and in many countries they account for up to 50% of all public investment, and without these funds, they do not have the possibility to modernise.

We have managed to reflect the claims of our peripheral and outermost regions. We have been able to introduce the problem of depopulation, as crucial to the future of countries like Spain. Stopping the rural exodus begins by boosting the development of small population centres, and to this end we are committed to endothing ERDF resources to stimulate areas with democratic handicaps. Thanks to the joint work, we have made the fight against depopulation very present, and regional funds could be used to revitalize our peoples, especially with regard to social innovation and the green economy.

At the same time, when it comes to investment in gas to replace more—polluting fossil fuels, it is surprising that such calls are coming from colleagues from countries that benefited from the funds for such activities and now want to prevent other Member States to do the same while, at the same time, they are promoting gas infrastructure like Nord Stream 2.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Raffaele FITTO", "mepid": "4465", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and to all my fellow Members who have worked very well in committee on a fundamental text.

The European Commission's proposal, which we have been working on, clearly presents a position that is for greater efficiency, greater flexibility and simplification of the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. It was essential that this message and this trend be maintained in the report, which was adopted in the Committee on Regional Development.  I would like to highlight a few positive elements of the report. First, this is to increase the contribution of the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund to climate change objectives by 35% and 40% of the Cohesion Fund respectively. With regard to urban development, the proposal of the Committee on Regional Development is 10% with a view to strengthening the urban dimension of cohesion policy and supporting the successful implementation of the urban agenda.  For the Group of Liberals and Democrats, there are several key elements of the Regulation that are in the context of the reformed cohesion policy and its interaction with other sectoral Community policies. We support the Commission's proposal as regards thematic concentration based on gross national income, flexibility and adaptability at the level of individual regions. ALDE's position is to maintain the concentration of resources towards a smarter and lower carbon Europe.

We are speaking about the next budget, the next Cohesion Policy, and the next European Development Fund and Cohesion Fund. At the same time, we are speaking not only about money, we are also speaking about the policy, which is based on solidarity. The policy is meant to help the regions where convergence is not yet ‘finished business’, to increase GDP and employment and many other important things.  This is not ‘just’ about the money, but rather ‘also’ about the money. We know that in the next programming period there will be less money in Cohesion Policy, and whenever we face such a situation, we have to think about how to invest the money. The debate here was mainly about this topic. We are all aware that we want to do more with less money, and we need to do more. The value for money principle has to be maintained. It must not be spending; it must be smart and sustainable investment. There will always be the people who see plastic castles. I have always seen thousands, or tens of thousands, of new jobs, investments, growth of European industry, cleaner air, cleaner rivers and many other very visible results of the previous investments from European Cohesion Policy. It has to be kept, and that’s why when we try to have better value for money so that the investments are to the benefit of the citizens, we need to have that thematic concentration and a clear added value of the investments. I would like to thank Parliament for all the good work that hopefully, by the end of tomorrow, will result in a first reading position on the entire Cohesion Policy legislative package. It paves the way to restart the legislative process on all fronts as soon as possible in October.  If we want to avoid delays in launching the post-2020 programmes, not only do the regulations have to be adopted this year, but the programming documents in Member States and regions also have to be prepared and adopted in a timely manner. The Commission cannot agree to any proposals that jeopardise the efficiency and added value of Cohesion Policy projects.  I have a final comment, coming back to the question of smarter cities or smarter villages. For decades, European Cohesion Policy has tried to balance fairly the development of urban areas and rural areas, and this should remain in the future Cohesion Policy. The Common Provisions Regulation introduces a new dedicated policy objective – a Europe closer to citizens – by fostering the sustainable and integrated development of urban, rural and coastal areas through local initiatives, which should allow for a well-integrated, multi-sectoral approach to urban development. The strategies are expected to further improve coherence in interventions and strategic planning.

On the subject of thematic concentration, we have been in line with the indications given to us by the Commission, but we have strengthened, as was right, the regional dimension, otherwise it would have been a vain concentration from this point of view, such as, I would say to those who have raised the issue of the environment, that never has a programme concentrated so many resources over the next few years on tackling environmental challenges at local level. , territorial and regional: we are over 30% of the resources. Furthermore, the principle we have adopted, both in the CPR and in the regulation on flexibility, is very important in order to strengthen cofinancing, release annual resources and strengthen strategic investments through cohesion policy. Finally – it seems to me that a significant result, as all the rapporteurs and speakers have grasped – we put at the centre the issue, above all, of the realities that have suffered the most in recent years, where there have been obvious demographic declines but also a progressive disappearance of the function of the State and of Europe, fewer services, fewer opportunities. There we have intervened and we want to intervene with cohesion policy to bring millions of citizens back to the centre of European policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. In this Parliament we are always witnessing astonishing moments, in this case the always astonishing twists and turns in the cooperation with my co-rapporteur Axel Voss. This legislation is a lesson in the fact that the better argument can exist even and especially when the other side claims the opposite, without making better arguments themselves. With these two sister directives, we have achieved a great deal for European consumer protection. Consumer law is also applicable when customers do not pay in hard currency, but companies receive personal data that commercialises them, for example through targeted advertising. Consumer protection rights are, of course, the same – as was not originally intended – whether consumers download an app or rent or buy an online game, and regardless of whether the consumer does his/her purchases with and through a smart refrigerator. All software must be interoperable with any common hardware – this is also an important principle. Consumers are entitled to software updates that lead to a longer service life and greater security of internet-enabled and so-called smart products that would be useless and worthless without appropriate working software. The portability of content produced by consumers over a short or even long period of use of social networks, cloud services or smart speakers is another point: the maintenance of minimum harmonisation in the area of warranty periods, with a simultaneous extension of the time limit or for the reversal of the burden of proof from six months to one year or even two years in certain cases. I think that in doing so, we have really brought in components in this legislation, in these two directives, which have become real twin directives, thanks to our strong cooperation, including with the rapporteur, Mr Arimont, so that we have really got the best out of consumers that we have been able to get out. This was not taken for granted from the outset, because we had to fight hard, very, very hard for three years in order for this right to really be enforced in this way. The Commission did not always agree either. The right-wing side of this European Parliament has also had to swallow one or the other. But we have succeeded in enforcing this. With the help of a great, tireless and constantly struggling team, I have achieved the goal I had – a goal for which I was occasionally ridiculed at the beginning of this legislative process. I remember saying at the beginning: 'Yes, I want this right, it is to be developed, but it must not reduce the law in any Member State and any Member State'. It has been said that this is not possible, we want full harmonisation, and if we accept all the law in all the Member States, that is unacceptable. We did it. We have managed to achieve this, thanks in part to cooperation with the Commissioner, and also because we have achieved minimum harmonisation in certain areas, so that where there is wider law, this broader right can be maintained. Because the populists would have been happy if we had done it differently, because they would have had the best. So I'm incredibly proud of what we've achieved. At the same time, we have achieved an internationally unprecedented high and innovative consumer protection law – that is digital consumer protection at European level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 125, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Axel VOSS", "mepid": "96761", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner and co-rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, I would like to thank mrs Gebhardt for her work on this report. First of all, I would like to thank the Commission very much for this very progressive proposal that has been made here in a new area. And I would like to thank the co-rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, very warmly for the very intensive cooperation that has resulted in something good as a result of the dispute. Mrs Gebhardt has driven consumer protection more forward, and I was actually more interested in digital contract rights with my legal background. In this way, we have been able to put the two together well and have achieved a reasonable and good result.  It took us a long time to do this, but there were also some problems to be avoided: on the one hand, the question of how we actually deal with the relationship with data protection, but also with copyright, and on the other hand, the great debate about how we actually deal with smart goods, where we first managed to include this in this directive. , and then afterwards, during the negotiations with the Council, we decided to include this smart goods in the report, which will come afterthat, from Pascal Arimont to the tangible goods – because that then played a reasonable role there. What we wanted to achieve in principle was, as far as possible, full harmonisation in individual legal consequences, and we basically did not want to leave any gaps in the treatment of these smart goods, which ultimately led us to say that the legal consequences of both legal acts must basically describe the same legal consequence. It doesn't matter if I buy the same property directly, order it online or download it. And that's what often mattered and where it became difficult to set a line. That is why I believe that, with the Digital Content Directive, we have also created a good basis for a common digital single market, that we have been able to achieve what I would like to see in the Council, from minimum harmonisation to full harmonisation at certain deadlines: the desire to create a digital single market in the digital sector as well. , and does not retract to including only his own BGB regulations or civil legislation, and says that we must not disturb this. No, it is precisely in this digital area that we must create a level where we are all convinced that full harmonisation at European level makes sense.  This directive, which we are discussing today, is intended to ensure that contractual remedies also apply to the provision of digital content throughout the Union. At present, this is only the case at EU level with the minimum requirements set out in the 1999 directive, and therefore there is still this difference in legislation, and therefore also legal uncertainty, which also affects consumer confidence in cross-border trade. That is why this step has now been taken. And we also want to ensure that it no longer makes any difference whether a consumer purchases the digital content or services in one Member State or another. With the reversal of the burden of proof and full harmonisation in this area, the legal situation in each Member State is clear.  That is why I think that we are taking an important step here and that we are making good progress on the digital level as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 126, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Pascal ARIMONT", "mepid": "24922", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I am happy to take up the picture of Mrs Gebhardt, who said that after a long, hard and tough struggle, we gave birth to twins. I myself don't have the ambition to have children, but having twins feels something like that. I know this from parents who did this or who were lucky enough to have twins. Getting twins is really a difficult thing, especially the first few months. That is exactly what we have achieved, because we have brought these twin directives into the world. With these two directives, we are, for the first time, putting in place uniform guarantee rules that apply throughout the EU, whether you buy online or offline, whether it is a piece of furniture, an app or a smartphone. By the way, the smartphone exemplifies how fluid the boundaries between classic goods and digital content have become. First of all, it's a device I can touch. However, this device runs on a digital operating system and is almost constantly connected to the Internet. And finally, I can also download all apps with the device – from photo editing to single exchange. The challenge was therefore to create coherent and coordinated guarantee rules that apply both to a classic non-digital product and to an operating system or a music streaming app, as uniformly as possible across the EU. This new legal framework applies where the purchased goods or the subscribed video streaming service breaks down. That is what it is all about. What is the consumer's right or what does the trader have to do, and what does he have to look at or consider? Basically, the following basic framework applies, which already exists when buying a classic product and which we are now introducing for both digital content and smart devices. Firstly, every consumer in the EU has at least two years' warranty on all goods and all digital content. Secondly, if something breaks within this two-year period, any consumer can request repair or repair or replacement from the dealer, discount or even termination of the contract with the return of money. As far as trade in goods in particular is concerned, we have been able to introduce some news. The first is to double the so-called time limit for reversal of the burden of proof. In other words, the consumer no longer has to prove after six months that his purchased goods were defective from the outset, but only after one year, and the Member States are free to increase this period to even two years. Secondly, it will be easier for the consumer to terminate the contract of sale. If a defect reappears after an initial repair or replacement, the customer can immediately terminate the purchase contract and receive his money back. Thirdly, manufacturers should also be made more accountable, because if they state that their equipment lasts a certain amount of time, the consumer should also be able to contact them directly to request repair or replacement. We are therefore clearly strengthening consumers by not only giving them clear rights, but also by asserting these rights throughout the EU. However, this standardisation should benefit not only consumers, but also businesses, especially small ones. In the future, they no longer need to worry about what law is to be applied if they want to sell to other European countries. And this is of particular benefit to small retailers who do not have a legal department, such as the large online retailers. With these new rules, we are strengthening the rights of consumers. We give businesses legal certainty and thus create confidence in our Digital Single Market and in cross-border trade in goods. I would therefore like to thank all the Colleagues who have worked on this text. We have shown in all – and I say to all – groups the will it takes to find compromises. And in times of polarization and black-and-white thinking, the good old compromise is the highest and best form of parliamentary democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 127, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this is a great moment for me because, after quite a long time, we are coming to the end of the legislative process on these two proposals which are of great added value for EU consumers and business.  I am not so sure about twins. I would rather speak about two sisters. In my language ‘directive’ is ‘she’. One sister proved to be rather sporty and quite modern and the other one became fatter and fatter because she also swallowed the offline shopping – not only online – and she proved not to be easy to move in the process. But after all, we managed and it was thanks to the very good cooperation of the co—legislators and of course my special thanks go to Ms Gebhardt, Mr Arimont and Mr Voss, who know very well that we went through some dramatic moments and some moments of anxiety that there was no easy result which would fulfil the purpose.  But here we are. I think that the result is very good. We have all worked towards one common goal: ensuring effective protection for consumers, while at the same time removing barriers to the digital single market. For the first time, European consumers and businesses will be able to rely on largely harmonised rules, specifically designed for the supply of digital content and digital services. Moreover, the current sales rules are modernised with the specific regulation of smart goods. This will cover a rapidly growing market of a wide variety of products, ranging from smartphones and laptops to connected toys and smart home systems. The new rules will also ensure that consumers are adequately protected and more confident when buying smart goods across the EU. This includes receiving updates for digital elements that are necessary for a satisfactory use of the product. For businesses, the two proposals are an important step forward in terms of legal certainty. The digital content proposal achieves a very high degree of harmonisation and prevents legal fragmentation, while the sale of goods proposal also provides for fully harmonised conformity criteria and consumer remedies throughout the EU. This will decrease the costs of having to adjust to different national laws.  We have promised European consumers and businesses a modern and coherent set of contract rules for their everyday transactions and you are about to deliver this to them. I see many beautiful young people in the audience. I am sure that most of them go online for their shopping so I think I have a good message for the consumers who are also sitting here with us that there should be no bad surprises when you go shopping online from a different Member State because there are going to be highly harmonised contract tools on the digital single market.  So my message is: enjoy your shopping, don’t worry, be happy and be aware that the rules will work for your greater protection.

These two directives create a standard set of consumer and contract law rules that boost consumer confidence throughout the EU, when the digital business-to-consumer market is growing.

It is also quite positive that we cover the contents embedded in physical goods. Indeed, it would have been incomprehensible to protect the consumer only for material goods, without worrying about embedded software that ensures their proper functioning. With regard to the text on digital content, this is a particularly important directive because it will harmonize European rules in an area where sometimes there is still no national rule. We must also welcome the fact that we have reached an agreement that will provide a homogeneous European framework for this growing sector. We also wanted to take into account the reality of consumer use, including in the text contracts that are concluded against payment, but also contracts that are concluded by the collection of personal data.

It will also make it easier for people to cancel contracts or seek refunds if those products are not up to scratch, so the recent example of a French newspaper making it very easy to instantly subscribe online but then requiring all cancellations to be done by a paper form should be a thing of the past.

Thus, in the presence of a lack of conformity, the buyer can ask the seller to repair or replace the goods and then have the right to a price reduction or termination of the contract. In this respect, however, we must also strengthen the protections of small retailers and SMEs against producers. In fact, for retailers, the costs incurred for repair or replacement can be very onerous and disproportionate to earnings. Furthermore, in terms of protection, it is now written in black and white that those who buy a digital asset will have the same protections as those who buy a material asset; so those who buy music or movies online will have the same protections as those who buy a CD or DVD.

They pursue two main objectives: firstly, to ensure the same rights for purchasers who purchase goods and services in both the traditional channel and the digital channel at a distance via the internet. Secondly, it is about harmonisation of rules across the Union and, above all, harmonisation between countries, because at the moment online sales are a very segmented market.

According to the OECD, EUR 6.2 billion are needed globally to make our economy more sustainable and to limit global warming to 2°. With this in mind, the report introduces two new types of benchmarks and encourages investments to be channelled towards those who are on a decarbonisation trajectory. It reduces the risk of greenwashes and obliges all benchmark administrators to disclose how they are aligned with the ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. Sustainability is a multifaceted concept. However, some aspects like diversity are often neglected. I recall the first time I spoke in the Chamber; it was with President Nicole Fontaine. Twenty years later, surprisingly, she remains the one and only female President of this House. Shocking. We claim to be global leaders when it comes to equality. Many female Members of this House leave to become Ministers, Prime Ministers, Commissioners, yet in these 20 years we’ve had no female Commission President, we’ve had no female President of the European Parliament, and we’ve had no female leader of the big political groups.

It is high time to take action to curb this practice, especially as Member States' services are reluctant to cooperate with each other and exchange little information. This is a fundamental problem in the fight against financial and tax crimes. Moreover, some governments, because of the tax model in their countries, are in principle opposed to prosecuting fraud in this area. Tax fraud not only affects Member States' budgets, but also weakens competition in the single market. Small and medium-sized enterprises cannot afford to hire advisers to answer how to optimise taxes. In principle, it is difficult to identify the reasons why we should continue to maintain the existing situation and existing legal solutions. They do not serve the budgetary policies of the Union and the Member States, nor do they strengthen the European economy. For all these reasons, I think it is a good idea to create a Pan-European legal framework for cross-border investigations into tax and financial crimes, which is why I voted with full responsibility today to support the report prepared by the TAX3 committee.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 197, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Paloma LÓPEZ BERMEJO", "mepid": "125047", "text": "   – Mr President, tax evasion and avoidance is a matter that undermines our economies, attracts resources that can be devoted to the well-being of the majority and impairs public confidence in institutions. The view that tax obligations are not equal for all has contributed to increased exasperation and outrage in our societies. It cannot be hidden that fiscal pressure and demands are always for the popular sectors and the middle classes. The defiscicalization of income has also meant a visible deterioration of public services for majority in our countries. Under the false excuse that fewer taxes favour investment and employment, fiscal avoidance mechanisms have been encouraged that have impoverished States and made social policies difficult. I voted in favour of this report because the TAX3 Commission has worked well and revealed the extent to which large companies are using increasingly aggressive tax engineering mechanisms to circumvent their responsibilities. At this point, the existence of tax havens is the great hole that allows to evade taxes and evade the obligations of those who have the most and large companies. We have also seen that the diversity of tax models in Europe creates competition between countries that is exploited by large companies for the sole purpose of contributing less and less. In this competitive logic nothing is gained and we all lose. Sooner or later someone can put lower rates and offer better tax advantages. Competition for fewer rights is detrimental to the vast majority. That is why it is now clear that countries are committed to implementing the proposals that this report makes. If we really want to regain the trust of societies and reduce unrest and social anger, we must guarantee the minimums that make our societies trust their institutions.

Firstly, we are faced with the last procedure for approving the management of this legislature, for the 2017 financial year, which is an important year for the budget of the European Union. But it is also important this moment, 2019, because we are facing a balance sheet where precisely the new elections of 26 May — of the week of the end of May — are going to be key to the future of the European Union. It is therefore essential to take a brief account of all these years — fifteen in my case, since it has been three legislatures — where we have learned all the institutions together. This European Parliament has exercised firmly, but at the same time opening itself up to all the other institutions to learn together and to find the best systems, paths and possibilities to make the Union budget implemented where it had been decided on values, priorities, and with all its guarantees of regularity and legality. I believe that, in that regard, Mr Lehne, I have to thank you - because you represent the Court of Auditors here - for the invaluable aid and the joint progression of both of them, which has been of enormous importance. I believe that the fact that we are facing the second year in which the declaration of reliability is not negative opens up precisely possibilities for a journey where European citizens are clearly told that all this work has been worthwhile, since in this whole period the levels of error have been greatly reduced. But it is true, and so does the Court of Auditors, and we have discussed it in depth with the Commission, that there are new challenges that appear. For example, the issue of financial instruments, which are very diverse right now; new trust funds, which also appear on the horizon as a possibility; or even the problems of public competitions or the various problems of the future, of new challenges such as defence, climate change or other fundamental aspects for the European Union, which certainly require all our wisdom and firmness for the future. I have to say that we have tried to make this 2017 report as readable as possible so that both those who come to the election and, above all, citizens, could read what the progress has been and where the fundamental challenges and problems are. We have worked on direct management, which presents some questions that the Commission will have to face. We have spoken and worked in shared management, where much has been improved — we must tell the Council that it has gradually been able to overcome some of the major problems — and also in indirect management, where, through these funds, these agencies and these new formulas, we need to go further in terms of inventing ourselves and in terms of controlling the European Union's budget. I would like to say that, since the vote in committee — which I thank very much for all my colleagues, the Secretariat and the Secretariats of the Groups, which have been of great help – two new things have happened. Once, OLAF's action — or misconduct this time — in relation to the IMG organisation and, on the other hand, a very important aspect of the conflict of interest relating to the Secretary-General of the Commission, which we will have the opportunity to see in the debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the EIB for their data, which have been very useful in drawing up this report. The European Union's action to promote development in third countries is crucial and important. Consequently, even given the figures at stake, it becomes extremely important to monitor their operation and results. I would like to start by addressing one of the most important issues, namely the fact that the Court of Auditors, in its annual report, pointed out that the estimated error rate for payments made in 2017 is 4.5%. This is a very worrying fact, which we have stressed in the report. The operations with the most errors were found were those relating to preventive programmes, grants, contribution agreements with international organisations and delegation agreements with member states' comparison agencies. The Commission should therefore improve contract management, selection procedures and the procurement management system. In this context, DG DEVCO should improve the monitoring and evaluation of key performance and performance indicators by gathering clear and comprehensive information. I would also like to point out that in 2017, under the European Development Funds, some EUR 860 million was disbursed through budget support operations. There must be quantifiable progress in the development of the countries benefiting from this instrument, and this method of aid must be clearly linked to concrete actions to combat corruption and fraud. The risk in these transactions is high: particular attention must also be paid to the presence of cases of tax evasion and avoidance and illegal financial flows, as we also pointed out in the TAXE report that was voted on today. I would now like to mention the Union's trust funds, to which the European Development Fund has so far contributed around EUR 3 billion out of the 4 in total. Although trust funds are flexible and useful instruments for dealing with critical situations, they need strict control, given their flexibility, both in the definition of the objectives to be achieved and in their implementation. I also believe that it is of the utmost importance to increase the traceability of relations with NGOs and international organisations. Cooperation is important, but I would remind you that the disbursement of funds must be subject to strict and timely control mechanisms. I would remind you, in this context, that the Court of Auditors recently published a special report aimed at analysing the traceability of Union funding, the implementation of which is left to NGOs. The special report points out that the Commission has not been sufficiently effective and that weaknesses have been identified both in the exercise of management procedures and in the collection of information on subcontracts. Once again, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the EIB.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 201, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Claudia SCHMIDT", "mepid": "125016", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent work and for the work she has done. The European Parliament spent EUR 1.9 billion in 2017, and the error rate was fortunately 0.5, the lowest possible level for other items of expenditure. But at least we are talking about an administrative budget, so the error rate of 0.5 is still too high, because 0 would of course be great. I have taken the trouble over the last few months and have looked at all areas of the European Parliament in person as far as possible. Colleagues were very accommodating, openly and honestly put their concerns and their things on the table, I could ask everything I wanted to know, and I felt that I had also received honest answers. Of course, not everything that shines is gold. It is, of course, the case that in the areas where most of my colleagues' complaints come from – that is, as always in such matters, the food and here also the driving service and the buildings, which I have looked at in more detail – there is certainly still a great deal of work to be done. However, when I speak now of the Chaffeur Service, the mere fact that we have integrated the drivers into Parliament is certainly a great step forward. As I said, I have looked at the areas. One of my hobby horses is the liaison offices. I think I'm standing relatively alone in the hallway, because somehow everyone likes it – except me. However, I believe that the fixed costs for buildings, salaries and travel costs are not in good proportion to what the liaison offices bring. I would like to see a much greater increase in the way people are approached in the liaison offices, the liaison offices and their staff. And I also expect much more communication via social media, because we are simply in the age of social media, and it is not enough to simply respond to campaigns, but to provide information in such a way that fake news does not find any breeding ground at all. Before I go into the major problem areas briefly, I would like to express my thanks to all my fellow Members. We can see from new compromise proposals that cooperation has been very good and very constructive, even if, of course, there was not always agreement. The big three problem areas, as almost every year, are the pension fund. We really need to come up with something here. It was created when MPs did not yet have national pension rights. Times have changed. We must now find solutions. The solution must certainly respect the rights of members who have paid in and must also protect the European taxpayer.  Headquarters in Strasbourg - single seat - the next of the big problems. There is no realise, especially among our French colleagues, that we are talking about the single seat. As always, this has been a huge problem. However, I would just like to point out the costs here: I do not like to talk about EUR 21 million a year, which costs the whole thing, and about THE CO2 savings, if you no longer have to go back and forth. The third is the general flat-rate cost. Flat rate is flat rate is flat rate. I believe that, even if we take the opposite view here, that is acceptable. And it cannot be the case that, just in order to make political money out of it, there should be an eternal debate here. All in all a good job, a very interesting work. I hope that we will relieve Parliament later.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 202, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Arndt KOHN", "mepid": "186884", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has said. The financial management of the other institutions and bodies was largely satisfactory in 2017. Only a few irregularities were found. In addition, however, we have also looked at certain aspects of administration and human resources management. As rapporteur, it was important to me to highlight working conditions in view of an increase in the number of jobs, to highlight the necessary steps towards equality for women and a determined approach to harassment in the workplace.  I welcome the fact that many of Parliament's recommendations from the last discharge have been included and that there have been positive developments in the management and human resources sectors. The European External Action Service, for example, has made progress in the administrative procedures in delegations, in particular in tendering procedures through targeted training, pooled expertise and the development of IT systems. In particular, I welcome cooperation with other national delegations abroad.  The Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee have exemplary administrative cooperation. Sharing buildings and translation services, for example, has led to significant savings. However, we have noticed a significant investment backlog, especially in IT systems. I encourage greater cooperation between the two institutions, but I reject the call for further cuts in their budgets in this context.  The European Ombudsman is doing an excellent job as a point of contact for citizens. Despite the increasing workload, it is still able to increase its effectiveness. However, I have the impression that the potential for potential savings has been reached and it is foreseeable that more resources will be needed in the medium term.  Following the recommendation of the Court of Auditors and Parliament, the European Court of Justice has made a significant effort to speed up the handling of its cases. The establishment of a new case management system is very welcome. However, with the recent reform of the Court, the doubling of the number of judges and the ever-increasing number of cases, the issue must continue to concern us in the future.  The European Court of Auditors is an indispensable partner for the discharge as a whole and provides valuable support through its reports and its participation in our events. I find communication with citizens via social media and the press remarkable.  The European Data Protection Supervisor is an ever-growing body which is gaining in importance, not least because of the rapid development of data protection legislation.  In addition to these positive developments, however, we have also had a number of problems this year: the Council continues to fail to recognise Parliament's discharge authority and has once again refused to testify before our committee. We are still working on a new agreement with the Council. However, an agreement has yet to be reached. That is why I recommend postponing discharge for this year in the hope of progress in the future.  In the Committee of the Regions, we have been dealing for years with a dispute between the committee and a former employee who was involved in uncovering irregularities in the CoR's expenditure. With my colleague from the ALDE Group, Mr Klinz, we have worked to ensure that there will be a conciliation procedure, which will also be supported by a large majority of the committee. We hope that this procedure will then also lead to a good result.  In the Economic and Social Committee, individual cases of stress and indications of their lack of preparation were brought to our attention. Investigations and judgments on the individual case must be made by competent authorities such as the Ombudsman, but we are calling for a review and improvement of procedures and rules. The Socialist Group stands for a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to harassment.  There has been a serious incident in the European Court of Auditors in which irregularities in travel expenses and the use of company cars have been detected. Here, too, rules need to be improved and the presence of members more clearly recorded. The Committee on Budgetary Control will monitor these developments and will monitor them positively.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 203, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Petri SARVAMAA", "mepid": "112611", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors, the Commission, the agencies network and Parliament’s staff, including the secretariat and our offices, for their valuable work during the 2017 discharge procedure. The decentralised agencies are highly visible in Member States and they have a direct impact on the daily lives of the Union’s citizens. We therefore welcome the overall positive results of the European Court of Auditors’ audit on Union agencies for this financial year.  The Court issued an unqualified audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts and on the legality and regularity of the revenue and the payments underlying the accounts for all the agencies in 2017, except for the payments of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). We regret that the Court issued an adverse opinion for EASO’s payments. The matters which led the Court to issue this adverse opinion were mainly related to non-compliance of payments on public procurement and recruitment procedures. However, we acknowledged EASO’s new management’s commitment to ambitious reforms. We called on the new management to continue its determined and transparent efforts to develop a more accountable, trustworthy and efficient governance structure and related procedures. Therefore, we proposed to grant discharge to all agencies, except for the European Asylum Support Office, for which we propose to postpone the discharge.  I would like to point out the following eight horizontal remarks. One, we strongly call on the agencies to further implement performance-based budgeting to develop and make use of more suitable indicators to evaluate actual impacts and outcomes, and to consistently seek the most effective ways to provide added value. Two, we call on the Commission, the network and the individual agencies to work together and provide constructive feedback throughout the negotiations for the post—2020 MFF, and to explore new sources of financing for the agencies.  Three, we invite the Court and the Commission to propose and define a consistent formula for the calculation of cancelled carryovers and clear guidelines on agencies’ budget reporting. Four, we also call on the Commission in the coming years automatically to provide the discharge authority with the official budget and staff figures regarding only the 32 decentralised agencies.  Five, we are concerned about the number of factors hindering the operational performance of certain agencies and about the shortcomings in the management of procurements. Six, furthermore, we regret that the new audit approach involving private sector auditors has resulted in a significant increase in the administrative burden on the agencies. Seven, the agencies should continue their valuable work regarding prevention and management of conflicts of interest, whistleblower protection, harassment policy and transparency in order to avoid shortcomings in these areas. Finally, we repeat our request of deciding on granting the discharge in the year immediately following the year for which the discharge is granted.  I look forward to the discussion, especially now that we have been given this daylight slot for budgetary control affairs.

I am very glad that together we managed to evaluate the financial year 2017, not only from a purely financial point of view, but also from the point of view of real results and impacts. I appreciate this cooperation, which began for me last year when I was shadow rapporteur for joint venture reports. I consider the evaluation of the economic performance and results of joint ventures to be very important, as in many cases they are already affecting our lives. Whether it is the simple expenditure side of the UNION budget or the interconnection and activation of private capital and the resulting employment or the development of science and research. The total budget of joint ventures for 2017 was EUR 2.1 billion, which is about 2% of the total EU budget for the year. Joint ventures employed almost 700 employees in 2017. Joint ventures aim to carry out research and innovation activities, increase the competitiveness of European industry and face major societal challenges. Joint ventures thus play a key role in connecting important strategic partners in the fields of industry and science, contributing to closer cooperation between actors in individual sectors and to the creation of long-standing networks of cooperation. It is the public-private links within these enterprises that are an effective way to develop European research and to finance it effectively. EU joint ventures show that if we effectively pool not only European money, but also private capital and citizens' knowledge and skills, the European Union can be a powerful global player in research and innovation. I also see as important the participation of small and medium-sized companies participating in the activities of joint ventures. I am glad that joint ventures are trying to support them and I hope that in the future they will participate in their activities on an even greater scale. I am very positive about the fact that Horizon 2020 also contains key performance indicators.  In this respect, joint ventures need to be congratulated, as most of them have met or even surpassed these key performance indicators set for the entire programming period in 2017. Furthermore, the effectiveness of joint ventures is underlined by the fact that the management cost ratio remains below 5 %, which points to their lean and efficient organisational structure. I also welcome the fact that, in the case of joint ventures, the vast majority of calls for proposals have been published and closed in accordance with the relevant work plans, and that the 'grant period' and the 'disbursement period' have remained well below the defined objectives. In the case of the ITER Joint Undertaking and fusion energy development, it should then be noted that the Joint Undertaking has reached seven of the nine milestones planned by the ITER Board for 2017 and I appreciate that 30 of the 32 ITER milestones have been reached at the overall level of the ITER project. Only in the case of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking has the Court delivered an opinion subject to the legality and regularity of payments. However, this is the result of projects taken from the legal predecessors of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, i.e. the Artemis and ENIAC joint ventures, and concerns the unfinished projects of the previous framework programme. Let me therefore once again thank all those involved for their cooperation and congratulate the joint ventures on the results presented. In accordance with the unanimous decision of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would also like to ask the Plenary of the European Parliament for the approval of the accounts of 2017 of all eight joint ventures.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 205, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "George Ciamba", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, it’s a pleasure for me to participate today in this debate on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2017, in the context of the annual discharge procedure, as foreseen in Article 319 of the Treaty. The Council attaches great importance to the discharge exercise. It is important that EU funds are used according to the rules and that expenditure respects the principles of sound financial management. On 20 February, my colleague Ms Luminița Odobescu, the Permanent Representative of Romania to the European Union, had the honour of presenting to the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) the Council’s recommendation to grant discharge to the Commission. This plenary will hold a vote today and, I believe, will confirm the vote of the Committee on Budgetary Control and grant discharge to the Commission. On the one hand, the Council welcomes the fact that, for the second time in a row, the Court gives a qualified opinion on the legality and regularity of payments. Additionally, the Council welcomes the gradual reduction of the overall estimated level of error, as reported by the Court over the last years. On the other hand, the Council regrets that the overall estimated level of error for 2017 payments – at 2.4 % – is still above the benchmark of 2 %. The Council, therefore, reiterates its wish to see further improvements in the financial management systems and in the estimated level of errors across all policy areas. The year 2017 was a special one, not only because it sits in the middle of the period covered by the Multiannual Financial Framework, but also because of the changes in the Control and Assurance Framework. This was particularly important in the area of cohesion, where the Court has introduced a new approach: for the first time, it checked assurance packages submitted by Member States for the current programming period. Having that in mind, a sustained improvement has been observed in the management of the EU budget over the past few years. The overall error rate for payments decreased in 2017 for the fourth year in a row. The Member States and the Commission have been able to improve their management and their control systems. This good work has to be kept up. There is, of course, room for improvement, especially in reimbursement—based payments, which still account for the highest proportion of errors. The rules are still very complicated, both for beneficiaries to follow and for authorities to check. A simpler, more transparent and more predictable regulatory framework is essential to ensure the effective and correct management of EU funds. In the same approach, the Council takes note of the Court’s recommendation concerning the simplification and streamlining of the strategic frameworks that govern the implementation of the EU budget. This is also about making sure that the budget delivers results connected to the objectives of the Union. European taxpayers must see that their money is not wasted and, furthermore, is spent on what matters to them and makes a difference. This is why the Council supports the Court’s recommendation to streamline indicators on the performance of the EU budget and to improve the alignment between high-level general objectives and specific programme and policy objectives, thereby reinforcing accountability for results and increasing clarity and transparency for all stakeholders. Increasing focus on performance measurement, however, should not prevent the Court from continuing its essential work on the annual reports and providing the estimated level of error for all spending areas both in the current and in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. This is particularly important in headings 3 (Security and Citizenship) and 4 (Global Europe), where expenditure is of increasing political significance. Going back to the way the budget and the finances of the EU are managed, the Council found some important elements of concern. There is a significant level of outstanding budgetary commitments and the budget is also exposed to contingent liabilities. The Council would like the Commission to improve the payment estimates and to follow the Court’s recommendation to provide more information about the situation of liabilities and about the use of financial instruments. This is an absolute must to ensure the transparency and predictability of EU funding. The European Parliament and the Council seem, in general, to share the same approach. We welcome the improvements that are there for all to see, and we want to see the good work of Member States’ authorities, of the Commission and of the Court, sustained and further improved. We have to send a clear signal to European citizens and taxpayers that EU funds are used in a responsible and accountable manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 206, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, rapporteur and honourable Member, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and gentlemen for their excellent work. First of all, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this constructive discharge procedure, led by Mrs Ayala Sender and her colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control. I find your draft report very worth reading, relevant and competent. I would also like to thank the European Court of Auditors, which is a constant constructive-critical adviser to us, whose advice is further forward for us, which we usually follow and which has also appreciated our work as fair. In the 2017 financial year, we have the last year, the discharge of which must be decided in this Parliament, in this period before the election. That is why, for the last five years, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control and Mrs Gräßle in her chairing, which has always been very, very committed here. Let me take a brief account of this period after five years. We have significantly improved our financial management in recent years – operationally the Commission, but strategically and with critical proposals from Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors to the same extent. We have put more emphasis on performance. We have examined how we can best meet common priorities and add value with our limited resources. Added value is also the motto for the next generation of our European budget programmes. We have done a lot to simplify the rules and make life easier for all final beneficiaries in the process of applying, implementing and accounting for projects by using simplified cost options. The adoption of the new Financial Regulation was a milestone, which was shaped by Mrs Gräßle in the deliberations. This is the basis for simplified programmes in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We have improved the management of the budget and its economic viability. The error rate has almost halved in the five years and is now 2.4%. We will do everything we can to develop this value further, thereby safeguarding the interests of our taxpayers. We have increased the protection of our budget and created an increasingly robust framework for prevention and correction. We have improved the management and control systems. We have also done a great deal to develop the administrations of the Member States in order to make their work the basis for our work. The fact that the Court of Auditors has not delivered a negative judgment in the last two years, but a limited one, is testament to this general improvement. We have also developed our reporting. With the integrated financial reporting package, which combines documents with important information on the performance of programmes and budgetary management and the protection of the budget, we provide you with a comprehensive overview of the discharge procedure. Your demands and the Court's recommendations are taken into account in the Commission's proposals for the next budgetary framework. Ensuring that taxpayers' money is used properly and that there is added value for citizens will continue to be our focus. The current negotiations for the next MFF are a decisive step in this direction. Specifically, on the 2017 financial year, your report, ladies and gentlemen, gives a clear picture of developments, of the mostly positive developments in the European Union's financial management. We want to make it even clearer to the citizen what added value a European budget can bring to each of us on a daily basis. The budget is small, in relative terms, but it is very effective because we create added value, achieve results that a Member State, on its own, could not achieve or could only achieve more expensively. A cross-border infrastructure network for rail, road, energy, digital infrastructure, jobs for young people, energy security, the internal market and the digital single market, research in the field of large-scale research, support for SMEs – all these are key words where added value can be achieved at European level, in the European team. Your report also identifies areas where improvements can be made. I would like to comment on a few here. The first key point is the use of European funds. At the beginning of the MFF in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the funds were very slow to be used. This has improved significantly over the past year. This year we have reached the full speed, i.e. a scheduled rhythm. We want to do everything we can to make this development in 2021 and 2022 through simplification and by adopting the budgetary framework earlier, or at least to reduce it considerably. Secondly, we want taxpayers' money to be used well, and for this the budgetary performance framework is relatively high. This is regularly confirmed by the OECD. We propose further steps with our proposals for the MFF. It must be our goal to use performance data and thus also to make the added value demonstrable. Thirdly, the error rate. We want to do everything we can to ensure that the error rate tends to go down. After the programme has been implemented and after all the checks, we have a remaining error rate of less than 2%. We have achieved this in 2017, and we want to continue to make this the basis for our budget implementation work. A fourth point: conflicts of interest. I should like to pay tribute to Parliament – in particular the Committee on Budgetary Control, for which it has supported, even brought about, the tightening up of the provisions on conflicts of interest. We are now taking steps to help Member States on how the conflict of interest provisions are to be applied in the new Financial Regulation, and we will monitor and monitor appropriately the adequacy of the audit activities at Member State level. To this end, we have scheduled a major conference with the authorities of the Member States on 10 April to discuss concrete measures to be taken in the event of conflicts of interest and to exchange views on best practice. Parliament is very cordially invited to make an active contribution. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is examining very closely and very closely the complaint that has been brought to its attention in relation to alleged conflicts of interest concerning the Czech Republic. I would like to point out here that it is important to distinguish between actions that may have taken place in the Member States before the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation on 2 August last year and subsequent acts since 2 August. However, we examine both periods, the period of the present – since 2 August – and the periods of the years before. We started conducting audits at the beginning of January with experts from different Directorates-General. These audits are ongoing. We want to determine whether payments to Agrofert companies have fully complied with the rules on conflicts of interest. It covers the period 2012 to 2018. With regard to the period after 2 August last year, we have asked the Czech Head of Government to give us written information on the specific measures he and his government are taking to rule out conflicts of interest from the outset and to take appropriate remedial action. We are currently analysing the response we have received, focusing on the measures the government intends to take to remedy situations that could be objectively perceived as a conflict of interest. In his reply, the Head of Government has informed us in writing that he is withdrawing from the ESI Fund Council and is not involved in decision-making or communication through funds. On the basis of this analysis, the Commission will draw its conclusions as soon as possible. I would remind you that, as a precautionary measure, the Commission is not currently making payments from the European Structural and Investment Funds for projects to Agrofert or related beneficiaries in the Czech Republic until the situation is fully resolved. The Czech authorities are informed and required to carefully assess the eligibility of expenditure. This is a proactive measure to protect the European budget. It is important to be consistent, but also objective, and not to prejudice either in the context of the analysis of the answer from the Czech authorities or in relation to the question of whether expenditure incurred should be corrected. As with all Commission audits, we must take into account the right of the audited bodies to an adversarial procedure for the provisional findings. If it is found that the current rules have not been complied with, we will take appropriate measures to protect the budget, including corrective measures for the past, where this is intended and possible. We will inform the House, Parliament, in a timely manner. As announced at the plenary session last December, I will appear before the Committee on Budgetary Control in April, and I am ready to do so after the election and i offer to give you further reports on all our audits and the relevant conclusions and measures taken in July, September, October. To the next question, I would like to draw attention to the discussion we held with all the institutions in September on the issue of high-level appointments last year, which is also the subject of this report. Representatives of the EU institutions were able to explain how they conduct their procedures and were able to compare how this happens – best practice. All institutions, I believe, aim to recruit, appoint and promote competent staff on the basis of competence, performance, qualifications and experience. The appointment of the Secretary-General of the Commission is a point of particular interest to you in this report. Since the appointment, Parliament has made several statements, many questions have been asked, including by the Ombudsman. As the Commission, we have cooperated fully here, endeavouring to answer all questions in detail and comprehensively and correctly and to provide access to all the files. My position and our position remains that the appointment has been made in accordance with the Statute, the case law and all the rules in force. The Secretary-General shall carry out his duties in accordance with our rules and will continue to do so. The President and all the Commissioners have full confidence in him. The Secretary-General has all the qualifications and experience necessary for this task. We have no intention of revising our decision. Nor is this possible, as was recognised here in the House in April last year. An appointment cannot be revoked. I can understand some of your questions. The principles of transparency, fairness and equal opportunities are also important to me. It is in this spirit that, in a few days' time, I will propose to my colleagues that a number of vacancies at the highest and highest management levels be advertised. I am sure that the Commission's current procedures, based on the Statute and the applicable law, provide a robust framework that is necessary for compliance with our principles in the selection and appointment of senior and senior managers. A final sentence on the IMG case, which was briefly addressed by Mrs Ayala Sender. The Commission has in the past cooperated with the IMG to implement development policy projects. As you know from the discussions in the Committee on Budgetary Control in recent years, the Commission has challenged the status of imG as an international organisation. In recent case-law, the arbitral tribunal and the ECJ did not follow the Commission's position. That is why the Commission will, of course, comply with these decisions properly. We will carry out the outstanding payments to IMG and examine the possibility of possible further future cooperation with IMG in a legal and objective manner. Ladies and gentlemen! All of you have played a successful and concrete role in the implementation of the budget you have adopted during the period that is coming to an end – in terms of performance, compliance or even in the fight against fraud. The draft report that has been presented to us today has specific demands. We, as the Commission, take this very seriously. I will report fully to the Committee on Budgetary Control on the Commission's follow-up to this in the autumn. Their work has been intense and bears fruit. Thank you very much for this and for the constructive cooperation! As this is the last opportunity to discuss discharges, I would like to thank you all for what I consider to be very fair and collegial cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 207, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Klaus-Heiner LEHNE", "mepid": "2224", "text": "   President of the European Court of Auditors. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Oettinger, representative of the Presidency of the Council, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has done. As this is the last opportunity for the Court of Auditors to speak here in plenary before the end of the parliamentary term, I would like to thank today all the Partners of the Court present – the Committee on Budgetary Control, its chairman Ingeborg Gräßle, its rapporteurs, Commissioner Oettinger and its services, the Presidency of the Council and his working group – for the excellent cooperation during the entire parliamentary term and also during this year's discharge procedure. Your control activities may not always be as visible as your legislative activity, which is sometimes at the centre of the general interest. I am sure, however, that it is equally important for many of our citizens that EU law is applied correctly and that taxpayers' money is well spent. The discharge decisions that Parliament will adopt immediately after this debate are never a 'blank cheque' – rather, they are part of a long-term cooperation process. It is clear from the Treaties that the Commission is legally obliged to take all appropriate measures to comply with Parliament's comments in the discharge decision and also with the Council's explanations. I think you are now well acquainted with the findings in our annual report and our special reports for 2017. As in 2016, we gave a limited – and not a failed – opinion on EU spending, which, in our view, means that 'the glass is half full' and is to be understood as a confirmation of a positive development in the way the Commission and the Member States manage European finances. I would therefore just like to go into four points today. Firstly, as far as our performance audits are concerned, I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for having received the recommendations in our special reports in a largely positive way. This is the way to help improve the policies and programmes of the European Union. I would also like to stress that we – the members of the Court and our staff – are available to you and your committees once our reports have been published. Contact us for further explanations or additional information. We are here to support you in your work as parliamentarians. Secondly, with regard to the outstanding commitments – the so-called RALs, the reste liquid ones – we note that Parliament shares our concern: when I was with you last October, I promised you that i would have this issue examined in detail. I am therefore pleased that we have now completed our analysis in this regard, which highlights the underlying causes of the record level of EUR 267 billion in outstanding commitments in 2017. Our Court member, Mrs Turtelboom, will present this analysis to the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control at a joint meeting on 2 April. Thirdly, with regard to your request to the Commission to use a methodology for calculating error rates comparable to that of the Court, and to the requirement that both institutions reach an agreement on this matter: let me repeat that we are in complete agreement on this point. Without prejudice to our independence, we are in close contact with the various Commission services to see to what extent and by when this could happen. Mr Oettinger may wish to comment on this later, but let me now thank him and his team for their first positive contacts on this issue. We look forward to the progress that we will gradually make in the coming weeks and months. This is also in our massive interest. I would also like to take this opportunity to address a number of points raised by the Council in its recommendation. Of course, our aim is also to provide the highest possible level of information and detail, especially where it matters most, and to do so at a reasonable cost. As things stand today, we already need almost half of our resources for our annual report – that is a high percentage. And in passing, we note that the closer we get to the materiality limit, the greater the effort automatically becomes in order to be able to provide useful results in the calculation of the error rate. In recent years, we have Risk analysis improves and tends to focus our efforts on the areas that are most at risk. At the same time, we want to create the conditions for us to be able to confirm the detailed information already provided by other auditors. We are currently working to ensure that this information is of reasonable quality. One example is our approach to cohesion, which was changed in 2017. What was very new was that we reviewed and tracked audits and inspections previously carried out by the expenditure authorities, and then took these results into account in our assessment. With this new approach, we want to provide you in Parliament with more comprehensive information on how EU funds are managed and make the management responsible for its reporting more accountable. It is also our aim to provide you with better geographical and fund-specific insights for the whole of the European Union. We intend to apply this approach in all those areas of the EU budget where this can be implemented cost-effectively and where the results are reliable. Fourthly and finally, a comment on cooperation with the European Central Bank, which is also mentioned in your resolution: as far as access to ECB documents, which we need in order to carry out our audit tasks, has recently improved atmospheric conditions. The ECB now seems seriously willing to enter into an interinstitutional dialogue with us on the draft memorandum of understanding that we sent to the ECB more than a year ago. I think that this development is partly due to the support we have received from your House on this matter. We intend to start the talks quickly now and, if possible, to complete the process by the summer recess. However, I appeal to you to continue to monitor this matter and, if necessary, to legislate in the next parliamentary term if the dialogue with the ECB does not produce a satisfactory result in a reasonable time, and also to address the fundamental problem of restricting our mandate in the area of banking supervision. Ladies and gentlemen, let me come to a final point: since the campaign for the European elections will start in at least 27 Member States in just a few weeks – and perhaps the most important election of its kind to date – I would like to encourage all Members of the European Parliament to review our independent audit work, which we are offering as an objectively factual reference. to dispose of freely. We are looking ahead in our many opinions, which we summarised in February this year in the form of a summary of comments, in which we set out our thoughts on the future MFF and the related programmes. However, the Court also looks back at its annual report and a large number of special reports highlighting many criticisms, but also many success stories and good practices. As auditors, we are not primarily concerned with objecting or measuring. Rather, we want to make a constructive contribution to improving things where we consider it necessary and sensible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 208, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Neena GILL", "mepid": "4533", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, it’s good to see our former colleague, Mr Lehne, here.

Otherwise we’re in danger of getting the reputation of having a magic money tree, and this will impact our credibility unless the focus is increased.

Will the Commission engage in a substantive and thorough review of working with partners and host countries, pushing for a performance-based approach?

As regards the opinion in the budget itself, we draw attention to two very important elements, and I will immediately add a positive one, firstly, to the implementation of erasmus+: not only the tendency to increase it, but also the correct way of implementing it. This is so important that we are about to celebrate the 30th anniversary of this programme and at the same time the more than nine million students who have already benefited from this programme.

In principle, we recommend that all those agencies be discharged by Parliament.

We see a need for action on the part of the Commission here. Some agencies, notably eu-LISA, the Fundamental Rights Agency FRA, CEPOL and also EASO, are unfortunately notaffected by shortcomings in the award of contracts. At the database agency eu-LISA, we complain that 90 percent of the work is done by three external service providers. This leads to dependency and can even become a security risk.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Inés Ayal Sender, not only for her exemplary cooperation, but above all for continuing the process of changing the perception of discharge as an effective part of the life cycle of the treatment of European Union citizens' funds, which I started in 2015. Although mistakes or omissions need to be found, rectified and mechanisms adopted to prevent them, it is also very important to stress that in the case of errors, we are talking about less than 3% of the Union's financial expenditure. We should therefore not forget that more than 97% of the expenditure that has served its purpose has been used properly and in a timely manner and for the benefit not only of individual citizens and businesses, but also of our common objectives. It is from these achievements that we must take an example for the future and present them to the citizens of the Union as a success of the European project. Even as rapporteur for the 2014 main discharge report of the European Commission, I have sought to see discharge as a meaningful part of the life cycle of dealing with the resources of european union citizens. I am therefore glad that the focus on performance and error prevention is an increasing part of the report.

That is why we, as the Greens, are pleased that the present draft reports address a number of thorny issues. Firstly, to the highly questionable appointment of Mr Selmayr as Secretary-General of the Commission. The European Parliament spoke of a real coup and the European Ombudsman also ruled in September that this very bizarre appointment had stretched the limits of the law. All this deserves further follow-up. Therefore, a plea to approve the existing paragraphs and the additional amendments. We must also very explicitly condemn that Selmayr was present at two meetings of the European Commission, where the answers to our questions were prepared. He was both judge and party and that is unacceptable. Those who swipe on their own doorstep must also talk about the conflict of interest of the Czech Prime Minister Babiš and the Agrofert consortium, which received millions of European subsidies. Mr. Oettinger, I have three explicit questions to ask you. I hope you're listening. One, what is the state of play in the investigation and the audits of various Directorates-General on this matter in the Czech Republic? Two, when will there be a final report? Three, will there be a statement from the European Commission before the elections in May 2019?  Finally, sweeping on its own doorstep also means a serious reform of the general expenses allowance in Parliament. We must force the Bureau to implement the recommendations of the plenary, which, in accordance with the following principles: a separate bank account, unused money, must be returned to Parliament, all supporting documents must be kept, spot checks are needed and each member publishes an annual summary of the expenditure incurred.

No decent work clothes, intimidation, too short lunch breaks, ban on speaking to each other, mandatory standing if there are visitors. It goes on and on.

No bad thing in principle, as it is one of the few ways to hold these shadowy, behind-the-scenes agencies to account, but the procedure, I would argue, lacks some actual clout. One of the biggest talking points has been the European Asylum Office, which has a budget of EUR 86 million. The Court of Auditors gave an adverse opinion on the legality of its payments. It has had a bad recent history, with high-ranking officios being removed and replaced, due to alleged harassment, misappropriation of funds and breaches of data protection, to name but a few. If we look at the European Parliament budget for 2020, it will be increased to over EUR 2 billion. On top of that, in the Committee on Budgets (BUDG) last night, you approved over EUR 3 million for 51 contractual agents to boost media relations and digital communications activity in the Member States in order to build a so-called pan-European community ahead of the European elections. This sort of state—sponsored propaganda machine is exactly what I oppose and will continue to oppose to protect taxpayers’ money. If Theresa May survives in the short term and continues the Brexit betrayal, she says she will meet all financial obligations to the EU, despite there being no legal obligation. So, under the Tories, if the withdrawal agreement deal goes through, the British taxpayers are on the hook for GBP 39 billion.

These are institutions whose functioning has a substantial impact on the everyday lives of European citizens and on their perception of the effectiveness of law-making within the Union.  These 32 agencies had a combined budget of EUR 2.24 billion in payment appropriations. Bearing in mind the magnitude of their activities, for us it is important that ECA issued clear opinions on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the agencies’ accounts, except for one of them. Despite some weaknesses related to staffing, public procurement procedures and a lack of harmonisation of information technology, we should underline that the agencies demonstrated increased cooperation that helped to enhance their visibility. Furthermore, they were able to demonstrate improvements in efficiency as well as to generate added value. Concerning the European Parliament, we also have positive attitudes. The use of the financial resources in the fulfilment of objectives for 2017 shows encouraging results: 99 % of the budget was committed, and only 1 % had to be cancelled. This proves good management of financial resources. At the same time, the objectives pursued, and outcomes achieved, during the year stem mainly from the priorities set by Parliament’s competent bodies preparing the budget.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which it has been First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the interesting debate and the many suggestions. In the light of the time, however, I shall confine myself to just two aspects.  One concerns conflicts of interest and ethical issues. I wanted to inform Mrs Macovei that the intention – and we are currently in the middle of work, and the chamber responsible is dealing with this issue – is to finalise and present a report on the situation of ethical rules in the institutions and bodies before the summer recess. We ourselves are also subject to a peer review, which will be completed well before the summer break in the foreseeable future.  The second aspect I would like to mention is the desire, which has been expressed time and again, for even more error rates on even more sectors of the budget. Let me make this very clear: this will not be possible. That makes no sense either. What is the error rate? The error rate is a statistical-mathematical method that by calculating a certain probability for a certain error rate by testing a thousand transactions across the entire European budget – about a thousand transactions – and making a probability calculation based on the error results we see, where we said last year, in 2017, the probable error rate, the estimated error rate is 2.4 percent with a 95% probability and a tolerance rate of plus one percent and minus one percent. In plain language, this means that it is somewhere between 1.4 and 3.4 percent. And if we now break this down to smaller areas and, of course, work with a much smaller amount of data on smaller areas, then the accuracy of this error rate will be lower and lower. In other words, if, for example, we find an error rate of 0.9 or 0.5 in the administrative area, that is a pure estimate, and the probable error rate may be higher than that, but it may also be lower.  And in this statistical area, it simply no longer makes sense to want to make more precise statements, because the effort that has to be put into it is no longer disproportionate to what is at stake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to comment briefly on three politically important issues or speeches.  On the one hand, we have had a comprehensive view of the documents, figures, data and processes, together with teams of experts from various Directorates-General – DG REGIO, DG AGRI and DG Employment – and other experts on site in Prague since the beginning of January. Now we are in the comprehensive evaluation with our experts. I have asked my colleagues and also the Directors-General to do so as intensively as necessary and as soon as possible. I cannot give a time limit, thoroughness takes precedence over speed. But you can be sure we are on the road intensively. In a few weeks' time, as agreed with your committee secretariat, i intend to give the Committee on Budgetary Control a comprehensive interim report on the audits, initial evaluation results and possible consequences here in Strasbourg on Monday, 15 April. I am then prepared to answer all the questions in a comprehensive way, even without the time pressure that exists today.  Secondly, tendering a post as Director-General or senior manager versus transfer. Once again, we are convinced that both ways of using instruments to decide on a post are equivalent in our legal frameworks. However, I would like to add: what are the reasons for a transfer? There are two reasons that may be quite interesting. Firstly, transfers take place in greater numbers at the beginning of a term of office, but only at the beginning. A new Commission has new Directorates-General, re-divides Directors-General and therefore comes to the conclusion that the stock of competent senior managers should be restructured if necessary. This only makes sense through transfer.  And secondly, we are not practicing mobility as a rigid rule, but as an important part of our human resources management – after five or six years of moving from one office to another. Again, this can only be done through transfer. I would remind you that there have been many complaints from this House when directors-general or comparable positions were occupied six, seven, eight, nine years with the same woman, with the same man. We were asked, why don't you regroup? That would only be a transfer. We are complying with this, but it is clear – and I will also set this out and prove this in the next few days – that the call for tenders, and therefore competition, is certainly the obvious procedure.  Thirdly again, the question of whether and why the Secretary-General was present in this circle of staff in answering the many questions from this House where these questions were to be answered. I quote literally my statement in March in the Committee on Budgetary Control – and I quote them, since many questions needed input from a subject to answer and we wanted to answer as comprehensively as possible. , he took part in parts of the deliberations in the processing. He did this not to influence the wording, but to complete the content. One of your house's questions was: when did Mr Selmayr know? If a question had been from you, in expiration 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, January, February? When did he know? Then it was clear that this question and other questions could only be answered with him or even only by him. If we had replied, we are sorry, we do not know, we have a Secretary-General who is sitting in the same building, one floor higher than us, but we cannot give an answer – I would have liked to hear your reply. That's why we brought it in. He was present so far and since he – and only he – was able to give a concrete answer to many questions for your House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 239, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "George Ciamba", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank honourable Members so much for this useful exchange of views.

I do not think I have understood the chairwoman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who I think questioned the well-founded reasoning of the judgment on IMG. You know very well, Mrs Grule, that IMG was founded only by the ambassadors, in Geneva, at a time when the Balkan war required experts to enter after the bombings to establish bridges, power cords, etc. In other words, there were only a few ambassadors to Geneva at that foundation, precisely to support the problems of a conflict as serious as the Balkan war. However, I wonder whether the fact that IMG's problems began in 2012 also has nothing to do with giz's coming to mind — a direct beneficiary of what happened to IMG, that is, the contracts that were rejected to IMG — from Mrs Tanja Gonner, to which you know very well.  The truth is that your articles in Der Spiegel, Mrs Grule, and the amendments you agreed to in the discharge procedure say very little of our ability to help citizens in the European Union. And as for the conflict of interest, Mr. Oettinger, I am very sorry; you know that I greatly appreciate you and that I consider you a good professional, but our Staff Regulations, which is a Regulation adopted in codecision, clearly state in Article 11a: 'An official shall not, in the performance of his duties and save as hereafter provided, deal with a matter in which, directly or indirectly, he has any personal interest such as to impair his independence , and in particular family and financial interests.' — this is only the first part of a much larger article; so when the Commission, in its official approach, says that Mr Selmayr was...

Existing dual procedural rates would be suppressed despite considerable efforts to approximate (e.B administrative, legal or decision-making procedures) and reduce red tape. At the same time, the EDF contains important elements of flexibility. For example, the EDF has substantial reserves that can be mobilised if necessary, including the financing of humanitarian action in the event of crises, and it also has a multiannual framework for application. In addition, through the African Peace Facility, the EDF also finances operations that are outside the limits of the Treaties, including operations for military or defence purposes. The EDF is still seen as a fundamental instrument of development cooperation, as it plays a symbolic role in the privileged ACP-EU relations established since the first Lomé Convention.

Thank you for your ambition. Thank you for your different points of view and your ideas, which many times allowed me to formulate and push for a strong position. The last months were tough. We negotiated hard, but we are here today because we do understand that the transition to a carbon—neutral economy can help address climate change, improve our health and environment, and can bring a new impulse to our countries’ industrial competitiveness.  The legislation aimed at reducing CO2 emissions for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles is part of this whole transition. It’s part of a bigger picture, one that requires a shift from traditional economic models to ones rooted in sustainability, where new technologies can flourish, where innovation takes centre stage and where further investments are channelled into research and development.  The final CO2 reduction targets agreed upon during the trilogue negotiations for 2025 and 2030 are a step in this direction, but they are just the beginning of a transitory path towards the economy of the future. After a number of meetings with the Council and the Commission, we managed to agree that new cars will need to emit 37.5% less CO2 and new vans will need to emit 31% less CO2 from 2030 onwards. Between 2025 and 2029 both cars and vans will be required to emit 15% less CO2. Electric cars, plug-in hybrids, hydrogen, fuel cell technology and efficient combustion engines will all play a role. I am glad that we managed to achieve this. The road was not always easy and we had to overcome some tough lobbying and initial opposition, even from some Member States. But anyway, what’s easy? At the end of the day we managed to successfully close a number of loopholes that would otherwise have weakened the legislation. We made sure that during the transition to the new test cycle manufacturers will not be allowed to inflate the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) value. For the very first time, there is an obligation on the Commission to monitor and report fuel consumption meter data to ensure emission reductions are delivered on the road and not only in the laboratory. Acknowledging the importance of new infrastructure, the legislation is echoing Parliament’s position, pushing for more investment to develop recharging infrastructure all over Europe and in favour of mobilising and incentivising significant public and private investment. Understanding the concerns of trade unions, the legislation allows for the allocation of excess emission premiums to a fund that would help the reskilling and upskilling of workers. This fund is aimed to achieve a climate—neutral economy without negative social implications and, in particular, to support workers in the European car manufacturing industry, a key priority for myself and my political group, the S&amp;D. The new law means fuel savings for consumers and will make it affordable to buy zero- and low-emission vehicles in the years to come. I have always said that I believe in policymaking that pushes change. Policies need to move the shift towards cleaner transport and we, as policymakers, need to encourage and stimulate this move, as I believe we’ll be doing in this legislation. This is our opportunity to inject new life into the EU’s manufacturing sector, create new skilled jobs and boost economic growth in Industry 4.0. Once again allow me to thank Commissioner Arias Cañete for his participation and positive help in this legislation. Thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and thanks to everyone for their input.

The agreement reached by Parliament and the Council is an important achievement and – together with the legislation on heavy-duty vehicles – marks the completion of a comprehensive legislative framework on climate and clean energy for 2030.  This has been possible thanks to the excellent work and constructive efforts of the negotiators from both institutions. In particular, I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur Ms Dalli for her leadership on this challenging file. It required a lot of work and dedication from her side to bring together the different views and to lead successfully the negotiations. I would like also to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their crucial role in these negotiations.  This agreement is both ambitious and balanced. It is a major step forward in regulating CO2 emissions from cars and vans. Its main elements for new cars: the European Union fleet-wide average CO2 emissions will have to be 37.5% lower in 2030, compared to 2021, and 31% for new vans. Intermediate reduction targets of 15% for 2025 for both cars and vans will ensure that investments are already kick-started now. An innovative and technology-neutral incentive system will stimulate manufacturers to deploy more zero- and low-emission vehicles in the next decade, and a strong governance system will make sure that emission reductions occur in reality, not only in the laboratory. A comprehensive review in 2023 will evaluate the effectiveness of the legislation. This new legislation puts the road transport sector on a clear pathway towards clean mobility, and the broader transition to a climate-neutral economy. Let me highlight its main benefits. The targets agreed, together with the targets agreed for heavy-duty vehicles, will lead to a 24% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in 2030 compared to 2005. This will help Member States to reach their binding targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation and for the European Union to deliver its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Citizens will benefit from cleaner air as the result of the new legislation, and consumers will also benefit economically as they are projected to save around EUR 1 100 over the lifetime of an average new car bought in 2030, and nearly EUR 4 000 for an average van. The legislation will also help to modernise the European Union economy, and the automotive sector in particular, to channel investments and strengthen innovation for clean vehicle technologies. The incentive system for zero- and low-emission vehicles will reward the front-runners in developing such vehicles. As a result of this legislation, around 35 million zero- and low-emission vehicles are projected to be driving on the road, compared to a bit more than one million today.  The new regulation is also projected to have positive impacts on the overall economy, creating around 60 000 jobs and more, around 80 000, if batteries are produced in the European Union. In this context, the Battery Alliance was launched to create a sustainable and competitive battery value chain in Europe. This is a market with huge opportunities for economic growth and job creation.  At the same time, the legislation allows for a smooth, gradual and realistic transition to zero-emission vehicles. In 2030, a very large majority of new vehicles – around 87% – will still have an internal combustion engine, as plug-in hybrid vehicles will play an important role. This will give sufficient time to undertake the necessary investments to re—skill and up—skill the workers in the conventional vehicles supply chain.  A clear signal is also provided for investors in refuelling and recharging infrastructure. In particular, by 2030, around 4.5 million public charging points will have to be operational. This represents a substantial increase, requiring significant investments, including at local, regional, national and European Union levels.  Let me conclude by inviting you to support this ambitious and balanced agreement when voted tomorrow. I would also take the opportunity to inform the Members of this House that the Commission has tabled a statement concerning the review provisions of the regulation to accompany its full support for the overall agreement. This will put Europe on track towards the necessary transition towards clean mobility, and I thank all of you for your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 262, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Karima DELLI", "mepid": "96868", "text": "  Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

Amateurs, because we hear young people who walk to defend the climate, who expect us to act with responsibility to protect future generations.

Tomorrow, we will vote on a significant tightening of CO2 limits for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. CO2 emissions for passenger cars are to be reduced by 15% by 2025 and by 37.5% by 2030. Some in this House still consider these objectives to be too low, while others consider them excessive. Climate protection is important, no question. However, I would also like to say to you that achieving these limits is not a breeze – on the contrary. With the outcome of the negotiations, we have once again gone well beyond the Commission's original proposal. However, we must not forget what limits were actually juggled at the beginning of the debate in the European Parliament. The Social Democrats demanded a 50% reduction, the Greens wanted a reduction of up to 75% – downright absurd, unrealistic, and tens of thousands of jobs would have been destroyed as a result. At what price? It is precisely the one-sided focus on electromobility that would have shifted emissions from the exhaust to the power plants. We now have a compromise before us. We have achieved a great deal. The interim target of 15% by 2025 is realistic, the 2023 review of how far we really are is important, and the separate target for light commercial vehicles, at 31%, is also in order. However, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have also been committed to improving the use of innovative technologies, such as synthetic fuels.

This is good! The turnaround in transport will happen, and it is also right that we, as Europeans, help shape it and that we set the framework for it.  However, it is also precisely as Social Democrats that we also have a responsibility towards working people, and that is why it is right that this regulation – contrary to what my colleague Jens Gieseke has just said – should be open to technology. It is also true that we have ruled out the imputation of synthetic fuels in the automotive sector, because we know that, with the available areas, we must make better use of these fuels, for example in air transport, for example in the case of lorries, where we can count it.

We already have a Flemish climate and energy plan awaiting implementation, and in the European Parliament we have already worked on a real climate and energy package in the last parliamentary term, on the way to 2030. Today we are once again giving the green light to a very concrete measure. New vehicles should emit 37.5% less CO2 by 2030. The NVA, my party, fully supports this. In Belgium, transport accounts for a quarter of CO2 emissions. We desperately need the innovative technology to reduce CO2 at source to meet our climate goals.  We also support the demand for a technology-neutral greening of the new fleet. This is a very important link in attracting investment, encouraging innovation and improving air quality in our villages and our cities. Our citizens have a right to clean air. If Europe is in the competition with China, we must encourage our producers to continue to innovate and to offer and market sufficient low-emission and zero-emission vehicles.

So, thank you once more. Some facts about the background. We did some counting. In Finland, an electrical car would produce emissions by kilometres of 48 g/km. Why? Because the mix in the grid makes the difference. In Germany, an electrical car would actually produce emissions of about 131 g/km and that was actually the reason why we had a hard fight. In the middle of the night, we waited for a call from Berlin. So, the real problem is actually what kind of mix we have in the grid and if we don’t make a really great effort to change the mix in the grid in the future, we will fail. That’s a fact. I can tell you, my 7—year—old diesel, with renewable second-generation advanced biofuel, produces less CO2 emissions per kilometre than an electrical car in Germany. So, my dear German friends, I think you have to take your efforts and your technological knowledge and do something real to change the grid.

Unfortunately, Germany itself was even split. The Environment Ministry wanted to have higher ambitions, but the Industry and Transport Ministry did not. So it was a very difficult file. It’s great that we are finally getting these policies ahead. I just want to mention to the Commission that yes, you put the proposal forward, but it doesn’t happen that often that both the Council and Parliament made it more ambitious. I hope that this is a lesson for the Commission when putting forward proposals. In the old days, the Commission tried to be in the middle; now, a bit too often on climate proposals, both sides improve it. So there is room for improvement also for the Commission for future proposals.  Just on the targets that are now on the table, these are very desperately needed in order to get innovation in the automotive sector within Europe and what you can see already is the impact of these regulations.

And how will manufacturers meet our approved targets? Member States have simply washed their hands of the solution, leaving all the burden solely to European products. The infrastructure for clean vehicles is still lacking, and we are in a vicious circle where the market for these cars needs to be started, but no one is willing to buy them yet because of the lack of infrastructure, and no one is willing to build them until these cars are extended more.

I am very grateful to the Commission for having carried out an additional impact assessment to assess the proposals that were on the table. The result was clear: proposals for 75%, or Miriam Dalli's original proposal for 50%, would have cost jobs in Europe. But this analysis by the Commission – and I have not met anyone who has been able to refute it, other allegations are not proven in my view – also shows that it is wrong to say that every percentage that goes beyond 30 is a disaster. On the contrary, the Commission shows that, if we are around 40% – and we are now even close to it with a safety margin – there are still positive effects on jobs in Europe as a whole. And that is why it would not have been wise not to use this room for manoeuvre, especially when many people expect more climate protection from the European Union, especially many young people.

The agreed CO2 emission standard for cars and vans will drive new jobs in Europe. Increased consumer expenditure, increased investment in infrastructure, reduction of oil imports and expansion in the battery sector are all positive drivers for job creation.

But allow me to address a couple of issues that were mentioned. First and foremost, let’s stop the scaremongering which says that more investment by companies equates to more expensive cars. With all due respect, all the studies that we were shown – even the impact assessment by the Commission itself – confirmed the financial benefits for consumers, as mentioned just now by the Commissioner himself when he was speaking about a decrease in consumer expenditure. Consumer benefits are the most evident thing in this legislation.  I would have expected some of the Members speaking tonight to know the details of what we are going to vote upon tomorrow. So for example we had Mr Meuthen, who has not even realised that we are speaking about zero and low-emission vehicles defined as vehicles that would emit 50g per km. And we had Mr Kölmel from the ECR, who has not even realised that this is part of a whole package of legislation which addresses different sectors and that this Parliament doesn’t focus on mobility or passenger vehicles alone. The reality is that change is happening, investments are being channelled into new technologies and research is being carried out to ensure that the EU, for example, can produce batteries and battery cells within its boundaries.  I am really glad that Members who originally proposed less ambition today are speaking about this compromise positively, because I am convinced that it was the initial ambition of this Parliament that changed things. And things will continue to change. Just look around at the models that are currently being rolled out and also the increased kilometrage that zero and low-emission vehicles have today. Things have changed from a couple of months ago to today.  My concluding remark would be, let’s continue working to make sure that we attract investments to this continent, to the European Union, that we roll out the required infrastructure and charging stations and develop the necessary technology to produce battery cells and batteries here within the European Union. I look forward to the vote tomorrow. Thank you to all the colleagues for their contributions. Once again, thank you, Commissioner and to all the staff for their help.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting on the new Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument. This is a very important procedure, as it will determine how EU assistance to third countries is given in the period 2021-2027. This is worth almost EUR 90 billion. The text is the result of lengthy negotiation and compromise work between all the political groups; we have achieved a position that I consider to be balanced on the merger of the various current financial instruments, so as to ensure greater direction and control by the European Parliament. That is the first point I think we need to emphasise, and that is governance.  The Commission's proposal only provides for implementing acts and comitology for the adoption of programming documents, which means that Parliament can only challenge such acts on legal grounds, that is, if the Commission has exceeded its implementing powers and not for the political decisions that motivated them. This is clearly insufficient and we are therefore inserting delegated acts, a more meaningful and regular strategic dialogue that pre-esses programming decisions. Therefore, in this way, all important strategic choices would be subject to parliament's review and the possibility of raising objections. A second element is the Neighbourhood Policy, which is one of the priority areas and a key element of the European Union's external action. Including the Neighbourhood Policy in the Single Instrument ensures greater flexibility for the easy and rapid mobilisation of additional funding and to support special relations with our neighbours. In addition, the planned allocation of EUR 22 billion represents a 24% increase in this sector compared to the current multiannual financial framework. As far as sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, let us strengthen its budget and provide for a programme for the ACP countries, so that they can address the possible needs arising from a future post-Cotonou agreement. In the objectives of the regulation, we have included a reference to poverty eradication and, as far as official development aid is concerned, we have increased the percentage of these criteria in the projects financed from 92% to 95%. With regard to migration, we stress the need for a holistic and long-term approach and address the root causes of regular, irregular migration and forced displacement, including a reference to climate refugees. We are therefore talking about the need to adopt human rights-based policies to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration. Furthermore, we consider the importance of addressing the issue of climate change, including with regard to the agreements made, including the Paris agreement, and in the settlement targets the percentage of expenditure allocated to climate issues has increased to 45%, an ambitious target compared to that proposed by the Commission. The priority is what we are doing with regard to human rights. We have introduced a clause suspending assistance to a particular country in the event of persistent non-compliance with these principles. Finally, with regard to the part of the instrument that deals with peace and stability, we make it clear that the funds in this area must be used to create conditions for ensuring sustainable development and cannot, these funds, be used for the purchase of weapons and ammunition or for operations with military or defence implications. This is an important work that has lasted many months and for this reason I obviously thank all my three co-rapporteurs together with myself for their work and I hope that this proposal will be fully approved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 302, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, those who have followed our discussions in Parliament closely on the Commission's proposal on this issue will not be surprised to learn that I was, among the four co-staffers, the one who was, from the beginning, the most sceptical about the idea of a single instrument. I would like to go back briefly to the reasons for this skepticism. Our Parliament had expressed a very clear position a little over a year ago, calling for dedicated instruments for pre-accession, development, neighbourhood and humanitarian aid, because of the financial and political specificities of these Union intervention areas.  The European Commission, with the exception of the pre-accession instrument, has taken this position into account and has presented the proposal being discussed today, which brings together a dozen instruments and programmes that currently exist. Furthermore, in January 2018, the European People's Party voted against the idea of a single instrument for external action in unambiguous terms, stressing that \"it would only be the illusion of simplification that would lead to permanent internal quarrels over which area would be the most important\". The EPP also pointed out that our European Neighbourhood Policy, which has a direct impact on the lives of European citizens, would be undermined, or even scrambled, without a specific financial instrument to support it. Despite these reluctance, my group and I have engaged in good faith and responsibly in the work to improve the Commission's proposal. This work is long-term, given the exceptional complexity of the case, which invites complicated trade-offs between different types of interests and objectives that are brought together within the same instrument.  It is, indeed, a real revolution in the way the European Union's external action will be financed. This revolution also responds to repeated demands from our Parliament, particularly in terms of more flexibility to respond to unforeseen challenges. But the Commission's proposal lacked important details in terms of the governance and role of the European Parliament, the clear and precise definition of the objectives for the various policies covered, as well as financial guarantees on the allocation of funds and their use. Through cooperation between political groups, we have been able to propose a coherent framework to ensure an increased role in the European Parliament, including through the intelligent use of delegated acts. We have set clear and ambitious objectives for the various areas of external action, while at the centre of human rights and the promotion of democracy.  Finally, with regard to budgetary measures, since this is the heart of our discussion, we have increased the total envelope of the instrument by 4.4%. We have introduced guarantees for geographical financial allocations for the neighbourhood and sub-Saharan Africa. We have also strengthened allocations for human rights, civil society and global challenges, in parallel with a reduction in the reserve from EUR 10.2 billion to EUR 7 billion. Finally, I regret the attitude of the Green Group in the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. We have accepted more than 250 amendments from this group. We, the four co-carriers, have filed a total of 380. Despite the fact that we have taken up an extremely large number of amendments (unprecedented for a report voted here), the Green Group abstained. I don't understand that attitude. This is the historical record and you want to break this instrument? I'd like an answer from you.

Mr President, we all know why we are here, although I regret that there are so few of us for a package that amounts to almost EUR 100 billion over a seven-year financial planning period. I would have liked the number of participants to be more in relation to the size of the case, but perhaps the absence of so many colleagues is also due to the more reasonable pace of the last few weeks of the session. As far as the text is concerned, I think it does justice to the Commission's ambition when it presented its proposal. All of us, who have been involved in the development policy, the development cooperation of the European Union, have come across interlocutors, especially African ones, for whom the proliferation of our financing instruments was so incredible that they no longer knew where to give heads to look for financing. The coherence that this instrument would bring is probably its most positive characteristic. But even if we vote tomorrow on the package concocted by the four co-carriers, we have no certainty that we will achieve the desired effect. This is due in particular to the unfortunately unresolved issue of the inclusion of the European Development Fund in the European Union budget. France, as well as other states, continue to oppose the budgeting of the EDF. And without this budgeting, there will be no instrument of neighbourhood, development cooperation and international cooperation, there will simply not be. It would therefore be desirable for Parliament to reinforce its message, which is also that of the Commission, of the budgeting of the EDF as a democratic necessity, and for the Council, which is the main protagonist of the non-budgeting of the EDF, to adopt this position, instead of remaining walled in a 'postcolonial' attitude. It also remains to be seen whether the Commission has had a unequivocal position on this issue. For I really have the impression that throughout the last few months, at least one Commissioner and his colleagues have made sure that the notion of a sacred instrument of the neighbourhood survives actively in this Parliament, as if the neighbourhood were an end in itself and a need for its own financing instruments, or else it would disappear. We are still talking about a treaty policy that will not be changed by a simple parliamentary or legislative decision. We are talking in this instrument about a 24% increase in funds dedicated to the neighbourhood. Nevertheless, we receive amendments and suggestions from the Commissioner's office on enlargement and the neighbourhood, all of which tend to invalidate the single instrument approach. Personally, I am asking myself the question and perhaps, Commissioner, could you answer it, whether or not there was a fair approach by the college from the beginning. Otherwise, I would have serious questions about the operation of the college.

Mr President, I would first like to thank my fellow rapporteurs. We have done a very good job over the last six months. It was not an easy job, but we still managed to get you a document before the end of that mandate.  I would also like to thank the officials of the Committee on Development, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Human Rights for their professionalism, skills, loyalty and also the stamina they have shown throughout this period. It is the most complicated document that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has drawn up and then, in another novelty, it was the result of three committees whose work deals with external relations. It was a risky bet.  It was a risky gamble because four rapporteurs and three committees were given that. It was a risky gamble because we promised to think outside the box without sacrificing the gains of development. It was also a risky bet because converging our views on this new instrument was not a foregone conclusion. At the first presentation of the document, Ms. Mogherini said that policies would remain in their essence, but that methods would change. We have made a bet on change and I think we have done quite well so far. To go off the beaten track is to make the European Union's external action more coherent. To go off the beaten track is to budget the EDF. How many years do we stop renewing this request to budget the European Development Fund because we have made a habit of teaching the rest of the world about democracy when we ourselves have not been able to have the power or a final word in terms of the implementation of the European Development Fund. To think outside the box is also to understand that it is a question of meeting challenges of a different magnitude for the period 2020-2027, than that which is being implemented. Going off the beaten track also means realizing that states and the Commission cannot do everything.  Money is missing everywhere, so what could be more normal than to invite the private sector to drain part of its savings and part of its means towards development. This is the instrument - the EFSD - which, with its leverage, will ultimately devote more resources to official development assistance. Finally, I would like to say that Parliament's prerogatives will also come out strengthened if our House endorses our recommendations. We have succeeded in enforcing the European consensus on development, we have succeeded in enforcing the rights of the European Parliament by trying to include the different positions we have taken in recent years on this subject, and we have - and this is no small matter - an advance on the Council: we are ready and our bet , it was to finish before the end of this Parliament.

I am pleased that the report gives overall support to the politically and financially ambitious proposal of the Commission. I especially welcome Parliament’s support for a more coherent and responsive instrument. Europe’s voice in the world will be louder and its priorities better served through this instrument – priorities such as the neighbourhood, sub-Saharan Africa, eradication of poverty, sustainable development, migration, promoting human rights and democracy, fighting climate change and preserving peace. I am also glad to see Parliament retained investment as one of the modalities that should be mobilised to pursue these objectives.  I am personally convinced that the budgetisation of the European Development Fund (EDF) will considerably enhance the European Parliament’s legislative, budgetary and scrutiny roles. Overall, I think all these elements will contribute to ensuring that the new instrument meets our objectives and commitments made in the context of the European Union’s global strategy, the new European consensus on development and the global 2030 Agenda. In the context of the inclusion of neighbourhood policy financing in the NDICI instrument that the Commission unanimously proposed and maintained, let me underline this point again: a streamlined, more efficient architecture of our external spending does not call into question the political importance of any single geographical or thematic policy. On the contrary, we want to maximise the impact of each policy while improving our ability to mobilise additional resources where they are needed the most. This is particularly important in response to unforeseen developments, for instance in our neighbourhood. In our vision, programming is the process that will ensure the link between the implementation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the European Union’s interests, external action interests and the interest of our partners. This process can only translate into the intended results if it is kept flexible. I also welcome the political ambition of the report to focus on major priorities like human development and the fight against climate change. I believe, however, that such targets should be aspirational and not legally binding obligations. Otherwise, they risk constraining our external activities in a complex and ever-changing context.  I reiterate my conviction that the European Union’s ambitions as the leading international development actor are fully reflected in this proposal, and I welcome your support. However, in the context of the 2030 Agenda, a 95% DAC-ability target may not be realistic. Indeed, it is important to keep a sufficient degree of flexibility to fulfil the European Union’s ambitions in the area of conflict prevention and peace, or in our cooperation with industrialised countries. I believe that by making a legal commitment to achieve a 92% DAC-ability, the Commission is already proposing an ambitious target. The Commission is ready to engage with Parliament in order to explore how best to enhance its role of steering and oversight. A frank and substantive dialogue both at political and technical level with Parliament is indeed our objective in full respect of the interinstitutional balance. However, I think that creating additional layers of institutional control and making excessive use of delegated acts will not achieve that objective. Instead, it will make the functioning of the instrument too complex. Keeping sufficient flexibility is key. In this regard, the foreign policy needs and priorities component for rapid response actions should be maintained in the non-programmable pillar. As is the case for the reserve in the current EDF, the cushion would give us the necessary capacity to respond timely and efficiently to the type of unexpected needs that are so common in external action in the neighbourhood and beyond. I do not believe, therefore, that unallocated funds for the cushion for emerging challenges and priorities should be reduced, nor should their mobilisation become more complex.

We put some proposals on the table – a steering group between the External Action Service and the Commission, and it’s not a secret that that cooperation can be improved – but we also looked at how to ensure more conditionality to the billions of euros suggested under a so-called flexible amount.

Secondly, we have managed to see migration more in the context of international challenges. It is important to us that migration policy ensures the safety of people and good planning and implementation, and that people enjoy protection, as enshrined in international law and in our values of the European Union. Migration is really only the result of conflicts, of poverty, of a lack of development. Above all, we want to aim at the strategy of combating the root causes. That's why 10 percent is enough for migration management.  I think that we, particularly as Social Democrats, should warmly welcome this instrument.

It is its own distinctive policy, based on values rooted in the fight against extreme poverty and the fight for global justice. In the short time left, just two quick points. Firstly, the period in which the new instrument will operate is going to be a crucial one. Between now and 2030, the EU and the global community must deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as on the promise of creating a sustainable future – not just for ourselves, but for all who share our planet. EU external action and development will be part of that.

Military as a development aid worker? Unfortunately, this is provided for in the Commission's proposal and, unfortunately, also in the agreed text from the committee.

Let me congratulate you again for your determination and success in concluding Parliament’s first—reading position in a timely manner. This will allow us to start negotiations as soon as the Council is ready. We in the European Commission are fully and unanimously convinced that establishing a coherent and more responsive Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) is a paramount step in promoting and delivering on our objectives and commitments made in the context of the EU Global Strategy, the European Consensus on Development and the global 2030 Agenda. I insist that this will be best done within the proposed NDICI architecture by safeguarding and ring—fencing the specific measures and the political importance of each geographical and thematic policy, including human rights and democracy.  In our view, any amendment that might undermine – let alone dismantle – a coherent structure of the NDICI instrument, as supported by the report, would only contribute to inconsistency and contradictions between our policy goals and our financial capacity to carry them forward. In that context, I am confident that the existence of any self—standing financial instrument does not add more significance to any particular EU policy. On the contrary, the best way of overcoming policy silos is building true policy coherence, including funding coherence of our financial instruments.  I would also like to draw to your attention that the financing instruments as proposed by the Commission are fully in line with our development priorities – our development substance that is set in the European Consensus on Development. Therefore, a human—rights—based approach, eradicating poverty, and a rule—based democratic approach to all of our partner countries are – and will be – important and a prevailing part of the implementation policy of our financial instruments.  Also, to all those honourable Members that tabled their concerns on the possible diversion of development funding towards military goals, I would like to point towards revisiting the founding treaties of the European Union, under which any military action funded by the European budget is actually impossible, and this will definitely not be part and parcel of our development policy. Also, let me stress again that the DAC-ability target and the spending targets as proposed by the Commission strike the right balance.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the ability to see globally and maintain geographical and sectoral objectives: this is the choice we have made fully and consistently, so I do not understand the concerns of some about the single instrument. We must not be afraid of the challenges that this instrument presents to all of us. And then let's face it, because in the course of the discussion these months, those who seem so dedicated to the neighborhood, were actually ready to sacrifice the southern neighborhood to look only and exclusively to the east. That is why we were right to incorporate all the instruments. The second issue is governance. The choice we have made is essential: to have greater control and involvement of the European Parliament, through delegated acts and a more meaningful and regular strategic dialogue, which takes account of programming decisions, is important and it is really strange that no one has dwelt on this element of transparency and the possibility for the European Parliament to actually co-decide.

Let us not allow political polemics to lose sight of the real and important issues of an instrument that seeks to give a global dimension to the European Union's actions.

Madam President, I would like to clarify the amendment I tabled on behalf of the EPP Group to the motion for a resolution that accompanies the report. It is not a question of unravelling what we have achieved together over the last eight months, we have been able to improve things in terms of neighbourhood. There is a 24% increase in funding, and we have more generally strengthened the policy framework for the neighbourhood, which remains a priority in our action. We have also improved the results-based approach, which is one of the central pillars of European Neighbourhood Policy. However, it is also necessary to be realistic and to say things clearly as they are: the door remains open for a separate neighbourhood instrument. We know very well that the Member States remain divided in the Council on this issue and I believe that all options must be kept on the table for the next Parliament, which will go to the negotiations because, like it or not, the instrument of neighbourhood, development cooperation and international cooperation remains for the moment a colossus with feet of clay. And I would also like to add that, during the negotiations, our colleagues in the Committee on Development tried to channel this whole process into a single development logic. They even proposed extraordinary things, Mr. Panzeri mentioned, such as eliminating the countries of northern Africa from the Southern Neighbourhood Policy and keeping only the countries of the Middle East and a small part to the east. The idea of breaking a policy with an instrument is unacceptable, but they have tried everything to grab the idea of international cooperation and diminish the meaning of foreign and neighbourhood policy. For me, you always have to take a political perspective.

We have heard once again tonight all the nonsense of the extreme left that we have already had to digest in the past months, namely that it is an instrument of militarism, that it is a martial instrument, that it is an instrument intended to prevent any form of migration. All of this is, of course, not true.  It is basically an extremely interesting instrument because it would finally enable the implementation of the Africa strategy, which we call for at every summit, which has been taking place for two or three years, and which, until then, due to a lack of coherent funding, has not been able to see the light of day.  It would also allow us to have another interaction between the territories covered by the neighbourhood policy and the territories covered by the cooperation policy, which makes a lot of sense. Because in the world in which we live, we cannot really separate Algeria from Niger, or Libya from Chad, or Morocco from Mauritania. We must be aware that all this closer interaction between the territories covered by one policy and the territories covered by another policy is also progress in terms of coherence. We are also safeguarding all options for the continuation of our partnership with the ACP countries, which I think is important given that, from next year, the Cotonou agreements will have to be replaced by something else. We do not know exactly what it will be, but in any case, from now on, the instrument we have on the table covers all the contingencies.  In short, it is also a good instrument because it includes the neighbourhood and I would very much like that tomorrow, when we are out of this room, it will be like this again and again because I think that fetishism does not help us as much as the political realism that all our external policies are financed coherently and ambitiously.

Madam President, I must say again that within the four co-speakers we have had a frank, open discussion. We have exchanged arguments and what matters is the final compromise. Also, blaming one or the other for making his arguments does not count. Finally, what matters is the result and I think we did it in a constructive spirit. That's what I remember from our work. I have heard some comments that can only come from colleagues who have barely read the report. I have read the Commission document, I have contributed to the preparation of this report and some remarks are not at all justified. Some say that it is not a good place for development. We have agreed to devote 95% of this instrument to development and the neighbourhood side even devotes most of the funds for development. Therefore, let us not be told that this is not an instrument of development. Geographical pillars are secure. There is no difference from the previous policy. The method has changed, we have a common reserve for all these instruments, which are now merged, and this allows the Commission to do a better job.  We have also tried to increase the prerogatives of the European Parliament. When we say that we could have done more for development, I will tell you one thing: here, in this instrument, we have not only done the maximum, but we have even tried to go beyond that. If we want to spend more development funds on the EUROPEAN Union's foreign policy, we must go to the Member States that have made promises, including spending 0.7% on official development assistance. If the Member States kept their promises and pledged to cooperate closely with the Commission, at the very least, at least an additional EUR 200 billion could be spent on European development policy in the coming period.  Therefore, it is not in Brussels or Strasbourg that we should address these reproaches, we must go to Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Warsaw, Prague, Lisbon. We have to go wherever these promises are not kept.  If we want to make the European Union a real development factor, we must realize that the European Union is not only the Commission but also the Member States. That is the European Union. It's sad to have to remember these facts.  From this point of view, I believe that we have done a job that allows us to approach the trilogue discussions with a level of view with the Council, to be modest, because the Council has not yet done its homework.

I understand that this cooperation can be interpreted as a model of understanding between the political groups of this Parliament. I would also like to extend this thanks to the rest of the shadow rapporteurs. Commissioner, I would like, before making an introduction to the main elements of this report, to share a concern which has been raised by some colleagues, a little in the context of the electoral process to which we are approaching, in relation to the name of this Regulation — The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III) — and the list of potential beneficiaries. I hope that in the course of the further discussions and the negotiations to be taking place, these doubts that some colleagues have expressed can be cleared up. Firstly, it seems to me that it is important to underline the importance of the financial endowment of this instrument: around EUR 15 billion. It is a very important amount, which is intended to support the political, administrative, economic, legal and institutional reforms that countries in this area of pre-accession have to have. These instruments are also aimed at supporting everything about structural reforms and public governance, and are aimed at specific areas of action, which are the principles that inspire the Action of the European Union: respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the rule of law. Finally, the areas of action are the policy areas of the European Union: economic and social development, agricultural policy and agricultural development, research, development and innovation, development policy in the field of the environment and the fight against climate change, and in particular, Madam President, everything relating to interterritorial and cross-border cooperation. There are three fundamental elements that characterize this new financial instrument that distinguish it from the previous ones. They are, first of all, the principle of equitable sharing, direct and indirect management and, above all, the need to deepen everything that concerns the visibility of the European Union's financial action. On the other hand, I am also interested in highlighting the support it has given to prerogatives, as noted in the previous debate of the European Parliament. This instrument, such as the Neighbourhood Policy, Development and International Cooperation Instrument, seeks to strengthen and strengthen the capacities of this Parliament, which will set annual amounts with the Council, within the framework of the multiannual financial perspective. The Commission must take into account the positions and resolutions adopted by the European Parliament. Parliament will be associated with all developments in programming and, through delegated acts, will have a more active role in maintaining a real strategic dialogue in which Parliament, The Commission and the Council can play their part in each institution. There is another element— and I conclude with this, Madam President. We have found a balanced formula for combining the role to be played by the Commission and the External Action Service in the development of everything related to this financial instrument and I hope, Commissioner, that in the course of the previous developments presented to us by the legislative programme we will be able to continue working and cooperating to make real instrument a fundamental element for the countries of pre-accession. I conclude as I began, Madam President, by thanking Mr Fleckenstein for his work; I hope that we will be able in the coming weeks to continue to cooperate in the institutional triangle in order to try to give a definitive profile to this much-needed and so essential instrument within the framework of the European Union's external action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 343, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Knut FLECKENSTEIN", "mepid": "96840", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which First of all, Mr Salafranca, thank you very much for your kind words. You are right about everything you have said about me, but I can give it back one to one: it was a very good cooperation, and above all the result is correct. IPA III is an instrument that does not serve any neighbourhood with EUR 15 billion. The beneficiaries are none other than future Member States of the European Union, namely the six Western Balkan countries.  Last weekend marked the 20th anniversary of NATO's deployment in the former Yugoslavia against the Milosevic regime. This reminded us of the region's past. The ultimate objective of the EU's enlargement policy, including in the war-torn Western Balkans, must be peace and reconciliation. With IPA III funds, we want to serve this goal. Good neighbourly relations, cooperation and networking between countries and many different ethnic groups are therefore highlighted in this report.  The European Union is the largest donor in the region, but an astonishing percentage of people there do not know this. But the people of the region need to know who their biggest supporter is. Obviously, we need to be louder and clearer so that we can be heard and seen. Other countries, such as China, Russia, Turkey, and Arab countries, have long been involved in investment. But these investments are nowhere near as sustainable and forward-looking as ours. That is why I say that we too must keep promoting and presenting our good work.  The statistics tell us that the economy in the candidate countries is growing. But in real terms, one can hardly see a real improvement in living conditions. Growth hardly generates new jobs and thus prospects for living at home. Many people in the Western Balkans still see no other way out than emigration, so it was particularly important to us that this instrument not only provides aid to central governments in the capitals, but also reaches rural regions. It should not matter which party has a majority there. People's living standards must be improved, democracy and prosperity must go hand in hand. Institution-building, democratisation and the rule of law are also the highest priorities of our instrument.  Ensuring the rule of law is not a gift to Mr Juncker or Mr Tusk or to Commissioner Hahn. Respect for and implementation at the micro level down to the highest levels of society is a duty, both for the state and for the citizen. Without the rule of law, EU law cannot one day be adopted or properly implemented.  However, the EU loses its credibility when it demands these values from the candidate countries, but at the same time some Member States no longer respect them. And that is why let us be a good example and use all the possibilities and enforce it in case of doubt.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have produced a good report. Thank you to the co-rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. I am sure that tomorrow, with a broad majority, we will be able to take the next step, also in the interests and for the benefit of our friends in the Western Balkans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 344, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first I would like to congratulate the House, and in particular the rapporteurs, on the excellent work. I am particularly pleased, looking at the Council and Parliament’s positions, that there are many converging views, notably regarding the new thematic programming. The new proposal for pre—accession funding is a EUR 14.5 billion investment in Europe’s own stability, security and prosperity. This instrument helps our partners to strengthen their democratic institutions, improve their judiciaries and public administrations, reform their economies and introduce high EU standards to protect consumers and the environment. All this benefits directly citizens and business in those countries, as well as in the Union itself.  IPA III will be more strategic. Its programming is based on thematic priorities, rather than country allocations, giving it also more of a performance-based nature. It will be important to reach a balance between predictability, which is important for governments to plan their budgets and their national co-financing and, of course, performance, which will allow us to steer strategically and support those partners that commit and deliver.  Strengthening the policy dialogue and building an inclusive partnership with the European Parliament is our objective. We should explore within the limits of the interinstitutional balance in the Treaties. This will be one important point to be discussed during the dialogue, and we look forward to starting it as soon as possible.  One issue that I would like to raise is about respecting the institutional setting between the Commission and the European External Action Service. We clearly need maximum coherence between enlargement and external policy, but what is proposed to amend here would demand disrupting the institutional framework in place. Enlargement policy is first and foremost about exporting internal policies. So, for example, when you propose a horizontal steering group we see duplication with what we have established already on the different chapters of the acquis.  Finally, you have proposed removing the cross-reference to NDICI. As you know, one of the principles for this MFF is simplification and, in particular, achieving a so-called ‘single rule book’. This is important because it streamlines the procedures within the Commission, it increases coherence when dealing with outside partners, and reduces the administrative burden of our actions.  I trust that your intention is not to undermine this objective, but as NDICI and IPA will follow their separate negotiation, we have no guarantees of finishing with the same set of rules.

Commissioner, you pointed out in your speech for which all areas the IPA is important. Of course, there are now new challenges facing not only Member States but also these candidate and candidate countries, such as environmental challenges, energy efficiency or migration, so it is important that we provide sufficient resources in the budget to respond to new challenges as well.  You pointed out how important strategic planning is, which is increasingly being improved. What I disagree with is the allocation of funds only by thematic priorities and not by Member State. I think it is very important to continue to have indicative amounts by country, not member states, but candidates and candidates, i.e. beneficiary countries of IPA funds. Why? Because in countries where there are not enough proposed projects and no capacity is strong enough, we need to help with stronger technical assistance.

Although, according to the responses we have received from the Commissioner in the past, the vehicles were not armed, I find it remarkable that IPA funds – the aim of which is to support reforms and build up their capacity during the accession process – are being used to buy these vehicles in a country such as Turkey, which is in constant conflict with its citizens and its neighbours. We now want IPA III to focus more on strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law and on reforming the judiciary and public administration, respect for human rights, including minorities, gender equality, workers' rights and non-discrimination.

Therefore, I fully support the establishment of IPA III with a focus on the rule of law, fundamental rights and migration, EU policies and acquis, socioeconomic development investments for growth and good neighbourly relations. Importantly, the establishment of IPA III has to be done not only in coherence with the priorities of the Western Balkan strategy and EU enhanced engagement with the region, but with increased flexibility and cooperation with Turkey, in the context of possible Turkish accession to the EU in the future.

We therefore ask IPA III to be better suited to the changed political circumstances of the Union and its partners than its processor. I think I can say that, thanks to the excellent work done by Mr Salafranca and Mr Fleckenstein, whom I thank, this is indeed the case with this proposal. It seems to me that very important progress has been made in strengthening Parliament's prerogatives in the design, programming, monitoring and evaluation of the instrument's action and in ensuring political control and democratic control of the European funds used. I also think it is extremely positive, indeed necessary, to strengthen the proposed conditionality and the allocation of funds on the basis of the performance of the countries and clear benchmarks and, above all, the possibility, this time codified in the instrument, of partially or entirely suspending assistance in the event of the candidates being relegated from the Copenhagen criteria or in accordance with the principles of democracy, the rule of law and the rule of law. , human rights and fundamental freedoms. Well, then we really must have the courage to use these benchmarks, to make this instrument stand out, starting with Turkey, on pain of losing our credibility. Ladies and gentlemen, accession policy is and will continue to be one of those that define the EU. Its centrality is also evident in the decision to have a separate instrument, even at a time of unification, such as that proposed by the Neighbourhood Instrument, Development Cooperation and International Cooperation (NDICI). However, once we know that we are going to vote on a good proposal tomorrow, we will need bolder decisions and clearer ideas for the accession policy itself, aspects that have sometimes been lacking in recent years. Thanks to the approval of the new generation of tools we will have a very sharp chisel available. It is in the hand that he will hold it, and therefore also to us, that it will be up to us to use it well and in the most effective way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 359, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Gerolf ANNEMANS", "mepid": "124973", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only should this Parliament stop the dream of some here, the dream that Turkey will one day become a member of the European Union, but also stop the billions of dollars that support this dream.

The issue that has struck me whenever I have visited has been the limited absorption capacity for funding in some of these states. Therefore, my questions to the Commission are, firstly – Commissioner Hahn, I hope you’re listening – how is DG NEAR, in this case also IPA III, taking the absorption capacity of accession countries into account?  Secondly, as we’ve just heard, Parliament voted to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey. Given that Turkey is by far the largest IPA beneficiary, how will the suspension of talks affect IPA disbursements?

First of all, I would like to thank you for this discussion. My take-away from the discussion is that we have many areas of agreement, and we look forward to continue working constructively. There is broad agreement that key parameters should be preserved of our work with the enlargement countries.  The ‘fundamentals first’ approach, linking the rule of law and fundamental rights with the two other crucial areas of the accession process – economic governance and reforms, the strengthening of democratic institutions and public administration reforms – will continue to be at the helm of our cooperation. The focus on regional cooperation promotes cross-border cooperation with Member States and between Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) beneficiaries. As we have committed to a European perspective for the Western Balkans, reaffirmed in the Western Balkans Strategy, this regional focus is ever more relevant. At the same time, we are not leaving Turkey behind. Our presence remains important to support, as Mr Fleckenstein said, the democratic process and civil society. This new programming dynamic will help us continue our support to Turkey, but allow us to adapt to the evolving situation and reflect developments in our relations with the country.  I will come to the comments of Ms Maletić and the concerns of Ms Gill. We can combine this, and that’s why I would like to refer to its core update: a more strategic steering towards financial assistance. We set priorities and schemes rather than country envelopes, allowing us to reward performance and progress towards key priorities and to increase flexibility to respond to the evolving needs of the partners in the path towards accession. This means, indeed, if there are absorption problems in the future, we can avoid this by focusing on thematic priorities. Somebody said there might be problems for one country or another in preparing mature projects. In our experience, they are always able to prepare projects but sometimes in this thematic area and sometimes in another one. Of course, we always have to help them to really prepare projects in a way that we can ultimately support financially and assist them to implement them. The idea of thematic priorities is to have a kind of competition, a kind of regatta, amongst the candidate countries and to have the necessary flexibility. So if one country is more focused on rule of law issues, they should have the opportunity to invest more. Others might be more focused on transport, but at the end of the day – which means the accession day – they have to align with all the different elements in order to get quasi—approval from us, the Member States, to accept a new Member State. But in order to arrive there, it’s good to have more flexibility.  There will be, Ms Maletić, an indicative country-specific envelope, but the baseline is indeed the thematic priorities. We are deeply convinced, and this is also true of a vast majority here in the House, that this helps us to be more effective on the ground, to have more flexibility, and to serve our joint interests to prepare the countries thoroughly for hopefully faster accession than is currently probably the case.  So finally, thank you again for helping us to launch this EUR 14.5 billion investment in peace, stability and prosperity for Europe.

Firstly, Commissioner, we do not want to blur or change competences, but we want there to be a coordination between foreign policy and neighbourhood policy or enlargement policy. I am quite sure that we will find the right wording in our discussions, which also make it clear that there is no fundamental need to change anything. Secondly, I believe that the people of the Western Balkans can be quite satisfied with us. Because it is not only a question of spreading our resources more widely, other areas of responsibility that we have not so far considered, such as climate protection, social affairs, the economy or jobs, but also of being able to do something more together or do less in the way that we have done, depending on the effort on the other hand. : \"If you don't do as I want, then there are less\", but vice versa: Whoever makes a special effort, who also picks up a bit more speed, must also have a chance to be supported by us a bit better or more. Finally, this IPA III is a clear signal to the people of the Western Balkans: no matter what the next European elections will be, no matter what the majorities in this House will be, the European Parliament will always and in the years to come alongside our friends in the Western Balkans and will endeavour to provide assistance with the almost EUR 15 billion. so that a merger in the European Union can take place as soon as possible.

It is therefore essential that the citizens of the candidate countries are able and want to have a say in what the IPA supports and why.

These were prompted by the announcement that the incumbent President Bouteflika would run for a fifth mandate in the presidential elections, initially set for 18 April. Since then, demonstrations have continued virtually every day and have grown in size. Besides opposing a new mandate for President Bouteflika, the protesters are demanding a broad reform of Algeria’s political system. Notwithstanding their massive scale, demonstrations have been largely peaceful and the response by the security services has been very measured. Official communication from the government in recent weeks, following the nomination of a new prime minister and deputy prime minister, stresses the necessity to consult and listen to the people with a view to introducing significant reforms. Algeria is a key partner for the European Union. We have important political, economic and people—to—people interests in that country and in that region, where Algeria is a stabilising factor. Our bilateral relations have progressed positively in recent years and we expect that to continue. The High Representative met Minister of State Lamamra in Brussels on 7 March to discuss the situation in the country before his subsequent appointment as deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and I also had the opportunity to talk to him. Demonstrations have so far been peaceful and the response by security services has been measured. This is highly commendable and restraint should continue. As you all know, the situation is currently very fluid. We have been following today’s developments very closely. It’s key now that there should be a positive response to the people’s aspirations: the call for reform of governance, for greater political openness and for more economic and social opportunities, especially for the young. Any process has to be transparent and include all sections of Algerian society. During this period, it’s important to remember that it’s for the Algerians to decide for themselves and among themselves how to make this transition happen.  On the EU side, we should encourage a free, fair and inclusive election of Algeria’s next President to be organised within a reasonable timeframe. The European Union is ready to support the election with technical expertise and will consider fielding an electoral observation mission if, of course, Algeria requests this and if the conditions of the process are met. I count on Parliament’s support in this regard. We should also support the call for a broad reform and transition process. A national conference could be the platform for discussing this as long as it is generally inclusive, representative and designed to ensure political legitimacy. It’s important to make quick progress on this. Citizens’ initiatives for a peaceful solution are also circulating and we understand there is willingness on both sides to define a common way forward. We hope that the consensus crystallises around a road map for the transition, as well as who should be in charge of carrying it out. Whatever process is followed, it must be one that is accepted by Algerians as expressing their will and, as we have stated publicly, the European Union stands ready to accompany Algeria in this process if the Algerians request it. The Union should continue to support Algeria in its socio-economic reforms and the shaping of perspectives that match the desires and ambitions of the population, especially the young. All this will be done in full respect of Algeria’s sovereignty and in a spirit of partnership, as it is defined in our neighbourhood policy concept. The events over the past four weeks have tested political maturity in Algeria and we count on all concerned to face up to the call for change and to bring a peaceful transition to fruition.

Madam President, tens of thousands of demonstrators take to the streets of Algiers, Algeria in general, every Friday to express the simple and legitimate demand for a credible political transition and the departure of President Bouteflika, who has been unable to govern the country for a long time. Unfortunately, the authorities do not seem to be listening to the people because their solution to the crisis is not one of them. Extending the term of office of the president, which legally expires on 28 April, and breaking the constitutional framework by suspending the electoral process goes against the demands of Algerians. The national conference proposed by the government was overwhelmingly rejected by the opposition and civil society. In addition, defections are multiplying within the circles of power and the army staff is sending contradictory messages, as we saw this afternoon as well. The international tour of the Algerian authorities, in an attempt to reassure their partners about their ability to manage this crisis, is further proof of the failure of the transition proposed by the Bouteflika family. Algeria is deadlocked. It is a major partner of the European Union, a guarantor of regional stability, stability that could be maintained through respect for the rights and freedoms of Algerians through the establishment of a transparent and inclusive system of governance.

The protests, thankfully, have so far been peaceful protests with young people taking to the streets because they believe in something different to what the Algerian Government at present is offering. One of the key comments that we see time and time again from people in Algeria is that they desperately want freedom of speech; that they want to be able to express themselves in ways that they’ve not been able to do of late. But the situation is incredibly serious: we’ve got the army chief calling for Bouteflika to be declared unfit to govern. The one point that I want to make specifically today, that has perhaps not been raised yet in this debate, is that freedom of speech must also imply freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is guaranteed under Article 36 of the Algerian Constitution, which states that freedom of religion and creed is inviolable. I want to mention the persecution of religious minorities in Algeria, and specifically Christians, because I’ve met Algerian pastors on two occasions who have come to the European Parliament to express their concerns about how they are being persecuted at present. Algeria has moved from number 42 to number 22 on the world watch list of most persecuting countries of Christians in just one year. We’ve seen churches having been closed, and particularly the EPA – the Église protestante d’Algérie. We have seen the government using various administrative means to close down churches, and we have seen those who have preached on social media put in prison. We’ve seen those who import religious materials put in prison. We’ve seen those who convert to Christianity being persecuted. All I’d ask is that in all of these discussions, in all of these debates, please can we remember that Christians and other religious minorities are being persecuted in Algeria, as these matters are being discussed in the coming days.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 384, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Jacques COLOMBIER", "mepid": "191510", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

I hear beautiful words in this Chamber, which is not in for a democratic transition. But what is the European Union doing? What can it do in this process? Algeria is not a member of Europe, at least not yet.

As such, the place of those who demonstrate, especially in Paris and elsewhere on current events, should be in Algeria and nowhere else. Certainly, the mummy Bouteflika who, during the time of his lucidity, insulted the French and spit perpetually on France, while coming to get treatment at our home at the expense of our taxpayers, arouses in us no sympathy.

Five years on, the European Union remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We do not, and we will not, recognise this violation of international law. We are unwavering in our non-recognition policy. The deterioration of the security situation in the Black Sea region is a constant source of concern, with an increasing militarisation of the Crimean Peninsula. The unjustified use of force by Russia in the Kerch Strait last November, in itself another consequence of the illegal annexation, is a reminder of its negative impact on regional stability. The Union expects Russia to release unconditionally and without further delay the Ukrainian crew members and vessels that were captured on that day. Russia should ensure respect of their right to legal representation and access by consular authorities. We also expect Russia to provide them with appropriate medical treatment.  This unacceptable situation also stems from the construction of the Kerch Bridge without Ukraine’s consent. Some time ago, Russia started to apply an inspection regime that limits the navigation through the Kerch Strait to, and from, Ukraine ports and leads to significant delays. Hundreds of vessels flying Ukraine’s flag and international flags, including those of EU Member States, have suffered from controls which can last several days. We expect Russia to ensure unhindered and free passage of all ships through the Kerch Strait, to and from the Azov Sea, in accordance with international law.  We welcome Ukraine’s approach to seeking justice, such as the ongoing case under UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition to the negative consequences of the illegal annexation and the security situation in the region, we deplore systematic restrictions of fundamental freedoms and violations of human rights in the peninsula, notably the rights of the Crimean Tatars, which have been seriously violated. Their media outlets have also been shut down; the activities of the Mejlis, their self-governing body, have been banned; and the leaders and members of their community have been persecuted.  We will continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Oleh Sentsov, who received the Sakharov Prize last year and whose picture outside the European Parliament reminds the people who walk by every day about his dedication.  We also call for the release of many others, such as Edem Bekirov, Oleksandr Kolchenko, Mykola Semena, Volodymyr Balukh and Emir—Usein Kuku, who have been detained and sentenced by Russia in breach of international law. We call for all human rights violations to be investigated and for international human rights actors to have unfettered access to the Crimean Peninsula. In addition to cases related to the Crimean Peninsula, we unfortunately continue to see examples of illegally-detained Ukrainian citizens being convicted in Russia. Most recently, Pavlo Hryb was sentenced to six years imprisonment, and we also expect him to be released. We will also take every opportunity to raise individual cases publicly and bilaterally with our Russian interlocutors.  Faced with Russia’s violations of international law, Ukraine is not alone. We have stood by our associated partner and continue to do so. We condemned the construction of the Kerch Bridge and pointed to the deterioration of the security situation in the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, including in this forum last October.  Our position on the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol has been reiterated on many occasions, most recently in the High Representative’s declaration on behalf of the European Union on 17 March. She also publicly addressed this issue during the last Foreign Affairs Council. We also have to take measures to show Russia that its actions have a cost.  Lastly, on 15 March, we added to our list of restrictive measures eight Russian individuals who were involved in the use of force at the Kerch Strait in November. The publication of this decision was made in parallel with similar announcements made by our transatlantic partners in a demonstration of our continued unity.  We have also identified possible areas for further EU support for the Ukrainian regions severely affected by the Russian inspection regime in the Azov Sea. We are particularly looking into developing railway and road connections in the area, training centres in some Ukrainian cities around the Azov Sea, and support for small- and medium-sized enterprises aiming to diversify the business sector and the industrial structure of this region, for the time being heavily depending on steel production.  These violations of international law are happening on our very continent and we, as the European Union, have no doubt about where we stand. We stand on the side of international law. We stand on the side of the basic principle that borders must not be changed by force, and most importantly we stand on the side of the people of Ukraine. In these years we have invested in Ukraine more than in any other country in the world, and Ukraine knows that our support is here to stay.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 400, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Elmar BROK", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very I would like to thank Mr Hahn for his contribution on this issue and for his clarity. In Helsinki, as Europeans, we laid out two principles: the sovereignty of a country, free to decide with whom to form coalitions, conclude treaties, and the second point is the inviolability of borders, which can never be changed unilaterally.  And Russia has violated both principles. It has occupied part of another country, is waging war with another part. And in the Sea of Azov – Mr Hahn, as you have pointed out – there is also an attempt to change things under international law, which is unacceptable. And I think we have to be clear here! This was the first violation of international law in these areas since 1945! This must be clearly stated. And it must not become the practice of the Europe of the 21st century that such violations of international law are accepted. For this reason, I believe it must be clear that we are sticking to the sanctions, but that we are open to Russia getting back into a good conversation, for mutual interest, especially for Russia's interest, if international law is restored.  I believe that, five years after that, five years after that the people of Ukraine voted by a large majority in favour of a single Ukraine in a referendum in the 1990s, that the people of Ukraine, in all the elections – in all the free elections that took place in Ukraine – were in favour of a European solution, a path to Europe, and that there is therefore no legitimacy for Russia from the people's level, and that there is therefore no legitimacy for Russia from the people's mind. to make claims from it, old historical or for the reason that one thinks that population has been oppressed.

Georgia, eastern Ukraine and Crimea are showing us without any uncertainty that the Russian Federation is having no second thoughts about changing the borders in Europe by other means than peaceful if they can.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years ago, thousands of women and men, particularly young people, took to the streets of the entire southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean to demand more democracy, respect for their rights, fundamental freedoms, work and social inclusion. Eight years after those protests, which marked a break with the patterns of the past, it is time to take stock of the changes that have taken place in the region and, above all, of the Action of the European Union. While what is commonly referred to as the 'Arab Spring' and which, in reality, has been a series of several stages of progress has in fact led individual countries to take different paths, from greater democratisation to new regimes if not a situation of civil war, Europe has first and foremost sought to accompany the democratic pressures that had emerged. However, following the growing terrorist threat from Daesh and the outbreak of the refugee crisis, Europe has been led to focus more on stabilising our partner countries, security and curbing immigration. In short, once again we have repeated the same mistakes as in the past, not understanding that this would continue the vicious circle from which the people of this complicated region are trying to free themselves. This is what we are still seeing today in Algeria, which is in danger of becoming a new Syria if the situation is underestimated once again. The Union would have many means at its disposal for a more effective foreign policy, but renewed action must necessarily be based on a coordinated approach and greater unity. If the Member States each continue to pursue their own interests in the very short term, sometimes in conflict with each other, we will continue to fail to influence the complex processes that run through the region, thus increasingly playing the role of payers and non-actors, as has happened in Syria. We must therefore deeply rethink our policy towards this very important part of our neighbourhood, taking up our fundamental principles as a polar star. As indicated in the overall strategy for the common foreign and security policy, we must invest more in the resilience of these societies and not in mere stabilisation: stabilising a country by legitimising its authoritarian regimes, repression and social exclusion can work temporarily but risks, over time, re-escalating tensions that are only apparently subtly. Instead, we need a long-term approach, focusing on people and their aspirations, democracy, human rights, social inclusion and socio-economic development. After all, what has emerged from the Arab spring is first and foremost a great crisis of confidence on the part of citizens towards their institutions, which requires the construction of a new social contract, which the Union must encourage and support. The report therefore proposes an approach that takes into account the point of view of the populations involved: a constant and structured dialogue with civil society, including in its minor and local components; an approach that makes young people protagonists, who constitute an important and dynamic part but also vulnerable to these societies. That is why we are proposing to set up permanent advisory councils for young people in the Eu ropean Union delegations and we are proposing an Erasmus Euro-Mediterranean model exchange and work programme, with dedicated resources. We also call, among the many points touched on, for the Member States to put an end to the sale of weapons and equipment used for internal repression against regimes that do not respect human rights. Furthermore, we reiterate that greater cooperation cannot be separated from investigative and judicial cooperation, even in cases involving young Europeans, such as the well-known one of Giulio Regeni, for whom we are still waiting for the truth. In conclusion, therefore, we need a paradigm shift, and we believe that this report points out a path that responds more closely to the aspirations for dialogue, growth and cooperation with our southern and Mediterranean neighbourhood.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 427, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Benifei, for his report on the situation in certain countries of the MENA region since the Arab Spring. We very much agree with the main point raised by the report, that almost a decade after the beginning of the Arab uprising, many of the demands that moved so many people to take to the streets are still largely unanswered in most countries. The demand for better democracies, the demand for social justice, the demand for freedom of expression, in short, the demand for more inclusive systems of governance. This was the core of the Arab Spring and some countries have come a long way since 2011.  I am thinking, in particular, of Tunisia, which was the first country to rise up and is still a point of reference for the region. Our global strategy for foreign and security policy makes it very clear. Stability in this region cannot be guaranteed if these demands are ignored or denied. A resilient state needs a resilient society and a resilient society must feature democracy, trust in institutions and sustainable development.  With this in mind, let me emphasise three points. First, no one supports civil society in the Maghreb and Mashreq as much as we Europeans do. Not only have we established a forum for civil society of the neighbourhood south, which is now led directly by civil society organisations. EU delegations across the region are in permanent contact with civil society representatives. We are already working, as suggested in the report, to promote constant consultations with them, with the help of dedicated contact points in each delegation.  The report also mentions the essential work carried out by the European initiative for democracy and human rights and our work to protect human rights defenders. In this context, as also stressed in the report, our engagement with young people is the core of all our policies. There can be no resilience and no democracy without the full engagement of young people. They must find their place in our societies and find the opportunity to follow their dreams. Their voice must be heard.  For this reason, we have created a safe platform for the youth of the region, in order to listen to them and help us to define priorities. It’s called Young Med Voices Plus and its purpose is for young people to have an open dialogue with decision-makers and to shape the decision we make. About one month ago they had the chance to be part of the 5+5 dialogue of the Western Mediterranean and to shape the outcomes of the meeting.  I would like to stress that we engage with civil society in all contexts, even the most difficult ones, so my second point is about Syria. As you know, we recently hosted the third Brussels conference on the future of Syria and the region and we decided to put Syrian civil society at the centre of the conference. We gathered over 400 NGOs, engaged everyday on the ground, both in Syria and in the rest of the region, with a special focus on women. We offered them a safe space to meet and to engage ideas and we brought their voice to the table of decision-makers.  This is something we are truly proud of because Syria belongs to the Syrians and the only way to end this conflict is to help the Syrian people, together with the United Nations, build a democratic, inclusive, united and reconciled Syria.  We all know that the situation in the Middle East and North Africa is far from ideal and the aspirations of the Arab Spring have too often been betrayed. The only way to address this state of affairs is to engage relentlessly with all relevant actors. We must continue to engage with civil society, to support them and to help create the space for them to work freely, but we must also engage with governments and advocate the change we would like to see in our region. This would be my final point: human rights and democracy are always at the centre of our engagement with all governments in the region. We, as the European Union, always raise the issue of human rights, sometimes in public and sometimes in private, in our meetings with our counterparts. We fully share the spirit of this report. We want to help our friends on the other side of the Mediterranean to fulfil their aspiration towards better democracies, more freedom and more social justice.  So let me thank you again for your work, and even the more critical aspects, which we take very seriously and we will work to address. We share the same goals and no one is as engaged as the European Union to achieve them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 428, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Elmar BROK", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the This is not only an issue that is important for the development of the region there, but also in order to achieve stability, better living conditions, a situation that must also lead us to ensure security in connection with migration.  If there is no economic and social development there, there will be no stable states, and then there will be no effective cooperation that will make it possible, for example, to fight the traffickers of human beings in order to create the conditions for people to stop dying in the Mediterranean – as in the Sahara region. I believe that we must deliver, and Mr Benifei, in a good report in which he has been very cooperative, has put forward proposals that may also allow countries to strengthen among themselves. Trade relations with Europe are still colonial, but not among themselves. If economic development has to develop there – and, Commissioner, perhaps we should also make more support for cross-border cooperation, with greater infrastructure cooperation among themselves, in order to strengthen the trade relations of such a region in such a way, which will enable us to have better political and economic development in this way, or vice versa, in order to achieve such an improvement.

The promise of these values is precious and people calling for them should find solid European support. Us not impacting neighbours does not mean they won’t impact us.  I will always stay with a sense of missed opportunity. If the EU had invested more forcefully in the freedoms and rights of the largely young and desperate populations in the Middle East and North Africa, what could have happened? Because whatever you give attention – and, frankly speaking, money – to, grows. That is why we pushed for a Marshall Plan for the Middle East to invest in democracy, education and human rights, particularly those of women and minorities. Because after years of being plundered by corrupt and authoritarian leaders, institution building and transition are hard but they are very much worth investing in. At some point the EU actually took an opposite turn. The war in Syria and the people it sent adrift towards Europe made for cynical trade-offs in the form of so-called ‘migration management’ – a euphemism for outsourcing the sheltering of people fleeing the worst violence we have seen in a long time, and outsourcing that responsibility to others in exchange for money, to the same kinds of dictators that caused people to flee in the meantime. Looking at Algeria today, it looks like we’ve come full circle. Egypt is still a time bomb and so is Turkey. Libya is a failed state and, as I said, the war in Syria rages on. Unfortunately, and I think this is very damaging, Europe is not a key player to solve that war.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the more so because of the words that have just been spoken. I would also like to thank Commissioner Hahn for his valuable contribution to this debate, just as I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their contribution, which I believe has also enriched our prospects. I am sure, with reference once again to the Commissioner, that he will take into account, in his work on the southern neighbourhood, the comments made in the report and also in this debate. I would also like to mention the role of the FEMM Committee and the rapporteur, Maria Arena, who was not present but presented a very useful opinion, fundamentally enriching our report on the role of women in the processes of building the resilience of societies in this region. Certainly, the current neighbourhood policy, as revisioned in 2015, has had the merit of introducing the concepts of differentiation, which is necessary to take account of the specific realities of each country, and of contitolarity, which puts the EU and partner countries on an egalitarian level from the point of view of identifying priorities, putting an end to policies perceived as falling from above. I would, however, like to stress that, as this report also shows, we believe that this should not necessarily result in a less capacity to influence partner countries. We expressly call, also in the report, for the conditionality criterion to be applied more rigorously and not just for the views of the authorities to be heard. Building real resilience requires, in a stronger way, the point of view of civil society, and I am also happy with the commitment put in place on Syria in this regard, as the Commissioner has mentioned. A civil society that must be the real protagonist for our action, with particular attention to human rights defenders, who risk their lives every day for the rights of vulnerable groups and minorities. I am therefore convinced, in conclusion, that the text we are going to approve tomorrow will be an important legacy of the European Parliament for the new parliamentary term and for the continuation of the European Union's policies in one of the most strategic areas for our external action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 446, "date": "2019-03-26.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   The debate is closed.  The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, March 27, 2019. Written statements (Rule 162) – I believe that this is the right time to take stock of the last five years with regard to EU policies in the Mediterranean. At a time as complex as the present one, almost ten years after the Arab spring, I would like to ask my colleagues: where have we come so far? And most importantly, where are we headed? Unfortunately, and it is clear to everyone, there has been no great progress. Egypt has returned to its starting point with a new military regime that favours stability over human rights. We don't even talk about it in Libya. The only example of a 'successful Arab Spring' remains Tunisia, even though young democracy is under constant attack. In Algeria, we have recently seen the protests of young people against the old ruling class, the desire for change, social mobility and concrete reforms for the country. But the future scenario remains uncertain. It is now up to Europe to play its part: I call for greater coherence but, above all, for a long-term approach that really takes account of the needs of citizens and addresses the root causes of radicalisation, through policies focused on people and young people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}]
