Madam President, Commissioner, we want the voice of the European Parliament to be heard loud at a time when multilateral cooperation for the well-being of people and for the good of the planet, both in the context of actions on climate change and for solidarity and peace, cannot be taken for granted.  It is therefore important to continue the practice of the annual strategy report on the implementation and implementation of the sustainable development objectives and to represent the European Parliament every year in the high-level political forum. Today, the strategy report is all the more timely given that the Commission is preparing the joint synthesis report, which we expect shortly, on the European Union's support for developing countries in the implementation of the 2030 agenda, with the contribution of the Member States of the European Union as well. We are convinced that a truly multi-level governance approach with active involvement of the public, civil society and the private sector is needed on a broad basis for the effective implementation of sustainable development objectives. Close monitoring, proportionate accountability and effective review mechanisms assessing progress made are essential for improving national strategies and effectively implementing targets at all levels.  Our report aims to contribute to the preparation of the European Union for a comprehensive European Union 2030 strategy, to implement the sustainable development objectives and to improve their integration into the policies and governance mechanisms of the European Union; a strategy based on education, specialisation of professionals and the creation of basic infrastructures. Such a large-scale European policy for sustainable development must be based on an analysis of political deficits and an assessment of the distance to the objectives. It should define clear and distinct objectives, indicators and actions needed to improve political coordination and cohesion policy for sustainable development at European level. To this end, we call on the Commission to carry out an in-depth analysis of the inequality and inadequacy of existing policies in order to identify critical areas in terms of synergies and inconsistencies. Commissioner, we would basically like to know what your plans are to be implemented by 2030, in terms of policies and legislation, statistics and analytical data collection, governance and best practices, with a view to implementing an integrated strategy for the success of agenda 2030 or possible before the end of 2019. The fact that many Member States and partner States beyond the European Union have made considerable efforts to design mechanisms and strategies for the successful implementation of the sustainable development objectives and its integration into their policies and governance is a very, very positive step. However, we need to make further improvements at European Union level and it is also very important to encourage and support third countries to follow similar practices. I would like to conclude my speech by saying that the European Union must be a world leader in the implementation of agenda 2030 and sustainable development objectives in cooperation with its Member States. Our goal must always be constant: the conquest of sustainable development and the wider prosperity of all without discrimination, without queues without being left behind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-03-14.json", "name": "Francisco de Paula GAMBUS MILLET", "mepid": "125006", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, Mr Vice-President, first of all, let me thank the co-rapporteur, Mrs Theocharous and the shadow rapporteurs of the Committees on Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for the ease and understanding they have made it possible for us to reach agreement on an issue which challenges all of us, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. Yesterday we discussed climate change and climate action is one of the objectives to be reviewed this summer at the high-level political forum organized by the United Nations.  The new generations of Europeans are demanding concrete action from us, and our responsibility is to respond to them and we must be clear. We have to explain what we've done so far. We must explain the European success of COP 21, the first international treaty to become environmentally neutral. We must explain that during this mandate, under the Juncker Commission — and with Commissioner Arias Cañete at the helm, both of the European People's Party, both of my political group - and with the ambition of this house, we have made more progress than ever in the fight against climate change. We have approved the circular economy package. We have reviewed the energy package and the renewable energy update. We have revised the Common Electricity Regulation, including for the first time energy poverty in that Regulation. We have renewed the European emissions market. We have approved the Regulation on National Limits. The Commission has just sent us new implementing acts and delegated acts on ecodesign, of which we have also produced a report. We've presented a clean air package. We have approved a single-use plastics directive. In short, we have laid the seed of the Union's economic transformation. We have sown the European industrial revolution of the 21st century.  And we can't fool people. Nature cannot change it from night to day, even if this is difficult to assume in the age of immediacy. Climate change is not mitigated by hanging the photo of a demonstration on Instagram, although we would like it to be so. We must act by being aware of what we can assume and periodically review our progress in research and development, to update our goals and become more and more ambitious. Otherwise, if our industry is relocated, we will not be sustainable in any way, environmentally, socially, or economically. That is why we must see the sustainable development goals as an opportunity. We must be ambitious; yes, but with his feet on the ground. We must seize the opportunity presented to us to renew jobs, to end inequalities within the Union, to establish fair wages that allow workers to maintain a dignified life and progress, as Leo XIII said.  We must use sustainable development goals to reinvent ourselves, not to create more structures. We're wrong if we think that by putting a SDO policeman in every general direction or creating a team, we'll be able to transform it. This is not more structures, but a change of mindset; to improve wealth redistribution instruments; to deepen and strengthen the social market economy that we have integrated into the Union, creating jobs that coerfie and with companies and industries that are based in Europe, not relocated; to create high-value-added jobs and transform our economy so as not to be anchored in the past.

This comprehensive and detailed report strongly encourages the EU to lead the implementation of the 2030 agenda and ensure that SDGs guide EU action for the years to come. The report is timely. The European Parliament elections are around the corner. The preparation of the EU’s strategic agenda for 2019-2024 and the institutional priority setting for the next EU policy cycle are on the horizon. The EU has fully committed itself to delivering on the SDGs and it is time to decide how we implement these global goals during the next EU policy cycle so that we can live up to our commitments.  The Commission published the Reflection Paper Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030 to inspire this debate. We put on the table three indicative scenarios to lead the discussion on how the implementation of the SDGs in Europe could best be achieved and what the most effective division of roles would be between the EU level and the Member States when moving forward. Let me underline that these three scenarios all rely on a shared premise in the Commission that we need enhanced commitment in Europe if we are to secure a sustainable future and achieve the SDGs by 2030 and beyond.  We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution. The question is whether we are a victim of change or whether we will embrace and guide it. It starts by diagnosing the situation and facing up to the reality, and undeniability of the facts. I want to be very clear. These facts should not instil in us worry and fear, but inspire us to act with expedience and determination. The core sustainability challenge for Europe, as well as for other most developed parts of the world, is to find the way to increase our prosperity and to improve our wellbeing without destroying our natural habitat and exceeding the boundaries of our planet. We only have one planet. In order to address this challenge, we must move quickly from a linear to a circular economy. We have to put our food system onto a fully sustainable path and we have to green our energy, mobility and built environment. To do this, we also have to gear all our key enabling policies and tools towards the SDGs. These include education, science, research, innovation, digitisation. They also include finance, taxation, pricing and responsible business conduct, new business models. And our trade policy as well, obviously. Any transition must be socially fair and leave no one behind. There is no sustainability without social sustainability and being who we are in Europe all our actions need to fully respect the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, as well as inclusiveness, facts, evidence.  Let us now move forward with confidence and optimism, for Europe is the best place in the world to lead the way to sustainability transition. We have it all. We have the skills, we have the brains, we have the people, we are the best connected continent and sustainability is deeply rooted in the European project. In the months ahead, we need to reach an agreement on what and how should be done specifically at the EU level in the next EU policy cycle.  The European Parliament’s report clearly favours the first scenario presented in the Commission’s Reflection Paper which proposes an overarching SDG strategy to guide all actions of the EU and its Member States. The Member States too will have to make up their mind. This will help the next Commission plotting a clear course for the development of a comprehensive EU SDG implementation strategy, a strategy that the European Council has called for. I said earlier this week in the informal General Affairs Council that, in both the way we should organise the Commission and our work, the SDGs could be a perfect framework for how we distribute the work and how we make sure that we take the right steps towards a sustainable future for Europe.  The collective contribution conclusion of the SDG high-level multitask platform, ranging from birdlife to business Europe, has made very clear that our people are expecting ambitious action from the EU and its Member States. I want to end by saying, let’s not turn this into a left–right issue. This is an issue that is important to the full political spectrum in this House, and that’s how I’ve always felt the support of this House for the SDGs and this is the way forward. I strongly believe in that.

It is not just a question of saving the planet, but also of creating quality and quantity of jobs, because the two must be together.  Since we were in New York for the adoption of the Sustainable Development Agenda, we have been calling – and we are also calling in today's report – for a European strategy for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals to finally be put in place, with a coordination mechanism between the Member States and with proper monitoring of the achievement of these objectives.

Youths and students are getting mobilised, but this is not only about the younger generation, this is not just about the future, this is about all of us, it is about now. A UN report stated that temperatures are set to rise by at least 1.5° by 2030 if the world does not take drastic measures. An increase of 1.5° in temperature can result in an increase in the sea level of 3.45 m. Just ask yourselves what it means for coastal areas, for people and islands like mine that live next to the sea, for low—lying countries. This is the challenge that we are facing today and we are at a time where we are speaking about industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution. We are told it is about digitisation and it is about automation. I tend to differ. It has to also be about ecological economies and about sustainable development and this is the moment for an economic paradigm shift. Being sustainable in everything we do does not jam our economies, it will give our economies a chance to thrive and grow. What will jam our economies is the traditional model of doing things where sustainable development is not a priority. Change requires ambition, ambition requires aspiration, an aspiration that we want to do better, to move to the next level in everything we do, to ensure a future for our children and our economies.  This positive transformation has to start from our countries but needs to find momentum at an EU level. It is about ensuring health, eradicating poverty, providing quality jobs and guaranteeing food security. The Sustainable Development Goals address precisely this. It is about ensuring a climate—proof, environment—proof, social—proof and economic—proof future. The discussions have started and the momentum is there.

I think we have a huge opportunity to do exactly what Mr Caputo has just said, to organise this paradigm change. I sensed also, when I spoke to the ministers in the General Affairs Council earlier this week, that in the Member States things are shifting as well in this direction. So, I think after the European election this Parliament with the new Commission could have a huge opportunity to frame the activities of the next five years using the Strategic Development Goals (SDGs). I think we have this opportunity now and I think there is growing consensus also in Member States to do that. That would be my first remark.  My second remark is this: those who, in general terms, deny climate change – you even have people who deny all the scientific evidence – those who want to say that if you want to have a sustainable society we all will have to live in caves munching on grass, should understand that this project fear is not going to fly, because there is a way, if we are consistent and if we move quickly, to have high levels of well-being and still not use the planet as though we have two more planets waiting for us. There is a way to do that. But the issue is, the longer you wait, the more difficult it’s going to be and I believe the only way we can get our societies to embrace the idea is to put social sustainability front and centre. There, I fully agree with Mr Marias when he says you have to make sure you can convince the people there is a sustainable future for them in this, with a decent job, with decent salaries, with decent social protection. If they have the feeling that they’re going to be the ones living in caves munching on grass, they will stop. They will not give the political support we need to go in that direction. So I think we need to put this front and centre. To Mr Gerbrandy, I would say, well, Sir, if you think that’s the fact, what this Commission has done is because of your tenacity I grant you that with pleasure. But I have to say the way Ms Ska Keller recently said somewhere that better regulation has led to lowering of standards, I think better regulation has given us the possibility to have the European’s view, for instance on the nature directives. We could not have protected the nature directives if we did not have this public consultation, which said very clearly that the vast, vast majority of Europeans want the nature directives to protect nature. So, in that sense, better regulation helped and it helped us to move with lightning speed on the plastic strategy, which is unique in the world and Mr Gerbrandy knows this very well. It also helped us move with lightning speed on the first steps of the circular economy, which is something also Commissioner Jyrki Katainen has done a lot of work on and which is very good for our collective future. So, you know, all the fears we had at the beginning that this would lead to lower ambitions and a lowering of standards, this did not happen. This is not what this Commission did. I think we really moved forward.  Finally, one remark on cultural sustainability. Isn’t it ironic, isn’t it ironic that the political movements who do everything to cut cultural subsidies and say this is for the elite, are the same movements who are pleading for us to safeguard our culture and foster our culture. For me, culture is not an exclusive thing. For me, culture is not a weapon to exclude other people. For me, culture is the way to develop pride in who we are and curiosity in who we are not, and curiosity is the way forward for our development. Without curiosity, without critical thinking, we will not be able to go forward and those who want to make us prisoner of a culture in fear of other cultures will kill curiosity, will kill creativity and will not help us move forward.

I hope that the debate we have had here and the vote we will have this noon will help us to encourage and renew efforts to achieve a broadcast-neutral society as soon as possible. But for Europe to be broadcast neutral, if we do not get other key players to accompany us, it will be of little use. The Union is prepared to lead — and indeed leads — the process of achieving the Objectives set out in the 2030 Agenda, but as in the fable of the turtle and the hare 'not because we are the fastest we will reach the goal first'. Let us keep the path, do not fall asleep and achieve the objectives we have set ourselves. That is why, as Commissioner Arias Cañete said yesterday, Parliament and the Commission emerging from the next elections will be key to this — you said this today, Mr Timmermans. They will be responsible for the 2021-2027 financial framework. They will be responsible for such important revisions as the Water Framework Directive linked to Agenda 2030 Objective 6. But it is not just the work of the Commission, nor just the work of the European Parliament. We must ensure multi-level collaboration and governance because the skills we have in Europe are limited. We must organize dialogues and have the participation of the local, regional, state and European levels to, together with the common foreign policy, lead the achievement of these Objectives. We must preserve the Union, ensure its diversity, listen to all voices, however small, so that we all felt part of this Union.  The Sustainable Development Goals are the key to broadening the sense of belonging to this european peace project and to leave behind the usual commentary on \"what do you do in Europe\" to move on to 'what we have done in Europe'.

Let’s take the Netherlands, for example, which developed when its citizens became freer to trade in the 17th century; and my own country, Sweden, started 100 years of growth in the 1870s when we opened up for trade. And growth miracles are not just a thing of the past: in Korea and, right now, China, they would not have happened if those countries had integrated into the world economy, and that is actually what is the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) is all about. I would call it the crown jewel of European trade policy because it tries to link poor countries into the world economy and lift them out of poverty. Many countries in the world have GSP programmes, but I believe that we in the European Union should be extra proud of our programme. It’s a very generous programme, in its terms, giving value and meaningful tariff cuts to the beneficiaries. It’s also extra generous to the poorest countries of the world that get duty-free, quota-free access to the European markets for everything but arms. The best part of GSP, though, is the GSP+, which grants additional preferences to those countries that strive a little more and try to behave better by implementing, ratifying and making a reality of 27 international conventions on everything from governance to environment and labour rights. It is a tool to extra-incentivise countries, to make sure that they grow and develop in a way that is sustainable and from which all their citizens can benefit. It’s a way to make sure that good governance is respected. We are now reaching the mid term of this programme and we are starting to see what can and should be improved, and this report reflects that. Firstly, it needs to become easier for beneficiary countries to source inputs from other countries, and that will require changing rules of origin to get away from the ‘spaghetti bowl’ effect. This programme is about making it easier for countries to integrate into global value chains, not more difficult – as can sometimes be the effect of the current rules of origin. Secondly, we should continually improve monitoring on the ground, and here everybody can help – civil society, the International Labour Organisation, relevant UN bodies, the Commission, Member States, embassies and others. Thirdly, we should consider introducing services into the GSP, so that countries can diversify into those areas as well. There is a precedent for this with the Least-Developed Countries (LDC) Services Waiver. This report represents the priorities for the programme – indicating how it should be even more development orientated – but there are voices which threaten that. The first such voices, I would say, are those seeking to place too many requirements on beneficiary countries. If we place too many requirements – on, for example, labour rights or environmental protection – on these countries they could risk facing the entire EU tariff wall, and that would harm the poorest. These countries are not Norway: if they were Norway they wouldn’t need this tool. After all, it’s better to be less poor and oppressed than being even poorer and more oppressed. The second type of voice is a classic example of protectionism: of the fact that we are afraid of imports from poorer countries. And, sadly, I think the Commission’s decision to impose safeguard duties on rice from Cambodia and Myanmar is a step in that direction. This report does not reflect any of those fears and I sincerely hope that the next Parliament will deal with the next GSP programme without listening to the voices who threaten trade for development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2019-03-14.json", "name": "Christofer FJELLNER", "mepid": "28126", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first thank the European Parliament, the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the rapporteur, Mr Christofer Fjellner, and all the shadow rapporteurs for the attention, work and time that you have invested into this report on the implementation of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Regulation. It is a welcome initiative, as it comes at a moment when we are assessing the impact and effectiveness of the current GSP Regulation and what possible improvements we can bring to a successor GSP scheme.  The EU has had the GSP scheme since 1971. The primary objective, as set out in the WTO Enabling Clause, has always been to assist vulnerable developing countries in their efforts to reduce poverty and integrate into the world economy. The European Union’s GSP has undergone several transformations over the decades. A major reform of the GSP took place in 2012, with three main objectives: first, to contribute to poverty eradication by expanding exports from the countries most in need. This was done by substantially reducing the number of beneficiaries and focusing GSP preferences on the most vulnerable economies. Secondly, to promote sustainable development and good governance. We increased the attractiveness of GSP+ and enhanced the GSP+ monitoring of effective implementation of core international conventions related to human rights, labour rights, protection of the environment and good governance. Thirdly, to better protect the EU’s financial and economic interests. In this respect, the safeguard mechanism was overhauled to make it more accessible to EU industry. We are now five years into the implementation of the GSP Regulation and I am pleased to note that overall, the European Parliament and the Commission share the assessment that the GSP Regulation is successful in meeting its objectives. Exports from the more vulnerable economies have expanded substantially, which can contribute to poverty eradication. GSP, and in particular GSP+, is also contributing positively to furthering human and labour rights in beneficiary countries. We agree with your view that trade policy, including GSP, must also be part of EU efforts to fight for values enshrined in the EU treaties, such as democracy, rule of law and human rights. Trade policy does not and cannot do this on its own or in isolation. We take great care to ensure coherence between all EU external policies. For example, we ensure that GSP+ dialogues and bilateral human rights dialogues with beneficiary countries reinforce each other, thus increasing the EU’s leverage to push for progress. As the Commission’s biannual reports on GSP+ implementation attest, we are seeing progress in all beneficiary countries. However, many problematic issues remain and we will continue to engage closely and firmly with beneficiary countries.  I would like to touch on an issue that is very important to us, namely, transparency in trade policy. In the implementation of the GSP Regulation, we make considerable efforts to ensure a transparent and inclusive process. We consult civil society in the European Union and in beneficiary countries on a very regular basis and we are always open to their input, which we greatly value. We do not always share their views on what course of action should be taken at a specific point in time, but this should not be taken to mean that we do not listen to civil society. Let me be very clear: the Commission will not hesitate to take its responsibilities when it comes to warranted cases of serious and systematic violation of fundamental rights. Our actions in relation to Cambodia and Myanmar clearly demonstrate this. In this respect, I agree with you that withdrawing GSP must be a last-resort measure.  We must now start work on the new GSP scheme that will take effect when the current one expires on 31 December 2023. As we have seen in the mid—term evaluation of the GSP Regulation, it is working well overall and this should be the starting point. Your report and resolution contains several proposals that we will examine carefully. The next immediate step in this process is to launch an impact assessment to help guide our work on a new GSP Regulation. This will include a wide-ranging public consultation. We count on working closely with you on this important endeavour.

Abolishing tariffs in these countries in exchange for promoting the protection of human, labour and environmental rights, as well as good governance, has undoubtedly encouraged better employment and enabled us to combat the scourge of child exploitation and corruption and help combat poverty. But progress is still not enough and unfortunately we are seeing serious setbacks in some countries. Reform is therefore essential and I welcome the re-action that it will be receptive to the proposals that are incorporated in this report.

It is also necessary to establish due diligence and transparency obligations for our companies because we cannot allow it to occur in other less advanced countries – taking advantage of the lower labour and environmental protections – and then these products are sold in our countries at a zero tariff.

But this kind of preferential access should not be taken for granted. It is attached to clear conditions, for example when it comes to improving democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and following the increasingly repressive behaviour of Cambodian leader Hun Sen, Commissioner Malmström initiated a procedure to temporarily withdraw Cambodia’s trade preferences, under the Everything but Arms scheme, and this is a very welcome move, that should be echoed by all Member States’ Commissioners, as well as the High Representative in all their dealings with Cambodia.

I believe that a black and white approach of withdrawing tariff preferences from a whole country also has not proved effective. We have examples such as Myanmar and Cambodia and I think the options have to be increased. I believe that instead of a whole economy, the EU should be able to target certain economic sectors with GSP instruments. Moreover, it should be able to use targeted sanctions against companies that breach human rights or other obligations.

I see two main trends in this debate. First, we have those who say we are not seeing the kind of development we want. I urge them – those who claim that we have stagnation, that we don’t have development of poor countries – actually to read the statistics. The fact of the matter is that we’ve never, ever in the history of mankind, had so few people in absolute poverty And there is no causal link to aid, should anybody look for that. The only causal link we can find is with integration into the world economy and, to some extent, with governance. Both of these are things we are addressing with precisely this tool. The second area, on which we have had long discussions, time and time again, in the committee, is the question of what we do with those that don’t behave. There are people here who give the impression that we don’t do anything, but that’s not true. First of all, Sri Lanka is one example of the fact that that you do actually lose your preference if you don’t behave, and what we now are doing with Myanmar is also a proof of that. However, we have to remember one thing: when countries are kicked out of the system, the system doesn’t deliver anymore. This is, to some extent, a question about what we see and what we don’t see. We see, in the history books, things that happen, but we never see things that do not happen – as the result of dialogue, of pressure or of this tool. I would claim that we’ve improved livelihoods, and the situation in terms of observance of human rights, for millions throughout this world by stopping things from happening, because people want to stay in the system. If we kick people out too quickly we lose that possibility. Therefore, I urge my colleagues, let’s be tough, let’s strengthen monitoring, but let’s not punish those already oppressed by making them poorer and kicking them out before we’ve used every trick in this regulation to pressure those governments that are behaving badly into behaving better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2019-03-14.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  The debate is closed.

These actions amount to a breach of all fundamental rights of assembly and expression. Freedom of religion is also vigorously repressed, as is demonstrated by the ongoing persecution of Christians, Baha’is and other minorities. In recent months, we have seen an intensification of the systematic campaign of house-church raids as Christians are arrested, and often violently interrogated, merely for the fact of peacefully exercising their religious beliefs. Several hundred Christians have been detained in recent months alone. Women’s rights are also severely curtailed in Iran, with even the most limited forms of dissent still being punished. In 2018, 39 women were arrested for protesting against the mandatory wearing of the hijab. Executions in the country continue to remain extremely high, with a figure standing at 273 for 2018.

On the occasion, High Representative Federica Mogherini, published a declaration on behalf of the European Union, in which she emphasised that support for human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, is at the core of the EU external human rights policy, and one of its major priorities. A few days later, this commitment was underlined by Honourable Members of the European Parliament during a debate on the Iranian human rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh, who just a few days earlier, at the time, was convicted and sentenced in connection with her work to promote universally recognised rights. Our deep concern at her conviction was expressed immediately in a statement.  Our commitment to support human rights defenders is there 365 days, throughout the year, and not only on 10 December. Indeed, as part of our diplomacy, we closely follow the human rights situation in countries around the world, including Iran. A cardinal aspect of this task is working to support the work of human rights defenders and ensure, as far as possible, that they are not subjected to harassment or detention.  With respect to Iran, this extends to closely following the situation of Ms Sotoudeh and other individuals, including, for example, the group of eight environmentalists who were detained in January last year and who are facing extremely serious charges. In Iran and in other countries, human rights defenders, including human rights lawyers, do invaluable work. This includes providing legal representation to members of vulnerable groups, representing juvenile offenders facing the death penalty, working to protect women or members of ethnic and religious minorities. All too often, however, this work is met with repression or convictions and imprisonment on security-related charges. This is inconsistent with the Universal Declaration and with the International Covenant on civil and political rights, which Iran ratified in 1975 and which commits Iran to ensure that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrests or detention, no one shall be deprived of his liberty, except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established by law.  As clearly reflected in the latest conclusions on Iran, adopted by the Council on 4 February, while we are committed to the full and effective implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action, the European Union policy on Iran is based on a balanced and comprehensive approach, critical when there are these divergences and cooperative in case of shared interests. In line with this approach, the European Union has repeatedly called on Iran to provide human rights defenders with an open, stable environment in which to conduct their work. The European Union has also consistently raised individual human rights cases with the Iranian authorities at all levels, including in the framework of the EU–Iran a high-level dialogue.  We are strong supporters of the mandate of the UN special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Iran and encourage the Iranian authorities to grant him access to the country.  Finally, our Member States have also raised the case during their own bilateral contacts with the Iranian authorities. We strongly believe that these efforts have contributed to certain positive developments that we have noted in recent years, including the decision to amend Iran’s anti-narcotics legislation in November 2017, which has resulted in a dramatic reduction in drug-related executions and which, in itself, is a positive step forward in human rights. We are continuing to advocate for further improvements in this regard, including an immediate moratorium on the execution of juvenile offenders. We continue to call for the release of all Iranian human rights defenders. Those who are detained should be afforded timely access to a lawyer of their own choosing, be allowed to communicate with their family members, have access to adequate medical care and not be subject to any form of mistreatment.  We are encouraged by the attention paid to this issue by Members of the European Parliament and we will continue our effort to work together with you in order to promote a better environment for human rights defenders across the world, including in Iran.

CICIG has played a vital role in supporting Guatemalan legal and judicial institutions that are crucial to upholding the rule of law and to ensuring the legal and physical safety of human rights defenders, including Sakharov finalist Lolita Chávez.  It is deeply concerning that the Guatemalan Government is showing contempt for its own people by colluding in acts of intimidation. We are also convinced that changes proposed to the national reconciliation law pose a significant threat to the rule of law in Guatemala, and would drastically undermine the important progress achieved by CICIG.  We urge the Commission to swiftly disburse the EUR 5 million already earmarked for CICIG and stand ready for further support.

The European Union and Guatemala have a solid bilateral relationship based on mutual commitment and trust. That is precisely why it is important to say that we are concerned by the weakening of the rule of law materialised by the recent attacks on the fight against corruption, notably the decision by the Government to terminate the activity of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and also by recent parliamentary initiatives that could reduce the democratic space as well as generate impunity for crimes against humanity committed during the civil war. The European Union has been a staunch supporter of the CICIG both financially and politically. Over the last ten years, the European Union has provided EUR 22 million to the anti—corruption UN body. For 2019, the last year of the current mandate and in very difficult conditions, our contribution amounts to EUR 5 million. Achievements in the fight against corruption and impunity have been impressive, also contributing to the reduction of criminality in Guatemala. Despite constant attacks, CICIG is very popular, admired and respected in Guatemala as the people know that corruption severely undermines the institutions, the rule of law and ultimately the country’s democracy. So let me repeat this: the European Union stands by Guatemala; the European Union stands by its commitment to the fight against corruption; the European Union stands by CICIG. We do of course continue to support all efforts against corruption by the Guatemalan judicial institutions. They play a crucial role in the fight against impunity. The separation of powers and respect for judicial rulings is paramount as it is a cornerstone of the rule of law. The overall security situation in Guatemala has recently improved. However, ensuring the protection of human rights defenders and other activists and avoiding any further deaths and attacks is urgent and essential. Human rights defenders paid a heavy toll last year with a doubling in the number of casualties according to human rights organisations. People from vulnerable groups, such as indigenous community leaders, environmentalists or LGBTIs, have been particularly targeted.  Finally, and while fully respecting the country’s democratic process, we want to express our concerns about two bills currently being discussed in Guatemala’s Parliament, as Mr Ignazio Corrao rightly pointed out. The first would reduce the space for civil society organisations by restricting their conditions for registration and operation, and undermining the democratic role played by a free and open civil society. The second draft bill would reform the national reconciliation law adopted after the Civil War and give absolute impunity for crimes against humanity. Yesterday our EU delegation in Guatemala, along with Embassies of the European Union Member States present in the country and together with the US and Canada, spoke out publicly against that bill. I’m glad to see that yesterday, Congress did not find a quorum to discuss that project for an amnesty, but we must remain vigilant as it is not totally off the table.  The country will have elections later this year in June and we have the highest respect for the electoral period Guatemala is entering. Elections are an important moment, where the people unite to debate, compare visions and ultimately elect their leadership. They should be used to enhance democracy and the rule of law and not to put in question the basic tenets or all the hard-gained advances over the last decades.

These landmark agreements are not only an expression of the common values of Canada and the European Union, but have also led to cooperation in a wide range of areas and to numerous joint initiatives to promote multilateral cooperation, peace, democracy and the rule of law. Your presence in this House also symbolises the deepening of interparliamentary relations between our parliaments, which has already been expressed in a joint declaration in 2017.

By inviting the European Union authorities to stimulate research, these studies will serve to justify government interference, to justify the medding of governments and the European Union on the internet. Whoever pays simply requires it. Subsidising infrastructure will give the Union an excuse to issue injunctions and bans in the interests of protecting the infrastructure it is building for its own money.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recent scientific studies show us that fish are sentient animals: they have a complex nature and a rich sensory world and can experience emotions, but not only that, they also have important cognitive abilities. Unfortunately, however, perhaps precisely because of their complexity and mysteriousness, fish have always been underestimated, even often ignored and excluded from the protection guaranteed to other categories of animals.  Fish are also the most exploited and widely used type of animal. To give an idea of the phenomenon, it is estimated that 111 billion fish are caught and 1.7 billion fish are reared in aquaculture. These figures relate only to the European Union. Personally, I find it almost difficult to assimilate and rationalise the size of these figures. In the light of all this, we have a strong responsibility towards them, the same responsibility that we have towards other animals.  However, the legislation on fish welfare is minimal, and we are a long way from implementing the necessary measures to ensure compliance with international and European animal welfare standards. This is confirmed by efsa's many opinions (scientific advice that our Agency has drawn up), the repeated evidence of the inadequacy of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the transport of live animals and Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 on the protection of animals during slaughter, and also a study by the European Commission itself carried out last year.  In view of the above, the Commission's non-action can no longer be justified. We need objective, science-based standards, we need high European standards. The possibility of setting minimum requirements through voluntary measures at Member State level and on the initiative of the industry itself has so far led to very little progress, and what little has been done at times is also disappointing.  On the basis of these considerations, we therefore call on the European Commission to introduce uniform standards on the animal welfare of fish and to ensure that European regulations are actually complied with and implemented.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2019-03-14.json", "name": "Eleonora EVI", "mepid": "124779", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, fish are sentient beings indeed. It is true that they are quite different from other farm species, but they are also able to suffer and feel pain. That is our starting point for this discussion. I understand that there is a growing concern for the welfare of farmed fish in the European Union. In recent years, to meet an increasing consumer demand, fish farming has intensified for some species in Europe. As the production process is intensified, it has the potential to generate new issues relating to animal welfare, notwithstanding the fact that the public also wants healthy and ethically-produced food.  In this context, you wonder why the Commission has not yet proposed specific pieces of legislation on the welfare of farmed fish. Firstly, I should clarify that the European Union animal welfare legislation already covers farmed fish at different stages of production — farming, transport and slaughter.  Secondly, I want to assure you that the Commission takes the welfare of farmed fish seriously. Let me outline some of the steps we have taken, particularly under the current Commission’s mandate to promote farmed fish welfare. Based on the 2012 EU strategy for the protection and welfare of animals, the Commission mandated a comprehensive study on the welfare of fish during transport and at the time of slaughter. The study was published in November 2017 and led to today’s oral question.  The study concluded that in the countries analysed, the transport of fish was in line with the international standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and as you know, the OIE is the international standard-setting organisation for animal welfare. The study also acknowledged that there was room for improvement when it comes to the slaughter of certain fish species.  In March 2018, based on this study, the Commission adopted a report on the possibility of introducing certain requirements regarding the protection of fish at the time of killing. The 2018 report concludes that, at this stage, it is not appropriate to propose specific requirements on the welfare of fish at the time of killing. The report indeed considers that improving the welfare of farmed fish could be more easily achieved by voluntary measures.  This conclusion is reached on the basis of the consideration that in recent years the industry has introduced improvements in this regard. We are moving in the right direction. In particular, I would like to highlight a number of important points which we should keep in mind when debating the issue. Firstly, EU aquaculture is relatively new compared to other animal products and systems. Technology to improve the welfare of farmed fish is still developing.  Secondly, the sector is a very diverse. The main farmed species — salmon, trout, carp, sea bass and sea bream — are biologically very different. Each species requires important effort in research and development.  Thirdly, furthermore the sector differs in size and geographical coverage, with a variety of practices across Member States. In this context, having a harmonised approach might be more complex than it appears. In light of these considerations, I think that Member States might be more suited to developing good practices in their national context. Nevertheless, the Commission continues to work on the welfare of farmed fish. Allow me to give you some practical examples of these efforts.  In 2018, the issue of fish welfare was put on the agenda of the two meetings of the EU animal welfare platform, which gather all key EU stakeholders related to animal welfare.

It is disappointing that, in the European Union, we still do not have a mechanism to protect fish welfare in a coherent way throughout all the Member States. At the same time, we have good practices that may serve the Commission’s efforts in identifying improvements. Europe is still a place where numerous compromising aquaculture practices take place – handling, transport, genetic manipulation, predation, stress provocation and inhuman slaughter. At the same time, I believe that EU consumers have the right to be guaranteed that the fish reaching their tables is the product of high-quality aquaculture. I sincerely hope that the Commission is going to close the knowledge gaps related to fish welfare, organise a consultation with stakeholders and develop a reliable road map. In the light of developing techniques of fish breeding, regulations adopted in 2005 and 2009 can no longer guarantee a high level of fish welfare, and I join the signatories of this oral question in asking for EU-wide legislative requirements in aquaculture. Guaranteeing fish welfare implies certain challenges and requires flexibility. Some practices that result in positive welfare for one type of fish may negatively affect other species. That is why we cannot expect to improve welfare for aquaculture species with prescriptive standards. We must apply different criteria to small farmers and to huge aquaculture companies. For example, small producers observe fish better and are much more attentive to signs of stress. Negligence towards stress of fish can lead to outbreaks of disease and serious losses. Per capita, the yearly consumption of fish in Europe is 27 kg, and this predicted to increase.

They are crammed into poor quality water, they contract diseases and are infected with parasites, they lack oxygen, they are treated with drugs and hormones, they are stressed and manipulated. In these confined spaces, they injure themselves and assault each other. These prisons do not allow them to behave normally.

Furthermore, nine out of ten people believe that culling in the absence of pain is an essential aspect of fish welfare, and so these seem to me to be unequivocal data that the Commission can no longer ignore.  Secondly, there are other things that should not be ignored: there are public health considerations. Animals that are kept unsatisfactory in overcrowded facilities are stressed animals, which get sick more easily, and all this leads to greater use of chemicals, antibiotics, to deal with and contain outbreaks of diseases.  Thirdly, the lack of animal welfare standards also has several environmental consequences. I am thinking, for example, of algal blooms, the creation of so-called dead zones, real dead areas near aquaculture sites, with possible effects on natural fish resources and biodiversity.

Mr President, thank you for speaking. At the initiative of my party, the netherlands started the creation of an animal police in the Netherlands in 2010. The animal police act against people who neglect and abuse animals, and also try to prevent animal cruelty. Penalties for animal cruelty, poaching and similar offences and crimes have also increased in recent years. In addition, a special telephone number, called \"1 4 4\", has been opened to report animal cruelty. The people behind this hotline ensure that the report reaches the right authority. In total, several hundred officers are active in combating animal cruelty. After a few years, it has been shown that the number of reports of animal cruelty has increased, and that more and more offenders are being dealt with. In short, a good thing. The authors of the questions to the European Commission therefore rightly indicate that there are examples of effective animal welfare policy in several Member States. As I have just said, the Netherlands is on the right track in this respect. Of course, improvements are always possible. But the basics are. It does not happen very often, but I have to pay tribute to the Commission here. It seems that we have finally seen the light and the realisation that not everything has to be arranged in Brussels or here in Strasbourg. And that, Mr President, is exactly how it should go. The Dutch voter determines what the policy on animal welfare should be. It is a competence of the national parliaments and the European Union should not interfere in this at all. National parliaments are very capable of regulating this themselves. Of course, countries can share excellent, good ideas and practices among themselves. They don't need the EU for that.

Due to productivity, intensive aquaculture models that use antibiotics and hormones that stress fish are promoted. Fish slaughter is quickly done to obtain benefits and these benefits are often concentrated in a few hands, unlike extensive aquaculture, Commissioner, which is shellfish harvesting or small-scale aquaculture facilities, which also give a lot of work. Between the two models, I also believe that the Commission should, in future European funds, in the future European Maritime Fisheries Fund, fight for the animal welfare of fish, but also protect another model of extensive aquaculture alternative to this stressful model, to this model that uses antibiotics, to this model that makes this type of fish slaughter and that causes questions like these.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 174, "date": "2019-03-14.json", "name": "Anja HAZEKAMP", "mepid": "125023", "text": "   – Mr President, fish have awareness and feeling.

The goal here is to find sustainable and coherent solutions to the issues facing EU aquaculture today, including those relating to the environment, animal health, the use of antibiotics and animal welfare.  I agree wholeheartedly that animal welfare is one issue that has to be integrated into the long-term strategy of the EU aquaculture sector. Next year we should have the results of the evaluation of the EU animal welfare strategy. This will outline the starting point of future initiatives on animal welfare, including for farmed fish.  Let me finish by assuring you that the Commission will maintain a high interest in the welfare of fish and will persist in encouraging stakeholders to work together for further improvements.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are opening this debate on the situation of European citizens of African origin by taking this opportunity to shine a spotlight on the specific form of social exclusion they face. In this presentation, it is my duty to explain to the Presidency of this House, to the members of the Commission, who are the addressees of the question, to the Members present and to the citizens, the whole meaning of the question itself and the way in which the subject should be included in our future parliamentary work. In this respect, Mr President, I would like to stress the good climate that prevailed in the LIBE Committee when it came to agreeing on the final version of the resolution to be adopted in plenary at the next part-session. Thanks to the effective and competent mediation of Claude Moraes, we broadly supported the content of the resolution, with the convincing participation, in particular, of the ALDE, GUE, Verts/ALE and PPE Groups. Of course, there was no shortage of controversy. The official recognition of the specific history of afro-descendants, the possibility of establishing reparations, the issue of public apology, but also the issue of the return of artistic goods to African countries, once plundered by the colonising European nations, and the issue of the declassification of the colonial archives deserve the establishment of a european Commission unit that deals specifically with these issues and the promotion of full citizenship of African-descendant Europeans. These were, broadly, the issues that animated our debate in committee, and we can be quite satisfied with the final version of the resolution, which is the result of serious and competent mediation. We now need to return for a moment to the general importance of this issue, in order to reaffirm some of the principles that led us to its treatment. The equal social integration of European citizens of African descent must, in my view, be seen in the context of the need to respect fundamental human rights. It is a question, on the whole, of guaranteeing the bearers of diversity the integrity of human dignity of which they are indisputable holders. These statements, which start from the elementary levels of our political reflection, are motivated by the fact that in today's Europe, despite centuries of theorization of rationality and social evolution, there are still disvalues, which undermine the lives of Afro-descendants. It is often said in half, because this seems unthinkable: yet, a specific research by the European Agency for Fundamental Rights has given us evidence of the existence, within European society, of recursive phenomena of anti-black racism. Moreover, in several Member States, daily news is often dominated by incidents of racism and xenophobia, which affect African-descendants of Europe indifferently and tend to push them to the margins of society. The extent of the phenomenon is such that no social sector can be considered immune. The rights to housing, the right to access decent work and the right to education are particularly violated. In some European countries, we have even seen the attempted return of apartheid, with the discriminatory exclusion of Afro-descendant children from school canteens, as well as the attempt to establish separate classes for them. When I was reporting on the disputes in the Committee on Civil Rights, Human Rights, Common Security and Consumer Policy, I referred to the issue of historical relations between European countries, which are now members of the Union, and African countries, the last place of origin of African-Europeans. This historical relationship has seen the post-medieval explorations, the black slave trade, colonisation, the total economic exploitation of Africa and the barely veiled forms of neo-colonialism that prevail in our time. Often, within this House, as well as within our societies, the issue of migration, an essential component of globalisation, has electrified our debates, also soothing our differences of opinion. I believe that the question of the full citizenship of black Europeans, African-descendants, must be included in this set of subjects, so that we can understand their depth, but also in order to remedy them. Often, even among us, I have seen some of our colleagues be surprised to hear me say that there is racism in Europe, considering it an almost exclusively American phenomenon. Yet, in the cradle of humanist culture, not only are racist and xenophobic acts teeming, but in some contexts, they become part of a theory of government...

The Commission is concerned about the high rates of discrimination and the manifestations of hatred reported to be seriously affecting people of African descent and black people in Europe, as recently shown by Fundamental Rights Agency research. Preventing and fighting afrophobia and other forms of racism are fully embedded in the Commission’s policies against discrimination and racism, which remain a clear priority for us. EU action in this area comprises a variety of measures and tools, including the continuing monitoring of the transposition and implementation of relevant EU legislation and, in particular, the Race Equality Directive and the Framework Decision on combating racism. In the past years, we have been working hard to provide national authorities with guidance on how to ensure the effective implementation of legislation. We have focused on data on equality and hate crime, victim support and improving investigation into, and the prosecution of, hate speech and hate crime. Last November, we published a new guidance note on the practical application of the EU Framework Decision on combating racism, which will serve as a useful tool to prompt and assist national law-enforcement and judicial authorities in better enforcing national legislation on hate crime and hate speech on the ground. Flagship policy initiatives, such as a code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, and the work on diversity chapters, are also providing a key contribution to concrete progress on the ground. All these horizontal initiatives play a key role in terms of preventing and countering afrophobia and anti-black racism. But, indeed, the recognition of afrophobia and anti-black racism as a specific form of racism is important. Following thematic discussion in the EU High Level Group on combating racism and other forms of intolerance, we published last November a policy paper which provides an overview of the main issues raised by stakeholders on the specific barriers, prejudices and obstacles facing people of African descent and black people across Europe. On this basis, targeted measures are identified, in order effectively to address discrimination, exclusion and intolerance directed against those communities. We hope this policy paper can be a useful tool both for policymakers at EU and national level and for NGOs and other stakeholders. I look forward to this debate and to the ideas of the European Parliament, which will be reflected in the resolution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2019-03-14.json", "name": "José Inácio FARIA", "mepid": "125101", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, in the context of combating institutional, personal and internalised racism, the UN has decreed the period from 2015 to 2024 as the international decade of Afrodescendants.  Despite this proclamation, the truth is that in the Member States of the European Union Afrodescendants remain racially, socially and legally discriminated against, more vulnerable to unemployment and, because of their political under-representation in the European institutions, prevented from contributing to the elimination of these forms of discrimination to which they are targeted.  This sad panorama is a shame that occurs a little throughout Europe, including in my country, where Afrodescendants are particularly vulnerable socially and economically and where unfortunately reports of police violence based on racial discrimination persist, where countless Portuguese Afrodescendants continue to be treated as immigrants and immigrant Afrodescendants see the right to nationality restricted to them and their inherent rights to them being denied by institutional racism that persists in maintaining themselves in the 21st century. It is therefore urgent to create a European Union framework for national strategies for the inclusion and social integration of Afrodescendants that includes promoting political empowerment, combating Afrophobia and hate crimes.  In the 21st century, we cannot remain impassive to witness discriminatory treatment among citizens, whether on the basis of colour, religion or sexual choices.

I'm leaving here to talk about a concept that very often runs through our society. This is the presumption of guilt, so this is the horrible name of a fact that spreads in a pandemic way in our European society, finding in the existence of stereotypes the reasons for its maintenance. Because of the presumption of guilt, many Afro-descendant European citizens are exposed to harassment and ill-treatment. Sometimes it is difficult to talk about it firsthand, for those who suffer from racism and xenophobia. It is difficult to talk about this because, precisely because of the presumption of guilt, one is immediately accused of victimism and simulation. Yet, Mr President, there is not a single African-descended European who cannot recognise the fact that he has often felt excluded, or simply targeted, because of the evidence of his own skin difference. Of course, it may also be a collective illusion, but it selectively affects and exposes black Europeans to discriminatory profiling by the police as well; to suffer institutional racism, as we have heard; to be refused their application for rental homes, without anyone having previously examined the practice. To tell you the depth of the matter, think that often, during routine police checks, it happens that the African-descending European citizen, holder of a regular identity card that bears the clear mention of his citizenship, hears the unexpected question: \"Where is the residence permit?\". There are many of these episodes.  However, I must thank this Parliament for the avant-garde regulation we have against verbal racism of elected representatives.

As people become more and more sophisticated and well-off across Europe, are they becoming more tolerant? It’s a good question. It’s not easy to answer it. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest that that’s not the case, and therefore it’s fundamental that the European Parliament would be aware of these issues to try and get fairness and equality across Europe for everybody, and particularly for people of African descent. They should have the same opportunity to get employment. They shouldn’t be subjected to hate speech or hate crime, and that should apply in every walk of life. I’ve seen in recent times, especially in sports, where even people of African descent and others, are abused simply because of their race.

Black women and LGBTIQ+ people face a particularly bleak situation as they find themselves at the intersection of discrimination based on race and gender. Access to employment, housing, education and other opportunities remains much more difficult for people of African descent. This is made worse when it comes, for instance, to trans women of colour who are also the target of unparalleled levels of violence.  Racism in Europe is rooted in centuries of colonisation and the bullying of African countries by the West. We need to address these historical trends and accept that they are still at play today, as we have seen in this very debate. However, as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination approaches, I know that thousands of anti-racist activists will march on the streets, calling for a world against racism.

I wanted to ask this question to Mr Jakovčiciovi, but he left anyway, so he will not answer me. Where does the data come from that this problem is growing? What observations justify such a belief that we have a growing problem with racism, homophobia – as he called it. I think we have a problem with homolification, if any, with such praise of deviance in this Parliament, not with homophobia. So what's the problem? Where do you have this data? Where are these specifics? On what basis do you bother with such strange discussions at all? It seems to me that this is a completely marginal problem, and perhaps only in connection with the upcoming elections do you want to win some more votes from people who are interested in it, but I see no reason for us to do so.
