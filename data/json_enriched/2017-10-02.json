This time the killing spree has hit two women. It is evident that this doubly vile choice is by no means accidental. The equal dignity between men and women achieved with difficulty by our European civilization is among the values ​​to which we are most attached and is one of the elements that most characterizes our way of living and thinking. By hitting women, you want to hit what is most important to us. On behalf of Parliament I want to express our closeness to the families of these two innocent women murdered yesterday in Marseille, our solidarity with the people of this French and European city and our increased determination to defend the values ​​we believe in. We will not lower our heads, nor will we change the way of life and we will carry on until we have defeated terrorism. A few minutes ago, through a statement, ISIS claimed the paternity of what happened today in Las Vegas. No one will ever be able to explain what can push a person to commit such terrible acts towards other human beings. In any case, whatever its origin, because the United States government does not confirm the terrorist matrix, on behalf of the European Parliament I would like to express our solidarity and sincere condolences to all those involved in this tragic event: we are all close to the innocent victims and families who are grieving the loss of loved ones in such dramatic circumstances. I thank the emergency services who have courageously worked to help their fellow citizens. Finally, I want to remember the victims of the attack that took place last Saturday, in Edmonton, Canada.

I think it is essential, although, listening to some of the previous interventions, one wonders if it is really worthwhile to continue talking about Law, about laws, when some absolutely pass them, they transgress them without any problem. In any case, I am not going to elaborate much on the content, but I do want to highlight some very clear messages. First of all, of course, I want to express my thanks to the Council, the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs who have made this Agreement possible. The Agreement provides for equal conditions for all operators, both from the European Union and abroad, operating in the same area. Ensuring the same conditions for everyone in the same area where European fleets compete with foreign fleets is crucial if we are to have the trust of fishermen. Much more stringent measures are often applied in the European Union fleet than those adopted in regional fisheries management organizations. We have to convince third countries, through our action in RFMOs, to follow the rules of the European Union in these cases. For example, transshipment at sea, which is prohibited for European Union vessels in European Union waters. Transshipment at sea is one of the main causes of the lack of transparency in fishing worldwide and that facilitates IUU fishing. And this is often done by foreign fleets, always the same at the global level - and there is no need to mention them - with low social or non-environmental considerations. It is important to continue making every effort to export our sustainability standards for fleets from third countries. The final agreed text urges the European Commission to take all the necessary steps to extend the Union ban to all waters. It is something that for many years our sector has requested - and legitimately - and I think we have to be grateful. The agreed text also highlights the need to pay special attention to traditional and artisanal fishing and to offer incentives to bluefin tuna and swordfish fishermen in the European Union who use fishing gear and techniques to reduce environmental impact and that this is taken into account when the quotas are distributed at the national level. That was a battle that we had with the Member States and that we negotiated very well then for bluefin tuna, and now that commitment is confirmed. However, I am very concerned that the Commission, almost a year after ICCAT adopted a multi-year recovery plan on Mediterranean swordfish - an iconic species whose stocks are in very poor condition - has not sent Parliament European no proposal transposing this plan. And that is the general trend of the Commission: more delay than would be desirable. I am convinced that the Commissioner does not agree either and views this very negatively. In fact, we are going to adopt, we are going to transpose, a series of ICCAT measures that are now obsolete and outdated. We are talking about measures from ten years ago. These measures were put on the table ten years ago and we are going to approve these recommendations now: there is no justification. This leads to legal uncertainty for operators and legitimate criticism from interested parties. This situation is legal and, more importantly, politically unacceptable. Therefore, we have submitted a statement to the final text expressing our concerns. I know, Commissioner, that you are going to accept it willingly, and have there must be a commitment from the Commission so that these rules are not born dead. Today we approved recommendations that have already been exceeded a year ago by a plan in relation to swordfish. And I also have to acknowledge my dissatisfaction with the latest decision taken by ICCAT on setting swordfish quotas in the Mediterranean without taking into account, at the same time, that the vessels engaged in this fishery are the same as engaged in bluefin tuna fishing. And, while they reduce, surely rightly, the quotas of swordfish, they do not increase those of bluefin tuna, when it has been shown that after a very well carried out plan the population has completely and completely recovered. I simply hope that now, Commissioner, in the month of November in Marrakech, where there is a new ICCAT meeting, that recovery is clearly reflected in a very notable increase in quotas and, furthermore, in a more equitable distribution and that take into account - as I said at the beginning - small boats, artisan boats and boats that are more respectful with the environment. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you once again for the good disposition you have had at all times and think and pose the challenge - which I am sure the commissioner will accept - that the transposition of the recommendations will not take ten years: if it is ten months, better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Gabriel Mato, and his team for their excellent work, and also Renata Briano for her earlier opinion. Considering the scope and complexity of this matter, the Commission is very pleased that the co-legislators were able to reach a political agreement smoothly and in a spirit of good cooperation and compromise. This is a challenging proposal because this transposition of measures agreed under the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) relates to numerous recommendations adopted since 2008. Some had already been partially implemented through the Control Regulation and the Regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. A review of some other regulations, including on control measures for highly migratory fish and on the system of statistical monitoring of trade in bluefin tuna, swordfish and bigeye tuna, is therefore also implied. I have read the statement tabled by the Committee on Fisheries for adoption by Parliament on the issue of EU compliance with ICCAT recommendations. I do not want in any way to justify any delays. However, while I agree that we should transpose such measures faster, I would like to clear up immediately a potential misperception that the EU has not been complying with its international obligations. That is clearly not the case. First, following the adoption of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU, any measures adopted by an international organisation to which the EU is party is binding on the Member States even without transposition. Second, despite some occasional delays in transposition, the EU has always ensured compliance with the international obligations it assumes, and the adoption of the ICCAT transposition regulation will, in the future, permit faster and more efficient implementation of new ICCAT recommendations, thanks to the delegation of certain well-framed powers to the Commission. I strongly support this practical approach, as it will allow the Union to deliver on its international obligations towards the regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) in a timely manner, providing certainty to Member States and a level playing field for operators. The transposition of measures adopted under ICCAT is necessary because they not only impose obligations on Member States but also create obligations for individuals, such as the vessel master and owner. These obligations need to be transposed into EU law to ensure legal certainty and a level playing field for operators across the EU. The ICCAT transposition regulation embraces the series of ICCAT recommendations with the exception of measures concerning the recovery plan for bluefin tuna and Mediterranean swordfish, which are included in separate regulations. The one for bluefin tuna has already been adopted. The Commission is currently finalising a draft regulation for a recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish, which is in internal consultation, and we aim to adopt the proposal before the end of the year. Let me assure you that the Union will continue working with the RFMOs to ensure better ocean governance and more sustainable fishing. We are fully committed to comprehensively and systematically addressing the issue of transhipment at sea within the framework of the RFMOs, with a view to extending the Union prohibition on transhipment at sea from our own to all waters.

Another positive point, wanted by this Parliament, concerns the obligation for Member States to apply transparent and objective criteria in the allocation of bluefin tuna and swordfish quotas: Member States will have to work to distribute national quotas fairly, taking into account traditional artisanal fishing, which is too often penalized.

First of all, I would like to thank Gabriel Mato for his report, which he drafted in a very technical and precise manner. Because the International Commission for the Conservation of Tuna Stocks in the Atlantic is of course an organization that goes further than the European Union's fisheries policy. It was founded in 1966 - over 50 years ago - because bluefin tuna was in a very difficult situation in the Atlantic and threatened to collapse. That already means that all the countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean - North Atlantic, South Atlantic - have to work together. These conferences, which are now held annually, refer directly to the stocks we have available to catch bluefin tuna, bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna and, in a special way, swordfish. We heard it, also from my colleague Briano, that of course there is also a complicated situation in the Mediterranean area here. The European Union with its member states has transferred the negotiating mandate to the Commission, and the Commission is then, so to speak, the authoritative and negotiating institution at this ICCAT conference, which can negotiate the relevant quotas with the individual member states. A delegation from the European Parliament only has observer status there, but then we ultimately have to implement the results - as Gabriel Mato said earlier. The fact that there is a delay of over ten years is simply unacceptable. Commissioner Vella said it again earlier: you will work to improve these periods in the future. It is also the case that control over the fishing vessels that have an ICCAT license and entry in the relevant shipping registers must be improved, including over the possibilities of the Data transmission by satellite etc. It is on the right track, but we must see together that it is precisely this illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, namely illegal fishing in the truest sense of the word, that must be combated. The bluefin tuna and also the other tuna species are back in a stock where one can say: We have a future in this regard. And it is also good that cooperation with China, also with Taiwan and also with Japan has picked up speed again in recent years. When we have a situation where a South Korean shipping register indicates that a fishing vessel, a longliner, has been sold without a license and is trying to catch tuna illegally in African waters that it will be caught there Chain can be placed - these are things where we can really report very positive trends in this regard. But as regards the transhipment ban for catches in the Atlantic or in other waters - our fleet also fishes in the Indian and Pacific Oceans - this is an unjustified competitive advantage for all other ICCAT members who do not have to take it into account. When it comes to controlling the fight against illegal fishing - I have already mentioned this - we have to work much better together, and the distribution of quotas, especially for small-scale and small-scale fishing - this is also included in the basic regulation - must be particularly important to us so that they have a chance of survival there too.

The work you have done is important and your speed in this case contrasts with the Commission's slowness. It took almost 10 years for the Commission to fulfill this obligation, leaving the European Union in international default. This transposition of the ICCAT provisions into European law promotes the use of artisanal fishing gear with less environmental impact and local vessels. Portugal, and in particular the Azores, where I come from, has been defending this strategy because it contributes to building and stimulating a fairer, more equitable and more resilient economy. Industrial fishing certainly has its place, but it cannot strangle traditional fishing communities. As the Regulation provides, when allocating possibilities, Member States are called upon to use transparent and objective criteria, including environmental, social and economic criteria, and must provide incentives to European Union fishing vessels using selective or fishing techniques with reduced impact on the environment. I fought for this point of view in this Parliament and in my country on several occasions, namely with regard to the allocation of the rabilo quota for the Azores. As stated now, there should be an obligation to seek to distribute national quotas fairly among the different segments of the fleet, taking into account traditional and artisanal fishing. The new regulation calls for the extension of the ban on transhipments at sea in waters outside the European Union and these positions are in line with the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We must maintain the position of leader of the European Union in the defense of sustainable development and in combating IUU fishing. In order to guarantee this, it is necessary to reinforce the observer programs, using the full potential of the data collection regulation that we recently approved here. Finally, I want to mention that tuna fisheries in general are in crisis. Every good news is followed by bad news. The large schools of tuna, which used to visit oceanic islands, such as the Azores, have stopped doing so. There may be a set of explanations for this, but I am almost certain that the use of devices for concentrating fish in tropical waters should have its share of responsibility. The use of these devices was rampant in the past but remains excessive in the present and, mainly, these devices continue to be used without the respective environmental impact study. In the Azores, we fish by line and hook, we refuse the use of industrial nets. Each fisherman uses only one hook, and even so, our fisheries were profitable. Not today!

The situation on the ground is changing very quickly and that is why we must not lag behind if we want to achieve and maintain a balance in the long run between these two goals, which make fishing a sustainable and profitable profession. It is inadmissible for the European Commission to propose the transposition of ICCAT recommendations with a delay of four or nine years, because since then a lot has changed at sea and the people who live from it. I call on the Commission to take time limits into account in its next steps and to react in a timely manner. Since I come from Croatia, I can't help but address the issue of igloo quotas.

Thus, our credibility and leadership capacity in the field of sustainability and the promotion of good fishing practices has been damaged, both because of the time that has elapsed and because of the obsolescence that some of the recommendations have become. In this way, we can generate legal insecurity such as that which affects, for example, swordfish, with a conservation plan that applies to operators, but which has not yet been transposed into Community legislation despite being a simple process. At least, and thanks to the contributions of the Committee on Fisheries, we have added to the protection and conservation measures some considerations that better connect them with the criteria of the common fisheries policy for the management of fish stocks. Thus, we force ourselves to apply more transparent criteria when allocating catch quotas between Member States. Likewise, we will support artisanal fleets due to their lower impact on the environment and for their decisive contribution to the maintenance of sustainable economic activity and the possibility of obtaining resources in order to diversify sources of income in coastal areas. It is also essential to prioritize the use of low-impact selective gears and not impose additional obligations on European ships over those from third countries; on the contrary, it is necessary for third-country vessels to comply with the same requirements as European vessels, for example in the case of transshipments on the high seas. It is also an advance to incorporate recreational fishing into the scope of application.

Many tuna species, such as yellowfin and bigeye tuna, are still threatened by overfishing. There is still great scientific uncertainty for a number of other species. The annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) takes place in November. I would like to urge the Commissioner to take the precautionary principle to heart and to propagate it at this upcoming ICCAT meeting. Minimal signs of recovery, as we see with bluefin tuna, for example, are no excuse to increase the fishing pressure already much more. Bluefin tuna is still on the red list of endangered species. I therefore find it irresponsible that the rapporteur is once again getting ahead in the explanatory statement of this report and argues for more catches of bluefin tuna. All the more so because increasing the quota for tuna endangers not only bluefin tuna itself, but also other vulnerable species, such as swordfish and marlin. And we want to protect the latter with these regulations. This report from the Fisheries Commission contains several proposals that go far less than the European Commission proposed. They protect the ecosystem much less. For example, the European Commission wanted to reduce the fishing fleet for bigeye tuna, or at least not to expand it further. The rapporteur wants to abandon this reduction because it is not strictly mandatory. But it is no shame to show a little more ambition. Finally, the sales ban for white and blue marlins caught above quota. They are overfished and the status of these fish species is vulnerable. It is not without reason that hardly any fishing opportunities have been set. The fisheries commission now proposes not to count marlins as they above quota are caught and landed.For example, the animals could be used for scientific research.It may come as a surprise to some, but a fish that has been killed and landed is missing from the ecosystem whether you count it or not.And whether you eat it or examine it: overfishing is not stopped by killed fish, but not counting.Overfishing is stopped by fishing less or even not fishing.And I also believe that European agricultural and fisheries subsidies should be abolished.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 38, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Mike HOOKEM", "mepid": "124957", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, you can’t save your money and spend it, you can’t have you cake and eat it, and you can’t pretend to be a nation when you are not.

The sustainability of marine biological resources should be a huge concern for all of us. However, I argue that this sustainability must not be blind, that is, it must also take into account long-term economic and social sustainability, and in this sense, I cannot fail to mention the situation of the fishermen and their families, who are going through a crisis situation, lack of income, even working harder and risking their lives a lot. I speak especially of fishermen from coastal areas, from outermost regions such as the Azores, who are increasingly suffering from the scarcity of marine biological resources, that is, fish. That is why this proposal is very important as it arises in the sense that we can balance all these aspects, especially with regard to tuna. Also here, year after year, both fishermen and our tuna industry see fewer and fewer resources, less tuna, undermining the sustainability of this important activity in my region, the Azores, thus threatening hundreds of direct jobs and indirect because, at some point, whether for climatic reasons, which led to the alteration of the migration routes of the tuna, or for human reasons, with aggressive fishing techniques by others that reduce, in large numbers, the individuals who manage to do this migration. Fisheries in the Azores, therefore, are part of the cultural and regional heritage and constitute a highly relevant socio-economic activity. Indeed, the Azoreans are highly dependent on fishing and marine resources play an important role. key role in the local economy and employment, including in fisheries-related industries, including the tuna canning industry. Commissioner, what you are bringing us here today aims to harmonize and broaden the scope of the ICCAT recommendations. I would like to make two very clear messages here: the first involves equal treatment between European and third-country fleets. We cannot continue to impose more restrictive and limiting rules on our fishermen than on other fleets that often do not respect the most basic principles of European standards. The second message is the commitment we ask you to take into account artisanal fleets, especially those in the outermost regions, as is the case in the Azores, as we have been an example at European and world level of the sustainability of tuna fishing. In the Azores, tuna are fished with pole and pole and, in general, with live bait, a highly sustainable fishing technique, with little environmental impact and very selective. Most catches are processed by the locally important tuna canning industry, although fresh tuna is becoming increasingly important because it produces higher prices, especially in the export market. Finally, I would also like to ask you to take into account the possibility of an increase in the shares of bluefin tuna, whose stock is booming and which in fact would be very useful for us to be able to compensate European fishermen for cutting the quotas for swordfish fishing , as is commonly recognized, suffered a sharp deterioration in its stocks. For all the reasons explained above, the growing adoption of information collected and managed by ICCAT is encouraged in order to adopt appropriate management measures and to safeguard the interests of operators in the sector who practice highly sustainable fisheries, as is the specific case of the Azores .", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 40, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation aims to transpose the agreement of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, of which the European Union has been a contracting party since 1997, please or not to Mr. Hookem.

So on paper everything looks perfect. Except that this is not the 2016 agreement, the most recent, but the 2008 one. We are transposing a text more than nine years late. The Commission has presented us with a transposition project, which is not only nine years old but, moreover, partly obsolete, since a new ICCAT agreement was negotiated in 2016. Thus, while it is about manage a precious resource, both economically and ecologically, while stocks have collapsed or improved depending on the species, and then, above all, when the common fisheries policy is based on the best scientific knowledge and the most recent, Brussels bases its regulations on data ten years old.

These are acts essentially directed at the contracting parties, but which also contain obligations directed at private operators, such as ship masters. We have identified two major contradictions in the Commission's position. The first is that the proposal he presented with recommendations and management measures of his own contradicts the spirit of the convention, which aims to transpose those recommendations exactly, guaranteeing the same conditions for all fishermen and fleets in the region. On the other hand, taking into account that the ICCAT recommendations come into force six months after their adoption, it is incomprehensible that the recommendations of 2008 are only being transposed at present, some of which are already out of date, as is the case with the fisheries of the swordfish in the Mediterranean, for which new recommendations were drawn up last November. A delay that highlights the limitations imposed by the fact that Member States have lost to the European Union their capacity to manage marine resources, with inevitable losses for the management of resources at national level but also for the defense of arts that have particular relevance at the regional level, since, being handcrafted, and we give as an example the jump and pole in the Azores or the almadraba in Spain, they lack timely measures that guarantee, in an uncompromising way, their defense and all the historical, social heritage and cultural, in addition to the economic importance for the communities that maintain and practice them.

I think that finally the transposition that is made is adequate. Maybe there is something missing, but I think he has done a great job. My congratulations. The transposition into Union law of these conservation measures is necessary to ensure that vessels comply with the regulations of the ICCAT Commission Convention. Like all of us, we are referring specifically to Atlantic tuna. With this transposition it is also guaranteed that a responsible management of the species regulated by this regional organization is carried out, even if it is outside the area established by the Convention. It is important that both community and non-community fishermen operate under the same rules and that the burden of recovery of the populations does not fall only on a few. I know that we are all insisting on it, but since I live in Spain and I know what happens in the Mediterranean - where, sometimes, the rules of fishermen that we have in the European Union are not the same as those of neighboring countries. , this insistence is important: that all of us who operate in an area have the same standards. By virtue of this Regulation, species as important to the Spanish fleet as bluefin tuna or swordfish are regulated. It is essential to ensure that this management of these populations is carried out in a sustainable manner, without forgetting the socioeconomic aspect or the coastal populations that live from this capture. Both aspects are very important to me. The European Commission, however ... We all say it, but it is true: the delay of these nine, almost ten years, in transposing the twenty-eight recommendations is very striking. A delay that is very difficult to justify and that, in any case, cannot be repeated. Now we have the fish management plan sword, what are we waiting for. It is worth highlighting the importance of these management standards, since currently the bluefin tuna stocks are in very good condition. This is demonstrated by the scientific reports published on the matter, and this is great news. This improvement in stocks is due to good practices in the sector and should translate into an increase in total allowable catches to reward fishermen for the effort they have made contributing to their recovery. In three years, the total allowable catches of bluefin tuna has increased by 60%. The ICCAT, which can regularly review its recommendations and implement new measures, must take into account the future of some fleets: that of swordfish from the entire coastline of Spain —and I especially want to mention the Carboneras fleet, in Almería, which it is undergoing both cuts, swordfish and bluefin tuna.

The ICCAT recommendations, some of which are really dated, albeit with the general objective of regulating activity and making fishing sustainable, risk imposing new and increasingly heavy obligations on our fishermen, who have been living for years a profound crisis. Before accepting new rules, we should therefore be able to ensure some safeguards. First of all, when allocating fishing opportunities, Member States should distribute national quotas equally between the various fleet segments. In addition, it would be necessary to provide incentives for fishermen, who already make enormous efforts and use selective fishing gears or who use fishing techniques with a reduced environmental impact. Third and last but not least, the ICCAT recommendations should also be observed by non-European countries.

The object is scarcely the point. Do we want to conserve tuna? Of course we do! We want the largest possible breeding stock to deliver the greatest numbers. That is common sense.

It is also in our name: Freedom and Direct Democracy! That is our Group. Madrid justifies its behaviour on the grounds that Spanish law is being broken. Putting aside the question as to whether a government should beat up its people in that way, even if they are breaking the law, we are entitled to expect the government that does this to be a stickler for the letter of the law. An international convention is a convention between nations. That means the parties to it should be nations. The EU is not a nation or a state and should therefore not be a party to international agreements – international, may I say.  If the Spanish Government are sticklers for the legal protocol, they should share our view. They do not, of course, because their view of the law is entirely contentious and self-interested. If they were consistent and decent, they would not try to deny the long-standing international agreement of the Treaty of Utrecht, some hundreds of years old. They would not constantly try to bully Gibraltar. To clarify, we – the UK – put our money on democracy where our mouths are.

On serious issues, I like this transposition because it is faithful to the latest ICCAT Resolution. My only regret is that the transpositions are sometimes carried out so late: it has taken almost ten years, and the measures relating to swordfish are not updated, however, a species that is the subject of a recovery plan, I think approved in 2016. That is why, in short, we had to make this declaration annexed to the Resolution approved by Parliament's Fisheries Committee that highlights these imbalances, and I would like it to be taken into account for future transpositions.

It has shown a very broad criticism of the delay but broad support for the approval of this proposal and I am very happy that the negotiations have concluded. Many have stressed the issue of the delayed transposition, which I fully understand. I have already commented on the delay in my introductory remarks. I stress again that the European Union has been complying with its international obligations all along, in spite of the delay in transposition. The EU was never in breach of any law. The adoption of this proposal will also contribute to reducing such delays in the future. This is a milestone that will contribute to a quicker procedure to transpose international obligations, acquired by the Union under regional fisheries management organisations (RFMO), into EU law in a timely manner. I want to stress the fact that the EU fishing industry was never exempt from any measure of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The European Union is a contracting party to ICCAT since 1997; as such the EU is under international obligation to ensure that the provisions of the ICCAT recommendations are effectively complied with, but pursuant to Article 216(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) this international obligation also lies with Member States. They are bound to comply with the provisions of RFMOs and take necessary measures to this end, even in the absence of transposition of the said measures into EU law. In fact, the Commission was continuously monitoring to ensure that all Member States were adhering to ICCAT obligations and measures. With regards to the use of data, I can assure you all that we are not using ten year old data as was said. I want to assure everyone that all fishing opportunities are evaluated by scientists on the latest data given by all contracting parties.  One comment regarding Mr Marias’ question on what support could be given to fishermen affected by an oil spin – I will take note of this and will revert directly to you to see whether support measures are available under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). With regards to this regulation, the Commission sees it as an inspiration for future transpositions. It was led by the principle of fair and strict transpositions and it allows for quick implementation of new ICCAT recommendations. As I said, the proposal transposing the management plan for swordfish is expected to reach you during the next months. The issue of quota distribution, which was raised by some MEPs, is not part of this regulation. This has been discussed extensively with Members States both before the ICCAT meeting and also after. We have found a good solution. Madam President, I would like to thank again Mr Mato and Madam Renata Briano for their support and the debate.

Even though Europe is a world leader in women's rights and gender equality, we still have a lot to do. As President Tajani said when he opened the part-session, we in this House have an enormous responsibility for women's rights, and can make a difference. That is why I am pleased to be able to present today my report on women's economic empowerment in the private and public sectors in the EU. In today's Europe, we see inequality clearly between men and women in our everyday lives, whether it is the gender-based wage gap, the pension gap, responsibility for unpaid domestic work or harassment in the workplace. In the work with gender equality, economic self-determination is a central issue and something we must always take into account when we try to achieve change. One of the main factors limiting people is economic vulnerability, and women are overrepresented in both poverty and economic dependence. One result of this is the wage gap and the subsequent pension gap, which is unfortunately still alarming. The wage gap between men and women is 16.5 per cent in the EU, which in turn has resulted in a 40% pension gap, while the gap in employment between men and women costs the EU around € 370 billion a year. In addition, today 17 million women in the EU are involuntarily excluded from the labor market due to precarious working conditions. We must ensure that women's employment is secure and give them the right to full-time employment. In addition, we need to tackle the unpaid homework that women in the EU spend 24 hours more than men. I want to see an end to this and I believe that an important way forward for gender equality is about economic self-determination. The road there is not easy and we must dare to think broadly and long-term. But I think my report can be indicative. Before the vote tomorrow, there are certain things in my report that I would like to press extra, and which we actually agreed on in committee. Despite that, so EPP and ALDE are now trying, as usual, to remove these important issues. Some of them are the wage gap between men and women, which must end. Therefore, I propose wage surveys and that the social partners should work for higher wages in sectors where women make up a majority of the workforce, that the macroeconomic trends we have today must be reconsidered. We need a gender perspective on economic policy. This was clearly felt during the economic crisis, when austerity measures hit women particularly hard. Men's violence against women is one of today's major security problems. We must put an end to the patriarchal notions that have resulted in women dying. And we must ensure that everyone has access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. The right to decide over one's own body must never be restricted. We are only three years away from 2020, where we ourselves have set very high goals that we must achieve. We cannot accept failure and must continue to work for women's empowerment and participation in the labor market. We must show leadership by taking a firm stance that we do not tolerate inequality and that we also expect both the public and private sectors to take responsibility for the lack of equality, which is spreading due to the problems raised in it. here is the report that we will be voting on tomorrow. I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the work on this report, both Members and officials.

Nevertheless, I did not vote in favor of the draft report we are currently discussing in the FEMM Committee. We cannot improve a woman's economic status just by sending women to work and preventing them from having children and being mothers. That would be a big mistake. We will improve the economic position of women by providing them with a quality education, by financially rewarding their childcare during maternity and parental leave.

The International Labor Organization also stresses the persistence of a gender gap in women's pay. In short, although work is increasingly becoming an important aspect of female identity, there is still a long way to go to achieve true equality between men and women.

Women’s equal participation in the labour market and in economic decision-making are preconditions for women’s empowerment. The Commission’s strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019 identifies five priority areas for action. 1: increasing female labour market participation and the equal economic independence of women and men; 2: reducing the gender pay earnings and pension gaps and thus fighting poverty among women; 3: promoting equality between women and men in decision-making; 4: combating gender-based violence and protecting and supporting victims; and 5: promoting gender equality and women’s rights across the world. In this context, let us focus on two important aspects. First, closing the gender employment gap. Women remain significantly under-represented in the labour market. In 2016, women’s employment rate was still more than 10 points lower than men’s employment rate. If you look at the full-time equivalent employment rate, the gap reaches 18 points. This gap is not related to professional qualifications or academic achievement, where women more and more out-perform men. It is first and foremost related to the way women and men share caring responsibilities in our society. The Commission has developed an extensive package of measures contributing to the economic empowerment of women. The main objective of our proposal for a directive on work-life balance of working parents and carers is to address women’s under-representation in the labour market. The proposed directive aims at modernising the current EU legal and policy frameworks for family-related leave and flexible working arrangements. The proposed directive is complemented with non-legislative measures with the objective to promote the development of formal care services; the enforcement of the rules with regard to dismissal; protection for pregnant women; and removing economic disincentives for second earners to work. We are also developing the relevant indicators in order to be able to measure progress in all these areas. The second aspect to focus on when it comes to the economic empowerment of women is closing the gender pay gap. The gender pay gap has been decreasing only slowly and seems to have stabilised at 16% over the last years as a result of pervasive segregation on the labour market, persistent stereotypes fuelled by inadequate work-life balance policies, and discrimination, all of this combined with a lack of transparency. The effective application of the existing legal framework on equal pay remains a challenge in all Member States. The Commission constantly monitors whether EU law on equal pay is applied correctly and supports Member States and other stakeholders in the proper enforcement of the existing rules. We are now finalising – and intend to propose – an action plan to tackle the gender pay gap from all possible angles. It will aim, in particular, at improving the application of the equal-pay principle, combating segregation in occupations and sectors, combating vertical segregation, and recognising women’s skills, efforts and responsibilities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, October 3, 2017.

So far, we are seeing only a negligible increase in equality. Despite the fact that women have a higher level of education than men, the pay gap between men and women is stark at 16.1%. The amount of pensions differs even more - 40.2 percent. A major problem is the unequal distribution of unpaid work in the household. When unpaid domestic work is done for both men and women, and the burden is shared equally, women will be able to participate in the labor market as men, creating a better basis for a proper work-life balance and thus enabling women to compete on an equal footing. This will not only guarantee people's rights, but also bring economic benefits. In order to strengthen women's economic power, it is first and foremost necessary to ensure that everyone is paid equally for work of equal value. Also, in sectors where women predominate, workers must be paid more. In the case of company boards and the public sector, where high-level decisions are made, the experience of women's participation shows positive results. The Council is therefore called upon to adopt the directive on women on company boards as a matter of urgency.

This draft resolution offers a number of good tools. For example, there should be instruments for governments and the business community that lead to more wage transparency. This should reduce the pay gap between men and women. The so-called Barcelona criteria must also be met. As a result, families can opt for high-quality affordable childcare earlier, so that the labor participation of women can increase. In my opinion, there are roughly two schools of thought in this debate. The first school argues that inequality between men and women will naturally disappear.

A continent that should set an example to the rest of the world excludes half of women from the workforce. The situation is not improving. Women are born poorer, live poorer, and die poorer than men. Women are under-represented in the labor market throughout the EU. The overall employment rate for women is still almost 12% lower than for men. 32 per cent of working women work part-time, only eight per cent of men. Are we cheating on European women? We argue that education is the way to better wages. Despite the fact that the level of education of women in the EU is now higher than that of men on average, the gender pay gap is still 16%. Thus, women do not rise to men’s wages, even though they are better educated. We also argue that working a lot can get a lot of pay. That, too, is a scam. Women do more work than men. The difference is that men are paid for most of the work they do. In the EU, women do at least two and a half times more unpaid domestic and care work than men. It’s a real job, but women aren’t paid for it. When work done at home and at work is added together, women’s working days are longer.

Before dwelling on the most important points in this report, I would like to underline the unanimous position that all political groups have held in dealing with the situation of civil society in developing countries. I have also seen the importance of joint work and consensus to achieve a good result, and thanks to that good will, because of the importance that this report had, we were able to approve it with 22 votes in favor, one abstention and one vote against. It is a very timely and relevant report, as it reflects the reality of civil society in many developing countries that receive assistance from the European Union. I have had the opportunity to meet with the NGOs working on site, to hear the problems and difficulties they face. I have also had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the European Commission and the European External Action Service and they have also allowed me to see another lens of the challenges that must be faced in the European Union in order to help the most disadvantaged. We all agree that human rights, the rule of law and democracy must be respected. Civil society in developing countries is so weak that it needs all of our action and attention. I have seen the difficulties experienced by aid workers, journalists, human rights defenders; inadmissible situations that, on many occasions, lead them to death. There are also very desperate situations in countries in conflict. I am thinking of Africa, where aid workers and civil society suffer the scourge of terrorism on a daily basis. Throughout this text, it has been my intention to underline the value of civil society to preserve a more democratic, dignified and just society, also collaborating positively with the public sector and the private sector. On the other hand, it is of the utmost importance, and this is reflected in the report, the recognition of the action of the European Union, since it defends and enhances the role of civil society in development cooperation. The initiatives could be grouped into two parts. The first, political support, where various measures are proposed, such as regular meetings with members of civil society in the framework of official visits - when the deputies go in delegation, I personally have the presidency, to a country, I always reserve a space to serve all NGOs. Also regularly incorporate this issue on the agenda of the Councils on Foreign Affairs. Also the promotion of the coherence of the policies in the matter of human rights, development, justice and security. Also the creation of a monitoring and early warning mechanism in relation to the reduction of space in civil society. The second initiative concerns financial support. It is recalled that the European Union is the main donor of aid to civil society organizations in developing countries, but we ask that the funds of the instruments dedicated to this be increased, such as the European instrument on human rights and the instrument of development cooperation. It also insists on the need for greater synergies between all the instruments, requesting a follow-up, country by country, of all the activities in support of civil society financed by the European Union. In conclusion, I would like again to emphasize before this House the unity of opinion in the work carried out in the parliamentary committee. Certainly some parts do not meet one hundred percent of the expectations of those of us who have worked on it, but I believe that in the dialogue held, common sense and availability to do a good job have prevailed. For that reason, I ask for the support of this House, because I believe that we must launch an important message, loud and clear, to this threatened civil society in many countries of the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 92, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": "- Madam President!

This is a reality that we must tackle together as it is the only way development cooperation will bear fruit. The European Union is seeking to formulate coherent and effective responses – building on the experience gathered so far. We are increasing our efforts in preserving civil space and ensuring an enabling environment for civil society organisations. Clear expressions of our strong commitment are: the Commission’s communication on Europe’s engagement with civil society in partner countries from 2012, the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy and our new European Consensus on Development. They all emphasise the crucial role of civil society as actors of governors and development.  Overall, your report is in line with the thinking and the ongoing work of the Commission and the High Representative to strengthen our support to civil society organisations and to continue our engagement in promoting their greater autonomy. EU delegations are at the forefront of translating EU policies into concrete actions on the ground. Therefore they proactively identify and report on threats to civil society space, including reprisals, and take steps to counter such threats. This implies using all of our diplomatic tools throughout the world, human rights dialogues and high-level contacts to raise the cases of individuals at risk. Supporting a genuinely independent, diverse, pluralistic and vibrant civil society is essential to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are committed to investing more in existing good practices and highlighting the positive aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals’ implementation through civil society organisations. The Commission and the High Representative are engaging with EU partner countries through various channels. When it comes to development cooperation, we support partner countries through funding that focuses on engagement with civil society and by ensuring consistency between all relevant EU policies and activities. However, I would like to emphasise that the support to our partner countries is not only financial. Our relations with civil society organisations are, first and foremost about policy dialogue, hence the need for appropriate space for them to share their views. The Commission will continue engaging with various stakeholders to drive this agenda forward and the European Parliament is one of our essential partners. Building trust and continuing to work closely with all relevant actors is key to addressing the challenges faced by civil society.  As you know, the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders were adopted in 2008. We consider human rights defenders as one of the cornerstones of every well—functioning state and are key allies in the promotion of the democratisation and expansion of civil space. Providing support and giving them visibility has been, and remains, one of the major priorities of the EU’s external human rights policies.  The progress and achievements since 2012 are reflected in the Commission’s report on EU engagement with civil society in external relations, which was issued in April this year. It provides concrete examples of how the EU is acting on its priorities with regard to civil society, showing the diversity, complementarity and strength of the EU’s worldwide interventions in support of civil society. The report was followed by Council conclusions last June, which confirm that on this essential point all EU institutions stand united.  The Commission and the High Representative are committed to continue working closely with the European Parliament and EU Member States to ensure that together we can build a better environment for civil society organisations. By preventing the further shrinking of civil space, we are not only enabling civil society organisations to engage more effectively as development actors, but we are living up to our duty to defend the values of democracy, freedom, pluralism and solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 102, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, October 3, 2017.

The fight against cybercrime is not easy, because it requires high specialization, continuous training and information, legal certainty and coordination. In the report I include the elements that highlight the peculiar form and the special character of the crime on the Internet. This lies in the ease and speed with which the crime is committed, in the anonymity, in the cross-border nature of the crime, in the difficult investigation. Large-scale digital threats are evolving rapidly and we do not have the means and tools to do so, because technology and criminals who use technology are always one step ahead of law enforcement and European law. It is our duty, however, to tackle this phenomenon, because the attacks violate the fundamental rights of European citizens, directly and crucially violate the rule of law and undermine the stability of democratic societies. It is worth noting that statistically there are Member States where the annual crime by 50% is in the form of cybercrime and there is also evidence that in 2016 cybercrime attacks against the European Union's electronic systems increased by 20%. This shows us the increase and the speed with which crime on the Internet is evolving. Our report includes parameters that affect the fight against cybercrime. We have highlighted challenges, legislative gaps, legal gaps and new threats. We submit proposals that include its method coordinated cooperation, with the exchange of information between the Member States but also between the Member States of the European Union and third countries and between the police and judicial authorities. Of course, we propose in a special chapter the need to protect vulnerable groups: young people, minors and children, and we emphasize the legislative initiative for the collection and use of electronic evidence and the framework for the collection of personal data always with respect for fundamental rights. At this point we must welcome the new strategy recently announced by the Commission and Mr King, personally, on Internet security.

This action plan recommends the massive use of new digital technologies, fintechs, to develop citizens' access to cross-border financial services. This plan is based in particular on the “eIDAS” regulation, which obliges Member States to do two things: on the one hand, each country must have set up an electronic identity system for its citizens before September 29, 2018, and on the other hand, each country will automatically have to accept the electronic identity systems of other States. The objective for the Commission is thus to allow, for example, that a citizen in Spain, on the basis of his Spanish electronic identity, can have a bank account in Latvia, without having to travel to that country.

This report on the fight against cybercrime shows that all citizens should know how to protect themselves against cybercrime. Almost everyone uses digital services, has a smartphone or laptop. Thus, almost everyone is a potential victim of cyber criminals. We must therefore improve global police and judicial cooperation, and it is imperative that we invest in more education. I therefore reiterate the call on the European Commission to launch a user awareness campaign. But the topic of digitization and its dangers should also be given more space in schools.

I want to thank the rapporteur for her personal contribution, and indeed all the Members for their engagement on this subject. As has been noted, cyber-attacks do not pay heed to geographical borders. They can be achieved at a surprisingly low cost, but with devastating effect, and they pose a risk to our security and sometimes to our democratic processes and institutions. Which is why we need to promote our cybersecurity, and that indeed was the objective of the package of measures the Commission issued on 19 September. As a number of you have suggested, we need to build on what already exists so we recognise the importance of the European Union Agency for Network Information and Security (ENISA) and of Europol, but we need to strengthen the work that they have been doing and strengthen cooperation between the various agencies and instruments. We have the Directive on the Security of Network and Information Systems. Once that is fully implemented it will improve national cybersecurity capabilities, enhance cooperation between Member States and require operators in important economic sectors such as energy, transport, banking and health, as well as digital service providers, to adopt risk-management measures, and report major incidents to national authorities. However, some of the attacks that we have seen recently, like the ‘WannaCry’ attack and the ‘Not Petya’ attack, showed the need to do even more on resilience and on preparedness. Resilience means being harder to attack and quicker to respond, so a proposed cybersecurity act would revise the mandate of ENISA and reinforce it. We are also proposing to introduce an EU certification framework for internet-connected products and services. Building on the cybersecurity public-private partnership, the Commission has said that we want to create a network of cybersecurity competence centres and a new European cybersecurity research and competence centre at its hub. Both network and centre would contribute to increased investment and reinforce capabilities across the European Union. Cybercrime should not pay. Sadly, it will continue and will continue to grow as long as it does appear to pay, so we also need to take steps – as well as building our resilience – to improve deterrents and to make cybercrime easier to detect, trace and prosecute. We want law enforcement agencies to have the tools they need to tackle online crime effectively. The Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on non-cash payment fraud, a crime that is worth some EUR 1.5 billion in the eurozone alone. We take a technologically neutral approach, but we want to facilitate cross-border cooperation and ensure that this crime is treated as seriously as it deserves to be. We have said that, by the beginning of 2018, we will propose measures to improve cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations. With regard to encryption – mentioned by a number of you – when it comes to encryption in criminal investigations, we are reviewing possible options and possible ways forward, and we will revert both to the Council and to this House. But we recognise, and we agree, that strong encryption is key to how we use the internet. It has a key role in maintaining effective cybersecurity. We recognise and respect that. Finally, we agree with Parliament’s calls for action to empower and protect children from online risks. The annual Safer Internet Day is a flagship event promoting awareness amongst children, teachers and parents. Next year’s Safer Internet Day is on 6 February. The Commission is considering launching a major EU-wide campaign covering online safety and cybersecurity for minors. Our communication last week on tackling illegal content online also set out guidelines to encourage more effective identification and removal of illegal content, including material in relation to child sexual abuse. It explicitly encourages more proactive measures to tackle this scourge. I want to thank you again for your engagement on these issues. From the Commission side we very much looking forward to continuing our discussion and dialogue with you on building our cybersecurity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday 3 October 2017.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "in writing.- The fight against cybercrime, a rapidly growing phenomenon, is both difficult and delicate.Indeed, it is difficult to combat a problem at national level which, by its nature, does not have any type of barrier, hence the fundamental importance of a coordinated approach at European level;then the relationship between the need to face the matter and that of safeguarding the right to the protection of personal data, privacy and freedom of expression is delicate.Finding a balance between these two aspects is not easy but, as mentioned, it is absolutely necessary and urgent.The presented report succeeds in this difficult task and I am therefore happy to support it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 124, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "  in writing. – It is a well—established fact that citizens’ everyday lives are becoming increasingly digital.

Since this House adopted its first report on political relations between the EU and the ASEAN group of states in 2014, a great deal of positive has happened in this area. The second report that the AFET committee is now presenting to the plenary session reflects this. At the same time, we have the opportunity to look back on 50 years of ASEAN and 40 years of relations between the EU and ASEAN and to take this as an opportunity to describe a new phase in these relations. For us, the ASEAN community is a strategic partner that is important for cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific region. It is particularly important that this is a partner who, like the EU, advocates multilateralism and the international rule of law. The collaboration now extends to more areas than ever before. In the area of ​​connectivity, for example, we are negotiating an air transport agreement. There is cooperation on the environment or on the UN's sustainability goals or the question of natural resources. There is cooperation on security at sea, piracy, cooperation between Europol and Aseanapol against organized crime, against terrorism, with regard to cybersecurity and, of course, crisis management. The issues of promoting democracy and promoting human rights also continued to play a major role in our relationships. In the report, we address the obligation of entrepreneurs who invest there within the very close trade and investment relationship between the EU and ASEAN, the obligation with regard to social and environmental responsibility. We address the possibilities of cooperation at the municipal level, the possibilities of cooperation between people - especially among the younger generation - and one of the specific projects, this one what is proposed is that a Young Leaders Program be set up between the EU and ASEAN.Finally, the report also emphasizes that we want to promote cooperation between parliamentarians on both sides.Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a very fruitful, very constructive collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups.There is a great deal of agreement.At one point we even managed to formulate a self-criticism with regard to the EU's not particularly laudable hesitation when it came to giving an opinion on the decision of the Unclos Court on the South China Sea.But the bottom line is that it is a positive development that we are giving our support with a lot of commitment and that we hope will gain even more momentum in the next few years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2017-10-02.json", "name": "Csaba SÓGOR", "mepid": "39724", "text": "- Ms. President!

Commission and High Representative/Vice—President Mogherini. It speaks to the importance the EU attributes to relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), notwithstanding the last comment. It is also an appropriate way to celebrate this 40th anniversary.  Europe and the ASEAN region may be separated geographically, but we remain closely linked. What happens in Southeast Asia matters to us, and – I think we all agree – the same is true for our ASEAN friends. Today’s challenges and crises very often have a global dimension, a global impact. The situation in the South China Sea and in the Korean peninsula, the fight against terrorism, radicalisation to mention just a few examples are ASEAN interests, but they are our interests too.  The EU wants to contribute to the security of the ASEAN region. The EU has become one of the main contributors to the security-related activities of the ASEAN Regional Forum. In 2017, we have sponsored initiatives on counter-radicalisation, people trafficking, preventive diplomacy and mediation. For the third year in a row, we have invited ASEAN partners to be acquainted with the EU’s capabilities in common defence and security policies. A seminar in Rome allowed for a visit to the headquarters of Operation Sophia. Shortly, the EU will co-sponsor the fourth edition of the EU-ASEAN high-level dialogue on maritime security this year with the Philippines. We see the recent invitation to attend the November East Asia Summit as an acknowledgment of these efforts. We want to thank all ASEAN members, and in particular the Philippines, for inviting us. We look forward to contributing to the summit’s work as a partner and a friend. The same goes for other security and defence forums in Southeast Asia, notably the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus.  There is much we can do together in terms of trade, connectivity, making the most out of globalisation, as well as addressing together the imbalances it can give rise to. Both the EU and ASEAN want to continue fighting climate change and to preserve the Paris Agreement. I am glad that we adopted, in August, a joint statement to reaffirm that we stand by Paris, and we will push forward implementation.  We should not underestimate the joint potential of cooperation between EU and ASEAN in a range of sectors. After all, as has been noted, together we represent over one billion people, and we are among the largest world economies.  The European Union is the first foreign investor in ASEAN and the second trading partner. The impact of bilateral free trade agreements between the European Union and Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand would be huge, with great benefits for our companies and citizens. These agreements could be the stepping stones towards a future region-to-region agreement.  The comprehensive air transport agreement we are negotiating would be the first of its kind. Once finalised, thousands of new jobs will be created, and one billion people will be able to fly directly for lower prices and with the highest standards of security.  The potential for greater engagement is huge. To turn this potential into reality, in Manila in August the EU and ASEAN adopted a comprehensive plan of action to guide cooperation from 2018 to 2022. All the key areas of common interest are covered, including human rights, good governance, women’s rights and the rule of law.  Forty years ago, we took the first steps to build cooperation between the European Union and ASEAN. We have come a long way since. Today, every day, we see that many of our interests coincide, as do many of the challenges we face. The EU remains committed to comprehensively upgrading the EU-ASEAN relationship. We can be proud of what we have achieved over the last 40 years. We should be ambitious about what we can do together in the years ahead.  Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for your engagement on this report and the debate this evening.

Forty years since the first EU-ASEAN relations were established, we have seen positive developments in cooperation in a number of areas. However, as in the EU, some countries face human rights and non-citizen violations. Large stateless communities are currently located in Brunei, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and especially Myanmar. It concerns Rohingya, whose position is worse in ASEAN countries than in the case of stateless citizens in EU countries. Unfortunately, the report does not mention them. It should be noted that tens of thousands of non-citizens have long lived in EU countries, specifically Latvia and Estonia. These non-citizens even have personal documents, such as a passport, marked non-citizens. One of the big problems of ASEAN countries is the protection of the environment and the fight against piracy. The South China Sea has long failed to resolve the conflict between the ASEAN countries and between the ASEAN countries and China. However, the EU is not free of similar problems either.

It only served to violate fundamental rights and alter coexistence, against express court orders to the contrary. I hope it is the last chapter of a wrong strategy: denying reality and trying to repress by means of sentences a political problem to whose solution the European Union should contribute as an agent of coexistence. Spain proclaims itself a united nation but is, in reality, a union of nations.

In 2017, four million animals were slaughtered preventively, i.e. months of crawl space for more than 1,000 municipalities, and a year without any income for some producers. A slow agony! The compensations awarded are not up to par and anger is growing, feeding on the unfairness of the situation. Indeed, where the losses of large groups have been well compensated, small farms pay a high price. I am a supporter of the precautionary principle and aware of the new standards and controls to be put in place, but this means helping producers to apply these changes and to secure their farms against avian flu, when they have to deal with the combined pressure of delayed CAP payments, new standards, containment measures and costs related to analyzes.

While we do want Europe to conclude trade agreements, we want it to be sensitive to the impact they can have on farmers in the European Union. In that context there is deep concern, certainly among beef farmers in Ireland, about the potential offer that the European Union will make to the Mercosur countries, and the figure being quoted is of 70 000 tons of tariff-rate quota for beef. This will have consequences not just for Ireland but for livestock farmers across Europe.

I had several meetings with European associations of people with disabilities, national associations and associations in my country. The discussions I have had have led me to declare this evening, Commissioner, because I believe it is necessary, especially with regard to the guardianship institution, that those persons with disabilities who are under the guardianship of certain persons are purely and simply worse than in detention.
