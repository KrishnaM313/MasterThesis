It sets out the processes whereby Member States give authorisations to individuals to own, buy and sell firearms. However, certain poorly deactivated ‘salute and acoustic’ firearms were able to be bought and sold without authorisation, and some of these were re-converted and used in the tragic Paris attacks. A cache of similar firearms was discovered in the UK. The European law does need reviewing. The first set of proposed amendments from the Commission was very poorly drafted. It would have put disproportionate restrictions on many legal owners, it was not supported by an impact assessment, and the proposals had many technical failings. But, over the past 18 months, I have worked with colleagues across this Parliament and many different stakeholders, as well as law enforcement authorities, proof houses and legal experts, in order to protect the interests of legitimate owners whilst also addressing the security issues. There have been some misleading reports in the press and I would like to set the record straight here. In reality, the Parliament text that we are voting on today contains many significant improvements. Firstly, firearms will not be restricted on the basis of their cosmetic appearance: this is legally unworkable. Military reservists, museums, filmmakers and collectors will be able to continue their ownership, provided their Member State agrees. Member States will continue to organise and protect their own national security, national reserve and public defence services. This meets the needs of countries like Finland and respects the situation in Switzerland. Technical issues with deactivation standards have been reassessed and holders of genuinely deactivated firearms, such as re-enactors, will be able to continue their ownership. The controversial proposal for mandatory medical and psychological tests has been rejected and, instead, each country will have in place its own system for assessments. There are provisions to support younger owners and for those in rural areas. There are new measures for clearer marking, for better information sharing between Member States and for safe storage, but we have taken care not to put overly burdensome requirements on small traders or on historical items. There are new stricter controls on certain semi-automatic firearms when they are fitted with high-capacity magazines, and on automatic firearms that are being converted into semi-automatics. However – and this is important – individuals who legally own these today will be able to continue to do so, provided their own Member State agrees. Target shooters will also be able to own these and continue to practice and participate in their sport, again provided their own Member State agrees. There are new provisions on magazines, which go beyond what Parliament’s committee initially proposed, however the representatives from Europe’s 28 Member States insisted that they should be covered. Today, there are some additional amendments tabled by colleagues. These are not new: they have largely been considered by Parliament already and rejected by the Member States and the Council. If they are adopted, it could risk destabilising the entire agreement. This negotiation has been a long and difficult process. It is unfortunate that the original proposal came with so many failings from the Commission, but the changes that we have now agreed will close the loopholes and make an important contribution to our security, whilst also respecting the rights of legal owners. I expect Member States to use their new powers to support those legal owners and thus avoid disproportionate restrictions.

The Weapons Directive is an issue that stirs up the feelings of many around Europe. Law-abiding and well-behaved hunters and shooters suddenly felt identified as terrorists and realized that their respective activities could in principle be banned. I understand that. As Vicky Ford said here, the proposal was presented in the greatest haste and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris, despite the fact that it was prepared in order to increase the security of Europe's citizens by closing gaps in the existing law that has existed for several years. A hastily made proposal to ban an entire category of weapons without investigating the consequences was the triggering factor. Criticism has been raised that we should focus on legislating on illegal weapons instead. However, as I see it, the Weapons Directive is not a measure to combat terrorism. It is about setting a minimum level for the laws of the EU countries, for who is allowed to use weapons and how legal weapons are to be handled within the Union. The tightening that we are taking a stand on today is about reducing the risk of legal weapons falling into the wrong hands or being used in the wrong way. For example, loopholes are being closed in terms of the rules for deactivation and marking of weapons, but also on the exchange of information between Member States, aptitude tests and stricter rules on the most dangerous weapons. The Weapons Directive does not at all oppose action against illegal weapons. On the contrary, in addition to the Weapons Directive, intensive work is also being done to deal with the illegal weapons on the black market. It is then more about operational measures such as cross-border police and customs cooperation, weapons amnesties and acquisition programs to counteract the availability of mainly military weapons from areas that have been in conflict, so that criminals or terrorists cannot reach them. The are major differences in the current regulations in the member states.Since some countries have very strict rules and others less strict, some have mandatory medical examinations, others none at all, it is obvious that we must create a better minimum level for everyone.I fully agree with what Vicky Ford has said before here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, we are here today for what I hope is the final vote by Parliament to approve the revised firearms directive. We have one shared objective, namely to cut off and limit the access of criminals and terrorists to guns. Our citizens rightly expect us to deliver on this to reinforce our collective security. That means cracking down on the trade in illegal weapons, but it also means strengthening controls on legally held firearms where there are gaps and vulnerabilities. Far from penalising legitimate gun owners and gun users, as some have suggested, by revising the directive we are in fact enlisting their support in the fight against those who misuse guns. We know that there are many law—abiding citizens who pursue hobbies involving firearms and who do not want those firearms to fall into the wrong hands. We completely respect that. The revision of the directive is not designed to stop people enjoying their pastimes, but, as we crack down on the illegal trade in weapons, we need to strengthen the rules around the acquisition, possession, storage and traceability of legal firearms. Clearer rules on marking and registration should improve traceability, providing reassurance for legal gun owners that their weapons cannot be used with impunity should they fall into the wrong hands. Like all of us, I would very much like to be able to say that criminal violence and terrorist attacks are a thing of the past. Sadly, that is not the case, so it is important not to be naive about the ongoing threat level or its likely consequences. Ensuring that criminals and terrorists do not find it easy to acquire powerful and dangerous firearms with the intention of harming our fellow citizens is a collective responsibility that encompasses both the legal and the illegal trade. The fact that the perpetrators of terrorist atrocities in the last two years were able to use modified acoustic and deactivated weapons that were bought legally was the driving force behind the Commission’s proposal to revise the directive.   En effet, la directive actuelle sur les armes à feu, qui date de 1991, comporte des failles de sécurité importantes. Ainsi, nous savons que certaines des armes à feu qui ont été utilisées dans les attaques à Charlie Hebdo étaient des armes acoustiques qui ont été transformées en armes létales. Or, la directive actuelle n’encadre pas les armes acoustiques. Nous savons également que des armes mal désactivées peuvent être réactivées et utilisées pour tuer. De même, certaines armes automatiques transformées en semi-automatiques, autorisées par la directive actuelle, peuvent, avec un peu d'expérience et des outils disponibles sur l’internet, être reconverties en armes automatiques. Il nous fallait agir d’urgence pour combler ces lacunes et renforcer la sécurité de nos citoyens.  The revised directive represents a compromise. It is well known that the Commission favoured doing more in some areas, but it was the subject of extensive discussion and I want here to recognise the work that has been done by Members of this Parliament and by the Member States to reach today’s result, and that result will significantly further strengthen security in a number of key areas, as we have heard. First, it will prohibit automatic firearms which have been transformed into semi-automatics. In addition, the directive will also ban semi-automatic firearms that have a high firing capacity: above 10 rounds for the long semi-automatic firearms, and above 20 rounds for the short ones. The Commission would have liked to go further, but recognises that the co-legislators did not support going further. Second, alarm and acoustic weapons will fall within the scope of the directive for the first time. These firearms will now need to be declared or authorised in order to ensure traceability. This is particularly important given, as we know, some of the recent attacks involved converted alarm and acoustic weapons. Third, museums and collectors will also fall within the scope of the directive. Following a request from Parliament and the Council, however, they will be allowed, subject to strict security conditions, to possess Category A firearms. Fourth, deactivated firearms must now be declared to national authorities and registered. This is key to prevent the illegal sale of reactivated firearms or parts of firearms. To complete this measure and ensure that the deactivation process is carried out in an effective and irreversible manner, the Commission proposed an implementing regulation to ensure common standards across the EU. This regulation, in force since April 2016, is currently being revised and strengthened to address technical issues flagged by some Member States, and indeed by Members of Parliament. Two rounds of expert meetings have resulted in agreement on draft revised technical specifications. These are now being stress-tested by national practitioners and experts, who will report back in late March. Provided the stress tests have not revealed any remaining major problems, the firearms committee will then be in a position formally to adopt the revised strengthened regulation by the end of April. Other important measures have also been included in the revised directive, such as stricter conditions for the online acquisition of firearms, clearer rules on the marking of firearms to improve traceability, and the establishment of a system to improve exchange of information between Member States. In revising the directive, we have sought to strike a balance. At the request of Council and Parliament, a derogation has been agreed, as we have heard, for sport shooters to acquire otherwise prohibited firearms under strict conditions, including proof of a legitimate and regular sport-shooting activity for which the weapon is required. Hunters should not be affected by the revised directive, as they would not usually use the type of firearms that will be prohibited. At the same time, we have continued to step up our action against trafficking in firearms, implementing the EU Action Plan of December 2015. That includes appointing national focal points to track, trace and gather intelligence on illegal firearms. I have written to Member States recently about this to ensure that we all implement what we have signed up to. It also means strengthening cooperation with the authorities across the Balkans to crack down on illegal trafficking in that region. That said, we need to keep working on this. The Europol Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment published last week shows that weapons trafficking remains a key crime area. Illegal firearms are increasingly available online via the Dark Net, a key facilitator for the trade in illegal firearms. So we will continue to tackle firearms trafficking as a priority under the new EU policy cycle for the years 2018 to 2021, allowing national law enforcement authorities and Europol to take coordinated action against firearms trafficking and, notably, the online trade. To conclude, I would like to thank you again for all the effort that went into achieving this balanced deal that respects legitimate users, while reinforcing our collective security. It will help further to squeeze the space in which criminals and terrorists operate and seek to do us harm. Your vote today is a key step, but the work does not end there. Once agreed, the directive will need to be implemented in Member States. The Commission stands ready to assist in this process and will closely monitor its implementation. Written Declarations of the Commission on the Proposal for a Directive amending Directive 91/477/EEC on the control and acquisition and possession of weapons 1) Written Declaration of the Commission The European Commission is satisfied that the co-legislators have reached an agreement on the revised firearm directive. These new rules will substantially reduce the likelihood of dangerous but legally held weapons falling into the hands of criminals and terrorists.  At the same time, the Commission regrets that some parts of the original proposal were not supported by the Parliament and the Council– in particular concerning semi-automatic firearms where the Commission had proposed a greater level of ambition with a complete ban of the most dangerous semi-automatic firearms, including all semi-automatic firearms of the AK47 or AR15 families. The Commission also regrets that the magazine size was not limited to 10 rounds for all semi-automatic firearms.  The Commission also stresses the importance of the proper implementation of the strict security rules relating to collectors. 2) Written Declaration of the Commission on deactivation The Commission recognises the importance of a well-functioning standard for deactivation, which contributes to improved levels of safety and gives authorities reassurance that deactivated weapons are properly and effectively deactivated. The Commission will, therefore, accelerate the work on the revision of the deactivation criteria conducted by national experts in the Committee established under Directive 477/91/EEC in order to allow the Commission  to adopt, by the end of May 2017, in accordance with the committee procedure established by directive 91/477/EEC, subject to a positive opinion by national experts, a Commission implementing  Regulation amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2403 of 15 December 2015 establishing common guidelines on deactivation standards and techniques for ensuring that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable. The Commission calls on Member States to fully support the acceleration of this work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "for the PPE Group. - Mr President!

For illegal weapons, we take other measures. It is about legal weapons not falling into the wrong hands, it has happened. It's not one or the other.

We worked a lot and with great effort, because the initial conditions were not the best possible. The previous directive was an old directive, which left significant regulatory gaps. Then, as has been said, the technical solutions adopted in the individual countries and also the culture of the relationship between citizens and weapons are very different and it was a question of bringing together, finding balance points between these conditions so far from each other. Finally, I would like to say, Commissioner, you have no responsibility - it wasn't there at the time - but the Commission proposal was a really bad proposal, very rough and above all it had the political error in itself of keeping the idea together. of the amendment of the directive to combat terrorism, which are two extremely different things. We have put a bit of order in what was there and it had the rough stretch that I commented earlier. We have restored certainty to unjustly worried people - I think of hunters, I think of sport shooters - who felt attacked, attacked: they always respected the law and here suddenly they felt put in the crosshairs of a measure that, in truth, did not concern them from the point of view. in view of compliance with the law. We have also created conditions for the market to be a regulated market and therefore does not lend itself either to promoting counterfeiting or, even less, to promoting the illicit purchase of dangerous weapons in other guises. The things you mentioned are all true, including the difficulties we had in the final phase regarding the trilogue. However, the prohibition of the two types of semi-automatic and particularly dangerous weapons was made with objective criteria, not for similarity as a category of the spirit, as requested by the Commission;and even the conversion of demilitarized automatic weapons has rightly been brought under control.Then we made some exceptions, including that of the Finnish defense system, for example, which didn't deserve to be involved in any way.We have introduced branding and blank firearms, if they come from conversion of real weapons, will also fall within the scope of the directive.In short, we put things right: we did it with patience, without exploitation and without demagogy and I consider this a very important landing point.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Richard SULÍK", "mepid": "124928", "text": "for the ECR Group.- Mr President.The Commission apparently thinks that if a terrorist wants to commit an attack, he will first obtain a firearms pass and then legally acquire a firearm.This is, of course, naive, and according to this idea, trucks, axes, machetes should also be banned, because terrorists use their instruments to commit their terrorist attacks.Restricting legal weapons because terrorists commit attacks with illegal weapons is a mistake and serves just to make the Commission even more attractive to the people of Europe.As if that wasn't enough.As if a large part of Europe's population no longer has their teeth full of these regulations and restrictions, you are just continuing.You continue on and on until the whole thing falls apart.People don't want as many restrictions from you as you think you know better than people should live.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 8, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "for the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, we all agree on one thing - we want a secure Europe. So why are we not all applauding the material that is supposed to increase security in Europe now? Why did he find opponents across the political spectrum in the Member States? Why, contrary to all expectations, have you focused on restricting the rights of legal arms holders instead of addressing real security challenges? To limit the rights of people who have not committed and are not committing any terrorist attacks. At the same time, there is so much to improve on security. We do not have clear rules for deactivating weapons. We do not have rules for various weapon conversions, and yet it is the weapons officially listed as non-functional that killed in the Bataclan club in Paris. We lack closer cooperation between Member States, which should exchange security information more quickly and efficiently. We are not able to ensure the traceability of weapons, the control of their circulation and movement between states, and I could go on. Commissioner, you recently wrote - people who do not have bad intentions do not have to be afraid of the directive. Mistake, she's scared! I meet such people regularly. They are sports and recreational shooters, hunters, but also former and current members of the security forces. Legal owners of weapons. And they are afraid of the directive. They are even worried that they will lose their weapons. Thanks to pressure from the European Parliament, the text has been largely rectified. Unfortunately, we only got halfway. In addition, we lack logical arguments for a number of measures. And if they exist, you should have submitted them. However, the Commission apparently considered the elaboration of an impact study to be unnecessary, so even today, after more than a year, we are deciding from the table and blindly. This is an irresponsible interference with the freedom of EU citizens.

At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to the shooting associations, collectors, sport shooters, hunters, museums, gun enthusiasts and over 20,000 people who e-mailed me during my work in the IMCO committee in defense of freedom, freedom from the prohibition of gun ownership. Work on this directive illustrates all the problems faced by EU legislation. From the beginning, the Commission's proposal was unrealistic and did not meet the assumed goals. Failure to assess the impact should result in an immediate rejection of the project. The final text is also unacceptable: it introduces further obstacles for law-abiding gun owners. Instead of building a positive message about weapons, we rely on negative arguments and distrust of our own citizens, who cannot decide for themselves and who are deprived of the most effective tool for self-defense. This means that the authorities are afraid of their citizens. In the preamble we find the reasons for the directive and the reference to terrorism. However, I see nothing in the rest of the text that concerns terrorists, criminals, illegal arms trafficking. Instead, I see another part of freedom taken from law-abiding citizens. Ladies and gentlemen! The reform of the European Union can only take place with the support of citizens and must be based primarily on meeting their expectations. The Czech Republic has already announced that in response to EU law, it will amend the constitution so that every law-abiding citizen has access to weapons. This is the way we should go. Free access to weapons is the only guarantee of our safety, the first and absolute anti-terrorist law.

We cannot play security and freedom off against each other - we have to find the right balance. That is why I said from the beginning - and many colleagues have supported this: we will not expose the law-abiding legal gun owners with this directive to new difficulties. And we kept our word. We organized a majority. It was a difficult discussion because gun rights are very different in the member states. The discussion is still not quite over in some Member States - you have heard a few crude voices here today. There is election campaigning in some member states. That, too, is an argument for many that cannot be ignored.

Firstly, the Commission's proposal, Commissioner, was extremely poor. You are talking here about the Commission's ambition, but that proposal, Commissioner, has caused us to vote on a failed compromise today. The original proposal bullied sports shooters, hunters, but also museum owners and administrators, collectors, etc. He certainly did not address terrorists. Here in Parliament, the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs have done their utmost with the proposal, they have really significantly improved it, and I would like to thank them. But I must say that the compromise is still unacceptable to me. The compromise further restricts legal weapons holders. Yes, there is a possible exception, states will be able to say that current gun owners will not be affected, but potential future owners who would like to buy semi-automatic weapons will not be able to do so.

Hunters, snipers and collectors are not there to close their gun barrels to rob banks or place bombs on the streets. Hunters, collectors and snipers value their weapons. Terrorists, for their part, do not buy weapons in the highly regulated market, subject to registration, which, in the end, allows their identification because of that.

The first Vice-President is actually already aware, here, but I will make sure that I report on it fully to Commissioners Bieńkowska and Avramopoulos and other colleagues who have worked on this dossier over the months. This is a difficult area and I am the first to recognise that. I understand the concerns that some of you have voiced on the importance of guaranteeing the rights of legal firearm owners such as sport shooters, hunters and collectors. Personally, I think that is what the revised Directive before you today does. Anyone needing to hold a firearm for a demonstrated legal use, such as sport shooting or for exhibiting in a museum, will still be able to do so, as a number of speakers, not least the rapporteur and other Members of Parliament who worked directly on the text, have made clear. What we are doing with this revised text is making sure that the most dangerous firearms do not fall into the wrong hands. A number of you have asked about the assessment the Commission made. Right at the start of this work, we conducted a number of studies. These were done in consultation with Member State authorities and stakeholders all across Europe, including hunting, collecting and sport shooter federations. Those studies actually pointed to some of the security loopholes in the existing Directive which, unfortunately, were confirmed in reality and which are being addressed in this text. A report based on those studies was presented to this House and the Council earlier on in this process. A number of you also asked about tackling deactivation. We agree, and that is why we are doing work to reinforce the regulation on deactivation. It is going to be revised and strengthened by national experts to address the very technical issues that had been flagged by people in this House. A number of us have spoken about the Europol study that has just come out, which addresses this area. It underlines that firearms traffickers are highly adept at exploiting legal loopholes and differences in the regulatory regimes between Member States. They do that to divert firearms from legal suppliers. The reactivation of deactivated weapons and the conversion of blank firing weapons are among the main sources of illegal firearms trafficking in the EU. That is why we need to clarify the rules. But increasing the clarity of the rules around the possession and acquisition of illegal firearms is not sufficient. Again, I am the first to recognise that. We need a comprehensive approach, including taking forward the fight against illicit firearms trafficking, as a number of you have underlined. Indeed, the Europol report that we have been referring to points to the proliferation and availability of illegal firearms in Member States and that that increases the risk of their use by criminals and terrorist groups. That is why the Commission is working closely with Member States on the implementation of the Action Plan against the trafficking of illegal weapons and explosives, and we count on your support in reinforcing that fight against illegal firearms trafficking. A number of you have underlined the importance of implementation. Again, once this revised Directive is agreed, it will need to be implemented in the Member States, and we will work with you to ensure that this is done effectively and in the spirit of the text. To conclude, I would just like to say that I hope that the revised Firearms Directive can now be adopted. We, and many of you, have done intensive work to achieve a good and balanced text that will enhance the security of our citizens, which is our shared objective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 59, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Thank you, Commissioner.

Semi-automatic firearms with a pin through the barrel were able to be bought and sold without permission. The pins were taken out of the barrel and the guns were used to kill people in Paris. Over 30 of the same guns were found in the United Kingdom. The law needed to be changed. Some people have suggested that this law will take away freedoms for legal owners: this is not true. Hunters, collectors, museums, re-enactors, reservists and target shooters will be able to carry on with their sports and hobbies, both now and in the future, provided their Member States agree. That is thanks to the work of this Parliament. We live at a time of fake news. Stop telling people half truths about what this report does. This report addresses fundamental issues to protect our security, especially about those poorly deactivated firearms.

Indeed, the package we are about to discuss and vote on today is only formally the amendment of four directives on waste. But I think that it would be absolutely reductive to relegate it to the sphere of environmental policy or to the sphere of waste policy. I think that what we have before us today is, to all intents and purposes, a package that poses a very profound challenge to us, which is the challenge of setting up a new sustainable industrial model, that is, of ensuring that environmental sustainability can be considered. one of the levers of the competitiveness of our economic system. Because we must acknowledge that the current linear development model is showing all its limits: it is an ineffective development model, it is an expensive development model, it is a development model that is no longer producing well-being for our citizens and which is exploiting the planet's resources excessively. So, today we have the opportunity to get out of this crisis and move towards the transition to a circular economy which, mind you, does not only mean recovering raw material from waste but also engaging a virtuous circle such as to create value in everything. the life cycle of a product. This, in a nutshell, means greater sustainable growth, it means jobs, it means, as I said before, relaunching competitiveness, it also means focusing on innovation and new technologies and therefore opening up our economic system to new opportunities. Of course, to do this we must have clear legislation, which favors investments and ambitious policies. There are many things I would like to say about this package but I will limit myself to the most essential ones. I must say that we started from a good proposal from the Commission, a proposal that we have however improved above all in two main lines: on the one hand, prevention in the generation of waste and, on the other, the development of an efficient market for raw materials. . In the meantime, why start with prevention measures? Not only because prevention in the generation of waste is the first level of the waste hierarchy, but because, in our view, prevention in waste generation is a clear indicator of how far we are moving towards a circular economy. Let me explain: producing less waste means having set in motion all those innovations of production processes, products, business models that tell us to what extent we are moving towards a circular economy system. Among the prevention measures I would certainly like to mention the clearer definition of end of waste or by-products, certainly the minimum requirements of extended producer responsibility, certainly specific measures along the entire useful life of the product, such as reuse and planned obsolescence. , but also, President, let me mention two ambitious but very important targets: one is the 50% reduction of food waste, which is not only an environmental policy measure but is also an ethical issue, and the other is the reduction 50% of the marine litter, which, I recall, are two objectives of the United Nations SDGs, which, however, were not foreseen in the European legislation and we have filled this vulnerability. As regards the development of the secondary raw materials market, I want to recall the targets, which we have entered, of recycling and reducing landfill, ambitious targets but, I must say, also very pragmatic, in line with the previous proposal of the Commission but also in line with the conclusions of the Commission's 2014 impact assessment itself.Clearly, the premise for having an efficient quality secondary raw material market is quality separate collection, which we have also extended to the obligation to collect organic and textile waste.We are talking about 7% of total waste and it is clear that we must close the loop by also taking industrial and commercial waste into consideration.We must not hide the fact that we are facing a challenge that requires a profound change of paradigm and the involvement of all the players, not only institutional but also businesses and consumers.But I am convinced that Parliament will be able to rise to this challenge starting with the proposal we are going to vote on today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start where Simona Bonafè also started, by thanking everybody involved in this, especially the rapporteur here in your Chamber and also, on my side, Commissioner Vella, Vice-President Katainen, and those involved in the excellent work done by our services. Some of the people concerned are sitting behind me, as are their Parliament counterparts. Their work was also of very high quality. I came to this House in December 2015 to present our ambitious programme for the circular economy, and Karmenu Vella was here in January of this year to update you on developments. I have always insisted that waste is just one part of the circle that we must tackle to achieve circular systems, but it is definitely a crucial one. We will never close the loop if we just keep throwing away or burning finite resources. The individual resources in our waste are just too valuable to burn or to bury in a hole in the ground. That is why waste reduction and modern waste management are essential parts of the material loops in a circular economy. State—of—the—art waste management is key to the success of the circular economy in Europe. Waste ceases to be a problem and becomes an opportunity when it is properly managed. Scrap contains precious materials and retrieving them creates profits and jobs, and reduces our dependency on raw material imports – a very different story from the complaints we regularly receive about hazardous, unsightly, and often illegal landfills. We are moving in the right direction. Recycling rates in the EU have been increasing. Land filling is decreasing. But Europe still loses around 600 million tons of waste materials per year, which could otherwise be recycled or reused. We can do something about this. EU waste policy and legislation have been key drivers for resource efficiency, growth and job creation. A swift adoption of the waste legislative proposals will further boost the markets for secondary raw materials and support a viable recycling sector and, what is more, the draft legislation we are discussing today has the potential to change for the better the whole life cycle of products in the wider economy. I would like, once again, to thank Simona Bonafè for her excellent work, and all the colleagues involved for their commitment and ambition and the good results that have been produced. The impressive number of amendments and the intensive discussions in Parliament have demonstrated the importance of the issue. It is equally important to agree the package so that it starts making a real difference on the ground. All the stakeholders are waiting for this and, with this package, they are all on board, which is something we also need to cherish. In December, along with the Council, we adopted together a joint declaration on the EU’s legislative priorities for 2017. The waste proposals are part of this selective list. So let us do all we can to come to a viable agreement during the first reading. There will of course – and Simona indicated this – be much focus on the target levels. I take note of the ambitious levels to which Parliament is committed. At the same time, I believe our proposals strike a good balance by setting targets that are challenging but feasible for the Member States to achieve. I am also glad to see Parliament taking into account the fact that some countries may need additional time to achieve the targets. While it is important that Member States make continuous efforts, the mechanism for granting time extensions should be simple and should ensure legal, policy and investment certainty for all involved. The levels of the targets should be seen together with the rules for calculating them: this will determine the true level of ambition. It is encouraging that both legislators have as an objective achieving the greatest possible level of comparability and a level playing field among the Member States. I share the view that the calculation rules need to be both robust and practical. This is the only way to avoid the problems of the existing legislation, which offers no methodological clarity at all. Of course, the best waste is no waste. So the priority that this House gives to waste prevention has my wholehearted support and I underscore the remarks just made by rapporteur Bonafè. I have taken note of the suggestions for a waste reduction target and for new targets for reuse, food waste and marine litter. They deserve careful consideration. This means comprehensive impact assessment, sound data and agreed methodologies. We have learned our lessons from the current waste legislation, which does not offer methodological clarity at all. We need to avoid this in the future. The waste package is also about improving the means to achieve higher recycling rates on the ground, while promoting a broader circular economy transition. More use of economic instruments can provide the right incentives to move up the waste hierarchy. At European level, more efficient and transparent extended producer responsibility rules are key to encouraging better design and production techniques to enable more efficient recycling. In this context, Parliament’s proposals to clarify and strengthen provisions resulting in better performance of waste management systems on the ground are most welcome. Last but not least, I note the very wide range of initiatives that Parliament would like to see in the waste area in the near future. We are looking forward to discussing these with you and the Council, but let me say the following at this stage: I believe that we should set clear priorities in this work, examine where we have sufficiently developed methodologies available, and agree realistic deadlines. In order to ensure tangible results on the ground we need to focus our efforts. Much has been achieved. I very clearly recall the antagonistic position that we – the Commission and Parliament – had at the beginning of this process of re-evaluating our waste proposals, and I am therefore very happy that we are in such a cooperative, forward—looking mood today. I will do everything in my power to make sure that we stay as close as possible to Parliament’s position in this.

We have to tell people that it's no longer about burying anything, but about reusing things, for the benefit of our children and grandchildren, because in ten or twenty years they may no longer be raw materials have to build certain things. That is why I think we are at a point here, at a turning point - Mrs Bonafè, you explained that wonderfully that we have to wake up. It is not always about the last percentage recycling rate, but about the awareness of this society that we can better recycle and recycle our raw materials. 60% of our fuels and raw materials are burned by us. It's a shame, we can't let it go on like this. And the prices are skyrocketing. Neodymium cost $ 25,000 seven years ago, today neodymium costs $ 700,000.

The way forward is to integrate resource efficiency in the way we do business. What we are speaking about today is not only the environment or the economy – we are also managing to bridge the gap and bring both of them together. We need to arrive at a point where the waste of one business becomes the resource of another; where the output of one industry becomes the input of another. The resources we have out there are all we have; they are finite. This is the reason why we cannot continue building an economy that uses things up and creates waste. We need an economy that uses and reuses things. This is our chance to inspire young people, who see new openings where others see challenges. This is their opportunity to be creative and innovative, and to help rebuild an entire system that actually works. The transformation required will not come about through legislation alone. We need smart regulation, together with market-based instruments, innovation and incentives. Investors need a clear and positive signal and regulatory certainty, because this in turn will help create jobs.

The EU is heavily dependent on third countries for the import of raw materials. Many of these raw materials are in danger of being exhausted in the relatively short term. Yet we handle it very carelessly. Every European citizen produces about five tons of waste every year - the weight of an adult African elephant. We only recycle a third of that. Our mountain of waste is growing, while precious raw materials all too often disappear underground. We must break through that dynamic and commit resolutely to a circular economy, in which we recover valuable raw materials. This is not only good for the environment, it is also necessary to keep our economy competitive. Recycling more and turning landfill into an ending story is essential, but better recycling alone is not enough. If we really want to switch to a circular economy, we must also focus effectively on less waste, more reuse and closing cycles through innovative business models. Everyone should participate, including the producers. In addition, one unique measurement method for calculating the recycling figures must ensure that we no longer compare apples with pears and that everyone takes their responsibility. Flanders, the nation I represent, is a pioneer in the field of materials management and the circular economy. The trajectory we have taken over the past twenty years strengthens my belief that much is possible if there is the political will. We can learn a lot from each other. I am thinking, for example, of our best practices, such as the concept of “thrift shops” to encourage reuse and innovative ways to valorise biological waste.

This expedition into the world of waste has been very interesting in many ways. Among other things, it has been an expedition into reality, and I have had the opportunity to visit various facilities, both at home in Finland and in other parts of Europe. The interesting thing in this context is that reality has proven to have taken several steps forward. Today, we are far more advanced in terms of reusing our waste than we were perhaps just a year ago. I have visited a small factory that manufactures waste containers. It is probably Europe's foremost factory. Through the technological solution, it achieves a sorting of the waste that leads to a purity in the consequences of 98 percent. Thus, by following the examples we already see, we can achieve an incredibly much cleaner waste stream. So a lot is happening out there, and we should not fall behind.

Why vote today for these more ambitious waste recycling targets, why go for a lower waste disposal rate. I will try to explain this with the example of a cartoon. Wall-e is an Oscar winner in which he shows how one small robot, the only one of its kind, collects waste, packs it and stacks it in pyramids. Will the achievements of our civilization be pyramids of waste, and we know what the achievements of Egyptian civilization were. And look at the miracles, that little robot recognizes the circular economy because the things it recognizes that it can fix, that they have some other value, it takes to its shelter, repairs it there, and enjoys those remnants of our civilizational heritage. And the question actually arises as to where the people are in that film. Humans fled into space because they used the entire space of the planet earth to dump waste to build these pyramids. The question is how will we then escape into space. Donald Trump seems to have a solution to this problem. A few days ago, he announced that he was reviving the space program and that he intended to send people to the moon. But, by the way, we must not forget that in addition to this recycling, in addition to disposal, we throw away too much food, we dump our waste in the sea and oceans, we forget that we have biodegradable waste from which we can produce energy and compost, we forget that this ambitious circular proposal economy, these goals, actually represents the creation of our local jobs and in all those Member States that are protesting, it actually represents the creation of local jobs.

We deplored a lack of flexibility, given the diversity of the situation in the European Union. We have noted that the definite consequence would be the increase in public spending and the deepening of the internal market, to the benefit of a few rare transnational entities, without any guarantee of efficiency. But I would especially like to mention EPR, that is to say the extended responsibility of the producer. Come to think of it, this REP considers that, in the entire manufacturing cycle of a product, the tailoring stage of the actual production is the real problem.

If we had worked on the original proposal further, we could have come to this conclusion.

We do something for the environment; I would just like to emphasize two points: When waste is dumped, methane is generated - methane is a worse greenhouse gas than CO2. And in my country, the largest single contribution to climate protection in recent years has come from the fact that we have less landfill. So that's at least as important as other things in climate protection. And we urgently need to address the problem of plastic and other substances littering the oceans. We make a contribution to both. But it's also about our children's raw materials, as Karl-Heinz Florenz always says, and it's about jobs, it's about jobs that we can safeguard and create through a sensible circular economy. Finally, I would like to point out a point where I believe we are improving the Commission proposal and making it less bureaucratic.

The ENVI Committee also called for a minimum of 5% of total municipal waste to be prepared for reuse, a binding target of 80% of packaging to be recycled, and a 10% target of packaging waste to be reused by 2030. I believe that the European Parliament has to send a strong message to the Commission and the Council and stick to this high ambition level, in line with the previous Commission proposal for the package, as this is the only way to trigger action in the Member States. Dear Mr Timmermans, this is not exaggeration, this is simply the level of braveness of the previous Barroso Commission.

It is important to respect the waste hierarchy at all times to avoid shortcuts that may favor some options over others. When it comes to setting new targets, it seems essential to me that there are clear concepts and definitions. This is how we will ensure that all data and methodologies are comparable and comparable. The Waste Directive has to draw a clear distinction between municipal waste, on the one hand, and commercial and industrial performance, on the other. That is why I want to ask for support for Amendment 251, which includes the quantity criterion in the definition of municipal waste. Eliminating this word in the definition may mean opening the door, including industrial commercial waste in municipal waste.

This Parliament wanted it, the meeting is there, and I thank Mrs Bonafè for all the work she was able to do. Basically, when we look at the future of the European economy, the question of the circular economy is a very central question. But it cannot be just circular, it must also be united. For this, the place of companies in the social and solidarity economy must be at the heart of the strategy we are implementing. This is what Mrs Bonafè's report does and I thank her for it. The fact remains that, when we talk about municipal waste for which we set targets, I believe that it is a completely winning strategy, but for it to really be so, we must ensure that, in these municipal waste, which today constitutes a large part of household congestion - namely waste electrical and electronic equipment - is included in these quotas which could be reused or reused. From this point of view, in many situations, there are logistics platforms for producers, which means that this waste is perhaps not automatically considered as household waste.

This is actually the summary of what is important in this file, and this means that it is the beginning of a number of more steps to come. After all, it cannot only be about waste, it must of course also be about the design of our products and how our economy converts this into a truly circular experience.

Our waste package is part of our circular economy package and the circular economy package is part of a much broader societal change leading to a sustainable society. Part of that is a sustainable economy, sustainable social systems and a sustainable environment.  Sometimes in our work it is nice to do things, but here it is necessary to do things. I maintain that the longer we wait with the waste package and the less ambitious we are with the waste package, the higher the cost will be. We need to make this transition anyway, so we had better do it quickly. It is my true belief – and I have been around for a couple of decades – that, if Europe takes the lead – even if it makes ambitious choices – the rest of the world will follow. We saw it with the norms we had in the internal market and we will see it with the norms we have on waste. I am absolutely sure about this.  Those countries that are worried because they are lagging behind should actually be comforted by the fact that, if you are lagging behind, the changes that you make will have an even greater impact than the changes made by countries which are leading. By the way, EFSI funds are available for investment in this, so, if you make the investment, the gains will be huge and you will make the transition to a sustainable economy more quickly than others. We are simplifying things because we are reducing four methodologies into one methodology, which creates clarity for everyone involved.  Finally, let me say this: in the approach that we have chosen, we have been inclusive from the start. This is the first time that I can see that everybody who is a stakeholder in this is on board. Sadly, in this peculiar world of ours, it takes three to tango, as we know. Now, after you have voted, Parliament and the Commission will have to confront the Council and make sure that we get Member States and the Council on board for an ambitious plan, but again I think that the Commission’s proposals are the best basis for this. I applaud Parliament for being more ambitious. The more ambition we can get through with the Council, the better it works. We will try to do this together with you in the next couple of months.

But how, therefore, can a man of Mr Verhofstadt’s integrity in good conscience carry out and fulfil all his responsibilities in his four outside jobs and be the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator?

For example, horses are a fundamental part of farms but their use is also growing in other sectors, different from the traditional ones of agriculture and sport. Horses are increasingly used in tourism and in the training sector, for example, they are animals with extraordinary qualities for rehabilitation for the disabled, for the education of children, for the training of children with difficulties. The presence of horses in increasingly disparate contexts, however, exposes them to risks for their health and well-being. For this, I believe, an ever greater institutional commitment is necessary for their protection and control. In my region, Sicily, there are some important realities that work for the increase in horse racing but, at the same time, there are very serious cases of exploitation such as the phenomenon of clandestine races run by the mafia.

The equine sector in the Union has great economic potential, creating jobs and contributing to many sectors: sports, research, medicine and food production. For this reason, in recent years the high demand for equidae has led to uncontrolled reproduction of lower quality animals. Many Member States have seen a significant increase in the abandonment of equidae, and hence more abuse and suffering of equidae. The report includes a package of measures to improve and combat the welfare of equidae.

the Vice—President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, honourable Members, I am here on behalf of my dear colleague, Commission Vice-President/High Representative Federica Mogherini. As you know, President Donald Trump has reinstated the Mexico City Policy with a presidential memorandum issued on 23 January. This policy requires foreign non-governmental organisations to certify that they will not ‘perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning,’ as a condition for receiving US global health assistance. This also includes NGOs receiving funds from outside the US. The policy, when in effect, applies to foreign NGOs as a condition for receiving US family planning support, either directly or indirectly. So the Commission is concerned about the possible implications for our objective of achieving universal coverage in health and reproductive health services, particularly in developing countries. Eventually, this decision might also impact on our Sustainable Development Goals, targets to reduce maternal mortality, and to empower women to take more informed decisions about their health. In the poorest countries of the world, this can put the lives of young women and girls at risk. And we do not want the progress that we have made over the past decade on women’s rights to be lost. Let me be clear: European Union policies are driven by our own priorities and values, not by what others do or stop doing. As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, what I can say, as the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid, is that our approach is based on needs. Our humanitarian partners which consider that abortion would be appropriate are not prevented from doing so. We have never issued instructions to the contrary. A decision on abortion will depend on various factors: the woman’s wishes after she has received all relevant information, definitely her condition, and the legal framework of the country, of course, which could influence the security of both the woman and humanitarian workers. In this context, decisions on how to treat women and girls are always better left to doctors. It is not something for lawyers to prescribe. Let me add that we are also continuing our work to prevent sexual and gender-based violence. Focusing on the treatment of violence can only ever be a second-best. Prevention is also the reason why we have strengthened the place of gender in our humanitarian aid. Over the past decade, the Commission has allocated around EUR 200 million annually from the humanitarian budget to healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health. In parallel, my dear colleague, Commissioner Neven Mimica, issued a press statement on 1 February 2017 underlining that the Commission will continue to play a leading role in ensuring women’s access to health and family planning services around the world. He also attended the ‘She Decides’ event on 2 March 2017 and reiterated our commitment. Several governments and private philanthropists have pledged nearly USD 200 million for family planning services. We are also assessing the potential impact of a loss of funding for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). The funding gap could be large. Together with Member States and civil society in particular we are analysing the US contribution to the fund in order to determine the best approach to take. We remain strongly committed to supporting global health initiatives such as UNFPA, into which we are putting EUR 20 million for 2016 and 2017; and also the Global Fund, to which we have pledged EUR 475 million for 2017 to 2019. Or GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, to which we have pledged EUR 200 million for 2016 to 2020; and the partnership programme with the World Health Organisation and Luxembourg, worth EUR 28 million, for 2016 to 2018. The informal foreign affairs and development ministerial meeting on Thursday will enable this matter to be addressed.

I strongly condemn the newly instated global gag rule. We had an alarm call from Africa, through Asia to Latin America, on the serious consequences for the health of hundreds of thousands of women and girls globally. Today my thoughts really go to all these women and girls who are at risk of losing a very important health programme. This also applies to the Zika virus, AIDS prevention, on prenatal and postnatal basic assistance for babies and young women, victims of rape, and victims of female genital mutilation. The risk is that women’s mortality is going to increase and that there will be more illegal and unsafe abortion. Last week we were marking the International Day of Women. We met fantastic women from Tunisia, Morocco, Kosovo, all over the world. We were told terrible stories of a woman that was found with a piece of a television antenna in her uterus because she wanted to interrupt her pregnancy. Another one had drunk pesticide and died. This is not to mention the victims of Isis and Daesh slavery, and the girls that come back, having been released from Boko Haram, and who are refused into their communities and cannot in the new circumstances get assistance for their basic health and reproductive rights and for their children. What we are talking about is not whether you are for abortion or against abortion. We are talking about humanitarian law: health, safety, child protection and women’s rights are human rights. No woman or girl should have to risk her life to have a baby. That is what we are talking about. There is a chorus of concern that is coming from NGOs, Save the Children and the United Nations. Europe has to step in. This is our opportunity to show leadership. Trump’s sexism is as bad as the problem that we have with security in Europe and with free trade with the new administration. I am glad that the ‘She Decides’ campaign has been so successful. I am glad that today we have voted to devote European funds to compensate for this setback. I hope that more pledges will come, and the test is going to be next week at the United Nations Conference on the status of women. I call on Member States to do their part and to raise their voice.

This is a debate we should not really be having, because a woman’s access to family planning should not be a political football to be given and withdrawn depending on who is in government. In particular, it does not seem right to me that it is a decision that has been taken by people who will not be affected by it. People here will not be affected by this decision, and certainly the men who surrounded President Trump when he signed it into law will not be affected by this decision. It is the poor women in the world, and the poorest countries in the world, who will pay the price – the women we heard from at the ‘She Decides’ conference on 2 March. So if we are serious – as the Commissioner said – about the SDGs and gender equality, we cannot afford the cuts that have been talked about. An estimated 225 million women globally lack access to modern contraception. Every day, 830 women die from preventable causes linked to pregnancy and childbirth. That is over 30 an hour. It is one since I started speaking to you. As we have just heard from Mrs Corazza Bildt, no family planning means other problems, such as HIV and other issues. Let us make no mistake about it: cutting this funding does not mean fewer abortions. All the evidence from the last period when the gag was in place shows that the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions increased when the global gag came in. Mrs Corazza Bildt has just told us about the consequences and what happens to women when that happens. So this policy is not a success story, and that is why she said that we must step in. But we must also step up now. So what can we do here in the EU to counter this policy? Well, we voted today. We voted for the report by Claire Moody this morning with a very big majority, calling for EU funds to counter the cuts caused by the global gag. We can support the ‘She Decides’ initiative, and I pay tribute here to Lilianne Ploumen and the Swedish, Danish and Belgian Ministers who organised that conference and brought over 50 countries together to raise funding. We can also look at our own wider funding and prioritise SRHR spending in our own plans. We have got a review of the DCI coming up and of the EDF in the mid—term. Let us look at what we are doing already. Commissioner, you indicated that the Commission was willing to do this and will be talking about it in the Council on Thursday with Ministers. I hope you will come back soon and tell us that the funding is being made available and that we will back the ‘She Decides’ initiative. Looking around this room, many of us here – mainly women here, but men as well – have made choices about our own fertility and if and when to have children. It is not a first world right, it is a right for every woman, wherever she lives. Commissioner, I know that you will be supportive on this, but we need the support of the whole Commission and Ministers to make sure that women are not let down after this gag comes into place.

So my opinion is, why would anyone – especially those calling themselves feminists – complain that a global abortion industry is losing some of its funding? Why are EU Member States wanting to step up and fund a practice that harms women and babies? That is genocidal, economically disastrous and anti-democratic, anti-feminist and anti-woman. And if someone has a different opinion, if President Trump decided on a different approach, it would have to be respected. There are reasons. And also there are reasons which come from reverence: reverence to life, reverence to dignity of life, reverence to the right to be born and to live, and reverence to those who cannot speak for themselves – for those who are unborn yet and cannot speak for themselves. So I strongly disagree with the Commission’s intent to spend millions to export this barbarism to developing nations. Abortion has no healthcare benefits. There are none. And it cannot be called health care. Abortion is not a health initiative, as Commissioner Stylianides has named it, because it cannot be called a basic health care.

But maybe I would rather address the citizens of the European Union, who should understand that the agenda of the so-called populist parties is not just about nationalism, anti-EU or national sovereignty; it is also very much about sexism and misogyny. It is against women’s rights. So keep that in mind when you go to the ballot box, and know what you vote for – like the Trump administration, who reinstated and expanded the gag rule, and the Helms amendment, which was still in the background. It is very necessary that the European Union gives a strong response, and I very much welcome the very positive attitude of the European Commission. You have our support, because the European Union must not only accept standards imposed by third countries; we must lead in the world, we must set the standards. We are the strongest actor in the world, and we have to make sure that we impose the standards and do not accept. That is why I very much welcome the ‘She Decides’ initiative. It sends a very strong signal to the Trump administration and women around the world. We need to go further. First of all, I would like to ask the European Commission about the 2015 letter about women who are pregnant as a result of rape in conflict, and you consider that that is covered by international humanitarian law. But now we need to make sure that these guidelines are actually transmitted through the practitioners in the field so that people know that they have the backing. Women should know what their rights and their options are, so I would call on the Commission to do this proactively. Secondly, we need to fill the funding gap that was left by President Trump, but not only in response to him reinstating the gag rule. But it has to be structural. If we want to lead, it has to be structural. Finally, we are going to table amendments to the budget this year in order to strengthen the funding.

Every Republican presidential administration in the United States has introduced this gag rule, but this one is worse than most others. It goes even further. It restricts virtually all support for women's sexual and reproductive health. Good sexual and reproductive health is a matter of life and death for women around this globe. However, it is also a question of being able to live a whole or being able to live a half life, to have control over one's body and sexuality or not to have it. This gossip rule implies such deep contempt for women, for our health and for our well-being. But just like our colleagues from the US who work for Pro-choice said: We will not be silent, we will not be gagged. Just as different Member States stand up for women's rights, the EU must now do the same. I welcome the She Decides initiative. That is part of the answer, but it is not enough. It is too quiet from the Commission, and it is too quiet from the Council. My question is what the EU will do, not only at the political level but also in terms of funding. The European Parliament has acted. We have voted in both the previous and this part-sessions. We want to see more funding, increased funding for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights. Now, however, we want to see the Council and the Commission also act. We need clear recommendations to our partner organizations on how to ensure that they will be able to continue to perform important and vital abortion care. We need to increase the development assistance budget for women's health and sexual and reproductive health and rights. I would like to say this, namely that one's commitment and sincerity are put to the test when it is discouraged. If the EU is serious about women's rights, it is now time to step forward and take concrete action. We must therefore condemn the EU's gag rule, we must take the fight in international forums, and we must shoot for more money!

Mr President, all the pretexts seem to be good in this hemicycle to attack the new American president whom you are devoting to complaining, just as you do not stop hurling anathemas against the Russian president, on the grounds that he has a family policy in his country that does not suit you. I understand your frustration at seeing your model of society rejected and I welcome it. The United States will no longer seek to impose on the rest of the world, through NGOs, such as international family planning, political standards inherited from the Cultural Revolution of May 1968. And that is good news. The American desire to upset traditional family structures and its aggressive promotion of urbi et orbi abortion were indeed not acceptable. But the European Union clearly does not have that wisdom. Mr. Trump's reinstatement of the \"Mexico City policy\" - adopted by Republican presidents since Reagan and banning funding for pro-abortion NGOs - is a sign that our old world is falling apart, and it scares you. So much so, moreover, that the French socialist government felt obliged to pass a law aimed at banning websites which simply presented solutions other than abortion. Moreover, at that time I did not hear the usual advocates of tolerance being indignant at this obvious attack on freedom of expression. In contrast, to lecture Mr. Trump to justice, the left, its cohort of ideologized associations, and the weak right are all set in motion. But it is the strictest right of the United States to choose its own criteria for funding NGOs. The European authorities, together with the media and politicized associations, do not have to use this affair to harm the American president, democratically elected, I remind you.

The key in these documents is that abortion is not a method of family planning and money is denied exclusively to organizations that promote abortion as a method of family planning. The funds have not disappeared or been reduced, as it is wrongly stated, they are still there and will be received by organizations dealing with the health of women and children. Abortion that saves the mother's life is not subject to this policy. Also, abortion in cases of rape or incest is not covered by this prohibition, nor is post-abortion care. There is no financial gap to be filled when it comes to funding family planning services. The financial gap was created only in relation to abortion as a method of family planning, which is prohibited by law in most developing countries.

We have to remain alert on this issue. But also let me reiterate once again: our action is not dependent on others. And I would like to be clear: our policies are driven by our own priorities and by our own values, not by what others do or stop doing.

And of course, I count also on your – the European Parliament’s – support to reinforce the budgets. My final point, last but not least. Some colleagues referred to the need to inform our partner organisations on the ground. As far as I am concerned we have over 200 humanitarian partners on the ground, in the humanitarian and development field, registered in the EU. And they know better what to do on the ground to help women in need. I have witnessed their knowledge and their action in my missions on the ground around the world. On the other hand, our partners work with local implementing organisations. If there is an information gap there, I stand ready to discuss with our partners how best to address this without compromising humanitarian access and the overall safety of the people in need and of the humanitarian workers.

The promotion and protection of human rights is central in our external action. It is consistent with our values, but also with our interest to foster resilience for societies in our region and beyond. I would like to thank the European Parliament for its continuing support in this area. The international community asks governments to respect human rights as universal, indivisible, independent and interrelated values. All fundamental freedoms should be universal. I am therefore proud to say that the European Union is in the lead on many key debates in the Human Rights Council in the General Assembly. Looking at the ongoing session of the Human Rights Council, we will run the regular EU resolution on freedom of religion or belief. This is a complex resolution aimed at promoting a universal approach to religion or belief. We also continue to work with the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation to ensure a good relationship with their resolution on defamation of religion. We will also run, with our partners in the Latin American and Caribbean Group, a resolution on the rights of the child. Our focus shall be on the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the objective of leaving no child behind. Let me now refer to the specific situation in some countries. The conflict in Syria remains the most serious humanitarian crisis facing the world. The European Council has stated several times that the situation in Syria should be referred to the International Criminal Court, calling on the UN Security Council to take action. With regard to the situation in Ukraine, we are accompanying the government’s reform agenda. At the same time, we continue to focus on the reports by the Office of the High Commission for the Human Rights Monitoring Mission, as well as the grave situation in the illegally-annexed Crimea peninsula. Now on the Democratic Republic of North Korea. We will co-present with Japan a strong resolution calling for accountability and extending the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The resolution will also reflect developments such as the UN Security Council meeting in December, the well-supported UNGA resolution and the new report from the group of experts on accountability. On Myanmar, the goal of our resolution remains stopping the ongoing violations of human rights in several regions of the country, in particular against persons belonging to the Rohingya population in Rakhine State. In light of the high rate of application of the death penalty in Iran, and with an eye to improving the human rights situation in the country, we will support the extension of the mandate of the Special Representative. Allow me one final word on migration. We all know how delicate this issue is and how exposed to abuses these men, women and children can be on their long and dangerous journeys. For this reason, we are working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and with the International Organisation for Migration to improve the living conditions of migrants and refugees all along the routes. No other power is as engaged as we are in the protection of the rights of migrants.

Regimes of various kinds are exacerbating repression and I express serious concern over the deteriorating situation of civil society in many places, including the media, as a result of adopting solutions that are also stigmatizing, for example, saying that they are allegedly external or foreign agents. Many human rights activists, including journalists, bloggers, representatives of NGOs, are imprisoned or subjected to various kinds of repression. This also applies to human rights defenders who have been awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that in the resolution we emphasize the difficult situation in terms of freedom of religion and belief. Also not for the first time: the Middle East, North Africa, some Asian countries too. In this work, we support the European Union's special envoy for the freedom of religion and belief, Jan Figel. We also support the standing rapporteur of the UN Human Rights Council on Freedom of Religion and Belief, Ahmed Shaheed. Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world today. There are particularly dramatic situations in the Middle East and Africa. We must make every effort to end this exodus of Christians, but also of followers of other religions. The world must learn from these atrocities, and the need for justice and reconciliation cannot be replaced by the logic of revenge. In the resolution, we support the activities of the International Criminal Court. We call here again - thank you for this declaration, Commissioner - regarding the efforts in the United Nations to punish those crimes that are genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The issue of people with disabilities will also be discussed during the ongoing session of the Human Rights Council. This is an important topic that must be dealt with more extensively by Parliament. We joined this topic, which is a priority of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament. The delegation will be in Geneva on March 21, among others, which is the Day of Down syndrome. There will also be young people who suffer from it. The session of the Human Rights Council is also a time of bilateral contacts, including with special envoys and rapporteurs who deal with problem areas or countries. We are also continuing our support for the abolition of the death penalty. We also want Ukraine and the situation in this neighboring country to be regulated, to improve the humanitarian situation in Donbass, so that one and a half million internally displaced people can obtain the status of people who can live with dignity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 272, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Soraya POST", "mepid": "124997", "text": "for the S&D group. - Madam President! Dear colleagues! Next week, we will be sending a delegation from the European Parliament to Geneva to present our common position on the state of human rights in the world. I would like to start with the most important thing: the EU must now, more than ever before, defend, promote and strengthen with a clear voice what is the origin and framework of EU peace and peaceful co-operation between countries. We have a super tool in our hands, the realization of human rights. Let's seriously start using this now. The EU must also work closer to the UN, especially with regard to the UN's various human rights mechanisms. This is a much more important collaboration than issues of internal market or common currency. Understand me correctly: Questions about economics are central, but we must remember that they are only tools, not an end in themselves. The goal must be a policy that gives every human being security and freedom every day. When we look out over the world today, we see increased tensions, belligerence, occupation and outright war. Patriarchal logic and rhetoric say that we must fight hard, that we must protect borders and defend ourselves, increase defenses, establish military alliances, prepare for war. We hear these arguments swirling around our legs in an attempt to make us fall over. What we see from history, however, is that this patriarchal logic of agitation does not create increased security and safety, on the contrary. It leads us to war and destruction and dehumanization. It leads to a situation where we can in some inhuman way justify seeing children die and women raped to defend a hill. Involving women in the building of societies that have suffered a conflict is a cornerstone in seeking reconciliation to move forward as a human being. Here it is incredibly important that we do not allow perpetrators to move on in life without punishment. Providing redress for victims is central to the peace process. Even in peacetime, women's rights become strong questioned.Our sexual and reproductive rights face loud opposition.Like violence, this resistance strikes directly at the core of our freedom - the freedom to rule over our own bodies.Here we must take a clear stand on the right to be a human subject.We see the same alarming development with regard to the death penalty.Several countries have broken their deadlines in executions, and some are also discussing reintroducing the death penalty.Here, the EU and the UN must be clear with their zero acceptance of state executions.Everyone has the right to life.In short, we are seeing a growing global opposition to human rights.Its defenders face more and more threats and are exposed to both prosecution and slander.The way forward requires courage and a clear stance on human rights.That is the courage the EU must now show.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 273, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Bas BELDER", "mepid": "4507", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - One question has actually occupied me for years: is there still a future for Christians in the Middle East? This is a revealing, depressing hot topic in panel discussions today. Consider, for example, the exchange of views at the Munich Security Conference less than a month ago. When I speak to insiders in the region about the future of Christians in Syria and Iraq, I hear bleak scenarios: hardly any future. At the same time a nightmare for Christians in the Arab neighboring countries, eagerly looking for escape routes if things should go wrong in their own country. I am thinking of Jordan, for example. That leads me to the honest, urgent question to the European Union: which priority - because today it is about priorities - do the fundamental rights and human rights of Eastern Christians enjoy within our international position? With the follow-up question: if that is really the case, what concrete strategy does the EU use to stop the exodus of Christians in the Middle East? By the way, at the aforementioned conference in Munich, a prominent German politician spoke without detours about “Christocide” in the Middle East. Her and my pressing question to ourselves, to the EU: are we passively watching this humanitarian catastrophe? I end with a ray of hope. At the beginning of this month, Yezidis, Turkmen, Shabak and Christians in Iraq united in a new initiative, al-Rafidein: the land of two rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. It is a plea for an autonomous peaceful region for these minorities in Iraq.

Firstly, protection of all human rights defenders in all forms of their expression – online and offline. Secondly, fighting back oppressive laws and systematic practices contributing to the shrinking space for civil society, which includes rights to free and impartial media. Thirdly, international humanitarian law: we cannot allow any more hospitals to be bombed, and must ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need in war-stricken areas as well.  In addition, ALDE calls to stop impunity for all States, to comply with ICC and make perpetrators accountable. We are all concerned by the resurgence of death penalties in many countries, especially in the Gulf, and call for a moratorium on the death penalty. More specifically, I should stress the appalling situation of Raif Badawi, the Sakharov Prize winner. He remains in prison and his health condition is unknown, and his relatives are not allowed to meet him.

Perhaps we will have a resolution, but one modeled on the Council's position which, too, has hardly taken into account the priorities of the agenda of the HRC. I noted a surprising paragraph on the importance for the European Union of international refugee law and, more broadly, of the human rights of migrants. It is noted that the determination of the European Union to guarantee the right to asylum remains unshakeable, of which act. The Council recalls the importance of the interdependence of human rights, but nothing on the main subjects of the CHR in this area: terrorists and human rights, human rights and the environment, democracy and the rule of law and human rights. The development of a binding international legal instrument for companies is also an essential instrument, in particular to respond to the climate emergency. But we know today that the Member States are all against it. There is nothing on the Durban Declaration and the fight against racism and nothing on Palestine.

I believe that no objective assessment can be made here. I am particularly interested in two countries: One is Western Sahara, which is in danger of being forgotten by the rest of the world. I remind you of the judgment of the ECJ: it banned the EU's trade agreement from extending to Western Sahara. The Commission had great difficulty accepting this judgment at all. Now is really the time to do that with all the consequences. These people need our help! Let me remind you that the part where you can do business in Western Sahara is occupied by Morocco and that the people who were born there who were residents of that country have no access to these sources, even if they do Somehow they only express the slightest criticism, they disappear into torture prisons, where it happens that I cannot describe it here. The second thing I wanted to address - very briefly - is the situation in Palestine.

I cannot fail to mention also the case of Western Sahara and the ruling of the Court of Justice which would certainly push us to do more, not only in words but also in deeds. However, I would like to underline an aspect that is the formal one, of the method, if we want, because even today a system for monitoring fundamental rights at a global level is very far from being what it should be: it is never possible that we continue to elect members of the Human Rights Council among champion countries of human rights violations, such as Egypt, China and Saudi Arabia? Is it possible that European countries do not coordinate from this point of view?

Here we talk about human rights but never about the rights of peoples: for example, as mentioned by my colleague Belder, the rights of religious freedom of Eastern Christians. What does the UN do? What do all these agencies do that spend two thirds of their budget not already on assisting and helping refugees, etc. but to pay the salaries and luxury of five-star officials? It is no coincidence that a great American columnist defined this large bandwagon a \"humanitarian jet\". And then let's see to whom the assistance is provided: it is, in reality, a mass of dictatorships, satraps and corrupt and spendthrift dictators, whom we see arriving in Europe in large cars with great luxury, in large hotels and we finance all of this! What is the UN doing to put an end to the most serious tragedy we have before our eyes, that of the transport of human flesh in the Mediterranean: its presence in Libya is ghostly; yet, there would be a lot to do there. Why does the UN ask for the intervention of the International Criminal Court against Isis, against the massacres, even on a cultural level, against the tragedies that the Islamic State creates: because it is afraid or because it is in awe of the countries that finance it? Well, it seems clear to me that the concern of the leaders of the United Nations is rather that of having the vote, the support and the contributions of all the nations that support it and this of the money seems to me to be an issue that conditions a lot and unmasks the hypocrisy of this body that always talks to us about human rights, but then, as happened in Rwanda, turns its head away and does not intervene.

In this context, I want to emphasize three points. First, I believe that more action should be taken at the international level to draw attention to the growing difficulties that civil society organizations and human rights defenders are facing in several third countries. From Russia to Venezuela, including some countries in our neighborhood, or even candidate countries for enlargement, human rights defenders are increasingly threatened and prevented from doing their work. I particularly want to draw attention to the plight of journalists who are quite often put under pressure. To counteract this tendency, we need - I believe - to sound a red flag every time the laws are manipulated by politicians to silence civil society or - as I said - journalists. Secondly, I stress the importance of reflecting at the international level, on the best way to bring justice to the victims of Daesh and therefore to judge the crimes that this organization is committing. As the resolution makes clear, the European Union can play a key role in this process - I recall that in the DROI sub-committee we are currently preparing a report which will address this issue. Thirdly, I support the priorities mentioned, in terms of countries, in the Council conclusions as well as in the resolution we are going to vote on tomorrow. Whether it is Ukraine, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Belarus or Iran, the human rights situation in these countries must remain on the agenda. international. On the question of the occupied Palestinian territories, I regret the fact that a separate agenda item - number 7 - is devoted to discussing only Israel.

If we look closely, we can say that the euphoria for human rights still exists, but it takes on the most nuanced tones of hope in many places on the planet, where rights are invoked because they do not exist. It becomes disappointment if they are deformed by rampant relativism or by a senseless and guilty political realism and it turns into a critique of human rights when they do not give what they promise, because they are hindered in their implementation and denied or betrayed by unjust laws. In short, human rights have filled the world but the world is now finding itself increasingly poor in rights. We would like to start from here, from this new awareness, from this new approach, looking at the annual meeting of the DROI delegation at the UN Human Rights Council during the spring session The Council document identifies some priorities, both thematic and territorial, towards which we should direct the greatest efforts to improve the situation in terms of respect for human rights.

Among the many noteworthy issues mentioned in the resolution, I would like to reiterate above all the urgent urgency to intervene in favor of human rights defenders, who are struggling to defend the environment and people from the speculations of governments and multinationals, continuing to suffer numerous and serious attacks in various parts of the world. It is essential that the European Union, the United Nations and all international actors show concrete and constant closeness to this category of heroes of our day, who often carry out their work which should be done instead by the institutions that abandon them. What are we doing, for example, to support them and to support those who are fighting against land grabbing? What are we doing to put a stop to the excessive power of multinationals that devastate the environment, the territory and the very life of entire local populations? Eight months ago, we approved a report, of which I was the rapporteur, which provided for corporate responsibility for serious violations of human rights in third countries. We are waiting for a beginning, something from the Commission that has not yet arrived. From the point of view of the nations, we decided not to support this resolution because it was an opportunity to come out strong and decisive against human rights violations committed by anyone, while in reality it turned into an opportunity to point the finger at someone. .", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 286, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Gilles LEBRETON", "mepid": "124738", "text": "- Madam President, the European Union has rightly expressed concern to the United Nations Human Rights Council about the restrictions on freedom of expression in several countries around the world, particularly in Turkey .

It is precisely because human rights are a long-term struggle that we, as the Union, must continue to work firmly in order to defend and promote them. I have always asked myself the following question: what is our strength, what is the added value of our action? And this is where it gets tricky. It is the balance between action, there now, in an emergency, and at the same time, long-term commitment, investment in the future. Acting simultaneously on these two levels makes our actions sometimes delicate, but our responsibility is greater and we must have the courage to do it on the \"there, now\", by firmly denouncing the harassments, violent attacks and assassinations of human rights defenders. We must denounce them, including when they take place in partner countries, and it is precisely because these countries are partners that we must remind them that partnership implies rights but also obligations. I am thinking here of some African states, but colleagues have also - rightly - cited other countries. Today, the emergency is what is happening in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen. The voice of the European Union must be the conscience of all of us who find it unacceptable to remain without trying to do more for the crises unfolding there. Human lives depend on it.

Another high-priority issue on the international agenda is the situation of millions of migrants and refugees fleeing hunger, misery, oppression and who suffer abuse by the mafias that traffic in human beings. We need to face it globally and in the long term. Terrorism is considered one of the gravest international threats at the United Nations. We must also give a firm response to those who want to end our model of open, plural and tolerant life.

Take, for example, the real epidemic of violence linked to criminal organizations and corrupt security forces, which today affects Central American countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. In addition to the thousands of deaths to be mourned and the climate of widespread impunity, this violence is causing hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons, in what is already a genuine migratory crisis. I cannot fail to mention Venezuela, where there are currently hundreds of political prisoners in unworthy situations.

Latin American countries. Many of the situations of human rights violations in this region are related to a particular historical and cultural context. This is the case of indigenous peoples, whose rights to their ancestral territories continue to be disrespected, in parallel with the criminalization of environmental activism and the persecution of those who defend the rights of these minorities.

From this debate I conclude that we all share a common vision of human rights as a flagship of our external policy. As you recalled, this is not an easy moment for human rights worldwide. Among other things, the challenges to freedom of expression, the shrinking space of civil society and the threats against human rights defenders continue to preoccupy us. Last week I was in Mosul and saw on the ground all these atrocities carried out by Isis. I have witnessed the victims of these atrocities and I met many victims from the Yazidi community. I do of course share your concerns and warnings about all these things. We are increasingly aware that cooperation by human rights defenders with UN agencies can expose them to reprisals. This is exactly what we want to address with our ‘protect defenders’ mechanism. We also look forward to supporting the recently-appointed UN Assistant Secretary—General for Human Rights to deal further with this issue. For the European Union, the protection of human rights is always a work in progress, and this is also true inside the European Union. We are still far from perfect and we have a duty to uphold the highest standards here at home if we want to be credible. But let us also be very clear: there can be no relativism on human rights. We should not curb our ambition to see credible institutions addressing human rights violations, to pursue the rule of law, and to protect media freedom and a strong and independent civil society worldwide.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! It will be a little safer again for Europeans! This time it's not about road traffic, this time it's about what ends up on the plates of Europeans. We have had very good official controls in the past, which affected the controls along the food chain. But during the revision of the 882 from 2003 it was found that in this area in particular a great number of parallel controls took place, which did not always meet the requirement of being effective. Furthermore, we have found that over time, of course, other demands are placed on controls and control mechanisms. And I am very happy that we are in the very long, very intensive and very cooperative negotiations - first here in the House, between the individual political groups, then in a trialogue with colleagues from the Member States, in the Council and, of course, with the Commission - have found a solution which, I believe, meets all the demands that we can make of modern, efficient, strict and effective controls along the entire food production chain. We want, as the saying goes, from farm to fork, in reality from the producer, from the farm, from the fattening farm to the plate. But here not only meat and foods that come from the meat of animals, but also plants. The title already said: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities to ensure the application of food and feed law and the rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products. So we see that this is a very comprehensive framework that really encompasses all of these control areas Future will cover. We have made it here - and that is a very big demand - that the Member States provide the appropriate funding for all these controls. And here we know that there is not too much money involved in the member budgets, and so I believe the risk-based approach we have taken is the right answer to that. Unannounced, risk-related checks with a minimum frequency of checks guarantee that we use our resources in a targeted manner and ensure health and safety. Food in Europe must be safe, safe and healthy. But we also want to protect Europeans from something else: namely from fraud and deliberate misleading. When I think of the horse meat scandal, which was perhaps one of the factors that triggered the question: In general, there was no health risk for Europeans, but it was clearly fraud and misleading. With the new regulation we also have mechanisms in hand to combat this fraud. For the first time, we have legally established the possibility for whistleblowers to disclose their knowledge of grievances without having to fear for their own position or their own economic independence. We now have a system of even more independence, quality and accountability for the law enforcement agencies. We have a new system of transparency in which the publication of the activities of the official control bodies must be guaranteed, and we can - and this is also essential for me - act much faster than before in times of crisis. What for many of us - and today's discussion on rabbit husbandry in Europe has shown it - is an essential point, which is also recorded here, is the question of animal welfare: we cannot and should not be indifferent to it, like animals in Europe be treated.Even if the slaughterhouse is the destination of their transport, conditions should also prevail there that do justice to animal welfare and animal husbandry.We have suggested that there be reference centers where all this knowledge can be exchanged and to identify the authenticity and integrity of the food chain for animal welfare as well.This project is also future-proof, which means that we have the opportunity to react to new developments in production, to new market conditions and, of course, to new consumer patterns.I'm actually quite proud of what we've brought together here.My thanks go once again to all those involved.It was a tough one at times, but I think the end product that we have created here - a very pleasant collaboration.Europe is a little safer again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 313, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to appear before the plenary here today to successfully conclude our work on the regulation on official controls. This is a very important piece of legislation. It is, as you know, the result of the joint and dedicated efforts of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The outcome is, I believe, a credit to all three institutions. Indeed, they all recognise the importance to provide Member States’ authorities with effective and efficient enforcement tools to ensure the coherent application of European law. Consumers and businesses should feel reassured that the control system across the EU is fit for purpose and safeguards the safety and quality of the entire agri-food chain. In particular, the new regulation will, first, introduce a more comprehensive approach to official controls along the entire agri-food chain by extending its scope to cover plant health and animal by-products. Second, it requires Member States to regularly perform controls to identify fraudulent practices and enable the establishment of new European Union reference standards for the authenticity and integrity of the agri-food chain. Third, re-enforce rules on financial penalties for fraudulent or deceptive practices by requiring that those penalties reflect the economic advantage either of the operators or a percentage of the operators’ turnover. Fourth, introduce new provisions for the protection of whistle-blowers reporting on possible cases of non-compliance. Fifth, strengthening the mechanism of administrative assistance and cooperation among Member States in case of cross-border non-compliance. Six, create a common framework of carrying out border controls on animals and goods entering the EU. And finally, seventh, increase the transparency of official control activities carried out by national authorities. The regulation is a major step forward to provide national enforcers with the powers and tools to effectively deliver on their control tasks.

Commissioner. First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kadenbach, for this work and also thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission for the spirit of collaboration that we have had during the negotiation to reach this agreement. If you will allow me, I would also like to have a special memory for our old colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, who was responsible for this report in my political group during the first reading. He strongly defended the role of official veterinarians, which is one of the topics that has generated the most debate. The Regulation will continue to maintain the fundamental role of veterinarians, while allowing, at the same time, some flexibility, by being able to delegate some tasks. It will always, of course, allow the particularities of the Member States to be taken into account for the sake of subsidiarity and, furthermore, these delegations will be highly regulated, clearly specifying what tasks can be delegated and whether the veterinarian has the power to supervise or not, and clarifying who has the final responsibility. Another issue of great relevance, and for which Parliament has fought to achieve this, is that controls are carried out, as a general rule, without warning and based on risk. This will allow control bodies to manage resources according to those sectors that most need to be controlled. As I have already said on several occasions, in the European Union we have the best legislation on food safety, traceability, animal health and animal welfare, and compliance must be controlled. We don't need more legislation. What is needed are more controls and an effective sanctions regime to deter those who break the law. I think we should congratulate ourselves on the fact that fraud is coming into the scope of the Regulation. All risks will be taken into account and not only health risks. Recent scandals in the food chain made it clear that sanctions were not enough. From now on, anyone who commits fraud will be sanctioned, not only based on the economic benefit obtained but also based on the volume of business of the company or subject who commits the fraud. The Regulation that we are going to adopt also clarifies the measures to be applied in relation to imported products, which must also be controlled, and which must be subject to the same rules as European products. Cases such as Xylella fastidiosa, which continues to dramatically affect our olive trees, or the black spot of citrus are examples of the importance of controls on imported products. Also a controversial issue has been financing. Given the complexity of the subject, we have tried to strike a balance, because we need food safety at the same time that we have to ensure that certain controls are carried out. And, for this, they have to be financed. The agreement has maintained the status quo of the Regulation in force, that is, mandatory rates for the meat sector and imports, which will allow the Member States to have sufficient funds to control all sectors at risk.

Consumers, food producers, traders and industry authorities will all benefit from simplified standards, applied consistently throughout the chain. The new types of controls will be based on risk assessment, thus helping to focus the authorities' attention where it is really needed. Inspections will be unannounced, making it difficult for any attempt by operators to conceal non-compliant practices from the authorities.

The official controls proposal was part of the review of the plant and animal health package announced by the Commission in 2013 with the intention to simplify and modernise existing rules, while strengthening the enforcement of health and safety standards across the agrifood chain. This became particularly urgent in the aftermath of the horsemeat scandal. Negotiations on this regulation have spanned two parliaments and 10 trilogues. I was very happy we were able to reach an agreement with the Member States under the Dutch Presidency in June last year. The agrifood industry is worth approximately EUR 750 billion a year and employs over 48 million people, making it the second largest economic sector in the EU. It is absolutely critical that we have a dynamic and streamlined legal framework to deal with this. A more uniform enforcement of controls across a number of sectors and increased transparency, as well as taking a more risk-based and thus less burdensome approach to controls, is a very positive outcome. This should help to detect fraud more effectively by concentrating resources on areas where they are most needed. If someone is intent on committing a criminal offence, it will not be easy to legislate to stop them, and indeed such intentional action should be met with dissuasive and proportionate financial penalties. By giving Member States’ competent authorities strengthened instruments at their disposal, we can help tackle compliance in line with the level of risk, thereby avoiding unnecessary controls and administrative burdens for SMEs in particular. Before I finish, I must just mention the issue of mandatory fees, which became a very difficult point in our discussions and negotiations. Again, I want to congratulate Ms Kadenbach for her handling of this.

We did not, of course, agree about everything all the time, but I think we have found a good compromise.  The proposed new rules on efficient hygiene control seek to deliver improved controls and enforcement along the agri—food chain. Our efforts have addressed three main objectives. First, better safety control along the agri—food chain, which I think we will get through the effective controls system based on risk. Second, more effective rules against fraudulent practices. European citizens want us to secure high safety standards, and these new rules are – or will be – delivering on that point. Third, the new efficient controls will also ensure a high level of human, animal and plant health along the agri-food chain.  This legislation will update and harmonise our framework to better adapt to the more than globalised market and increasingly complex agri—food chain, which today requires flexibility while maintaining high safety standards. We can be content and satisfied with the deal agreed. The final text is balanced, creates transparency and safeguards the independence of operatives and authorities, as well as the efficiency and consistency of the rules.

The report on official controls is also very important for strengthening and monitoring animal welfare standards.

Unfortunately, the present text is not yet an ambitious guideline for ensuring food safety, but this was not the fault of the rapporteur; it was up to the Council. However, a positive development can be seen that has been learned from past food scandals. For example, the report provides for unannounced controls in all sectors, better enforcement procedures in the event of fraud and clear rules for greater transparency, including with regard to the results of the controls. However, the trialogue negotiations have also shown that we are dealing with a large gap between the good intentions of the legislators and the actual implementation in the Member States, for example in border controls, in the transport of food or the control of animal welfare standards in slaughterhouses.

I personally welcome the fact that the specific controls on organic farming have been removed from this regulation and will be covered by the specific regulation on organic farming. There are separate certification organizations for organic farming, which not only monitor the end product, but also the quality of the product and the entire production process. The independence of the inspection services is better regulated. Unannounced checks are essential. There will be more transparency with an annual obligation to publish checks and results. There will be stricter fines. Of course, the specific clause on whistleblowers is also of great importance.

These producers have, through no fault of their own, been placed at a financial disadvantage given the need to house birds in high-risk areas. These farmers are worried that such labelling moves may affect the importance of free—range status, devaluing not only their product in the long term, but also their business. The Commission must do more to protect this important industry in exceptional times.

We have to act when we look at the scandals - from horsemeat to many other food scandals, where the European internal market has been abused to deceive consumers and in some cases there have been health risks. For me, three points are important that I would like to emphasize in particular. First, we need dissuasive penalties. In the horse meat case, there have been cases where the economic gain for the company from the fraud outweighed the penalty. We'll put an end to that. It is clearly stated that the punishments must be dissuasive. We need unannounced controls because, firstly, we will discover black sheep as a result, and secondly, everyone must know: if in doubt, I can be unannouncedly checked. Then the fraud will not even take place because you know you can get caught and will then be severely punished. And then, like some other colleagues, I would like to turn to the subject of fees. The weakness of the original Commission proposal was that it would have forced the Member States to introduce compulsory fees even for small food business operators such as restaurant owners, bakers and butchers, even if they were not guilty of anything. That created a lot of trouble and luckily we negotiated that out. But now my urgent appeal to the Member States is: if you introduce fees, do not blame the European Union!

Nevertheless, I am glad agreement has been reached on the proposal, and I hope it succeeds in reducing incidences of fraudulent and deceptive practices along the food chain. It is also less burdensome retaining the use of slaughterhouse staff under the supervision of a veterinarian or auxiliary for meat inspections, and it retains flexibility in Member States in terms of the fees charged in relation to controls such as in the slaughterhouses and dairy products at border control posts. Crucially, the proposal also allows suitably qualified persons, and not just official veterinarians, to perform certain controls. I also welcome the fact that there are more stringent penalties to deter international and intentional fraud and the additional possibility of using a percentage of the operators’ turnover as well as penalties based on the economic advantage sought. I welcome the much waited-for agreement on this file, and that we can now have a more uniform enforcement of controls across a number of sectors, taking a more risk-based and thus less burdensome approach.

The food sector is moving from scandal to scandal and this report should restore consumer confidence. But if countries can decide for themselves what they will or will not check, that will not happen.

I dare say that this legislation, which has now been agreed, is the first good, comprehensive control legislation that monitors and produces the necessary information for the whole food production chain.

We now have powerful tools at our disposal to monitor potential risks. Now we need other good legislation to limit the routine use of antibiotics in animal feed, to limit chemicals that pose a risk to humans, and to limit, for example, the use of pesticides and their accumulation in food chains.

this proposal and the length is probably appropriate because agri-food chains have become longer and more complex, and as a result the EU is more and more exposed to new risks.

The bigger the punishment, the greater the deterrent. We know only too well the potential damage that can be caused for the entire agri-food industry of a Member State in the even of unwanted ingredients ending up in the final product as a result of lax controls, with the ensuing controversy upon their discovery. It is important to stop this early, and I believe that the current agreement will help to do so. It is also important that there is provision included to ensure that food business operators can have a quick follow-up inspection if they are found to be non-compliant. This is crucial, as companies must be able to act quickly, rectify the situation and get back to trading or production.

At the same time, there is a need to modernize and simplify the instruments, aimed at enabling the implementation of legislation and guaranteeing a real protection of animal and plant health and welfare, but also of plants. The administrative burdens of small and very small enterprises need to be reduced so that the administrative burden is not transferred to a higher cost of the products being marketed. I also appreciate the need to strengthen official control over marketing standards for agricultural products in order to prevent fraudulent and misleading practices, but - and I also emphasize - the application of appropriate financial sanctions to discourage them. It is extremely important to strengthen alert mechanisms and the exchange of information between national authorities so that, through swift measures, any risk to food chain safety can be counteracted. At present, there are significant concerns in Eastern European countries about double the quality standards of the products being marketed compared to Western European countries.

These are controls on animal welfare and health requirements. Both topics are extremely important, as they directly concern the health of millions of European citizens and have a direct impact on the European economy. Firstly, the control of animal welfare requirements is closely linked to the issue of poor conditions in recent years for the transport of farm animals, both within the Union itself and in transport from the European Union to Turkey and other third countries. countries. With my colleagues from the Intergroup on Animal Protection, we have repeatedly raised the issue with the European Commission, insisting on more control over the implementation of this type of transport and strict compliance with all existing European regulations. This is important not only to protect animal welfare, but also to protect the interests of European producers. Better control means greater security for the animals themselves, which in turn would lead to less financial loss due to deaths during their transport. You yourself understand that when transporting tens of thousands of livestock each year, the financial losses for producers can amount to millions of euros. Secondly, better control over compliance with the rules for the transport of farm animals will provide greater certainty about their health and safety, and hence the quality of the products from these animals and the whole food chain. This would be extremely beneficial in terms of preventing and reducing the risk of disease, both in animals and in humans. After all, human health is the highest priority.

This is a shared EU goal that has constantly been highlighted by the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council and also the Commission. Similarly to previous Presidencies, the Maltese Presidency has placed the fight against tax evasion, fraud and avoidance among its top priorities on the Council’s agenda. The TAXE resolution of July 2016 called for a significant number of measures to be adopted in a large number of areas. I will give you an update on the achievements reached to date in the Council in reply to the general call for action. In a nutshell, the Council completed work on the Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive 1 and 2, on the Administrative Cooperation Directive 4 and 5 and on defining criteria to establish a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. More specifically, we have called on the Member States to adopt measures to counter aggressive tax planning, tax avoidance and the particular mismatching tax qualifications that lead to cases of double non-taxation. In a joint effort to speed up our common fight against tax avoidance, the Council reached two political agreements on an Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive. The directive provides for a comprehensive framework of anti-abuse measures aimed at ensuring that taxation will happen where value is created. Measures such as the control of foreign companies and anti-hybrid-mismatch measures that you mention in your report are no longer a wish but a binding reality for all Member States. As a result, the European Union can claim that the measures to counter base erosion and profit shifting, which were given impulse by the G20 and the OECD, have now been translated into the EU binding instrument. In several respects we went even further than the basic OECD recommendations. As regards transparency and exchange of information, I am also in a position to report that progress has been achieved on the Administrative Cooperation Directive, as multinational companies will now be obliged to report key tax information on the amount of revenue, profit before income tax and income tax paid in each country where they do business. In order to reinforce transparency, tax authorities have also been given the competence to access anti-money-laundering information, in particular on the beneficial ownership of companies. Furthermore, Parliament also called for  progress to be made on a common consolidated tax base. Responding to that call, the Commission issued two legislative proposals that the Presidency has put on the table in the Council. The Council has identified a working method to deal with those proposals, starting with the common corporate tax base, and we are currently working on the new elements introduced by the Commission on research and development, allowance for growth and investments and cross-border loss relief. We will also strive to increase tax certainty by, we hope, making as much progress as possible in establishing a mechanism that will improve double-taxation dispute resolution. This could be achieved by making alternative dispute resolution mechanisms binding, faster and more efficient. Honourable Members, turning to the Code of Conduct Group on business taxation, developments aimed at improving its working methods and effectiveness have been undertaken. We have adopted two sets of conclusions which enhance the effectiveness of the Code of Conduct Group. One of the group’s main tasks in the near future will be to finalise the process of establishing the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. I would also take this opportunity to recall that this is an inter-governmental exercise, to be carried out in the Code of Conduct Group in conformity with the competences as set out in the Treaties. To sum up, the Presidency is striving to move forward systematically on the basis of a clear road map for the Council’s work in the field of tax evasion, fraud and avoidance at EU level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 347, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "   membre de la Commission. – Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Président du Conseil, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés européens, il y a une saison, c’est celle-ci, pour regarder les réussites et les insuffisances de ce que nous faisons comme Union, avec l’objectif de définir la voie à suivre dans l’année qui suit. Assessing where we are today, where we need to go and where the added value of the EU actually lies, this is a useful contribution to the wider debate. Therefore, I very much welcome your invitation to discuss the progress we have made and the work still to be done in delivering on one of the top priorities for EU citizens today, which is fair taxation. We know that taxation has a vital role to play in addressing some of the biggest challenges we face in Europe today. The need for more social justice, the need for equal treatment and opportunities for all, and the need for stronger economic growth with more jobs and more investment. And that is why the Commission has given the highest priority, as you know, to advancing an ambitious agenda for tax reform throughout our Union. Our agenda for fair taxation rests on the two twin pillars of transparency and effective taxation. With these pillars as our base, we have built a new, improved and crucially fairer corporate tax framework for the entire EU, and we have done so in a remarkably short space of time. D’abord, la révolution de la transparence, que j’ai appelée de mes vœux, prend forme. Elle pousse nos États membres vers un niveau sans précédent d’ouverture et de coopération sur les sujets fiscaux. L’échange automatique d’informations sur les rescrits fiscaux, les tax rulings, le country by country reporting, l’échange d’informations sur les données comptables et fiscales entre autorités fiscales, tout cela est maintenant incorporé dans la loi européenne. De nouvelles règles européennes vont autoriser les autorités fiscales à accéder à des informations cruciales pour lutter contre le blanchiment d’argent, pour mieux faire en sorte de fixer les audits et les enquêtes. La Commission a aussi répondu à l’appétit de nos concitoyens, aux exigences de nos concitoyens pour plus d’informations sur les pratiques fiscales des multinationales, avec cette proposition, le country by country reporting – dont je rappelle ici à quel point la Commission est attachée à la publicité et à la transparence – et, depuis le 1er janvier de cette année, les États membres échangent automatiquement les informations sur les comptes financiers, pour faire en sorte de mettre fin à la pratique du secret bancaire et pour que l’on voie qui cherche à cacher son argent hors des frontières. Sans aucun doute, nous avons poussé la transparence autour des systèmes fiscaux et des pratiques fiscales en Europe avec un véritable résultat, qui fait que nous avons franchi un premier pas pour rétablir la confiance publique dans nos systèmes fiscaux. En parallèle, nous avons travaillé sans relâche pour nous assurer que toutes les entreprises, grandes et petites, paient leurs impôts là où elles créent leurs profits. Nous avons maintenant des règles anti-abus qui sont contraignantes pour toutes les formes de transferts de profits, et c’est ce que dit notre directive anti-évasion fiscale. Cette directive a été acceptée et votée par le Conseil en un temps record. Elle a, récemment encore, été complétée par des mesures additionnelles pour traiter ce qu’on appelle les hybrides avec les pays tiers également. Nous avons utilisé – comme vous le savez – nos outils en matière d’aides d’État pour traiter de cas qui ont trait à la concurrence fiscale inéquitable, et nous avons poussé – comme l’a rappelé le Président – le code de conduite à s’assurer que les États membres jouent de manière équitable sur le régime préférentiel. Enfin j’ai relancé le projet fiscal le plus ambitieux de tous, qui est ce qu’on appelle le CCCTB, l’assiette commune consolidée pour l’impôt sur les sociétés, et nous voulons là un système fiscal qui soit capable d’anticiper, qui soit capable de se mettre à la hauteur des défis que nous rencontrons en matière de taxation d’entreprises aujourd’hui, et aussi à l’avenir. Our agenda for fair taxation over the past two years has also extended beyond the borders of our Union. With today’s globalised economy and interconnected markets, the external threats of base erosion and unfair competition cannot be ignored. Therefore, we have stepped up our work to export a higher level of tax good governance worldwide, especially in the framework of the G20, and we will have a G20 meeting of Finance Ministers at the end of this week at Baden-Baden, for the first time in the presence of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Mnuchin, with whom I had the occasion to exchange yesterday. Our preferred approach is a cooperative one, to work closely with international partners for fairer competition, higher standards and a level playing field. We have positive incentives to achieve this, such as development head, EU funding and bilateral agreements, and we continue to be active players in shaping the tax agenda in international fora such as the G20 and OECD. However, there are some countries that consistently refuse to play fair, despite our best efforts to collaborate with them. With these countries it is time to play tough. By the end of this year, the first EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions will be published, together with appropriate common sanctions, and it will be something very important. Our Member States are honouring their international tax commitments, so other countries must do the same. Honourable Members, you have asked for an update on how the Commission responded to the recommendations of the TAXE 1 and TAXE 2 committees. The brief overview that I have just provided should reassure you that our agenda fully reflects and respects the expectations of this Parliament. As I always say, we are on the same side, respecting our diversity and our differences, but fighting for the same cause. Many of the actions called for by TAXE are now binding in EU law. Many of TAXE’s recommendations are now robust Commission proposals waiting for the agreement of the Member States. Let me give you just a few examples, which prove that our institutions have a shared vision on what is needed to secure fair taxation. The EU list: transparency on tax rulings; improved anti-money laundering provisions; public country-by-country reporting; tighter rules for patent boxes; the relaunched CCCTB. These were all recommended by Parliament and proposed by the Commission, some of them adopted by Member States. And there is more to come. For example, in line with TAXE’s report, we will propose greater scrutiny on revisers and intermediaries by the summer, to clamp down on those that promote aggressive tax planning schemes. We are also exploring how to better protect whistle-blowers and are examining ways to boost transparency on beneficial owners. For the Commission, the work of TAXE 1 and 2 has been a valuable asset, both as a source of inspiration and as a strong political backing for the many new initiatives we have brought forward. I have every confidence that we can rely on the same positive relations with the PANA Committee as it advances with its work, and I am fully ready to cooperate with this committee, as I did with the previous ones. You have also asked specifically about the reform of the Code of Conduct, which was among TAXE’s recommendations. On this particular point the results, I must say, are mixed. The Commission pushed very hard for an ambitious reform to make the Code more relevant, more transparent and more accountable. Some progress has been made; for example, the Code is now committed to more regular and transparent reporting of its activities, and the chair of the Code will appear before this Parliament, as well as ECOFIN, when needed. In terms of the content of the Code itself, technical work has started to review the criteria, so that they are more relevant to modern realities. But I have to admit that so far, the scope and pace of the reform in Council has not been as fast as I, and I know as many of you, would like. I do think that more could and must be done if Member States got fully beyond this project. A new Chair has recently been appointed to the Code Group, and this creates potential for a new momentum to be injected into the reform process. So I would suggest that you keep up the political pressure on your side for real and meaningful improvements to the Code of Conduct. On our side, the Commission will provide all the support that we can to this process. Looking ahead, I would stress that the many achievements so far in our fair taxation agenda should not be an excuse for any complacency. If anything, we need to be more vigilant than ever in ensuring that the momentum is maintained. Proposals must be agreed, commitments must be respected and legislation must be properly implemented. As already indicated, the Commission is working on more new initiatives to reinforce transparency and fairness in our tax systems, and we will continue to respond quickly and decisively to new challenges as they arise. However, we are not the only institution with obligations to fulfil: important proposals which need to be agreed quickly – I am conscious of that – are in your hands now, notably public country-by-country reporting and revision of the anti-money laundering directive. I would encourage you to use your combined forces of ambition and pragmatism in order to reach consensus with the Council as soon as possible. I would also urge you to keep the spotlight on crucial files such as the CCCTB, which rely entirely on the agreement of our Member States to become a reality. As we have seen before, political and public pressure has a powerful capacity to deliver results. It is the most powerful capacity. Chers membres du Parlement européen, j’espère que j’ai pu vous rassurer aujourd’hui et vous convaincre que lorsqu’arrivent les sujets de taxation et de fiscalité européenne, les positions, les suggestions, les demandes de ce Parlement, sont prises très au sérieux.

Je voudrais conclure en vous remerciant pour notre partenariat, pour votre soutien dans ce travail que nous menons en commun pour une taxation juste pour toutes les entreprises et pour le bénéfice de tous nos concitoyens qui sont conscients qu’il y a là un champ encore inespéré il y a quelque temps, et vraiment très puissant, pour une vraie preuve de l’efficacité et la nécessité de la construction européenne.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 348, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Werner LANGEN", "mepid": "1928", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mister President! If I have heard what has been said here - once by the Minister from Malta - then everything is well on its way.

Mr Moscovici has now explained in fourteen minutes and thirty seconds what you are doing - it seems that he is now on the march. It is very kind of you, Commissioner, to leave now that Parliament is leading the debate! I don't think you should do that. You should stay here and listen! Because what you have announced here is an ambitious program. When half is achieved by the end of 2017, we will give you the greatest applause. Because so far the member states have blocked it, and on a large scale. And if transparency is seen as the most important point here, I can only say: transparency is not guaranteed. As the Panama Committee, we have seen documents from the Code of Conduct group: the most important passages in the Member States' negotiations have been blacked out. It is a provocation for Parliament to give us documents - it passed through your hands, but it is not your responsibility, Commissioner, for the crucial passages being blackened out there.

In this world of the 1950s, reducing the threat of double taxation was a big step forward in encouraging international trade. The finance executives of big industrial companies couldn’t even dream of the kind of tax planning arrangements we’ve seen in this millennium used by big business like Apple, Google, and Starbucks. The Code of Conduct for Business Taxation, conceived at the European Community Finance Ministers' meetings in 1996 and 1997, was an important milestone at the time. Interstate tax wars were becoming a problem, and the Code of Conduct Group managed to put a brake on the development of the worst models. However, in the world of LuxLeaks, aggressive patent boxes and increasingly complex tax products, the mandate of the Code of Conduct Group is outdated. This is also underlined by The Guardian's January revelations about Luxembourg's problematic role in the group. The role of the group needs to be strengthened and its remit and range of means expanded. Transparency and representativeness must also be increased. The final report of the first TAXE special committee provides a good basis for this. Key reforms would include the election of a permanent, politically accountable chair, the extension of the criteria for harmful tax practices, including the impact on non-EU countries, the strengthening of the implementation of decisions and regular visits by finance ministers and senior officials.

First of all, it has to be said very clearly that some things have changed since the big scandals.

We have seen progress in combating tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. But unfortunately we are now seeing a relapse.

The obligation of reciprocal information on rulings, the unanimous adoption of the recommendations of the OECD, the anti-tax avoidance directive, the anti-money laundering directive are important advances, to which must be added the end of banking secrecy. But as Werner Langen has said forcefully, this effort only makes sense if it is carried through to the end.

First, the harmonization of the tax base of multinational companies is the CCCTB project. For us, Parliament, these two directives are the two legs that the device needs to walk upright. Parliament will be ready at the end of the summer. Second, a common list of non-cooperative countries, from which all the consequences must be drawn.

I think when we built the single market in Europe, we failed fundamentally to ensure that we have a fair tax regime, and the code of conduct group of business taxation lacks transparency and its principles on unanimity are destroying fair competition. What we have seen in Europe over the years – as you will see if you study the documents of the code of conduct group – is that we allow schemes, harmful tax regimes that are stealing revenues from each other, from Member States, revenues that should go to welfare, revenues that will protect our welfare states. So we need urgently to reform the code of conduct group for business taxation; we need transparency; we need to get rid of this principle of unanimity and secrecy. So I hope the Council will do something about it, and I see the Parliament and Commission, we have to stand together in reforming the code of conduct group to bring tax justice to Europe. Then I also want to say, as the rapporteur of the TAXE 2 Committee, it is important that we look at the instruments of tax evasion and tax dodging in Europe. We see that intermediaries – banks, law firms, tax advisers, wealth managers and so on, lawyers of all kinds – they are helping rich people and companies to evade taxes. This is a scandal. We should be much more tough on them. We should revoke their business licences if they repeatedly engage in illegal tax evasion, helping tax evasion – this is really dangerous. And then finally, I think if we want to build real trust in Europe (and we should), we need once and for all to have a fair tax system. We need to see the Commission and Council acting on the many recommendations that this Parliament has put forward and adopted. We need to see action now; we have seen some action but we need much more, and we need also the Council to listen to us and act, not only sit back and relax.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 361, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Zbigniew KUŹMIUK", "mepid": "28389", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

The Union is always considered to be slow, inefficient and unable to find agreement and move forward, but this is not exactly the case. We can point to the adoption of the Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive (ATAD) I and II and the Administrative Cooperation Directive (DAC3 and DAC4), and we have started to use state aid rules to enforce better and fairer tax collection. I hope that we will make similar progress quickly on the Anti-Money-Laundering Directive and, more importantly, the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). Obviously, there is reason to be at least a little proud, not just for doing something, because taking action is not always a good thing, but for doing right things in a basically reasonable way. However, there is no reason for complacency, and we must be aware that the fruit of our efforts will come later, because the macroeconomy is slow and we will not move forward unless countries implement the directives properly, tax authorities cooperate and work properly, and the Commission plays its role decisively. As I said, there is no room for complacency and many things have to be done. I am dissatisfied with the situation of the Code of Conduct Group.

They should also stop using the practice of intra-group transactions, thus avoiding taxes and depriving state budgets of huge tax revenues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 372, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner. It has already been said: the revelations of the Panama Papers and Lux ​​Leaks highlighted the pressing need for the Union and its Member States to fight against tax evasion and avoidance and aggressive tax planning and to promote greater cooperation and transparency , making our tax systems fairer and ensuring that corporate taxes are paid where value is created. Some tax jurisdictions cannot be allowed to actively contribute to the design of aggressive policies for multinational companies, which may thereby seize the opportunity to avoid taxation. We need a joint effort, at European and international level, to prevent aggressive tax planning, increase transparency and create a fairer environment for companies in the European Union. At the beginning of last year, the Commission introduced new measures against corporate tax avoidance. These new rules are essential to harmonize tax legislation in the 28 countries of the European Union, in order to fight effectively against aggressive tax practices by large companies. Likewise, at the end of last year the agreement on the criteria and the process for the preparation and approval of a pan-European list of non-cooperative jurisdictions in tax matters was approved. The objective of creating this list is to promote the good standards that the European Union already applies in tax matters. The criteria for including jurisdictions on this list will be fiscal transparency, having a fair tax system and implementing the OECD recommendations against the erosion of tax bases. The list of non-cooperative jurisdictions and sanctions - according to the commissioner has added - must be presented before the end of this year, and I am sure that there will be some absence.

The Group, as many colleagues have said, has been sorely lacking in dynamism since its initial leadership under Dawn Primarolo. Mr Borg referred to two revisions in the Code of Conduct Group but surely these cannot amount to the proper, full review of the Group that this Parliament was promised. Such a review is desperately needed. That is evident from the recently leaked cables, with one participant stating that it was impressive to see how some Member States presented themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reform and, at the same time to watch, in the Code of Conduct Group, how they actually behave in EU discussions protected by confidentiality. So, will the Council support the Code of Conduct Group becoming more transparent? And, on the point that Mr Kofod underlined, will there be a shift away from the stifling unanimity which has prevented progress in this area? I would also ask this: will the Group be taking forward the TAXE and ECON reports’ calls for action to ensure that Member States notify each other of new tax measures? Finally, I want to focus on the problem of tax havens. It is disappointing that Mr Woolfe and Mr Coburn have left the Chamber. I actually listen to my constituents and I know they are furious about tax dodging by both businesses and individuals. And they are disgusted in particular that public funds end up in tax havens.

Meanwhile, there were already the Swiss Leaks, the Panama Papers, the Bahamas Leaks and who knows what else will come. The outrage after each new revelation gave us as politicians a clear mandate, yes even an obligation, to deal with these abuses. In the European Parliament, we have taken up the gauntlet with the two special committees on tax rulings and other measures of a similar nature or effect and the Committee of Inquiry into money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion. We have always come up with concrete proposals for solutions, but unfortunately our power is limited to holding the Member States and the Commission to account. Nevertheless, important legislative steps have also been taken, such as the automatic exchange of tax rulings and the anti-BEPS directive. But is this enough? Can we now look our citizens in the eye and promise that Luxleaks will never happen again? Certainly not. I want to mention three things. First, the list of tax havens is a missing link. I explicitly ask the Member States to throw taboos overboard and arrive at a single, comprehensive European list. Because as long as there are loopholes, they will be found. That is already certain. The associated sanctions will also be crucial. But in addition to formal sanctions, we must also respond to the reputation effects. That is why I am calling on the banks here and now to sign a European charter in which they commit themselves not to conduct transactions with tax havens. Third, the loopholes within Europe itself must also be closed. And let's be honest: this is only possible through the proposed CCCTB. Unfortunately, the signals from the Council on this are anything but encouraging, but it is now or never. In the meantime, several countries have also announced a reduction in their corporate tax rate, which will eventually make a debate about a possible European floor tariff inevitable.Finally, the catch 22 in which the Member States are holding each other today in tax matters is evidence of short-term thinking and, to my regret, not of the political courage we need to look our citizens back in the face and work towards a just Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 375, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Paul TANG", "mepid": "125020", "text": "   – Mr President, the Code of Conduct Group is probably Europe at its worst.

A major step would be the actual introduction of the consolidated common corporate tax base. It would provide, among other things, a level playing field in the internal market for large companies and not-so-large companies: and people are right to expect that Amazon pays as much in taxes as a small book store. As rapporteur, I will do my utmost, together with Alain Lamassoure, to find support inside and outside this Parliament. We need political and public pressure on the Member States.

I am pretty fed up with this and I am convinced that none of the civil society players, the media or the European Parliament is going to drop the issue as long as it is open and unsolved. There are easy ways to solve the problem. What about the automatic exchange of information , which is halfway or more to finalisation? A truly automatic exchange of information would be where all benefit payers all over Europe had a tax index number for their beneficiaries, and the information would be transposed immediately and automatically with the technology that we have, for Member States’ tax officials to take into account. It is not very difficult. This is automatic exchange of information. In fact, the Commission has been promising a tax index number regulation for quite some time.

The vast majority of what you have spoken followed in the same direction - an analysis we share and an expectation we support. My colleague Moscovici had to go to another appointment. He sends his regards, but has asked me to take up your comments. We do this together with the experts from his cabinet and from the general management. I can say again at the beginning: We see the position of the MEPs largely congruent with the position of the European Commission. Anyone who wants to expect tax honesty must promote tax fairness. Both are closely related. We therefore believe that more progress has been made in the last two years than in the previous 20 years. The glass is half full or half empty. Transparency, cooperation, information requirements - a lot has been achieved, but not enough. The situation remains unsatisfactory. We believe that tax competition can be part of an acceptable European location competition. Regions, municipalities, member states inside and outside advertise with good education, good culture, good infrastructure, advertise with certainty and advertise with taxes on sales and earnings. I am a realist. I do not believe that this competition between municipalities, regions and member states can be leveled out in the next few years. But we should see that we are much further ahead in sales tax law than in income tax law. In sales tax law we have European framework rules for the determination and for minimum and maximum taxes and for the different tax levels, in income tax law we practically do not yet have this. It would be a step forward in corporate income tax law to get to where we are today in sales tax law in the European Union. And one thing is clear - me I believe that we should see the presidency as a partner here, asking you to convey your analysis, your criticism, to the Council, to convey it to the 27 colleagues: in the end we are all losers. If the one with tax advantages, with deals, with dumping has a short-term locational advantage, we will all lose in the medium term. That is why I believe that a common approach is necessary. The European single market is the most attractive market in the world. Everyone wants to act in it, everyone wants to export into it, everyone wants to use it. That is why we should avoid companies inside and outside Europe operating in this internal market and tax avoidance or even tax dumping or tax deals coordinated with member states continue to be possible in the long term. Mr Giegold mentioned the subject of the method. Indeed, tax law doesn't have to be intergovernmental. This can happen with the financial transaction tax, but as a rule tax law is also subject to the Community method, with the principle of unanimity. And we continue to work towards that. It is a tough process and Article 116, which you mentioned, Mr Giegold, may be a last resort. I deliberately do not rule this out for the Commission. We will use the last two years in our endeavors as a basis, to continue our work, but not as a neverending story.

I also fully support the leading role of the EU in setting up global good tax governance rule. Although I welcome a common European approach towards fairer taxation, I believe fiscal matters should remain exclusive competences of the Member States. Fiscal competition between Member States should not be curbed. Fiscal harmonisation should not be used to protect fiscal expansionist governments at the expense of countries with lower taxes and better public governance.

It is the report in which we, as a Parliament, are putting forward our political priorities for the budget of the Union for next year. I would like to propose two political priorities: number one, growth and jobs; and number two, security. I would like to propose these as priorities because these are exactly the areas in which the citizens of the Union expect that the Union will deliver: number one, growth and jobs; number two, security. How will we achieve this? Number one: on growth and jobs, I propose that we invest more in infrastructure, innovation and research, that we support more SMEs, and that we invest more in entrepreneurs, especially highly innovative entrepreneurs. So programmes like the Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020, COSME, Erasmus, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) have to be enforced in the budget of the Union for next year, because it is only by strengthening the economy of the Union and making it more competitive and more credible in the eyes of investors that it will be able to grow and create jobs. The second priority which I am proposing is security. This has two aspects, two components: internal security and external security. For internal security, as we all know, the financial means under heading 3 are very limited. So the question is: how can we have an impact with the limited financial resources which we have available? I propose that we strengthen the agencies of the Union which have responsibilities in the area of justice and home affairs: Frontex, EASO, Europol and Eurojust. We need to strengthen them, and we need to make them cooperate better and use synergy effects between them. Also, to improve internal security, I support the defence pilot projects launched by the European Commission this year. They have to continue because, until now, we have spent money in 28 Member States of the union 28 times for defence industries and defence research for the same results. This needs to end where it can. We need to achieve economies of scale. Spend money once at European level and share the results, as is normal to do amongst partner countries. Security also has an external dimension, and I would like us to stand side-by-side with the eastern neighbourhood of the Union and with those countries which have embarked on a pro-European path the three countries that have signed Association Agreements with the European Union: Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. They face a more aggressive Russian Federation. We need to stand by their side to strengthen their institutions, their judiciary – the independence of the judiciary – the rule of law, to fight money laundering and to fight corruption. We also need to stand by the countries in our southern neighbourhood, Northern Africa and the Middle East. These are countries of origin or countries of transit for refugees, and it is for us much cheaper, it is politically easier and it is safer for the Union to support refugees in their countries of origin. It is also preferable for them. We can achieve much better results by supporting them there and preventing them from coming in high numbers to Europe. These are the main political priorities which I am putting forward for debate and for vote tomorrow. In addition to these, there are also small punctual projects which help different categories of people in Europe. We believe in the Erasmus programme. It has to be strengthened, but we believe that in addition to the Erasmus programme, the Interrail project – which was proposed over the course of the past month and which would enable every young citizen in Europe who turns 18 to receive from the budget of the Union a free 30-day Interrail pass – is something which would enable people to learn more about Europe, to practice the foreign languages which they have learned in school, and, in particular, to increase their chances of finding a good job. As we know, employers appreciate international experience. On this basis we would like to ask the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal to enable the Interrail project in a transparent, predictable and sustainable way without, of course, affecting any other existing projects. I thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to the debate tonight.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 389, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, With today's debate, you too will begin discussions on next year's budgetary procedure. I have carefully looked at Mr Muresan's report and the priorities it has set out. I can say that the Commission fully shares the priorities and expectations set out in this report for the financial year 2018, and I am also pleased that the Council's guidelines, which were adopted in the Council on 21 February, are largely communicated coincide with the priorities of Parliament. The starting position for a constructive and purposeful discussion of the 2018 budget proposals, which we as the Commission will work out and present, between the Council, Parliament and the Commission is therefore absolutely good. The 2018 budget will not differ significantly from that of 2017. We assume that the tasks, the challenges and the priorities in the coming year will be very similar to those of 2017. One area is growth and investment in Europe with the aim of creating more jobs - this is exactly the first priority that we share. And the second is: security with knowledge of migration and other tasks - external and internal security. We will anchor these two priorities in our budget proposal based on the experiences and realistic expenditure to be gained in recent months and this year. With your support, we have earmarked EUR 6 billion in the 2017 budget for migration and security. That is the amount of growth in the budget in general to help both Member States and third countries to cope financially with the consequences of migration flows. In 2018, we also want to propose the necessary budgetary resources to finance legislative measures that have already been adopted. Let's take that Proposal package on border management, heading 3; let's take the new partnership framework under heading 4 - Europe in the world. This means that in 2018 we will reflect in the budget what has become of a joint policy by Parliament, Council and Commission in recent months. We will take the necessary steps to adjust the budget for migration and security. But we know that our options in the current multiannual budget framework - in the FF - are finite. The multiannual budget framework adopted in 2013 did not, in principle, foresee these tasks; all the more we will do everything we can to make these tasks and their financing possible. In addition to new priorities, we should continue to anchor, with great sensitivity, the enabling of existing projects and programs in the budget: Horizon 2020, Connecting Europe Facility, COSME for small and medium-sized companies and Erasmus +. New focus areas must not displace established programs. We have to find a wise middle ground. 2018 will again only be possible with sufficient use of the instrument of flexibility. There are new expectations for us: the State of the Union Speech by President Juncker with WiFi for Europe, the extension of EFSI until at least the end of 2020, the consideration of a European youth solidarity corps, but also the European defense action plan . All of these projects and ideas are new, innovative, correct, but not free. That means that we are facing quite a challenge, especially with Heading 1 A, to at least partially or even fully finance all of this seriously in 2018. The idea of ​​an Interrail ticket coming from the middle of Parliament, which we want to give young Europeans for their 18th birthday, seems to us to be a very interesting idea. With our start in 2017 of Learn to Move, Move to Learn, we want Enable first attempts and gain first experiences with young people. We put this pilot project at the beginning so that we can see what we can finance together with you as a permanent funding project. Here, too, we depend on the Council of Parliament to see how we can achieve serious medium-term funding for 2018, knowing the foreseeable large number of young people who will take part. Mr Mureşan mentioned the issue of young people and the Youth Employment Initiative: the reinforcement, as agreed in the course of the 2017 conciliation procedure, will be taken up by the Commission. In a few weeks' time, we will be presenting a draft amending budget to you, Parliament and the Council. I mentioned the subject of flexibility. We will only be able to finance our diverse tasks in the next few years if we make extensive use of the flexibility and expand it. That is why we believe that the process of mid-term revision and mid-term review does not hit the wall. After many weeks of standstill, an agreement was possible in the Council a few days ago. The Council has now given the go-ahead for mid-term revision and review, with some expectations and conditions to be discussed now. We will be happy to advise you on the assessment over the next few days and weeks. We are grateful to the Technical Committee, the Budget Committee, for wanting to address this issue next Monday, because we have one concern: As soon as the Article 50 letter arrives from London and Brexit is on the agenda, that the time window for mid-term review and revision will close. And, in my opinion, it would be very disadvantageous if the mid-term review and revision, which had always been a concern of Parliament, were not to result in a pragmatic, factual result got.The time window is still open and, in particular, more flexibility would be the main advantage for financing numerous projects that are also very important to Parliament in the next three years.We will do everything we can to avoid a backlog in 2018 on the way to 2020.Your worries are our worries;we share them in full.We will have a first trialogue on March 27th - an initial exchange of ideas - and there we will also have to discuss the schedule until October / November of this year.On the same day we will also have a debate on agencies and on monitoring the payments situation.All in all, we have a clear agenda, and I do not see Parliament's priorities and your report in conflict, but an effective partnership for the Commission.We are happy to take up your expectations for our budget proposal for 2018 in a few months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 390, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "on behalf of the Group. - Mr President, I would like to greet the Commissioner, greet colleagues and colleagues and congratulate the rapporteur on the excellence of the work, on the consensus he can bring and involve all groups, which means that we will have, once again, a Parliament united in this goal of wanting the best for the European Union and the best possible budget for citizens too. To speak of the European Union budget is to speak of a small budget - it corresponds to about 1% of the Gross Domestic Product. When we compare it with the federal budget of the United States, we see the difference well, since the federal budget has 20% of the Gross Domestic Product. But this budget, being small, has enormous added value and the proof is that, in many regions, it is the only investment available and, in many Member States, it also represents more than 50% of that investment. In fact, the European Union budget is an investment budget: 94% of the budget is for investment and only 6% is for administration. I congratulate the rapporteur once again on the fact that he has set clear priorities for employment, growth and security, and this obviously has to have consequences in terms of the programs that we have, such as COSME for SMEs, but also essential programs for youth, such as Erasmus +. But jobs, growth and competitiveness are also done with innovation and research and, therefore, it is important that we provide Horizon 2020 with the means necessary for this objective. 2018 is the fifth year of the Multiannual Financial Framework, Commissioner, and I hope that cohesion policy in 2018 will reach its maximum speed, since there has been a delay in the implementation of the programs and since, in 2016, there were even more than 13 billion euros that were not implemented. Therefore, it is essential, Commissioner, that cohesion policy and other funds enter a maximum speed in 2018, not least because it is the fifth year of the Multiannual Financial Framework, and that there are sufficient amounts for payments.A strong word for youth, which has always been our priority.A youth that has about double the unemployment of other generations and, therefore, it is crucial that the Youth Employment Initiative program has the necessary amounts and sufficient amounts for this objective.It is important that Erasmus +, which promotes mobility and professional training, also has the necessary minimum objectives and sufficient amounts.For this reason, I thank the rapporteur once again for this excellent proposal and I am sure that, in this process which is now beginning, on Parliament's part, we will always be up to the wishes, the will and the hope of the citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 391, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Daniele VIOTTI", "mepid": "124791", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budgetary procedure for the year 2018 will not be business as usual.

The plot thickens and the hands travel fast: we are called to respond and do it for real.

The budget must be a political tool at the service of our idea of ​​Europe and almost all those elected in this House are well aware that Europe represents the only possibility for growth, peace and happiness. Just remember how to do it. If we don't give answers, someone else will give them and we know what the answers will be. European citizens want clear answers: a welfare model that works, a strong push for investments, a great plan to fight inequalities and a Europe capable of welcoming migrants while protecting its own security. And yet, on the other hand, what must be said, and what everyone knows, is that our work will be completely useless if it is not directed above all to the younger generations. For decades, Europe has been synonymous with the future and we have a moral duty to align that our policy to this idea, the survival of the very idea that we are here called to represent is at stake.Out of tactics, I hope that this budgetary procedure represents a new chapter and a new history.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 392, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Bernd KÖLMEL", "mepid": "124824", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. -  Mister President! The draft presented contains many correct points of emphasis. I would particularly like to mention the security of citizens, competitiveness, which must be increased, but also investment in research and innovation, which ultimately means that we must continue to improve the standard of education throughout the EU. At the same time there is light and shadow in this draft, especially in the basic setting of the course. On the positive side, I would like to emphasize that this draft shows that jobs are mainly created in the private sector, and also that migration is finally recognized, that it must be combated by investing in the migrants' countries of origin - i.e. at the sources of the causes . That means that we have to invest there. It is also important that we integrate ad hoc financial instruments into the budget in the future, because that is an effective measure against shadow budgets. These are all significant improvements compared to previous years. However, I would also like to note that there are still some points with which we are not satisfied, because there is still no overall EU concept for the very great challenge of the migration crisis. But we should make it dependent on how much money we spend where. There are also minor theaters of war that we continue to deal with. I also include the Interrail ticket. That will cost us several hundred million euros, depending on how it is introduced. I don't think that's the right focus. In addition, it is very important that we should not give the EU budget the impression that it is a panacea for all crises. That can not be. More realism is called for here.

Mr President, The rapporteur has rightly focused on growth, jobs and security, because these are the most important issues for citizens in the European Union. For me, however, the link between security and action on climate change, for example, is not sufficiently reflected in the report. This is also confirmed by the European Court of Auditors' audit, which states that 20% of the money in our budget should be spent on stabilizing the planet's climate. I am very pleased that the rapporteur's emphasis on the Interrail youth program is strengthening it. The same applies to the Erasmus program.

Even if perhaps many of those here today may not join me in celebrating this momentous decision of the British people, I hope that all will recognise the exercise of democracy. There are two ways of doing a divorce. It can either be a mutual recognition that paths are leading in different directions; to still be friends and neighbours while recognising that both parties can thrive separately, but that that relationship is not working – or it can be negative and acrimonious. I certainly prefer the former. Today we are discussing the guidelines for the 2018 EU budget, and the report makes all the usual calls: more resources, more EU action, more taxpayers’ money to be spent. There has always been a disconnect between the structure of the European Union and the British people. This report typifies, in a lot of ways, that disconnect: strong support for common EU initiatives in defence and defence research, the Interrail tickets, the fact that the Court of Auditors’ reports are giving such a high error rate, and the adverse opinion on the legality of the payments underlying the accounts. Again, those things are put to one side. We see political groups in this Parliament not only exempt from the staff reduction target, but getting 76 more posts offset by the staff reduction target for the general administration. All of these things go fundamentally against the way that the British people would see these things, but ultimately the elephant in the room is how we proceed following Brexit. The UK must make sure that it is protected, and as Brexit approaches, the relevance of all of the items of spending to the UK will diminish month on month. But according to the multiannual financial framework regulation, by the end of this year the Commission has to put forward a proposal for the next multiannual financial framework. So in the spirit of this truth we must tell the Commission, first of all, that it should of course not include the UK in its proposal for the next multiannual financial framework period, and that is an important and necessary first step for accepting Brexit and moving on. There needs to be a credible long-term plan from the EU’s perspective on what happens post-Brexit. The amendments that we have tabled will help protect the UK from a never-ending EU bill.

First point: it is useless to consider the European budget as the tool to solve all the problems of European citizens, which are called recession, poverty and unemployment. To foster the recovery, it would first of all need to get rid of the bosses imposed by Brussels and Frankfurt, which do not allow the States the necessary fiscal and monetary policy maneuvers that would serve to get out of the crisis. It is therefore necessary to leave the euro, dismantle economic governance and then start over on different bases in order to seek a new, healthy and clear one: cooperation between European countries. Going into the specifics of this report, I do not see how EFSI or the Youth Employment Initiative can be assessed as successful. The EFSI was a propaganda tool, which was supposed to restart investment. But the results are far from flattering, as the report of the European Court of Auditors also points out and demonstrates. The youth employment initiative starts from a concrete problem, which in many situations becomes a real drama. However, the measures undertaken through this program have been of little or no avail: in Italy this budget line has been affected by several cases of fraud and mismanagement. The European Union, then, cannot think of raising its image by giving an Interrail ticket to young people: this is a shameful useless failure to curry favor with the people. We must also be very careful when talking about projects and funds for the common defense, because we have already ceded a lot of sovereignty to Brussels and with this idea we risk taking a step of no-return, trampling again the desires and will of the peoples who do not they want more integration. Finally, I consider a passage on the Brexit, as I fear that in Brussels they will try to pay a hefty bill that smacks of revenge for the free choices of British citizens: this would be mean and shameful, as indeed the very idea of using the United Kingdom to leave the Unionto strengthen the EU's own resources system.Monti has already tried to destroy a country on behalf of Brussels and now we will certainly not let him impose new taxes even at the European level, because this would mean the end of the freedom of European peoples and citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 398, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Eleftherios SYNADINOS", "mepid": "125072", "text": "- Mr President, the Union's budget offers, through its financial tools and mechanisms, solutions and catalyzes the challenges, problems and difficulties faced by the citizens and states of Europe.

It was no different last year. Today, however, I see that this area is still underfunded and we are forced to look for every euro to strengthen this area. In my opinion, therefore, a further increase in the budget for security and the migration crisis should be the main priority of the 2018 budget, as proposed by the rapporteur today. Above all, I want the new budget to have sufficient flexibility and to be able to obtain EU funding quickly and efficiently in times of crisis. However, this must go hand in hand with proper control of this funding and its effectiveness. We must therefore not only ensure a balance between flexibility and control, but we must also ensure that budgetary discipline is respected. Another aspect that I think is new and important for this proposal and for any other proposal is the spillover of money from area to area. Pouring from the area where money is left to the area where it is missing. One example for all is European agriculture. Billions of euros flow there every year for pointless and poorly controllable projects. On the other hand, there is still insufficient funding to address the migration crisis.

My colleague Jäätteenmäki has said this - and I will not repeat it - in reality we find in her proposals almost all of our concerns and our priorities. For my part, I want to focus on a problem that I consider to be essential in the current state of the European project: the level of youth unemployment is too high in the Union and it is even dramatically unbearable in some countries. At a time when so many populists - and there are some here in this room - want to destroy the European project, we have an obligation to demonstrate that the Union is a real added value for the younger generations. The Youth Employment Initiative deserves to be resolutely supported and strengthened. The Council's greed in this matter is a shame. The Erasmus + program, whose success is undeniable, must be able to be extended to young apprentices and make room for young workers tomorrow. Our rapporteur also takes up in his report the proposal for a European Interrail pass, and the Commissioner seemed to find this idea sympathetic. I also find it sympathetic, but it still has to be both well calibrated and financially manageable so as not to turn into an electoral gadget serving the interests of a single political party. In our view, to merit support, this proposal must meet four characteristics. First, the pass must be accessible to young people from all walks of life and not just from wealthy backgrounds. Second, the benefit of the pass must be linked to a trip to another country as part of a training or discovery process. Third, it is not completely free: an adequate personal contribution must be the pledge of the beneficiary's commitment to the displacement project. Fourth, funding does not necessarily have to come from the EU budget alone, but can be extended to other sources of funding.Finally, the best investment we can make is investing in youth.Please let us not miss out on the future of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 403, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Jordi SOLÉ", "mepid": "185974", "text": "-  Mister President!The EU's internal and external challenges are high and growing.Nonetheless, we must confront them with a budget that is less than 1% of the Union's gross domestic product - 50 times less than what national governments spend as a whole.Even if the EU budget were very efficient, it seems difficult to use these figures to produce results in key areas such as unemployment, climate change, research, competitiveness, migration or social cohesion.The debate on the next MFF, particularly in the context of Brexit, and also the debate on the EU's own resources - put back on the agenda through the Monti report - will be a good opportunity to see how strong the political isThe will is to turn wishes and goals into reality through a strengthened EU budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 404, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Marco VALLI", "mepid": "124778", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen fit to table some amendments to this text.

Firstly, I want to say: we are not asking for more money. The accusation of Ms. von Storch, who can no longer be there, is simply wrong. We have a budget, we have a cover for it, we keep it. We will do everything we can to accomplish the tasks within the budget set by the Council and Parliament for 2018. In general, I think you could all be a little more proud when you look at the efficiency of European budgets. Europe's government quota is on average 50%. For every 100 euros that a citizen earns in Europe - through manual work, mental work, investments - 50 euros go into public hands. In some countries up to 57%, in others only 45% - on average 50% percent. So for every 50 euros that we take from citizens for a gross 100 euros, one euro goes into the European coffers and 49 euros remain in Berlin or Madrid, in Düsseldorf or Barcelona or in municipalities or with state health systems. One euro out of 50 - we are responsible for that. With this one euro we do a lot of things right. I'm not saying we're doing everything right. That is why the discharge debate is necessary, and the Commission is also capable of self-criticism. The error rate has been reduced significantly year after year in recent years, and I look forward to the debate on discharge in a few days here in this House. We had an excellent factual debate in the Committee on Budgetary Control. We have achieved discharge in the Council and here too we want to use good arguments to promote discharge for 2015 in the European Parliament. The 2018 budget is not about Brexit, no matter how and when the negotiations start and when they end. Our member state Great Britain is a full member with all rights and all obligations for the entire 2018 financial year. That means it works around EU-28. We also know that in the next post-2020 budget, there is a probability bordering on certainty that the British will no longer be there. That is why the EU27 Commission's White Paper is mentioned. And that is why we will of course, within the framework of what we as the Commission have to work out, concentrate the next budgetary framework on 27 Member States in terms of revenue and expenditure. And yet there are subsequent obligations. It's like any normal relationship. Even after separation, there may be subsequent obligations. This is what the family calls children of divorce, and what is called commitments here. If we now make commitments that will continue after 2020 when the children are not adults, then we will be able to expect our British friends to fulfill the subsequent commitments, which are decreasing year by year. By the way, especially in the area of ​​research: those who will suffer most from Brexit are British research institutes and industrial companies that are currently participating in Joint Undertaking, Public Private Partnerships, the Important Project of Common European Interest and, to a large extent, funds from Horizon Want to access in 2020, also in the future. That is why we need a clever solution here, which we will discuss in the course of the divorce negotiations over the next few months. The idea that defense should become a European issue has been criticized. If you know how inefficiently 28 Member States are doing defense research individually, how many branches of arms we have, how little standardization we have, then you know that Europe is not well positioned here. The Americans - our partners in NATO - get for one dollar several times what we currently get from one euro or one pound. That is why it was the consent of the European Council to ask the Commission on the subject Defense research and joint projects to work out a proposal that we will also present to this House before the middle of the year. We will start defense research with first projects. It doesn't make sense to develop the use of drones for defense 28 times and research 28 times. The smallest child knows that the company size can run far better for such complex projects in partnership, in cooperation and in a harmonized way. It is correct - we will come back to this: Defense projects cannot be financed at the expense of social policy. This is exactly what we will pay attention to. We do not want to save on our important social spending and programs, the fight against youth unemployment, to finance defense projects. That would be unfair to the young population and to socially disadvantaged European citizens. But it still makes sense. And that is why the Member States may have to provide additional funds, because these tasks and expenses can be financed more efficiently and therefore more cost-effectively for the taxpayer in a European team, coordinated at European level. The subject of own resources was mentioned. This, too, has nothing to do with the 2018 budget; the report by the group around Mr Monti will have to be discussed with you in the course of the next budget framework in 2021. What are we thinking about? When the European Community was founded, customs revenue was a focus. With every enlargement of the European Union, the customs revenue decreases.

I was able and happy to integrate most of your amendments into the compromises which we voted on at the level of the committee last week, and I am looking forward to continuing the work together with you over the course of this year in the same constructive spirit. I would also like to thank Commissioner Oettinger for sharing our priorities, for the positive evolution on the priorities which we have put forward, which are: number one, growth and jobs, and number two, security. We believe that the primary mission of the Union is to support the economy, which would then be able to create more, better, stable, better-paid jobs for the citizens of Europe, and this is of course only possible if people feel safe in Europe, if companies invest, if people start companies, if they unleash their entrepreneurial spirit, if they are ready to move throughout Europe to other Member States of the Union in search of a job. Commissioner, I also agree with you in what you have said on youth unemployment, and many colleagues have also voiced their views on this. The youth employment initiative should continue, should be strengthened and should be improved, if possible, in the next year. I also agree that we need to make available the financial resources which we need for payments next year, because the operational programmes in the Member States will be at full speed next year, and we need to make sure that we have the money to pay the bills of the Union immediately, because there is no worse signal than a Union which is not capable of paying its bills immediately.

Hungary has been at the forefront of sustainable economic growth, increasing employment, reducing unemployment and strengthening the security of its citizens for many years, so this is an important message for us. The report also states that the mid-term review of the current seven-year financial framework must be concluded as soon as possible, ie the European Parliament must give its assent as soon as possible to the compromise reached by the Council. This is crucial for Hungary for two reasons: the Council confirmed that a reduction in cohesion, agricultural and rural development funds, ie resources previously allocated to Member States, was ruled out during the review. This succeeded in ensuring that the EU funds fought by the Orbán government could not be reduced and that the support of Hungarian farmers was also ensured. However, the revision of the multiannual financial framework can also help to avoid a liquidity crisis under the previous seven-year framework, when the Commission was unable to pay the invoices submitted to the Member States for the projects implemented.

Therefore, an increase in funding is essential to further develop the European innovation policy and to strengthen the EU's competitiveness and innovation. I am also sorry to note that the redirection of H2020 funds to support EFSI projects has resulted in marginal benefits for the cultural and educational sector and for public universities. The problem of the low success rate also applies to the Erasmus + program. Here, too, it would be necessary to increase the budget, as initially announced by the European Commission. Moreover, it is very worrying that the Commission plans to finance other projects, including the European Solidarity Corps, from the Erasmus + budget.

So far, much has been done for this crisis at the expense of other budget chapters, such as the CAP. What should we understand, that Europe needs money to keep an unresolved issue? I therefore propose in this way a first concrete solution, namely the return of competences on migration and border issues to the Member States. In this way it will win in both directions, on the one hand the Union budget will save, and the Member States will have a harder time saying a word about border sovereignty. In conclusion, I consider it irrational to increase funding and introduce new taxes for European citizens as a direct result of a still uncertain situation of the migrant crisis.

The European Commission is deeply concerned by the humanitarian crises in North-East Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Twenty million people in these countries are at risk of starvation and famine in the coming four months. The international community should step up its support now. Tomorrow will, unfortunately, be too late. Let me briefly refer to the situation in each of these four countries and then inform you as to how the European Union is helping the people in need in their countries. I would like to start with Yemen. The situation is dire. Almost 19 million people – yes, this is the figure – are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. This is the largest food insecurity emergency in the world: 7.3 million people are at risk of famine over the next four months. The truth is this: the intensification of fighting is making the humanitarian situation even worse. What we are witnessing is an appalling disregard for protection of civilians and international humanitarian law. If fighting reaches Hodeidah Port, which is the main entry point for food imports into the country, there will be dramatic humanitarian consequences. Second, there is the Lake Chad crisis, which includes North-East Nigeria. The situation in North-East Nigeria is of great concern owing to Boko Haram’s activities. I witnessed this myself when I visited the country, especially the area of Yola town, at that time. But the worry is even bigger right now because of the combination of extremism and instability with climate change and population growth. Over five million people need emergency food assistance in North-East Nigeria alone. Thirdly, South Sudan. This is the very definition of a ‘man-made crisis’. It is a shame. Three years of conflict have had catastrophic consequences. The United Nations declared a localised famine in February. Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of dying. These figures could further increase if they do not receive urgent assistance. This is unfortunately the situation on the ground. The European Union is a leading donor in South Sudan. However, the parties to the conflict, including government troops, are stopping the delivery of assistance even in areas hit by famine. Unfortunately, this is the tragic reality for millions of citizens. I saw it with my own eyes when I visited South Sudan, but also during my recent visit to Uganda, which is hosting thousands of South Sudanese refugees. There is no more time for empty promises. The international community has to take a stronger, more outspoken and principled stance on this. Fourthly, Somalia. The situation is desperate. Half the population – over six million people – are now facing acute food insecurity and hunger. Three million people need urgent life-saving assistance. This is three times more than it was six months ago, and even more than at the time of my visit to Mogadishu at the beginning of last year. The expected weather conditions can only make this worse. Dear colleagues, this is the situation in these four areas on the ground. As the European Union, we are fully committed to doing our best to help, as we did last year when we adopted a package of EUR 540 million to help address the El Niño effects in Africa. The European Union has already taken immediate steps to address the most urgent needs. We stepped up our humanitarian funding in all these countries last year, in 2016, with almost EUR 345 million. We have already allocated EUR 200 million in the first two months of this year. I was in Oslo two or three weeks ago and I pledged, on behalf of the European Union, EUR 105 million in humanitarian assistance for North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region. Also, last month we stepped up our assistance to South Sudan to EUR 82 million, and we provided a first package of EUR 10 million of emergency assistance to Somalia. This is an initial allocation. We are currently mobilising all our funding possibilities to step up our response. You will receive, probably today, the Commission proposals for a new emergency package, in particular for the Horn of Africa and Yemen. We count on your quick adoption. At the same time, the Commission is finalising a new significant package for North-East Nigeria, linking relief, rehabilitation and development. This, as you know, has to be matched by other donors, because the needs are huge. Every hour that passes is crucial. Thousands of lives are at stake.

Commissioner! After six years, we have once again such a dramatic situation in the Horn of Africa, but this time it could be the biggest humanitarian crisis in decades on this continent, and this time it is much more difficult because the crisis in hungry countries is man-made. 20 million people in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria are facing starvation. Prolonged conflicts mean that there is a shortage of food, food prices are rising and people are forced to leave their homes, while humanitarian convoys have limited access to those in need. In the last famine in the Horn of Africa, 250,000 people died, half of them children under the age of five. A famine means that at least 30% of a country's children are severely and severely malnourished, and the death rate among the population is enormous. Already in February, the United Nations declared a famine in the northern part of South Sudan as humanitarian aid was cut off. It is now a national problem, and its sole cause is an internal political dispute that has turned into a violent conflict. You have already spoken about the data: 7.5 million Sudanese people require immediate help, and there is a cholera epidemic spreading in this country. In Yemen, two-thirds of the population suffer from food insecurity as fighting continues. There are displacements, and the lack of access to medical care results in higher morbidity and, of course, higher mortality rates. In Northeast Nigeria, where 80% of the population was dependent on agriculture and cattle breeding, Boko Haram militias forced many people to flee their homes and destroyed livelihoods in rural areas. As for Somalia, there is a period of drought from January to March, while previous rainy seasons were poor in rainfall and the crops were destroyed, and the water reserves are exhausted.Added to this is the terrorist action of the Ash-Shabbab group, which carries out attacks in the southern and central parts of Somalia it controls, effectively destabilizing the country.We are pleased that the European Commission decided in February to donate 82 million as part of the aid package for the South Sudan famine, and today's declarations by the Commissioner are also proof of the EU's swift response to the appeals of the international community.However, the UN Deputy Secretary General for Humanitarian Aid Stephen O'Brian said that about $ 4.5 billion should be allocated to the implementation of the plan of action prepared by the organization.This is a huge amount, but I hope we can make a collective and coordinated global effort to prevent the tragic consequences of one of the greatest crises in recent African history, which could claim 20 million lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 1, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 1, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 422, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group.- Madam President, about half a million children in Nigeria, about two hundred thousand in Somalia, about three hundred thousand in South Sudan, about five hundred thousand in Yemen;In total, a million and a half children, like this child who has been lucky enough to live and be born in the European Union, are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.It is a certain and immediate risk of death.Millions of people are hungry.And the cause of all this is an explosive mixture: war conflicts, poverty, climate change.As always, climate change affects the poorest;conflicts affect women and children first;poverty affects everyone.I support the fact that the package that the Commissioner has presented to us, which we will receive today, is quickly processed in Parliament, to serve millions of people who are at risk of death.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 423, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group.

Moreover, the current crisis differs from the past in that it is occurring in a large number of countries at the same time. It should be remembered that around 30 countries are dependent on external food aid and that five of them have entered the acute phase of the food disaster. We can go on about the current crisis for a long time to conclude, finally, that the five most affected countries are all marked by conflicts. This does not explain everything, but internal conflicts are often such that the distribution of food aid is almost impossible. The drought in East Africa should be added, but this only partially explains the phenomenon of the current famine. When it is not a conflict between Shiites and Sunnis, it is an ethnic war which endangers millions of lives and, among them, many children, who are only skin on their bones. It is up to us to act with our means of humanitarian intervention, while being aware that we will not be able to do everything, unfortunately.

IMF and World Bank interventions and the prevailing neoliberal guidelines, the significant increase in the cost of production factors in agriculture, inseparable from the power and role of multinationals, the drastic reduction in the purchasing power of the urban population, the dismantling of programs social debt, debt and debt servicing, the replacement of state cereal reserves and the price fixing mechanisms of agricultural products in local markets by the Chicago Stock Exchange, for a world market dominated by agribusiness multinationals and speculators, the civil wars and the various conflicts instigated by external powers, such as the United States, Saudi Arabia and some European countries, external interference and the imperialist impulse to control natural resources, such as oil - all this led to what the United Nations already classified as the biggest drama, the biggest humanitarian crisis, since its creation in 45.

We definitely share the same concerns and worries, and of course our determination is common. There is no doubt that we have to do more. But make no mistake: as my dear friend has already mentioned, the European Union is doing its part and we will, of course, do more. But let me remind you of something critical. This is also a development crisis. As some of you have already mentioned, we need to address the root causes of fragility, conflict, poor governance, non-governance and the rule of law. Otherwise our response will never achieve sustainable results. The European Union Trust Fund for Africa and the External Investment Plan, as new instruments, are aimed precisely at covering this dimension. We do not, of course, have any illusions, but I think we are already moving in the right direction in order to address the root causes. In parallel, what matters in any humanitarian crisis is that humanitarian organisations have immediate and full access to do their job and deliver aid. Repeated violations of international humanitarian law are simply unacceptable. The governments of these countries have a primary responsibility to care for the basic needs of their populations and to allow aid organisations to support them in this obligation. To conclude, let me say that this human suffering is not inevitable. Almost all these crises are manmade. Above all – as some of you have already said – they need political solutions. The European Union has a responsibility to put its weight behind efforts to address the root causes of these crises, be they driven by conflict, climate change, population growth or other causes.

Today it is clear to everyone that high-speed connection is essential for our society and our economy. It is expected that by 2021 the number of smartphones will double and that by 2020 Internet traffic will increase by eight times compared to the current one. I mention only these two data to give the measure of the increase and rapid growth of everything related to digital. We must be ready to answer this growing demand for connection. I think we need to do this because consumers, like businesses and public administrations, need it to offer better and more efficient services. I am thinking of all the innovative services - they are in front of all of us - that are emerging: from connected cars, to all remote healthcare management, to all public administration services and also to the whole huge issue of the digitalization of businesses. . Internet of things, cloud and mobile communication services are just some examples of connectivity that are experiencing this development globally. And therefore there is a demand for speed but also for communication networks capable of carrying a lot of data, a huge and growing mass of data, reaching densely populated areas as well as remote areas. The development of the most advanced technologies therefore requires the European legislator to guarantee the best possible access to the Internet for all citizens, even in remote areas, also contributing to the development of increasingly cross-border applications and transnational. Radio frequencies have no borders, which is why it is necessary to provide for better coordination of the spectrum at European level - I have long been a great supporter of this need for coordination at European level - and it is in this context that the proposal of this a decision we will vote on tomorrow, which contains specific measures for the coordinated release of the 694-790 MHz band, more quickly called the \"700 MHz band\". The aim of the proposal is to create uniform criteria at European level for the allocation of frequencies, to overcome barriers to entry, to overcome the current obstacles to competition and to offer this high-speed wireless connectivity with a universal character. The availability of a broad radio spectrum is one of the essential prerequisites for the deployment of broadband services. Its management takes place at national level - it is a national asset - and the sale of the related rights of use can ensure huge revenues (some states have already done so) for the coffers of the member states. But the management of the radio spectrum at national level determines very different conditions between the individual states, both in terms of license duration, coverage obligations, but above all the consequences of inefficient use of this precious resource. That is why, in the opinion of the Commission, but also of Parliament, we need to act in a timely manner, as we are doing, to ensure that spectrum is managed and regulated more efficiently. Basically, the proposal focuses on two elements: for the 700 band there is a common timetable for it to be effectively available for use by wireless services under harmonized conditions, with coordination measures to support the transition phase. For the sub-700 band a long-term priority is foreseen for the distribution of audiovisual media services to the general public, together with a flexible approach, the use of spectrum in response to the different degree of diffusion of digital terrestrial television in the various Member States.We have reached a good compromise in the ITRE committee, asking for the release of this band to take place by 2020 but also for the possibility of a small delay, motivated by some specific conditions, to be provided for some States.And we also asked for a coordination plan for transnational issues.I think it is a good, balanced job that responds to clear objectives and that will put us in a position to win this race for the spread of 5G and all the most advanced technologies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 445, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Andrus ANSIP", "mepid": "124696", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of Parliament, we welcome the political agreement in December 2016 and the swift preparation of the final text by both co-legislators. A coordinated and timely release of the 700 MHz band by mid-2020 is fundamental to establish a European world-leading 5G home market of innovative services like the connected car and high-speed rural broadband. The Commission has suggested ambitious connectivity targets in its digital single market strategy, and also a structured plan for European leadership in deploying 5G mobile services. One objective is that all European households, including in rural and remote regions, should have access to connectivity offering download speeds of at least 100 Mbps by 2025. In addition, uninterrupted 5G coverage should be ensured in urban areas and along major transport paths by 2025. For this to happen we need high-quality spectrum to provide wide area coverage at high speed and a reasonable cost for operators. The 700 MHz band is ideal for this purpose. With regard to the agreed sub-700 MHz band, its availability for broadcasting until 2030 ensures legal certainty for developing our European audiovisual model as well as flexibility for adapting to diverse national situations. Therefore we will work closely with the Member States on a timely and structured implementation of this instrument by the following steps: publishing national roadmaps for transition, a key tool to ensure predictability for our stakeholders and consistency of approaches in the single market; minimising delays for 700 MHz availability and resolving cases of cross-border interference in a timely manner; enhancing wireless coverage for high-quality connectivity for citizens and innovative services; fostering coordination of the evolving use of the sub-700 MHz band including a future review.

It was a very good cooperation and we achieved a lot, securing that the 700 MHz band can be allocated in 2020, with some adjustments for some Member States if they have duly justified reasons until 2022. This means an important opportunity for Europe. I think you can say that the third generation of mobile telephony was a digitalisation of telephony, and Europe was in the lead with very important consequences of a positive kind for the European economy. 4G was the digitalisation of services, and Europe lost the lead because of fragmentation, and because we did not deploy the networks rapidly enough. And that also had economic consequences because Europe is lagging behind, not only regarding 4G but also regarding all the services that are coming from 4G. That creates problems for our competitiveness, innovation, unemployment and growth. 5G is the normalisation of the digital, and that makes the game much more important, because if we cannot be in the lead regarding 5G we will not be in the lead regarding innovative products, companies, services, and we will not be able to take the lead regarding growth, global champions and competitiveness. This has huge consequences and I think, seen from this perspective, the decision here tonight is one of the more important in Europe in order to make Europe strong, globally and economically.  5G is dependent on the 700 MHz band. Not only because of the rapid increase in mobile data traffic, which our rapporteur described, but also because it is essential as a base for 5G regarding connectivity, regarding rural areas but also regarding the opportunity to reach through buildings and make the services possible everywhere. And 5G will mean huge opportunities for us in healthcare, for the car industry, for traffic, for small cities, indeed for everything because it will be not only the internet of things but the internet of everything or anything. And we must be aware that other parts of the world want to be in the lead: China, the US and a lot of others. I want Europe to be in the lead.

The Internet of Things, the cloud and mobile communications services, the digitalization of industry - keyword Industry 4.0 -, e-government or G5 technology - they all have one thing in common: They need communication networks that are fast, that can transfer large amounts of data and that are dense populated as well as remote areas, i.e. rural areas. In addition to new technologies for data transmission and reception, the most important thing in the gigabit society is the extensive use of frequency ranges, in this case the frequency band 470–790 MHz. The aim of this report is to create an EU-wide uniform frequency allocation in this bandwidth, which enables companies and citizens alike to have a comprehensive wireless network connection at high speeds. We need fast internet, but it will be expensive. The German Federal Transport Minister recently calculated that the nationwide broadband expansion in Germany alone will cost around EUR 100 billion. Internet connections with a performance of 1000 megabits per second should be the digital measure of all things by 2025. At the EU level, people are less ambitious. All EU citizens should have access to broadband speeds of at least 30 megabits by 2020. What is important about this report: In order to achieve a harmonization of the frequency band, it is planned that the member states will adopt their own timetable for the reallocation of the 700 megahertz band by June 30 of next year. If one assumes that the mobile Internet will increase eightfold by 2020 compared to today, then the capacity expansion is a basic requirement for the gigabit society.

First, and foremost, I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Toia, and also my good friend and colleague who has just left, Gunnar Hökmark, who did an excellent job and reached what I believe to be a good and well-balanced agreement.  The key point here to remember is that a requirement for the fast roll-out of 5G is: do we want to be a leader, or a follower? Allocating this spectrum as soon as possible is vital if we want to ensure the steady roll-out of 5G. 5G is a development which brings significant benefits to European economies. We were too slow in deploying 4G and, as a result, we were left chasing our competitors. We need to secure enough spectrum for this roll-out  between faster download speeds, higher capacity, more broadband users and more reliable networks. This is crucial for businesses and citizens alike, and we need to ensure that they are at the forefront of the roll-out.  Coming from a rural constituency, I know only too well the problems with connectivity outside urban areas. Skibbereen is a town in county Cork, in my constituency. It is Ireland’s first rural digital hub, Ludgate, also known as Gigabit Town. As a result, Skibbereen is home to many innovative businesses and projects. It is an example of the possibilities when our rural areas are given access to strong connectivity, and I am extremely proud to see such great work happening in my constituency.  This frequency band is crucial for ensuring the provision of these broadband services in rural areas, to keep up with towns and cities and help to ensure that our rural population is not left behind in the digital age. From the perspective of Ireland, a country which prides itself on leadership in the digital start-up sphere, it is crucial that we set the infrastructural framework to attract companies to Europe, and this means rolling out 5G. We cannot be left behind in this regard, otherwise we are allowing jobs to go elsewhere at a time when we should be giving the signal that all of Europe is open for business.

Everybody in the European Union will benefit from that, and everybody can understand the meaning of this decision. We were recently also able to allow portability of content to our citizens. Once again, everybody will benefit from that, and everybody can understand the meaning of this decision. Regarding the 700 MHz, the situation is a little more complicated. Not everyone is able to understand about 700 MHz. I would say that a majority of our citizens will switch off if somebody starts to talk about 700 MHz, but it is an extremely important issue. We can only dream about remote surgery or connected cars and 5G. Without clarity in 700 MHz it will never become reality in the European Union. But this is global competition. We know that South Korea has stated that it will start to use 5G at their Olympic Games in 2018. I took part in the G7 meeting in Japan, where the Japanese said very clearly that at their Olympic Games in 2020 they will start to use 5G. In Europe, Ericsson and Telia have stated that they will start to use major elements of 5G in 2018 in three cities: Stockholm, Tallinn and Helsinki. It is easy to think that it is possible to create new apps based on 5G or to build new cars based on 5G by just knowing theoretically how it will work. But we know the best solutions we will be able to get are if we are faced with real-life situations. So we are in a terrible hurry, and that is why we are setting ambitious aims, namely to cover all the urban areas and main transport paths with 5G networks by 2025. There is a secondary aim: in at least one major city in every EU Member State, they have to start to use 5G networks on a commercial basis by 2020. This is important for self-driving cars, absent and remote surgery, etc. This clarity in 700 MHz is a real pre-condition for being among the leaders of this global competition. I would like to cordially thank all Members of Parliament, but especially the rapporteur, Ms Toia, for this heavyweight decision. I am sure that, thanks to this decision, Europe will take a leading position in the meaning of 5G.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 462, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Patrizia TOIA", "mepid": "28340", "text": "rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has truly been a job in which each colleague has made his own contribution, has given his own ideas and is therefore the result of joint work. I want to say three very brief things: we all understood the importance of winning, as Europe, this challenge of 5G: therefore a rapid availability of these frequencies and a harmonized and effective assignment, because we know that this band with lower frequencies allows a capillarity of diffusion. However, we knew that, with the very slow release of the 800 MHz band, we had a lack of success with 4G, which slowed the diffusion of all networks that used 4G. The first goal was therefore to take a step forward. However, we could not forget the objective of satisfying the needs of broadcasters, which are also companies that give work, generate profits, so we needed to find a balance, a win-win strategy. We worked very well with the CULT commission, with my colleague Maullu who was its rapporteur, and we have found, I believe, a balanced solution that allows us to overcome this challenge but also to leave the whole issue on the field, which is of great interest to Europe. , creative and broadcasting companies. One last thing, which concerns my country a little: there was a lot of concern when we wanted to introduce the possibility of reasoned postponement to free frequencies until 2022. We said, however, that it is not due to the laziness of the States, that they fold their arms and do nothing! It is a question of understanding certain objective situations. It seems to me that it was a choice of trust but also a winning one: I speak for my country which seemed one of those that, due to historical and political conditions, had a certain delay. I know that many things have been set in motion: the coordination plans to address the issue of transnational interference, which are many and we, in Italy, are affected with France and Croatia.All this is going on and therefore maybe we will not use that delay and I hope that the other states do not either so that we will all be ready to do our job well, with realism and with seriousness.So I thank you, Mr. Vice President, also for all that we will still do together on the 5G level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 463, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "- The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday 15 March 2017.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 464, "date": "2017-03-14.json", "name": "Andor DELI", "mepid": "124714", "text": "in writing. - Honorable Members! The report now on the agenda is not just a technical document, even if its title suggests. Ultra broadband internet and 5G internet connection, but the so-called \"700 MHz band\" can be a milestone for the development of the whole digital union. Currently, the 470-790 MHz frequency band is used for digital terrestrial television and various audio equipment such as wireless microphones. The so-called \"800 MHz\" frequency band (790-862 MHz) is used for broadband services, but this is no longer sufficient for the further development of these services. The basic condition for moving forward is the availability of sufficient radio spectrum. From 2020, the \"700 MHz band\" would also be available for broadband and 5G internet, thus contributing, inter alia, to improving the quality of digital and broadband services, full coverage of rural and less developed regions and ensuring social, social and digital cohesion. In the EU. Among the objectives, I would also like to highlight the conclusion of cross-border frequency coordination agreements, which would allow the future cross-border use of the frequency band without interference and, consequently, the phasing out of area-based restrictions on digital services.

Fifth-generation telecommunications technology can bring about fundamental changes in related services. Europe needs to become a market leader in the development and application of these technologies as competition in the telecommunications market intensifies. The release of the 700 MHz frequency band is the first major step in this direction.
