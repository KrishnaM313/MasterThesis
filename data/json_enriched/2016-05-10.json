Not only will it affect EU trade, but deriving from it, jobs and growth as well. Obviously the EU must comply with its obligations under WTO law, but it must also balance the legitimate concerns of European producers, consumers, and users, while acknowledging China’s position as a strategic trading partner. Clearly the EU is under high pressure from its industries and civil society to take a decision on this matter. On the Council side, we will examine the full potential impact of our decision in order to give the question a solid and well-founded answer. This is why the Council very much welcomes the work being carried out by the European Commission, in particular the open public consultation of stakeholders and a full impact assessment. In addition, it is important not to lose sight of the potential effects of the EU’s decision in this matter, beyond the trade aspects of our relations with China. Yes, the Council is very much aware of the alarming situation of the EU steel industry, which is facing a serious crisis as a result of global overcapacity, in particular in China. Now, as you will know, the Council has not yet taken any position, for the very reason that the right to initiate legislation belongs to the Commission. In other words, the Council looks forward to the results of the Commission’s impact assessment and stands ready to work with the European Parliament and the Commission in the best interests of EU industry and European citizens. In the meantime, the Council has restarted discussions on the Commission’s 2013 proposal on modernising the EU’s trade defence instruments (TDIs). Although it is not for me to prejudge the outcome of the ongoing work, let me underline that this might be the moment to reflect on how to improve our trade defence mechanisms with a view to better tackling unfair trade practices and to ensuring a global level playing field for EU companies. In the same context, the recent release by the Commission of its communication on steel has been a welcome initiative to examine how to strengthen our defences against unfair competition and cheap imports.  In closing, and considering the importance of the subject, the Foreign Affairs Council, in trade formation, will discuss the Commission’s communication from a trade angle this coming Friday May 13, including new Commission ideas on how to modernise the EU’s trade defence instruments and in particular in the light of the economic damage caused by overcapacity in third-country markets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is very clear that the issue of market economy status for China, as well as the overcapacity issue in the steel sector, are two of the most important trade issues facing us. The Commission is treating them as an utmost priority. While the EU-China relationship is of the utmost importance, it is undeniable that China is not a market economy by any standards. We know that is not the question here. We are working very hard to find a solution, but that is not easy. Clearly our trade defence instruments need to be efficient and effective, independently of the expiry of certain provisions of China’s WTO Accession Protocol. Let me tell you where we are. The three options we are considering are, firstly, we do nothing. This would mean no change in legislation, an option that we consider would pose a high legal risk, given that the European Union’s and other countries’ methodology for China is based on the very elements of the Protocol which expires in December this year.  Secondly, we remove China from the list of non—market economies and apply the standard dumping calculation methodology. This is usually called granting market economy status to China. Our analysis of this option so far and the feedback from many stakeholders show that it would involve a very high cost in terms of potential job losses in the European Union, as the Union would not be able to allow fully for the distortions existing in the Chinese economy and would therefore no longer be able to provide the necessary protection against unfair trading practices. Even without the current climate of overcapacity, any such move would be untenable. Thirdly, we change the anti-dumping methodology by introducing a new approach which would maintain a strong trade defence system in the EU, while giving effect to the expiry of certain provisions of the China Accession Protocol. This approach would help ensure that the dumping margins calculated would, for the most part, reflect the ongoing distortions in the Chinese economy more accurately. The EU would thus be following the example of the United States. The Commission’s public consultation ended on 28 April and generated almost 5 300 sponsors, as well as some 150 additional submissions delivered by citizens, industrial associations and other stakeholders in the form of letters, position papers, emails, etc. In addition, almost 300 stakeholders attended a Commission conference on 13 March, which was followed by a consultation with the social partners on 15 April. The economic study carried out by external economic experts is also being finalised. The additional work on the study aims to enlarge upon the results and provide more information about the impact of the options at both Member State and sectoral level.  The input received and the feedback from all of these sources is being compared and analysed at present, and the findings will be reflected in the impact assessment. Given the massive interest and the volume of representations received, it takes time to draw conclusions. Once the impact assessment has been finished, as it will be in the coming weeks, the College is planning to discuss the matter again before the summer recess. We are also in close contact with our non-European Union G7 partners on the issue, bearing in mind of course that the specific features of each legal system differ. Irrespective of the legal interpretation of Section 15 of China’s Protocol of Accession to the World Trade Organisation, let me reassure you that the Commission’s overriding aim is to ensure that the EU will continue to have a trade defence system that will remain strong and effective in the face of unfair trading practices – practices which, as we see, are especially frequent when there is massive overcapacity , not only in the steel sector, but in many other sectors as well.  It is becoming more urgent than ever for the modernisation package to be adopted. Parliament has done its job, but unfortunately the Council has been unable to take matters forward. As you know, the Commission is making every effort to help the Member States to break the deadlock. The adoption of the modernisation package has also been mentioned in the connection with the steel communication.

And this for a simple reason: today China, despite the progress made, is not a market economy. Let us not take refuge behind technicality. What is at stake is the future of European industry and millions of jobs. We have a duty to listen to the well-founded concerns of those workers who fear for their jobs.  Chinese industries have been dumping in the steel sector for years, but all manufacturing could be affected by unfair competition. Faced with this risk, in the name of the precautionary principle, we have a duty to stop. The recognition of market economy status would in fact be an irreversible choice, and there can be no compromise solutions or mitigation measures in relation to this. There are only two possibilities: either China fully meets the five criteria that define the market economy (and I challenge anyone to say that the conditions are there today) or China cannot be granted this status. This does not mean, in any way, denying the friendship between China and the European Union, which is and will remain strong, but today a risky decision would contribute to the suicide of European industry.

The ECR Group believes that certain fundamental principles should be considered within this process and these should go hand in hand with the Commission’s impact assessment with industry, with some 5 000 responses, and it is vital that the results of these are taken into account ahead of any proposals being made.  Firstly, and undoubtedly, the case that Chinese contravention of world trade rules has led to the dramatic decline of our own industries, most notably steel in the UK, in recent months. Nevertheless, we expect the EU to lead the way on global trading rules and if we want China to play by the rules we have to do so ourselves. We therefore need to ensure the full compatibility of EU law with the EU’s obligations arising from its WTO commitments, as well as the legal consequences of changes to China’s accession protocol. We also need to determine the full legal meaning of those sections of the protocol which will remain after 11 December 2016 so that we know how to proceed in our relationship with China.  That being said, we must also consider the practical consequences as well as the legal ones. The positive and negative medium and long-term effects for industry, Member States’ economies, and societal impacts need to be known ahead of any decision that is taken. We cannot do this blindly. And in order to deal with any of these negative repercussions in the future, it is critically important that we retain full ability to take timely, necessary and effective measures to tackle anti-competitive market prices by EU trading partners.

We need to ensure EU policies are in place after the protocol of China’s WTO accession, which was agreed to 15 years ago, expires. Our Group feels strongly about not leaving this to the WTO courts to decide. Not only do we need solid EU trade defence instruments in general, but specifically the EU needs to be able to apply anti-dumping measures in cases of dumping of goods by China beyond the end of this year.  Our Group wants a thorough assessment of the legal consequences of the expiration of the protocol, as well as a long-term legal, economic and political impact assessment. We look forward to seeing the results of the outcome of the public consultation and the Commission’s impact assessment. We need EU measures to be WTO compliant. It is the only credible way to underline the importance that we adhere to global trade based on rules that apply equally to all. This debate is not, contrary to what the name may suggest, a debate on whether or not China’s economy operates according to free trade and fair competition laws and principles. We share the concerns about state interference, the creation of overcapacity, the lack of transparency and the existence of reliable indicators that can predictably verify whether prices are the result of supply and demand or whether they are kept artificially low.  What we do know is that wages and environmental standards are lower in China than they are in the EU. In fact, importers in Europe benefit from this aspect of globalisation, and it can also lead to lower prices for consumers.

In the coal and steel sectors, 1.8 to 5 million people are estimated to lose their jobs. Cynicism of the market economy: the price of steel is rising again. Nevertheless, it is precisely here that there is great concern for jobs, including in many Member States of our European Union. And outside, the steelworkers are protesting. The problems arose from management errors as a result of the fall in demand in China, from weaker economic growth, to which the EU economy had become accustomed and which was often used by local companies as the engine of European economic growth. The Chinese market has long compensated for the EU's lack of industrial policy plans and investments, which have now become apparent after years of prolonged and unresolved economic crisis. However, the debate on market economy status and the choice of weapons in a trade war is misleading and does not provide a solution for jobs. The EU and China must learn and regulate common existence. We need a corrective approach on both sides and constructive solutions based on and within the framework of the WTO. I therefore call on the Commission not only to negotiate with China on investment protection, but to negotiate an agreement for fair trade and against price, social and environmental dumping, in the interests of jobs here and there.

We do not want to cling to more or less bold interpretations of the Accession Protocol.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in opening the discussion, I wanted to remind you that the virtual total free trade with China has devastated French and European industry. These ridiculous border protections are imposed on Europeans by promising that they will benefit by focusing on high value-added products. You were wrong again. The European countries have paid for this huge mistake for you by the loss of a large part of their industry and by enormous social suffering. Quite predictably, huge wage differences and very unequal social, health and environmental regulations have worked, industries have left entire regions to the Chinese skies, workers have been laid off by the millions and have often never found work. You promised the Europeans that the Chinese would settle for the low end and that we would develop the industry of the future. The Chinese are selling us televisions, phones, internet networks, and so on. It is a huge field of ruins that your irresponsible policy has left on our soil.

Even worse, World Trade Organization rules will no longer allow us to protect ourselves from products sold at broken prices by a Chinese industry in chronic overproduction. Do you want to trigger another catastrophe or will you stop rendering the Member States of the European Union powerless?

We have a common trade policy, but when it comes to trade diplomacy with China, we have 28 states that act separately from each other. When we mobilised the European Parliament on the issue of Chinese dumping on photovoltaic panels, what did we see? First, that Europe did not have the commercial defence tools sufficiently relevant and robust to protect the competitive European photovoltaic panel industry. But we also found that, all of a sudden, because China does not speak to Europe - it speaks to the 28 European leaders - Europe has broken down.  We have seen France let go because of the threats to wine, and Greece, because of the threats of investment in the port of Piraeus. China has divided Europe by threatening every state. Germany preferred to sell its machine tools that produced Chinese photovoltaic panels rather than impose anti-dumping rules. We are still seeing it with the steel industry - one of the most affected countries, the United Kingdom, with a Prime Minister who is still hesitant to do anti-dumping - because we are afraid of China.

Yes, some of it is to do with appallingly bad British Government decisions over the years – no one to blame but ourselves. Some of it is due to the application of crazy directives about green taxation and carbon emissions, which has caused damage to us. But now we have aggressive dumping by China, which is distorting the market. This is not about free trade. It is a hostile act to destroy our steel industry.

We will lose a vital part of our tradition and our history – certainly in the UK – and it is strategically vital that we keep an operational steel industry.

Macroeconomic management of the planned economy continues, state-owned corporations are privileged, and intellectual property is not adequately protected in China. This gives China an artificial competitive advantage. I am personally concerned and concerned. I come from Linz, the heart of Austrian steel production.

Secondly, I have heard someone here say, somewhat naively, that it is a good thing to buy products at low prices from China. Well, this is a typical statement of those who unfortunately live more in here than outside, in reality.

Mr President, for some time now the German and other European multinationals, in order to reduce labour costs, have gone through the outsourcing process, transferring part of their production to China. As a result, unemployment in Europe has risen sharply, and the European Union has been closing its eyes to the massive violations of labour rights in China, as well as the practices of Chinese dumping. Now China has grown into the world's second most powerful economy. It aspires to achieve a new division of labour and redistribution of spheres of influence and exploitation around the world.

It is true that the picture is not always just a rosy one and we do face a difficult global environment. The growth rate remains modest at a projected 1.8% in the EU this year and there are significant differences between Member States. But things are slowly getting better. The employment situation is also slowly improving but, again, with significant differences among Member States.  In this context, I am happy to note – and I will focus my intervention on this specific point – that unemployment of young people has dropped slightly recently. The gradual improvement in the economic situation over the past two years has translated into a somewhat better situation regarding youth unemployment. While remaining at overall high levels, it has been declining since the year 2013. In 2015 and early this year, 2016, youth unemployment continued to fall and at a faster rate than overall unemployment. Let me be clear though, because we should not hide the fact that the overall level of youth unemployment still remains very worrying, and I would like to underline once more that the situation differs significantly among the Member States. What did we do and what is still to be done to address this? It is not necessary to remind you that three years ago the Council adopted a recommendation on establishing the Youth Guarantee. This recommendation has been, without any doubt, a cornerstone of European policy measures on youth employment. Funds from the Youth Employment Initiative have been front—loaded and the Member States are implementing the Guarantee through their Youth Guarantee implementation plans.  Obviously implementing is just one thing. Taking stock of what has been done and, above all, what is still to be done is another thing. Three years after the adoption of the Youth Guarantee, the Employment Committee has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Guarantee and for that purpose a framework for indicators has been developed.  Earlier this year, in March, the Council approved recommendations from the Employment Committee and I am convinced that they are of great importance for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee after 2016. In this respect, we look forward to the review of the Commission which should be presented by the end of this year. The same goes for the announced new skills agenda which should contribute to the achievement of the EU’s targets of cutting the early school-leaving rate to below 10% and getting more young people into higher education or equivalent vocational education. Let me also remind you that the new EURES Regulation should enter into force in the coming days and I sincerely hope that the modernised EURES network can also substantially contribute to the fight against the unemployment of young people. We are fully aware of the fact that Parliament expressed its concerns in the recent past about the slow implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Funding was increased and we tried to speed things up, although it should be clear to all of us that, first of all, Member States are the ones that have to implement structural reforms.  As you all know, youth employment has always been a central subject in the country—specific recommendations, and will continue to be so. We need more job creation and we also need to exploit the full potential of the exchange of best practices among the EU Member States, and also beyond the Union. Let me also underscore that the social partners have a very important role to play within this context.  With specific measures like the Youth Guarantee and, above all, with the ongoing structural reforms in the Member States, we should be able to take advantage of the improving economic situation and, thus, to make further progress in the reduction of youth unemployment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 66, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, since its first day in office, a key goal of this Commission has been to boost economic growth through a combination of funding tools such as the investment plan and structural funds, policy reforms in the framework of the European Semester, new initiatives to unleash the potential of the internal market such as the digital single market or the energy union , and, finally, policy guidance. Our objective is that this will help to tackle the high level of unemployment we are still faced with, and notably youth unemployment.  There are now encouraging signs which I should first mention, as was also just mentioned. Approximately 4.3 million young people in the European Union were unemployed in March 2016. This is down from a peak of 5.7 million in December 2012, or, simply put, a drop of nearly 25%. These are positive developments, reflecting a return to growth, decisive action from the Member States and the support given by the EU. However, while the youth unemployment rate has decreased from a peak of 23.9% in February 2013 to 19.1% in March 2016, it is still too high in various Member States. There are peaks of more than 35% in several countries. Moreover – and more alarmingly – in 2015, 12% of young people aged between 15 and 24 were not in employment, education or training, with peaks of around 20% in Bulgaria and Italy. Wasting the potential of young people, who are usually better trained, is something we cannot afford. Against this background, President Juncker made it clear that we need to channel funding towards projects that can help get the younger generation back to work in decent jobs, further complementing the efforts already undertaken with the Youth Guarantee Scheme, the implementation of which must be accelerated and progressively broadened. As you may know, the Youth Guarantee is a political commitment that all young people under 25 get an offer – within four months of leaving education or becoming unemployed – for employment, a traineeship, an apprenticeship or continued education. Delivery on the objectives of a Youth Guarantee require strategic reforms to achieve more successful transitions from school to the labour market. Progress has been carefully monitored within the European Semester and has resulted in country-specific recommendations where appropriate. Notably, in 2015, country—specific recommendations for Bulgaria, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Romania specifically pointed to the need for action on youth employment.  The Commission has mobilised a range of instruments to support implementation. Policy support and mutual learning help Member States put in place the right infrastructure and measures. The Youth Guarantee’s implementation is still in an early stage, and additional efforts are needed to accelerate and broaden its implementation. While progress has been facilitated so far by an unprecedented political backing and support from EU financial instruments, a key challenge is to ensure sustainable implementation. This requires fundamental structural reforms in most Member States in order to create the necessary conditions to help young generations enter the labour market. The Commission will continue to monitor the Youth Guarantee. In order to take stock of the success achieved and lessons learned from the Youth Guarantee, let me inform you that the report on its implementation and the operation of the Youth Employment Initiative is due by the end of 2016. This will also address the quality and framework of traineeship implementation. It will include a qualitative assessment of the actions and the use of the funding devoted to supporting young people.  The forthcoming Skills Agenda is complementary to the Youth Guarantee. Indeed, we need to make sure that everybody – not only the young – has the skills needed to keep pace with a fast-changing labour market. Europe’s economic success is, to a very large extent, based on the skills of our people. Our future competitiveness and growth depend on skills, and the pace of change in the labour market makes this especially challenging. The digital revolution continues to reshape jobs. The new Skills Agenda will focus on skills as an elevator to the employability of all people. It will also focus on creating the right environment for all skills to drive competitiveness and fair and balanced growth. Moreover, it will set out actions for a reinforced engagement with businesses for a shared commitment to deliver skills to Europe. However, we should not forget that the main responsibility for defining their employment and social policies and for pursuing structural reforms lies, of course, with the Member States. The Commission is working closely with them to support and complement their actions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 67, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I welcome the fact that the EPP Group has insisted on linking this debate on youth employment to the issue of growth, because the subjects of employment and growth are really linked.  Make no mistake, the first of the precarious situation for young people, in particular, is unemployment. A young person without a job or training does not find a place in society. He cannot take his autonomy, he has no housing, no car, sometimes even, no driver's license. This means that an unemployed young person can quickly find himself marginalized and, also, that work is a real factor of social integration.  Today, in Europe, growth is still low, very low in some Member States, and the entry of young people into the labour market has become very difficult. The subject is very serious. Almost 20% of young Europeans are now looking for a job. So what opportunities can we offer our youth? How can we encourage her to undertake, to innovate in Europe, rather than to push her to pursue a career on other continents? How can we not feed the sense of betrayal that sometimes pushes her into the arms of populists? It is these questions that Europe must answer, and it is not through subsidies, supported jobs or emergency measures that we will provide lasting answers.  Young people have ideas, talent, energy. They want to prove what they are worth. They do not expect their politicians to give them alms, but to create the conditions for a return to growth and job creation. The Commission published its economic forecasts last week, but it has clearly shown the differences and differences that exist from one Member State to another. So some Member States have already made a number of reforms. Ireland, Portugal and Italy are in this situation and have seen the unemployment rate fall.  I would also like to highlight the good figures of Spain, where new elections are being prepared and where the courageous reform efforts undertaken are beginning to bear fruit. Unfortunately, this is not the case in all Member States. This is not the case in France despite the repeated assertions of François Hollande and Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, whose optimism seems very gullible. The \"everything is better in France\" speech does not stand up to serious scrutiny for a minute.

We have a young generation with a lot of potential for creativity and innovation.

We have not mentioned Greece – which is above 50% – in Italy it is also very high, as it is in Slovakia and Croatia. So something is badly wrong in the way the European Union is working and this has huge implications, not only in social and economic terms, but also in political terms, as we can see. So my plea is to adapt all the tools we have to go to the heart of the problem: very high employment and also very deep divergences.

I welcome the recent agreement on the IIA on better law—making. Legislation which is simpler and easier to understand and implement will help Member States create an environment that will encourage companies to hire and manage staff, while protecting basic workers’ rights.  Europe’s strength lies in its diversity, and we must use this diversity to learn from one another. There is no one-size-fits-all template.

We voted in this Parliament for increased pre-financing for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). How much has been spent? The deadline is this year. Is it likely that some – even a significant amount – of that money may come back unspent? What are we doing to ensure that this does not happen and the Youth Guarantee delivers? One of the issues I have come across is that it can be challenging to incentivise young people to access the Youth Guarantee. There are different reasons for this and often it is because they know – and the authorities know – that it is only for a few months. It is not sustainable. Many of these young people are already very disillusioned. So what are we doing to reach them? What are we doing to incentivise them? Crucially, we have to understand that this includes the demand side as well as the supply side. One final, and very important, issue I want to raise is about my own country, Ireland, and the fact that the vast majority of young people with disabilities cannot access the Youth Guarantee Scheme. Only those on the live register can access the Youth Guarantee Scheme and most young people with disabilities are not on the live register. So we have a situation in which European moneys are being used to exclude young people with disabilities in the context of employment opportunities.

We have put in place a lot of programmes to end this misery. The effect is shameful, almost non-existent. We are still on the way to losing an entire generation, and an entire generation is losing faith in Europe. I believe it is appropriate to do more now on the part of the Commission and the Council. Firstly, the funds must be increased. Even according to renowned studies, they are by no means sufficient to eliminate youth unemployment. Secondly, we must create qualified training. What we are creating with precariousness, with precarious jobs, with short-term employment, with part-time work and with traineeships is not really a useful qualification for young people, from which they can then live permanently. Thirdly, we need to drastically reduce pre-financing and co-financing conditions in the case of EU funding. Fourthly, yes, we can do better, Mr Kuhn, to promote cooperation between the Member States in the use of vacant training places in prosperous countries, to improve the quality of vocational schools and to set up training centres in the countries with weak vocational training. All this is urgently needed. But it will be of no use if we do not at the same time focus economically on creating good, sustainable work from which people can live independently. This requires a European programme for the future of the Member States and the European level, so that we can finally create new work. We simply need to put an end to austerity and finally ensure that we move forward and that we do not continue to be broken.

In fact, the situation is still so very bad that even the Pope mentioned the problem of youth unemployment in his speech last weekend.

All these things are wrong. The crisis is not yet over, austerity has not – and will not – solve the huge problem of youth unemployment in the European Union and we will have to be the ones to fight for political change, for bringing back hope to young people in Europe.

If the statistics for several years, when youth unemployment is far from falling but remain stable, it should be noted that all measures to reduce unemployment are inadequate and more declarative. Monetary incentives for employers are too small, the commitment period is too short. The money spent on retraining does not produce the result that we want. I believe that very different solutions should be taken and should not only cover unemployment problems. For a young person, nothing less than work is important for housing. Let us build and allow young people to dispose of it on preferential terms. Housing and work for a young, child-raising family should be the most important task for every State of the European Union and every municipality. Another incentive for young people is to create legislation so that young people can do preferential treatment for their family business throughout the European Union.

The EU can and must make a difference here. This can be done, among other things, by increasing intra-European labour mobility. In my region of West Flanders, for example, companies are crying out for qualified staff. Less than 40 kilometres away in northern France, an army of young people is out of work. You can't do this. By making these young people more mobile, we can offer them opportunities across borders. We need to make them physically familiar with the labour market of other Member States, for example by focusing erasmus+ more on work. At the same time, vacancies must be exchanged digitally, efficiently and up-to-date with up-to-date information through projects such as EURES. My second spearhead is the further development of the youth guarantee scheme. We should not only focus on activation, but should focus more on the transition from education to the labour market.

The analysis is correct, the problem is the solution that has been mentioned. In order to rebuild the ailing banking system in southern Europe, a great deal of money is needed, which southern Europe does not have. The solution for the Eurogroup and the Commission is therefore to create new national insolvency rules and to raise the necessary funds from Northern Europe through the Banking Union and the Deposit Guarantee Funds.

The future of Europe is today's young people. That's a fact and can't be changed by anyone. What are we doing with them? Well, here we deal with growth with jobs. The problems of youth unemployment are different depending on the areas of Europe. In some it is an intolerable unemployment rate for an extended period of time; in others it is the quality of work; in others it may be the remuneration of work. But they all lead to the same solution. The solution is that it is a European crisis and it has to have a European approach.

I see that there is one point we all agree on. We must not have a lost generation. Making sure young people get a foot in the labour market remains therefore one of our highest priorities. This is first and foremost important for the young, to allow them to realise themselves through work, to have a decent wage that allows them to rent or buy accommodation and/or to start a family, that takes care of their professional development, but it is also important for society at large.  Young people tend to be better educated and computer literate. We need them to support productivity and growth in Europe. Delivering on the objectives of the Youth Guarantee requires strategic reforms to achieve more successful transitions from school to the labour market. It is a complex programme that requires time and effort in the Member States, but these efforts are starting to pay off. Progress has been carefully monitored within the European Semester, including those country-specific recommendations where appropriate.  In reply to some questions: to Marian Harkin: the majority of the Member States concerned have effectively used advance payment and today more than one million young people have benefited from the scheme directly. However a few Member States might not be in a position to have used up to 50% of the advance payment by 23 May. In that case, they will have to pay back the advance but they will not lose the money as that will stay in the Youth Employment Initiative envelope allocated to their regions. In reply to Ms Pervenche Berès: at the end of the budgetary conciliation last year the three institutions agreed to assign to the Commission the task of assessing the progress made in the execution of the Youth Employment Initiative this year and, taking into account the available budgetary margins, of considering whether additional funding should be proposed after 2016. This assessment is ongoing and while a few Member States might be obliged to pay back the increased advance payments they received one year ago, the results obtained so far deserve to be taken into consideration in the final decisions. On the calls for more growth and programmes, let me remind you that the Youth Employment Initiative is only a part of the solution. There are, for example, specific programmes for small and medium enterprises and there is also the investment plan. Moreover, the Commission has mobilised a range of instruments to support implementation, for example policy support, mutual learning between Member States, outreach campaigns. The Commission will report in October on the progress of the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 116, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT", "mepid": "28176", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, let me take this opportunity to signal once again our full commitment to addressing youth unemployment and let me stress once more that the Council, obviously in close cooperation with the Commission, will pursue its efforts to address the challenges and closely monitor the progress made. Let us not forget the importance of structural reforms in the Member States. The Council, the Commission, and Parliament will not be able to provide the Member States with the one and only silver bullet. It is up to the Member States to act swiftly and in time.  Ms Marian Harkin asked for concrete numbers and the Commissioner has already replied. She also asked whether the Youth Guarantee could have been implemented faster; the answer is yes. It has taken time for Youth Guarantee measures to be put in place, and therefore a complete evaluation is not yet possible, but we are getting there, slowly but surely. What struck me most in this debate were the words of Ms Rodrigues. Europe has no future if we cannot offer a future to our youth. I could not agree more, and therefore this is an important debate. I also agree with Ms McIntyre, who said that we need to create the right environment for businesses to grow so that they can hire young Europeans entering the labour market. But, as I have just said, this is not so much a matter of European funding programmes, it is first and foremost a task for Member States.

Public subsidies granted by the country of origin of the imported product or by an intermediate country from which the product is exported to the EU distort competition because they allow the selling price of products placed on the market to be lowered and are a serious detriment to European companies.

In order to ensure the proper application of its rules, terminology should be introduced into Union law.

The legislative report also added clarity to the guidance on definitions within the text; in the fight to protect European, and by extension the British market from unfairly subsidised manufacturing this kind of clarity is vital.

Since the previous agreement did not include the cephalopod category, there have been very significant changes in the EU fleet and even the dismantling of vessels, the rapporteur calls on the Commission to monitor very closely the state of cephalopod stocks, as well as to strictly respect the priority given to the EU fleet to fish for surplus fish in that country.

This significant reduction is justified as some fish stocks have been too low and therefore time should be allowed to strengthen them. Not only the current fisheries partnership agreements, but also other fisheries partnership agreements show the tendency of the European Union to impose appropriate restrictions on sea fishing. Europe's supply is therefore steadily and significantly reduced by the amount of marine fished. Therefore, the EU should pay more attention to freshwater fish farming.  A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas.

This significant reduction is justified as some fish stocks have been too low and therefore time should be allowed to strengthen them. Not only the current fisheries partnership agreements, but also other fisheries partnership agreements show the tendency of the European Union to impose appropriate restrictions on sea fishing. Europe's supply is therefore steadily and significantly reduced by the amount of marine fished. Therefore, the EU should pay more attention to freshwater fish farming.  A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

The EU's Galileo project has also become interesting for non-Community countries thanks to its innovative nature. In 2006, South Korea and the European Union concluded talks on Korea's participation in the programme. The Agreement provides for cooperation in research, training, market development and trade. It also assumes industrial cooperation and cooperation in the creation of legislation, standardization, certification and development of regional assistance systems.  The conclusion of the agreement with Korea once again confirms the European Union's desire to develop international cooperation. The growing interest of third countries in participating in the Galileo programme stimulates the market for GNSS-based services, with an estimated potential of 3 billion receivers and global revenues of €275 billion per year in 2020.

ITI can be used to achieve the objective of sustainable urban development, but they may also be targeted at other territories. I agree with the need to address the problems associated with these programmes, such as the fact that young people are often excluded from the debate on public policy. It is essential to involve young people in territorial development measures, in particular CLLD.

It also stresses that by guaranteeing a more general approach to governance reform, EU funds should not be directed to national and regional policies within a parallel system, but rather used to achieve sustainable economic outcomes embedded in a broader endeavour. The proposed two instruments already had reservations for the proposers. For example, the Committee on Regional Development has suggested that the idea is complex and that some Member States and regions consider the instrument unnecessary, as coordination with local actors is ongoing. In view of this, the proposed two new instruments do not bring added value and, as they are new instruments, local expertise is not available, which can lead to delays and implementation difficulties. In addition, the development of parallel administrative structures, lack of flexibility, lack of funding for the entire financial planning period and lack of coordination with other development strategies may cause problems in implementation.

Under the European Structural and Investment Funds, two new instruments will be introduced: Community-led local development (CLLD) and Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI). They are likely to be implemented with 5% of the cohesion policy budget. On the basis of preliminary feedback, ITI will be used in 20 Member States and CLLD in 18.  Clld's difficulties arise primarily from the prominence of actors at local level and the increase in their responsibilities. Member States where LEADER is already employed have a significant experientience advantage. The challenges of the ITI are related to the implementation of tasks of local bodies with limited expertise, the resulting delays and the lack of coordination of other development structures.

Although these are new forms of tools that existed before 2014, the LEADER and PUI programmes, the aim is to further strengthen the financial and other links between the European Union and sub-regional local authorities, to involve them in the consideration and implementation of European policies at their decision-making level, and to justify a European role in national urban policies. The French authorities have of course encouraged these tools, seeing them as a way to compensate, somewhat, for the territorial and financial disengagement of the state. But it must be remembered that these funds, presented as a windfall and a benefit from Brussels, are in fact only a very small return of the French taxpayer's money, since France is a net contributor to the European budget to the tune of 9 billion euros.

In this context, two new instruments have been introduced: Community-led local development (CLLD) and Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI). In my opinion, for the Member States that joined in 2004, the implementation of the leader programme at the time required a massive learning process. We should be at the fore when, in addition to community development, job creation and economic development play an increasingly important role. However, I regret that in many cases these resources are allocated in Hungary purely through partisan political interests and not in accordance with the real needs of local actors.

With regard to the CLLD, we have come to the conclusion that it is a very complex concept, that it is considered unnecessary by some Member States and that a downward vertical movement of power in some of them is also very difficult. In addition, many Member States fear the administrative burden associated with the implementation of these mechanisms. These problems are also experienced with regard to the ITI.  It is therefore obvious that I support a resolution that points to these problems and gives clear suggestions on how they can be resolved.

To this end, it is proposed to evaluate the design of concrete incentives to stimulate Member States to implement CLLD and ITIs, together with potential tools to ensure greater coherence between operational programmes, CLLD and ITI.

How do we maintain and encourage young people to live and work in these regions? If they do not have jobs, they will not stay. It is a real challenge for the European Union and for the Member States. As a last word on this report, linking it to the previous debate on unemployment, particularly focusing on youth, there is an issue in Ireland about the fact that people with disabilities are excluded from the Youth Guarantee Scheme.

This report, which I have approved, therefore calls on the Committee: - to draw up a 'programme for the European mountain regions', which should form the basis of a European strategy to develop these regions in the long term and to present a white paper on the subject; - to encourage the use of financial instruments in mountain regions in order to achieve concrete results; - to regularly assess the state of mountain regions in the Union and to analyse the results of the implementation of the operational programmes of cohesion policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1336, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Beatriz BECERRA BASTERRECHEA", "mepid": "125040", "text": "   in writing. – I voted in favour of this resolution on cohesion policy in the mountainous regions of the Union.

These mountain areas have a positive impact in terms of combating climate change, preserving and protecting the ecosystems of these territories. However, we cannot fail to note that these mountain areas have been neglected, in particular because of the infrastructure and the additional costs involved in the isolation of these regions. As a result, in the absence of investment, many mountain regions face depopulation and ageing of the population due to extreme conditions and their peripheral character, which affects the natural cycle of generations and leads to a reduction in social standards and quality of life.

There are no specific objectives and instruments that respond more to particular territorial needs.  The call for the European Commission to draw up an Agenda for the EU's mountain regions stems from the need to have a specific framework on which to develop a cohesion policy, and consequently to adapt the European Structural and Investment Funds in the next programming period. It is undeniable that these areas face serious difficulties due mainly to a lack of accessibility, infrastructure, connectivity and human resources.

However, worrying trends, such as depopulation and population ageing, are particularly exacerbated in them. I therefore believe that ways and instruments should be sought through European cohesion funds in order to stop and even reverse these trends. Investments in a closed production cycle are an opportunity to do so. They ensure that the added value of the whole process remains in the region concerned. Farmers in the mountains are more difficult to achieve the economic performance of their competitors than other regions because of transport, natural and other constraints. For this reason, I believe that they should look for ways of merging, and in addition to being able to offer more production and reduce the costs of each producer individually, this would also help them in negotiations with the purchasers. I also support the call to streamline administrative procedures for these mountain producer organisations.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to being with you today to discuss the latest developments on Greece's adjustment programme following yesterday's Eurogroup, a Eurogroup which was - I can say - a very good meeting, probably one of the best we have had on this subject which is really of major importance to the euro area. The last time I spoke to you about Greece, I stressed the achievements that had already taken place, including the recapitalization of four Greek banks that are systemic banks, the reform of the VAT system, the implementation of a strategy to solve the heavy issue of non-performing loans, and an agreement on the parameters for establishing the privatisation fund. This was already a series of substantial progress. I also told you that many challenges remained, including structural reforms that needed to be taken before concluding the first review of the programme. A first step was taken on Sunday with the adoption of important laws to reform and unify the pension system, as well as to reform income tax. These two measures alone - these two reforms - taken together will have a considerable permanent budgetary impact, which represents about 2% of Greek GDP. They will make the system stronger, more durable and unified. Finally, through this reform, all pension funds, for all retirees, will give access to the same building. All of this will be fairer because it is the most modest who are favoured or spared, so that, finally, all will pay their share to secure the state's income. These reforms are the result of several months of intense discussions and efforts by greece, by the Greek authorities, in close collaboration with the Commission. I would like to greet here the heads of mission of the various institutions, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the International Monetary Fund - all those men and women who do not spare their time and are really, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on the ground, in Athens, in sometimes difficult conditions. The institutions have worked well together. These two reforms are part of a very important package of measures that also includes the creation of an independent revenue agency, a mechanism - rather than a strategy - to manage non-performing loans and, finally, the establishment - not the parameters - of the new privatisation and investment fund with the passage of all this as priorities, priority actions of the necessary legislation. That is what we were actually asking for. Overall, these measures will make a very important contribution to the recovery of the Greek economy, and that is what we ultimately want. For the past six years we have been making these adjustments with the aim that the Greek economy will be healthier, its public finances to be stronger, competitiveness can return, growth to restart and investors to regain confidence in Greece. It is an open economy, which needs foreign investment. I would remind you that the latest forecasts, which I presented last week, indicated that economic growth in Greece would be positive again in the second half of this year and that the public deficit should fall below 3% in 2017. These forecasts are in the order of 2.7%, which is by no means negligible for Greece in 2017 provided, of course, that these reforms can be adopted. That is why it was crucial that these important reforms be concluded. The great achievement of yesterday's Eurogroup is that these negotiations on reform are finally complete, that we have reached an agreement - there are still some details to be settled and, above all, votes to be taken - and that the Greek economy in this way will be able to get back on the right foot and return to growth. There was a second block in our discussions yesterday and in previous weeks, which was the need to reach agreement on a contingency mechanism, the final details of which will be settled in the coming days, by what is called the eurozone working group, the Euro Working Group. This mechanism meets the criteria set by the Eurogroup in Amsterdam two weeks ago, namely that it will be objective, legislated upstream, credible and automatic. What is it about? The aim is to look at how to meet the target set by last summer's MoU, to generate a primary surplus of 3.5% in 2018. The Commission believes that the measures already approved will be sufficient to achieve this primary surplus target, but this is not the view all partners. The Commission has therefore agreed with all members of the Eurogroup that it is useful for a mechanism to exist, in a way, to ensure or reassure all partners about the credibility of the commitments made. In other words, what is important is that, if, if this primary surplus were not to be reached, then there would be the mechanisms to ensure that, in any event, steps would be taken to achieve it. Basically, on that second block, we also reached an agreement yesterday. It must therefore be remembered that, 1) on the package of reforms necessary for the conclusion of the first review, we have succeeded and that, 2) on this contingency mechanism, with a few details, we have also succeeded. Today's message - mine - is therefore very clear: Greece has already travelled, with the help of its partners, a very significant part of the path charted together last August, but we have not yet crossed the finish line. How do we do that? First, it is important that the measures I have presented quickly be voted on in the coming weeks. It is a prerequisite for the conclusion of the first review of the program and the disbursement that must accompany it. It is envisaged that the European Stability Mechanism will pay a large sum for the rapid payment of the State's arrears to its creditors, which will also have a positive impact on the economic recovery and will mitigate the effect of tax measures which may have - it is true - a partial recessive effect. As Klaus Regling, the director of the ESM, said yesterday, it is true that the liquidity situation is becoming more tense and this solution must be found. Finally, with regard to the third package, the debt issue, it is first and foremost a question for the Member States and for the European Stability Mechanism. But I want to say here that the Commission is quite satisfied with the statement approved yesterday. The President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, proposed that we deal successively with the short-term problems - how to manage the debt well until 2018 - without a change in the programme and without a haircut, because these are two red lines that are very clearly drawn, then, that we see in the medium term - after 2018 - if and at that time what additional measures would be needed and and, finally, in the long term, for several decades, the technical measures that we might have to take to develop the debt still without a haircut. I would simply say that the sustainability of Greece's debt is a fundamental element of the agreement reached last summer and, as such, I am pleased that we have had, for the first time, in the Eurogroup an open and constructive debate on this point. The Commission is ready to contribute, technically, to these discussions in the future. As agreed yesterday, the institutional teams and the Greek authorities will now work intensively in the coming days to finalize the agreement. I am confident that we will be able to take favourable decisions at the next Eurogroup meeting on 24 May. What decisions? They can be of two kinds: first, there are the first two blocks together that could pave the way for disbursement under the program and then the design for a debt approach. It is, of course, desirable that these three issues be dealt with together and that the agreement be comprehensive. But with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, we said last night, at the end of the meeting, that there were also two tracks that were being taken. It was desirable that they not be followed in parallel, but they were distinct. We will work with the other institutions and all the partners to help the Greek authorities finalise their commitments, so that they can benefit shortly from the first disbursement. And I am giving you an appointment after 24 May to - I hope - this comprehensive agreement which will make the path of reforms that will allow for a return to growth, the return of confidence and the growth of investment. Here, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, are the few introductory words I wanted to share with you at the opening of our debates. I am, of course, at your disposal to discuss the path we will take together in the coming months, but I want to reiterate here my very deep and very sincere conviction that after much collective work, the path taken is the right one and that the path to success is mapped out. This exceptional Eurogroup meeting on 9 May will, I am sure, remain a strong date in this history of the success we wish for from the Greek programme. This is good because 9 May, as you know, is Europe Day. Yesterday we contributed a little to this party.

When we discuss the situation in Greece today and the overview of the programme, the focus is first of all on the people – the people of Greece, who are suffering a great deal, who have suffered a great deal. What is the expectation there? What is the expectation of the people of Greece, but also of other countries in Europe, when we talk about the reform agenda? On the one hand, there is the expectation that people will want to be allowed to live in a state that is functional, that deals efficiently with the tax money it receives, that it works well in the state. The need to reform the state apparatus is not just a Greek issue, it is an issue throughout Europe. Above all, the justice system must function better in Europe. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens' desire that they have social security, that social security – the buzzword pension – also be guaranteed in a sustainable, long-term and lasting way. And it is even the case that Prime Minister Tsipras is now openly standing in Greece and saying that there is no alternative to pension reforms, that we need to reform pensions structurally so that they remain stable in times of demographic development. There is a desire throughout Europe that we will not continue with debt. Unfortunately, all those countries that have high debt burdens are also the countries that have poor prospects for the future. In other words, stable budgets – that the state does not live beyond its means – is a wish that I believe exists throughout Europe. And last but not least, there is a desire for growth. The basis, as Commissioner Moscovici has made clear, is the question of growth in the European Union. We have now got the Juncker plan up and running with EUR 80 billion that has already been paid out, and I am pleased that, in the Juncker Plan, we have now financed the first Greek project to receive this investment money. These are the wishes that are on the table and which have a lot to do with reforms, with change. I would like to emphasise that I recognise that the Greek Government is now also ready for these reforms. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she What I have now described in terms of wishes is precisely the wish list that the PPE-DE also has. That is our reform agenda for Europe. The five countries that have received aid from Europe, from the ESM, in recent years, have been governed by EPP governments in recent years and have made precisely these changes – and they have succeeded. Ireland, for example, had a higher growth rate than China in 2015 – let's face it: Ireland was better at growth than China! Thanks also to Enda Kenny for that. Ladies and gentlemen, the question arises as to why of the five countries that have received aid, four are now out of the programme, leaving only one country, namely Greece. Why? Unfortunately, I now have to become more political about God. In 2014, at Samarasˊ times, we had a 0.7% increase in growth in Greece, and last year– in 2015, when the Tsipras government took office, Greece had a minus of 0.2%. That is, growth the year before and last year again a slump in the economy. Ladies and gentlemen, Tsiprasˊ policy has harmed Greece. The last Samaras programme, launched a year ago today, when we were on the verge of completing the programme, would have meant that Greece would have to save another EUR 1 billion – a year ago today – and that would have meant that Greece would get out of the programme – save a billion! Now we are discussing the question of the need to save EUR 5.4 billion – that is the current programme. And that is why it must be said quite clearly that last year was a lost year for Greece, and that the Tsipras government has even caused massive damage to the Greek economy. Tsipras himself recently admitted that he was somewhat naive about the task of prime minister. All I can say is that Europe and Greece cannot afford to behave naively. And I would also like to say explicitly that Tsipras has now had to abandon many of his election promises and has not been able to deliver much of what he actually promised the people. And regardless of Greece, we can tell the electorate across Europe: please do not believe the populists who are pretending to deviate from the reform programme! In the end, unfortunately, it will be paid dearly by God. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she What is to be done now? The compromise is on the table. I believe that if everyone reaches out to each other, we can still achieve a great deal. And for Greece, I would like to refer to what the opposition leader Mitsotakis said in his speech. With an honest, strong leadership, he has described alternatives to Tsipras's wrong policies in Greece, a clear course for reform, for a stable budget, for a modern Greece. The people of Greece can continue to rely on Europe and also my group, the European People's Party, to stand by their side when it comes to solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1550, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one year after the outbreak of the first Greek crisis, we are once again here discussing Greece. Meanwhile, the world has changed: in just over a month' s time, on 23 June, there will be a major referendum in the United Kingdom. Europe is shocked by the worst crisis since the war. But we're here, still here, in a kind of remake of a bad movie that's already been seen. Something is wrong, ladies and gentlemen, and I want to make it clear that this has only one name: it is called therapeutic relentlessness against the Greek people. The Greeks honoured the commitments made in the memorandum. Eurostat, as Commissioner Moscovici reminded us, told us a few weeks ago that Greece's public accounts are even better than expected. Many reforms have been made. Of course, we must remain vigilant and ensure that everything is done, in particular the reform of public administration and the judiciary.  I disagree with Mr Weber on one point: for me, the problem today is not Athens, the problem is called the International Monetary Fund. The problem is the extremists, who, in the name of a vindictive vision, want to punish Greece and invent the concept of preventive austerity, that is, the idea that the Greeks three years in advance must approve measures which, as the International Monetary Fund itself has acknowledged, would kill any economy. In the conditions in which Europe finds itself today, provoking a new crisis would be irresponsible. After yesterday's Eurogroup, thanks to the work of Commissioner Moscovici and the European Commission, all the conditions are in place to successfully close the review of the Greek programme and open the chapter on debt relief – I am not saying cut, but relief – on which we committed ourselves a year ago. That is a source of pride for our group. From the outset, we Socialists and Democrats were convinced that an agreement could be reached between the parties, a fair compromise calling on Athens to reform intelligently in exchange for Europe's support and debt relief. After yesterday's Eurogroup, alibis have fallen and it is now up to everyone to assume their responsibilities, and I would like to conclude, here too clearly, that if the International Monetary Fund wants to sabotage this agreement once again, then the Union as a whole must have the strength to move forward on its own.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1551, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   on behalf of the ECR Group. Mr Moscovici and Mr Weber, it has been six years since Greece entered the Memorandums. Six stone years in which Greece's GDP fell by 25%. 40% of the Greek population lives below the poverty line. Wages and pensions have fallen. Unemployment exceeded 1.5 million people. Thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises have closed. The tax evasion of Greek property hit a ceiling and the debt, from 125% of GDP in 2010, reaches 200% of GDP in 2016. Yet the troika, and in particular the IMF, continues the \"business as usual\" and has imposed, with a view to completing the first evaluation, additional measures of EUR 5.4 billion, voted for by the neo-monumental parliamentary majority SYRIZA - ANEL. The troika also imposes additional \"cava measures\" of EUR 3.6 billion plus a budget cutter. So yesterday's Eurogroup, Mr Moscovici, continued the well-known failed memorial policy - also served by the Samaras government, Mr Weber - of violent fiscal adjustment, merch austerity, middle-class tax evasion, the sell-off of public property and red loans. Yesterday's decision by the Eurogroup is therefore a new social Armageddon, a monument to the cynicism of the troika and the lenders towards the poor Greek people. As for the so-called debt settlement, we have a repetition of the same task: refusal to immediately return the profits of the ECB and central banks from Greek bonds, which only for the period 2014 - 2016 reaches 5.1 billion euros, which could go for growth. So again promises uncertain, vague, about a supposed future settlement of Greek debt \"when, if and when\", of a debt that has been proven, Mr Weber, to be shameful since of the EUR 220 billion given as loans to Greece in the memorandum years, only EUR 9 billion has been granted to Greece. The remaining EUR 211 billion went into the pockets of the lenders, rescuing the German and other banks. That is enough, Mr Moscovici and Mr Weber!

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for being with us. I am happy to hear what you are telling us about the fact that the discussions at the Eurogroup have been more constructive, that the horizon is clear. We are aware of that. I am always a little embarrassed because it seems that our discussions here are discussions of insiders, of people who see things from the inside in a rather technical way.  The truth for everyone else, for all European citizens, Greek or not, is that it has been six years - as previous speakers have said - that we have summits on Greece, exactly six years, since it was the weekend of 9 and 10 May 2010. It is also six years ago, for example, that Mario Monti's report on the single market was handed over, and it is clear that the lack of growth and the lack of investment that the Juncker plan is trying to compensate for are also due to this considerable slowdown in the Union at twenty-eight. It is always said that the eurozone is going badly, but I do not see any considerable progress or glimmers of genius in the 28-member Union.  These discussions, always the same, on the substance really give a feeling of trampling. As far as the procedure is concerned, we realize that there has not been much progress on the legitimacy of the institutions that make these decisions either. I say this with a certain sense of responsibility. Of course, it's not easy, of course we did what we could. It is one thing to do what we can as a matter of urgency; but the fact that we continue and do not see the colour of the implementation, nor the report of the five presidents, nor the previous report of the four presidents, nor the Blueprint of the Commission is another, and we have at the moment the feeling of a euro area that we do not understand. Brexit was a fantastic missed opportunity to look at the future of the eurozone. There was a way to conclude a completely different settlement than the one that was concluded outside the treaties in a rather foolish way. But what worries me the most about what you said is the number of things that are postponed until 2018.

Madam President, Mr Weber, in the five minutes of your speech you attacked the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras, five times to help your political friend, Mr Mitsotakis, but unfortunately the truth does not help you, because your Friends of the New Democracy left Greece with a public deficit of 15.5%, with a public debt of 125% of GDP and, by the end of 2014, together with PASOK, had reached 180% of GDP. You may see Mr Weber, Perhaps even in your sleep, but I can assure you that just as you have not been able to help Mr Samaras, you cannot help Mr Mitsotakis. You will see Mr. Tsipras for many years as prime minister because that is what the Greek people want.

We have finally had some positive news that can help Greece and the Greek people to finally ensure greater stability, political and economic, a faster return to growth based on the optimistic forecasts made by the Commission and Mr Moscovici and to ensure debt sustainability without any burden on the European taxpayer. But it is also a decision that also helps Europe avoid an unnecessary new crisis and destabilisation in its south-east, as it has tried with the blackmailing, irrational, irresponsible things demanded by the International Monetary Fund. Yesterday the Eurogroup rejected the excessive and unreasonable demands for new additional recessionary austerity measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund and yesterday the Eurogroup laid out a clear road map for substantial debt relief by cancelling the plans of those who wanted this commitment to be broken.

Madam President, at the dawn of his mandate, Jean-Claude Juncker declared here, in essence, that in his view social justice was as important as the soundness of public finances. Colleagues, since the beginning of the crisis and despite three aid plans for Greece, or perhaps because of them, the three million Greek citizens who were exposed to poverty and social exclusion in 2009 have been joined by another 900,000, the combined population of Luxembourg and Malta. Some say this is the price to be paid by Greece for the mistakes of the past. I think that those who have benefited from the country's over-indebtedness - I am thinking of the financial sector, the shipowners, the arms sector, but also a clientelistic political class - are not those who are paying the price today for this irresponsibility. You will therefore understand, ladies and gentlemen, that I do not share the optimism that seems to prevail in the wake of yesterday's Eurogroup. The so-called step forward is the potential opportunity to discuss debt relief arrangements. But the price to be paid, even to start these discussions, is so exorbitant that it makes the real possibilities for debt relief completely derisory. While it was necessary to restructure as early as 2010 to make private creditors pay the price for their share of irresponsibility, six years later, the creditors who have become public are limited to waving the carrot of hypothetical relief, on the condition that Greece drinks the chalice of austerity to the dregs. This austerity, precisely, the creditors persist in accentuating it, while the IMF itself considers it socially unsustainable and economically counterproductive, the same IMF that advocates debt relief. I see that those who absolutely insist on having the IMF on board — because the IMF knows how to deal with such a crisis — persist in not listening to what the IMF is saying when it says, \"Let's reduce austerity and restructure the debt.\" Of course, this would force the creditors, and all those who insist on austerity, to recognize that so far they have gone the wrong way. They obviously cannot admit it, especially when the government they have opposite is not precisely their political color. Secondly, of course, there is everything that is missing from the conclusions of the Council and the Eurogroup yesterday, such as the question of investment. Investment in Greece has fallen by 70% since the beginning of the crisis. Everyone knows that the investment capacity in Greece is zero, but we are told that there will be a few crumbs of the Juncker plan to celebrate. You'll understand that it won't be enough. There is also the issue of setting up a proper tax system. It is clear that successive Greek governments have not shown much enthusiasm to finally collect taxes and fight tax evasion and evasion. The Member States of the euro area could have provided them with expertise by delegating civil servants to them, but since they carried out 58,000 redundancies in the civil service, the \"finance\" sector, they may no longer have many people to send reinforcements to Greece. Ladies and gentlemen, I would say that without a radical change of course, the suffering of a largely abandoned Greece alone in the face of the refugee challenge will only increase without the State or its economy being able to rebuild itself.

We will finally have greater prosperity. We will finally have greater stability. We will finally have greater ability to live our lives in prosperity’. Well face that with what the Greeks are facing today: Greek unemployment at nearly 25%; youth unemployment at 52%; the numbers of Greek young people who have left their country at 200 000; suicides since the crash at 6 000 people; the money spent on austerity – over EUR 40 billion – and every month over the next few months Greeks will have to find five billion to pay for those people who are controlling their country: the ECB and the Troika.  Is that the prosperity, the growth and the great future for Greece that was pronounced in 2001? No. But what you did have during the times of the crash was a man here in this Chamber placing his arm around the Greek Prime Minister at the time, when the people of Greece had said do not give us the chance of austerity, and I am reminded of the line from Caesar to Brutus: ‘Tu quoque, mi fili’ – ‘And also you , my friend’.  Because at the moment when that arm was placed around the Greek Prime Minister at the time of the new government and after a referendum that said we did not want that austerity, what you allowed was the arm to embrace you and the slow knife and dagger of the EU’s austerity programme slice itself into the heart of the Greek people.

Madam President, in the end Winston Churchill was right when he said 'if you want to get rid of the Left once and for all, I would add populism, you have to let them govern for three or four months'. In the case of Greece, utopia and delusions - as the Prime Minister himself admitted in Parliament - cost the Greek people more. Indeed, the European institutions have identified the objectives of fiscal adjustment, for the Samaras government in December 2014 at EUR 1 billion, and for the Tsipras government now at EUR 5.5 billion and to add EUR 3.5 billion in preventive austerity measures. To solve the Greek problem, the Tsipras government chose the easy way, the path of raising taxes. However, an excessive increase in taxation leads to a reduction in public revenue to zero. The programme is in danger of not coming out and in October we need new measures. Debt needs to be regulated, it needs relief. Europe has shown solidarity. Debt fell by 100 billion euros in 2012, its service needs 4 billion euros a year from the 16 it previously needed. The Tsipras government cannot use the debt as the last fig leaf of a failed negotiation.

At the same time, I think it is equally very difficult to deny that this Greek Government is delivering and is seriously committed in making reforms and implementing what has been agreed.  For these reasons it is positive that an agreement has finally been achieved on the policy package of the fiscal and structural measures which are necessary to conclude the first review of the programme. I also consider it a good result that the contingency mechanism will be based on the Greek proposal and will not impose on the Greek people additional preventive austerity measures that would have been politically and economically destabilising. I note that the institution that has strongly advocated this option produced an economic forecast on the 2015 primary balance that has proved to be totally wrong. This would have called for more prudence, which hopefully in the end is materialising.  Finally, I strongly welcome that the discussion on additional debt relief has taken place and that now there is guidance and a clear mandate to identify specific measures like maturity extensions, grace periods and this, the interest deferral, on the basis of a three-stage approach that – and this is another positive element – does not exclude further measures in the long term.  So yes, 9 May has been a good day for Europe and I would like to thank the Commission – and Commissioner Moscovici in particular – for its crucial role.

Six years have passed today and Greece is not on its own feet!

Greece is not saving, as Mr Pittella said, but Greece still has to save, even though six years have now passed since Greece should have been ready for three years.

Yesterday we went a small step, but I think it's frankly insufficient. Commissioner, I would like to ask you for two things: debt restructuring must be more ambitious and we must speed it up now. We know since 2010 that this is not sustainable and we need that to be done as quickly as possible. And the second thing, and with this I conclude: to a country that is currently one more point of primary surplus than the program marked—one more point of primary surplus than the program marked—and is beginning to emerge from recession, asking for more recessionous action is suicide. So it seems to me that contingent measures go far beyond what we should; it seems to me that we are asking for a kind of preventive austerity that is misused, but in any case, let the Greek economy breathe and do not impose any more recessive measures on it.

It took a long time for the reforms to begin to be adopted in Greece since the arrival of Alexis Tsipras. It is a shame to have wasted so much time since we remember that during the time of the Samaras government, we saw growth pick up in Greece.  However, we must rejoice today in some concrete progress and say that the main architect of this progress is the Greek people. You have to give him a lot of courage. Greek citizens have had to make many efforts without seeing the direct benefits. They are going through an extremely difficult period. They, too, are on the front lines, who have had to bear the consequences of wait-and-see policies and systematic opposition to each embryo of reform. There are still too many disparities in Greek society, there are still too many privileges for some and too much misery for others.  Let us therefore be clear: the Eurogroup has not given Greece its white-seing. The Greek government must be very aware that European flexibility is conditional on the real progress of reforms. I am pleased that the Eurogroup has been able to start discussing a possible debt adjustment, Greece's debt which still stands at 180% of GDP.

You have subdued Mr Tsipras, who did not have the courage to resist you and who did not have the courage to choose the path of the end of the euro for his country. Today, the European Central Bank continues its daily search for liquidity.

Keeping banks closed for three weeks would harm any economy. But what is the way forward now? The way forward, in my view, is reforms.  What Greece now needs is reforms. Greece needs a functional and efficient public administration; this would be to the benefit of the people. Greece needs more competitive and flexible labour markets; this would help people find a job, especially young people. The government should make it easy for young people to start their own business. Education needs to respond to the needs of the labour market; enterprises need to be privatised and well-managed. All this will make Greece competitive and it will lead to investments and new jobs. These measures work. We have seen it in Portugal, in Ireland, in Cyprus, in Spain. Only if applied completely will this package help Greece.

The first is that the Hellenic government's massive efforts in reforms and fiscal seriousness must be particularly welcomed. It should be remembered that the laws passed by Athens on Sunday on the pension system and on income tax represent more than three billion annual savings. Thus, the commitments made by Alexis Tsipras in the framework of the agreement made last summer are kept and his political credibility with the institutions not only cannot be questioned, but it must be, once again, welcomed and encouraged. The second lesson is that on the greek debt issue, common sense is beginning to prevail, but here too we must move forward in the face of a promise that we made to the Greek people in the summer of 2012 and which we renewed last summer. The third lesson is that, despite the progress, the reasons for the renewed optimism must be quickly justified by lucid acts, and on this point we are measuring the stakes of the meeting set for 24 May so that Measures to manage Greek debt can be made and that investors and insurance markets return to the long-term path.

You do not want to admit that the entire eurozone is in agony and that Greece is just a symptom of the cancer of the single currency. For patriots, a debt is a debt. Therefore, a partial cancellation of the public debt, a haircut, would be irresponsible because it would amount to a partial default that would set fire to the powders of European public finances. On the other hand, we, the reasonable creditors, must accept a moratorium on Greek debt with a rescheduling of duration and interest to allow a fresh start for Greece. But in order to meet its financial commitments, Greece must benefit from three fundamental conditions: its monetary sovereignty by leaving the euro zone in order to partially monetize its debt through its national bank; secondly, the settlement of the 162 billion euros of the Greek historical debt by Germany in financial reparation for war and, thirdly, the cessation of your European migration plans which the Greeks suffer.

Madam President, in Greece we have good news, but we also have bad economic news. The good news is that the Tsipras government had abandoned its strategy of confrontation with the eurozone and is making the necessary adjustment effort, so we will not have a repeat of the 2015 crisis. Unfortunately, there is also bad news. First, we are obliged to pay dearly the bill of the failed radical experiment Tsipras – Varoufakis of 2015. Secondly, the economic policy mix implemented by the SYRIZA government emphasises the exterminating taxation of private sector enterprises and households, thus creating new problems in the functioning of the economy. Thirdly, at the request of the International Monetary Fund, the Tsipras government has accepted the creation of an intervention mechanism and the preparation of so-called preventive measures for 2018. Thus, it sends the message that the Greek programme is not particularly reliable and removes the forward character of the third programme and the relevant memorandum. In this way it makes them less effective and less developmental. This demonstrates the enormous cost of left-wing populism. SYRIZA triggered early elections in late 2014, blocking Greece's exit from the memorandum by implementing the latest 1.2 billion euros ($1.2 billion) bailout. Euro. But the Tsipras government has already implemented, announced or planned measures ten times the height. That says it all about left-wing populism.

And yet the target has been moved. A surplus of three and a half% was agreed last year. So in addition to Greece's wrong decisions, we can also talk about the unrealistic demands of eu countries.

More taxes and insurance contributions to the productive forces do not pre-promote the reduction of unemployment which is the most important social issue in Greece. In-general injustice, as young people - at least those who work in Greece - will pay higher contributions for smaller pensions. The responsibility lies with the lenders and the Greek government.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate, which I believe will have been fruitful and useful.  Of course, it is more than difficult to answer as the views that have been expressed are diverse. I want to see that, of course, mistakes have been made and, of course, responsibilities have to be established. You don't go through six years of crisis without seeing these inadequacies of all kinds. As it happens, I have a bit of a step back on these cases, not only the setback of the year and a half that I have just passed to the Commission in charge of this file, in the College of Commissioners, but also before since I was already a member of the Eurogroup as Minister of Economy and Finance of my home country, which is still my country. France. Therefore, I have been involved in these discussions for four years now. And I can assure you that, in reality, responsibilities are shared. Mistakes have been made at all times, basically, by all Greek governments. I think that the moment in which we find ourselves is a very decisive moment which should nevertheless encourage us to express a consensus on the need to continue solidarity with Greece, which everyone recognises. Let's start with common sense thinking. It is not for this or that here to say in the place of the Greek people whether or not they wish to remain in the euro area. The evidence is that it is. The choices that are made today, above all beyond any partisan consideration, bear witness to this long-term ambition. My conviction, that of all the members of the Eurogroup - and by definition, it is men and women from all groups who are present here or almost and therefore have different political sensitivities - is that we took an important step yesterday, after much work. This step is that of a solid reform programme that is now underway, that is accepted by all and which must be the basis for a return of confidence and growth in Greece with the following investment. This is what the Greek people, who have suffered greatly from this crisis, need. We owe this consensus to the Greek people. I am not talking about this or that political formation, I am not talking about the authorities, although I want to say how well we have worked in recent months with the authorities to pass these reforms, which are still difficult reforms.  I think your debate also provides us with some interesting ideas for the Eurogroup meeting on 24 May. We have carefully taken note of the members' comments and the points that have been raised today. Of course, if we put ourselves in the shoes of a particular government, of a particular institution, we could wish to go in that direction or in the opposite direction, but as a last point, I would point out to you that this is the first time that all the issues have been taken together. First, the issue of structural reforms. There is an ambitious package that is there, then a contingency mechanism that protects itself from the vagaries which, once again, the Commission thinks can be ruled out. Finally, it is the first time, since November 2012 , and not least because there is now a package of reforms on the table that is solid and credible - that we are able to deal with the Greek debt issue. We are going to do it and we want to do it. Therefore, I think that yesterday an important step has been taken. I repeat, I hope that on 24 May we will be able to reach agreement as broadly as possible, at least on the first two blocks and, if possible, on all the issues.  I have heard speakers from various countries who have had programs or who want Greece to do so. That's my wish, too. For the past four years, I have had to attend sixty, seventy or even eighty Eurogroup meetings and my wish is that one day at a Eurogroup meeting, we can say: \"That's it, Greece is out of the programme\". After all, it is a normal country, a country that has succeeded in the reforms that have enabled it to return to growth.  I think that beyond the different political sensitivities that may inhabit us, it is a wish that we can all share.

The process remains detached from the hardship and suffering that millions are having to endure. It is true that those who over-borrow have to pay for their mistakes, but there comes a time when a line must be drawn under their liabilities. For it is also true that those who over-lend should also have to pay for their mistake: that is the logic of the free market.

On Thursday, conclusions on the World Humanitarian Summit are expected to be adopted by the Council. The Presidency has been at the forefront of preparing a strong common position of the EU and its Member States, obviously in very close cooperation with the Commission and the European External Action Service.  Let me be clear. The Council wants the World Humanitarian Summit to be a success. From July last year, the Netherlands has put in place an envoy for the World Humanitarian Summit and this has enabled us to link up early with all key players: the United Nations, humanitarian organisations, EU institutions, the Member States and other UN member states and stakeholders.  Let me mention some of the most important things the Member States would like to come out of this summit. We would like the global community to recommit to the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. World leaders must also commit to addressing the root causes of humanitarian crises by stepping up their efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully and to prevent new conflicts from emerging.  We want all actors, including those who have influence over parties to a conflict – all of them – to respect international humanitarian law. Let me repeat what I said during our debate in Brussels two weeks ago. Violations, such as attacks on medical facilities and schools, are unacceptable. It will be crucial to keep international humanitarian law high on the international agenda, to hold perpetrators accountable and speak out clearly and publicly against serious violations. Upholding international humanitarian law is also linked to a central theme of the summit: placing people at the centre of humanitarian action. So we must move away from drawing boards in capitals and truly listen to the affected population. And yes, we must also work towards eradicating sexual and gender-based violence and emergencies. At the same time, I would like to say that women and girls should not only be seen as victims, but as key partners who should be involved in all phases of the humanitarian response cycle.  The Presidency also believes that more efficiency in humanitarian assistance can be achieved by promoting innovation – innovation in financing humanitarian action, innovation in promoting the technologies and innovation in new partnerships. As an example of the latter, the Netherlands is one of the founding partners of the Global Alliance for Humanitarian Innovation, which is foreseen to be officially launched in Istanbul. Let me also say a few words on humanitarian financing. The Netherlands and other EU Member States are among the top 15 global humanitarian donors. Together with Turkey, these donors were invited by the High—Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing to negotiate the Grand Bargain on aid efficiency with the 15 biggest humanitarian implementing organisations. We have lent our full support to the Grand Bargain negotiations. We hosted the first of the four Sherpa meetings in Amsterdam on 29 February and, in the course of the negotiations, we led, together with the World Bank, the discussions on aid transparency.  Let me again thank the Commission and the United Kingdom for hosting the second and third Sherpa meetings. The fourth, and last, Sherpa meeting, hosted by Sweden, is, as you most probably know, currently ongoing in New York. Let us hope for a swift and successful conclusion of the meeting. As the Presidency of the Council, we would like to see as many donors and humanitarian organisations as possible sign up to the Grand Bargain and to its suggested commitments.  In closing, I would like to thank Parliament for your interest, your guidance and your advice. The summit participation of this House is a clear demonstration of your dedication and commitment. I am obviously looking forward to hearing a bit more about your views and expectations ahead of the Istanbul Summit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1604, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, we are only twelve days away from the World Humanitarian Summit, a Summit which is a unique – maybe a once in a generation – opportunity for us to make a lasting difference. To make history by sending a clear signal around the world that global humanitarian needs and suffering require urgent and collective action. The Summit could not be more timely. The challenges we face are enormous. Last year, humanitarians assisted over one hundred million people. Displacement is at its highest since the World War II. Millions flee conflicts or leave their homes behind to escape disasters or climate change, and people are displaced for longer periods than ever before.  The way in which we have been responding to growing needs is not sustainable any more. People affected by crisis need to live with dignity, rather than just receiving assistance. Business cannot continue as usual. Humanitarians continue their tasks under challenging circumstances, but other actors must step in as well: to make the humanitarian system more effective and efficient but also to prevent conflicts, reduce disaster risk and empower communities. It is no secret that we had higher expectations for bold political outcomes from the Summit. Nevertheless, I hope that we can ultimately deliver a strong vision for the future in Istanbul. The UN Secretary-General’s ‘Agenda for Humanity’ is a very good basis for action. The European Union remains committed to doing its part, in line with the call that was put forward in the resolution on the World Humanitarian Summit that Parliament adopted in December. I also recognise your contribution to the formulation of our priorities. This is why I am particularly pleased that Members of the European Parliament will attend the Summit. Your participation is very important to us and we advocated with the UN at the highest level to ensure your representation. As the European Union, we go to the Summit with a clear set of three key objectives. I would like to thank very much the Dutch Presidency for this and of course the previous Presidency, the Luxembourg Presidency, and others.  Firstly, the lack of respect for international humanitarian law that we are witnessing today is simply unacceptable. Civilians are targeted, medical facilities and schools are destroyed, medical and teaching personnel and humanitarian workers become casualties. We must stop it. Therefore, we want the basic norms and values of humanity to be upheld and reconfirmed. We strongly advocate for the respect of international humanitarian law (IHL) and we want the Summit to reaffirm its centrality. I particularly welcome the recent ‘resolution of the European Parliament on attacks on hospitals and schools as violations of IHL’, which echoes this priority. We also want more efficient and effective humanitarian action: cooperation rather than competition in the UN system and among implementing organisations, and more flexibility and predictability of financing, involving of course also the private sector. To this end, we are engaged in the discussions to follow up on the report of the High—Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing.  Finally, we want to strengthen the humanitarian and development link and engage more strategically with partners. In particular, situations of protracted displacement call for a novel approach in order to ensure that affected people move from aid-dependence to self-reliance. This is the ultimate objective of a key piece of our commitment at the Summit: our Communication on Forced Displacement and Development that we adopted on 26 April. We will address these key issues and we intend to deliver strong commitments. We expect other actors to do the same. For the success of the Summit, political commitments at the highest level will be essential. These should pave the way for an effective follow—up, because the Summit will not only be a culmination of months of consultations and preparations, but also the beginning of the transformation of the international humanitarian system, through, definitely, the implementation of our commitments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1605, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, I would first like to point out that this summit comes at a time of great organizational difficulties and the presence of actors, such as this Parliament, which has difficulty in being at the appropriate level at the Istanbul summit. , at the most appropriate time. Because there is now the largest accumulation of top-level humanitarian crises in the world, from Iraq to Syria, South Sudan, Central African Republic, but also in Ukraine or also in Yemen, also in Libya and also in other parts of the world. Because we currently have the highest number of people displaced from their homes— around 120 million, from thirty-seven different countries—almost half of them children. Because right now there is the biggest gap between the need to serve people and the funding we have; we have about 40% funding gap. And because at the moment, too, there are growing violations of the principles of humanitarian action and attacks on facilities and actors. So it's time to address a strong call, a serious drive to address humanitarian crises around the world. There has been a lot of consensus in the various global dialogues and in the various regional dialogues, and I believe that the position expressed by the Commissioner and the representative of the Council also reflects this consensus on what needs to be done. However, there is less determination in the commitments to be made. The Commission presented its proposals with its priorities; Parliament supported it; Parliament, in turn, developed a report calling for a comprehensive consensus of humanitarian action, in which we also called for a need to better protect in connection with development cooperation policies; we also called for a greater role for local actors and women; to talk to the displaced, to which the Minister referred, and we also called for consistent funding. So what I are asking the Commission and the Council to do now is for Istanbul to be the first step, and for Istanbul to be followed by serious commitments from the Commission by the Member States towards a comprehensive consensus of humanitarian action, towards a new initiative that will pool development policy and humanitarian policy , and towards commitments to denounce violations of humanitarian principles, attacks on various humanitarian actors.

I would like to mention a few points. Coordination is fundamental. Local NGOs and the private sector can offer added value. In addition, complementarity is important. Humanitarian and development aid needs to be better coordinated. Proactive measures are also essential. There is too little attention for emergency prevention, which means that aid and reconstruction cost much more afterwards.  And finally, we need to talk about conditional aid: aid that is linked to political or security considerations. The summit must not be yet another talking bar.

Madam President, anyone who attends major UN summits regularly attends ceremonies of self-satisfaction. The international community is right to welcome the success of alleviating suffering in either crisis and to recall that disasters have been averted through humanitarian action. However, we should not hide our faces in the face of three dramatic aspects that will undermine the world humanitarian summit on 23 and 24 May in Istanbul: first, the increasingly threatened security of medical missions; second, the proliferation of crisis outbreaks accepted as inevitable; thirdly, the gulf between the commitment of states, particularly the European Union, and the actual funding results. On the first point - the increasingly threatened security of medical missions - is it the result of human stupidity, the bad faith of the warlords or both? Failure to respect the impartiality of humanitarian action is unacceptable. The states represented in Istanbul would do well to put an end to these practices. As for the proliferation of crisis outbreaks, military intervention is generally not the answer. That is why diplomacy must mobilize in time. Not just any diplomacy, but the best possible. The states represented in Istanbul would do well to remember that. The commitments made by the European Union are generous, of course, so they are regularly renewed for the simple reason that they have not been kept. For the Member States of the European Union, it is a question of credibility. The Member States would do well to remember that. It is not enough to see that others - almost all others - are doing worse than the European Union and its Member States. For the Twenty-Eight, this is no reason to let their guard down in the face of the scale of the challenge. Our hopes rest on the commitment of the Presidency and our Commissioner.

We've heard from colleague Guerer how many millions of people around the world need some kind of humanitarian aid. We know that today we have more refugees in the world than we did in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a dramatic rise in humanitarian crises, and the particular challenge is that these are protracted crises. Long-term displacement takes on average more than 25 years for refugees and more than 10 years for 90% of internally displaced persons. It is in this regard that I think it is important to put emphasis on crisis education and I know that the Commissioner is doing just that. In these protracted crises, only the humanitarian aid system cannot meet all needs. Forced displacement is not only a humanitarian challenge, it is also a political, development and economic challenge for human rights. Of course, there is also the phenomenon of irregular migration – we must also take into account the security dimension.

This is a very dangerous phenomenon of the 21st century. The world therefore needs a new humanitarian law today, among other things. It also seems that we need reform of the outdated and rather ineffective UN response system today.

I always appreciate the views and position of Parliament and this is particularly true as we are getting ready for such a unique multi-stakeholder event as the World Humanitarian Summit. This is why I insisted on increasing the number of places for the European Parliament at this big event. My services and I did our best so that this Parliament has a strong presence there and I am pleased to announce today that we secured two additional places in the EU delegation for the European Parliament. We have common priorities: more efficiency; more effectiveness in the humanitarian system; respect for international humanitarian law and, of course, humanitarian principles also; more support for education, emergencies, and many more in the humanitarian field. This is why we have this very strong collaboration because we are in the same boat. This Summit will complete a cycle of events – the SDG Summit with Agenda 2030, Sendai, Addis Ababa and COP21 – that have provided a vision for the future. Their outcomes provide a solid framework for the future, but real progress can only be achieved if we now turn to the poorest and most vulnerable and look at how we can help them thrive. This is the mission of the World Humanitarian Summit.  I hope that when we look back in 2030, we will be able to say that this event was a true game changer. Through the long consultation process it lent a voice to everyone: from leaders to members of affected communities, from academics to the private sector. It involved thousands of people across the world. It introduced a new way of discussing some of the toughest problems we face at a truly global forum and it generated momentum to bring about systemic changes in how we could prevent, respond to and recover from crises. It delivered on the ultimate goal: that by 2030, fewer people require life-saving emergency assistance. This is our common goal. On Thursday, I hope that the Council will adopt a second set of Conclusions on the Summit. We have worked with the Presidency and Member States on a strong position. This will guide us in making commitments at the Summit but also beyond that.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done Indeed, on 15 March, the Committee on Trade decided to put this question for an oral answer. You know, Commissioner, my co-author Pablo Zalba Bidegain and I have also written you a letter on the issue in order to get the negotiations with Mercosur back on track, which are a bit murmured, because we do indeed believe that the political changes in some Mercosur countries have changed the situation. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which Some people may not have this in mind any more, but we have been negotiating with the Mercosur countries since 1999 – that is, for a very long time – without any real action being made. We started the concrete trade negotiations on 17 May 2010 – which is six years ago, after all – and this, despite the fact that Mercosur is a central element on the world map for the European Union, both politically and economically. We discuss a lot about TTIP and many other things and sometimes forget about the economic importance of the Mercosur area. We have shown a bit of flag in the region with Colombia, Peru and now by adding Ecuador, but not with the core countries. That is why it is so important that we really get back on our way here. Parliament has always made it clear that we want a fair agreement. We want the negotiations to be concluded successfully. Hence the questions that we have put on the table, Commissioner. However, on 15 March, we were not so optimistic that market offers would be put on the table tomorrow. In this respect, I would perhaps also modify the question somewhat and ask not so much when the market offer will be put on the table, but rather what will be put on the table on 11 May. Perhaps we should discuss a little more the substantive moments. It is quite clear that we on the European side will certainly have to look again at the issue of agriculture – and I also see Mr Dess on the other side – particularly with regard to the issue of beef and citrus fruit. On the Mercosur side, it will certainly also be particularly concerned with mechanical engineering and corresponding equipment. So maybe you'll get a few more answers. Then, Commissioner, of course, the question: what are the next steps, and what about the sustainability impact assessment? This is a crucial issue for a trade agreement. Perhaps you could also say something about what the Member States think. A large country in the Mercosur Council seems to have some political difficulties at the moment – perhaps you can also give us some thoughts on the current political situation.

We have long historical and cultural ties with Mercosur, many shared interests and, of course, we have, on both sides, economic interests. So in terms of trade Mercosur countries offer EU exporters and investors a very attractive market and this is still subject to significant tariffs and barriers. EU exporters pay annually more than EUR 4 billion in tariff duties alone, so the potential gains of a free trade agreement are of course evident.  We are committed to those negotiations and we are encouraged by the interest that has been seen lately in the four Mercosur countries in moving forward, and a very large majority of EU Member States also welcome this movement and the work towards an exchange of offers. This exchange has been carefully prepared on both sides, given the importance of moving the negotiation process forward, because there has been a long history to this and now we need to look forward. We have kept you and Member States informed about this. The timing of the exchange of offers: I had a meeting with Mr Nin Novoa, who is the Foreign Minister of Uruguay and the current President of Mercosur, and we agreed to exchange offers in this week of May, so we are fine tuning the very last formulas here, and making the final checks with Member States, of course. We are looking forward to studying the Mercosur offer when it comes. We will study it very carefully and of course share the results and our analysis with Member States and with Members of the European Parliament. The exchange will be a first step in this new phase and Mercosur has already indicated that it is a first phase and that they are ready to improve offers during the negotiations, and we will set a timing for negotiations when we have analysed each other’s offers. We have set out with the Uruguayan Minister a very ambitious agenda for the rest of this year, so we are both aiming to advance the negotiations quite rapidly. We hope to make progress on all areas with the aim of obtaining a balanced, comprehensive and ambitious agreement with Mercosur. The EU is aware and the Commission is aware that we have strong offensive interests with Mercosur but there are also some specific defensive interests in the agricultural sector. Following the various impact assessments conducted during the course of the last negotiations, we will conduct a new impact assessment and a new sustainability impact assessment for the trade part. That will of course also cover key issues such as human rights and economic impacts of the agreement. With regard to the impact on the agricultural sector we have already conducted two studies in 2011 on the impact of a potential deal between ourselves and Mercosur which examines a range of scenarios and we take account of those conclusions in the calibration of our offer. In addition, as has been announced by Commissioner Hogan, the Commission is also conducting now a general study of the cumulative aspects and impacts of the different free trade agreements on our European agricultural sector and we expect conclusions later this autumn and will of course share them. Investment protection was one of the parts in the question as well. The mandate for this negotiation dates from 1999, which was well before the Lisbon Treaty; there is therefore no chapter on investment protection foreseen in the mandate. There will be some parts of investment covered in the services and establishment chapter, but no specific chapter on this.

The European Union and Mercosur have important political and economic ties and the signing of an agreement would bring enormous benefits. We must take this opportunity to make decisive progress in strengthening economic and trade ties, but also cultural and human ties between the Mercosur countries and the European Union.

It is a first step towards the negotiation and I thank the Police Station, the whole Commission and the negotiating team for the proactive attitude they have shown in channelling the beginnings of the negotiation, and even more taking into account some known reluctance in recent weeks. There are some discrepancies, but they account for only 10% of the total of what is being negotiated. It is unreasonable to reach 90% of the Agreement because of the reluctance of some. When there is a will, understanding is always found. I would like to remind you that, as with any other partnership agreement, an impact measurement study will be carried out. These studies are carried out in parallel with the negotiation. The exchange of negotiating offers cannot be postponed at the end of the impact study, simply because it is inefficient and serves only as a blocking mechanism for those who oppose the signing of trade agreements with other States.

Mercosur has always been an important reference point for Europe, not only in political and cultural terms, but also in economic and commercial terms. It is enough to quote one fact: the European Union is Mercosur's main trading partner and Mercosur is the sixth most important export market for the Union. Despite this, Mercosur remains the only bloc of the countries of the Americas – if we exclude the United States and Canada – with which the European Union has not yet signed a trade agreement. Moreover, in recent years the distance between the two sides of the Atlantic has seemed to be increasing, due to a strategic shift of Latin American countries towards Asia, and in particular towards China, as demonstrated by the conclusion of plurilateral treaties such as the TPP and some bilateral agreements such as China-Chile and China-Peru. Today, however, the Mercosur bloc's partners are showing us a new willingness, and relaunching the negotiations for an association agreement is a significant opportunity to strengthen existing links with this area within the broader framework of a transatlantic EU strategy. The exchange of offers to be held in these days will be a fundamental stage in this renewed commitment. The agreement would provide not only for a reduction in tariffs, but also for the reduction of non-tariff barriers and greater cooperation on controls and compliance with each other's standards. As is the case with all agreements, however, here too we are calling for trade to be a new opportunity and not just a source of imbalances.  We call on the Commission to be ambitious in the negotiations but also to be cautious, taking into account the needs of the most sensitive sectors of our productive fabric. I hope that today's debate will demonstrate the European Parliament's political support for relaunching the negotiations, so that a balanced agreement can be reached which will be a real factor in economic development for our continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1648, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "James NICHOLSON", "mepid": "1318", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, producers across Europe are not anti-trade; they see the value of fair and free trade. In my constituency in Northern Ireland, for example, we are large exporters in the agri-food market. However, while the principle of these trade deals being pursued by the Commission may be sound in practice, many feel that agriculture is being used as a bargaining chip and kept to the end of the negotiations – and I refer to the TTIP aspect of that as well, even though that may have gone on the back burner a bit until after the Presidential election. The possible conclusion of the Mercosur trade deal is what is now giving many in the agricultural community a great deal of worry. In particular, there is grave concern about the Commission offering a quota of 78 000 tonnes of beef, of which 39 000 tonnes is high-quality beef at a tariff rate of 7.5%. Commissioner, can you confirm what Commissioner Hogan has said today in Wales – that it is off the table? It would be useful for many of us to know if that is a fact. A majority of Member States, I understand, have made their position about this very clear to the Council. If that is the case, it is certainly welcome that Mercosur countries are already a major agri exporter to the European Union – 86% of our beef imports and 70% of our poultry meat imports, and I do not think that the market can absorb much more. I understand that we are looking at the moment at how much more we can absorb within Europe from other Member States. I think that we should wait for that report to come from the Commission, to see how much more the European Union can actually absorb as far as the extra exports would be.

In the meantime, some of these countries have even been taking protectionist steps against exports from the European Union. So let me come back to the reason for opening these negotiations. Mercosur has a population of 286 million, it is the fourth largest trading bloc in the world and it represents an important economic bloc both in the region and globally. For me it is unbelievable that the European Union does not have trade agreements with these important economies, such as Argentina or Brazil, especially as we have advanced in negotiations and upgraded our trade agreements with many other countries in the region. Can you imagine that back in 2000 the  then Trade Commissioner Lamy was predicting rapid progress on negotiations with Mercosur? But after years of inaction we can feel now a fresh wind blowing. We finally have the political momentum on both sides to move forward in these talks. We must take full advantage of it. There are many real economic benefits to be gained for European businesses in the Mercosur members’ markets, which encompass our major trading partners in the region.

Madam President, Commissioner, I am still very annoyed. Today, there is a sense that all of these free trade agreements that are being put in place one after the other — Canada, then tomorrow perhaps the United States, and then Mercosur — are being done permanently with agriculture as a bargaining chip when there is nothing else to offer. Earlier, we were talking about the balance sheet: today, we can say, already, that more than 100,000 jobs would disappear in agriculture and in related trades if these import agreements were to pass. Today, we have a problem with Mercosur because we can see that a number of ministers are telling us \"we don't want sensitive products\" - at least for now, until the negotiations have advanced. But are you able to tell me today that we will not bring a kilo more beef or poultry meat within the European Union? Because the question is there: today we have a crisis on production, poultry, beef and pork. Today, we are experiencing a dramatic situation within Europe and we still want to open the borders. That is something that is not possible. In terms of standards, I have a real question: a year ago, we voted in this chamber to ban the use of meat from clones or cloned animals. You know as well as I do that, in Mercosur and especially in Argentina, clones are already used. What measures have you implemented today at the Commission level to ensure that there is no import from clones? There is no such as that. As far as GMOs are concerned, there will also be a problem with the implementation of the standards. It is the same debate as with Canada and the United States.

Commissioner, we are not a priori opposed to this agreement, but rather we believe that there is much to be gained for European industry and european Union companies to access the public procurement market in South America, but we must not trade some advantage in market access for our agriculture, as unfortunately happens all too often. If the agreement is successful, we run the risk of a 70 % increase in beef imports and 25 % in poultry imports, at a time when the European livestock sector is not sailing bleeds. What is more, there is less agricultural regulation in South America, which raises the same problems as other agreements, which are now sadly known and have already been mentioned by other Members.

The Commission, in relaunching the reopening of negotiations with Mercosur, will have to carefully assess the repercussions in agriculture, also in view of the serious crisis facing the sector and given the impact assessment on the potential effects that this agreement could have on the European agricultural sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1678, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Luke Ming FLANAGAN", "mepid": "124985", "text": "   – Madam President, the President of Uruguay has said that the reason why we do not want a trade agreement is because we are afraid of competition.

But something has happened that opened a new unique window of opportunity. The change of government in Argentina with its President saying that it is his priority, his government’s priority, to reach out to Europe and to work with us has created a new momentum. We are now facing the possibility that we can finally take those negotiations forward after so many years, engaging with countries with whom we share so much history, so much culture and so much friendship. It is important for cultural, political, geopolitical reasons, and also for economic reasons.  This is a fantastic export market. There are more than 250 million people, opportunities for European businesses such as the car sector, machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, wines, spirits and also in the agricultural sector, for instance fruits, vegetables, dairy, processed food, etc. Our exports, as I said, pay more than four billion annually in tariff duties and these can basically all be eliminated through an ambitious free-trade agreement (FTA). It will also open up new possibilities for our service sectors and for our public procurement.  As regards the agriculture sector, we are of course very aware of the crisis in the agriculture sector in the European Union, but I think we need to be correct on the figures: 60% of our agricultural imports from Mercosur are soya and feedstock for our own cows and pigs, and the FTA would eliminate taxes, tariffs, on this issue, making it less expensive for farmers. We actually have a trade surplus when it comes to pigmeat and dairy with Mercosur, and more could be exported through FTA. Our laws and our standards and our SPS regulations would of course have to be respected, as in all free trade agreements but having said that, we are very vigilant of the agricultural sectors. I will not confirm today what is in, and what is not, because we are finalising the final offers that will be exchanged later this week. Once it is there and once we have received the Mercosur offer we will share it with you and we are also working on this general analysis. Because of the crisis of the agriculture sector we will follow this very closely, and it is also because of that we are trying to open more markets in order to give more possibilities to our agriculture.  The mandate is old – yes – that is in the hands of the Council. I hope the Council will make the mandate public because that is the line of the Commission, as you know: that all mandates should be public.

It is a major step forward that trade negotiations between the European Union and the South American Free Trade Association, MERCOSUR, can resume with the return of Argentina.

However, the preliminary impact assessment that will be used to start negotiations is outdated, since since 2004 the world, including trade, has changed considerably. A new impact assessment reflecting the current situation is needed. It is very irresponsible to resume negotiations until this is born, there are so many uncertainties.

In view of the growing volume of trade flows, which make Mercosur the EU's sixth trading partner, and its closeness to global issues, an ESA between the two regional areas is the natural step forward in friendly relations between the two partners.

This Agenda will be the focus of global development cooperation in the years to come.  But let me be clear, the adoption was just a very first step in addressing this global challenge and as agreement on the implementation and review mechanism of the Agenda is still to be secured, we have important and significant work ahead of us, and yes, further preparation of the EU position before the July session of the High-level Political Forum in New York is crucial to ensure an optimal and action-oriented outcome that will be in line with EU priorities. As most of you know, the Council is of the view that the follow-up and review process should accelerate progress on implementation of the comprehensive 2030 Agenda. It should also foster broad ownership and accountability. Without any doubt, the Council remains committed to a full and active, constructive role of the EU and its Member States in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, obviously in close cooperation with all partners and stakeholders. Now in our capacity as the EU Presidency, the Netherlands organised on 19 April a meeting for Member States to exchange best practices with respect to national implementation of the global goals. The Netherlands will also organise a meeting at the end of this month about multi-stakeholder participation, and yes, we consider it of the greatest importance to maintain the indivisible nature of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. The EU has started its work for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Commission will present a new approach to ensuring economic growth as well as social and environmental sustainability beyond the 2020 timeframe, taking into account the Europe 2020 review as well as the internal and external aspects of the implementation of the UN sustainable development goals. A roadmap is expected to form the basis for further discussions. Within this context I am happy to note that revision of the European Consensus on Development in light of the 2030 Agenda will feature on the agenda of the Development Council on Thursday. It will be a very first and general debate but I do expect Council to focus on how to address the comprehensive nature of the 2030 Agenda, how to ensure the best possible contribution, what means of implementation and financing instruments can be used best, as well as how to improve coherence, complementarity and coordination between the EU and the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1687, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, the EU was instrumental in shaping the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and I see several of the key players before me here today. But New York was only the start; and Europe has a duty – to itself, and to the international community – to lead in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Commission is committed to delivering its part in an integrated way, and we have made our response to the SDGs one of the priorities of the 2016 work programme. We will present to you an initiative in the course of this year on ‘next steps for a sustainable European future’ to map out the EU contribution.  Delivering on the SDGs is deeply entwined with our objectives under the 10 priorities of the Juncker Commission. Vice-President Katainen and I are coordinating this, while working closely with High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini for the external side. This work builds on a solid basis. Through the Europe 2020 Strategy, and through a wide range of EU policies, from climate change to skills and innovation, the EU is already delivering on many SDGs. One of the challenges in our institutions, in our Member States, will be to prevent dividing up implementation between an international, a national and a European strand. What we do at home needs to be consistent with what we do in Europe and internationally. If we are serious about the SDGs, we need to understand the philosophy behind them; namely that it is an integrated and universal agenda, and no longer the ‘developed world’ telling the rest of the world what they need to do. It is also us telling ourselves what we need to do. Externally, the SDGs are already playing a big role in shaping our development cooperation but also more broadly. The Commission will present later this year a proposal to revise the European Consensus on Development in the light of the SDGs and changing global trends. We need to address all three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. Eradicating poverty, eliminating inequalities and combating climate change are not competing objectives; they go hand in hand. This means change in Europe too. And 2030 is the day after tomorrow, if not already tomorrow. I strongly believe that if we take a hard look at our prospects as European society in a business-as-usual scenario, if we do not step up our efforts over the next generation, what we can hope to achieve in terms of structural economic growth is not encouraging – an annual average of perhaps 1 to 1.5% if we are lucky. With our demographic realities, that is simply not sufficient to sustain our social model, our European way of life. It is a very uncomfortable truth, but it is nonetheless true. If we want to be in a position to provide for our parents, our children, for everyone in need, if we really want a sustainable, social model for our societies, we need to move much more quickly to a sustainable economy, to a low-carbon, resource-efficient, circular economy. We need to make sure we enable people to fully participate in society. This is not about something that is ‘nice to have’; it something that is urgent and something we need to have. This is about competitiveness in the widest sense of the word. This is about the future of the European way of life. It will not happen all by itself. I am deeply convinced that new forms of governance and smart regulation are increasingly going to play an important part in that respect. To make this transition from where we are now to where we need to be tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, you need governance; you need broad alliances with businesses, NGOs and society at large. This is what we need to create in Europe, and I count on working with you hand in hand. The European Parliament will lead on this. If we fall in the trap of only defending the past, all we will find ourselves able to do, is to slow down decline. This is about shaping the future. A prosperous future for all Europeans. So the Commission sees the global 2030 Agenda as a tremendous opportunity – for Europe, for the international community at large. An opportunity also for us all to overcome our own silos, whether they are in the services or between countries and between institutions. Our intention is to make the implementation of the SDGs, like the circular economy, a team effort. We encourage you to do the same, and I look forward to work closely with this House on this Agenda over the months and years to come, and with the Council of course.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1688, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam President, Mr. Vice-President, Madam High Commissioner, Madam Minister, indeed without false modesty, the adoption of agenda 2030 has been a great success for the European Union. It was the culmination of a truly inclusive negotiation process where, in addition to the United Nations Member States, civil society and the private sector also participated, but it was essential that the EU had a unified position.  That is why this agenda includes concepts such as good governance, the rule of law, inclusive institutions that were not part of the development agenda before. And you, Mr. Vice President, Madam High Representative, were in New York when that agenda was adopted, and now comes the hard part, which is the implementation of that agenda, that program, these development goals. And before us is actually the first act in implementing where this will be measured, which is a meeting of high-level political forums in the 7th month in New York.  The aim of this debate and the resolution we will adopt is to demand that we once again have one unified position of the European Union there and not be presented exclusively at the level of different EU Member States.

I think it is a very important statement of intent that you are all here tonight to embrace the concept of the universal agenda of the SDGs. When you talk around the capitals of Europe, and indeed in this Parliament, to be honest, we get the impression that we are still talking of SDGs as a replacement for the MDGs. It is something about development policy, exactly what you said, Commissioner Timmermans, and we need to move away from that, we need to get this comprehensive agenda.  I was pleased with what the Presidency said about bringing the Member States together and their coordination. It would be useful to set it out for Parliament so that we know what the Member States and Council are going to do: that will be very important. I have just got few specific questions for the Commission stemming from New York. We have seen progress and statisticians have done their job: they produced these statistics, these indicators. Is the Commission looking at those statistics now? Are you thinking how we can implement them and set some baselines across the Commission? How are we preparing for the first meeting of the high-level political forum which takes place in less than 2 months’ time? How will the Commission be represented? How will the Member States be represented? Will we speak with one voice in that forum? It would be useful for us to understand that. We know that the development aspects will be covered by a new consensus on development. I am very pleased that Commissioner Timmermans has said that we will look at the 2020 strategy for the internal aspects. We must have a universal agenda and we must be coherent. We must not lose sight of important things such as financing for development, and the major conference this week in London about corruption.  We all know that there is money there if we can harness it for governments to invest in the interest of society and not to have it stashed away in bank accounts in places like Panama.

Point two: with goals alone you achieve nothing. It is essential to focus on policies and reforms that create prosperity and encourage economic growth, such as integrating poor countries into world trade, good governance, fighting corruption.

I understand that this may sound unrealistic, but if we consider that the cost of eliminating poverty in the world for a full year is equal to the cost of arms in eight days, we will realise how little is enough. The hard truth is that poverty can be eradicated, but there is a lack of will, especially from the political and economic elites who have been so drastically involved in the status quo. Cutting poverty in half sounds more realistic than the requirement to eradicate poverty everywhere and in all its forms, but we must not forget that poverty kills more people every year than it did during World War II.

And now the 2030 Agenda will be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 May. But is this the right body? Commissioner, you said that there is a philosophy behind it. This philosophy is actually world internal politics. It takes up sectors that were previously considered to be classically intra-European.

Madam President, two political values are important for democracy: legitimacy, that is, to tell the truth and to share this truth through credibility, to live the truth. However, on sustainable development, the European Union should question its legitimacy and credibility.  Of the seventeen objectives on the sustainable development agenda, I remember the first four: poverty, hunger, health and education. What is the legitimacy of sustainable development when EU policy results in a 47% increase in child mortality in Greece through its policy to the banks against the Greek people? What credibility does the Union have in supporting free trade and relocating its pollution while perceanting the UN's ecological objectives? China pollutes for us more than for it, and that is the eighth objective.  If we remain in our hypocrisy, nothing will change. At home, man works for the economy and the economy works for finance, whereas with the Copernican revolution - if our priorities were human - of this new humanism that the Holy Father asks us to listen to wisdom, in short to avoid the desolation and suicide of Western Europe, we should want finance to work for the economy and the economy for man and his needs.  This revolution, I propose: it would be to use the capabilities of the Central Bank, the current 1 trillion monetary creation to invest them in a human project of sustainable development that would then be truly economic, social and environmental. 500 billion invested in the countries of southern Europe and 500 billion in co-development with the South.

The 17 sustainable development goals are a great – and very important – comprehensive, sustainable and enjoined effort. But it requires money – it requires USD 2.5 trillion. My report, which was passed in Parliament last month, points out how to raise these sort of funds – by leverage, which we have done, and the Commission has committed itself to that – and we can actually involve the private sector, in public—private partnership, to act comprehensively, reduce poverty and also sustainably help the EU in that problem. But I am already told that the UN is now six months behind creating the 230 indicators that we need. We must not allow the United Nations to use its bureaucracy to slow down this process. The global humanitarian crisis which I mentioned a few minutes ago also requires that the new Secretary—General of the United Nations, who we are going to look towards to implement our programme, has some humanitarian experience. It should not really be just someone who can run government, but someone who has got hands—on experience of development and humanitarian work.

Firstly, the lack of policy coherence between the various EU policies. Secondly, we still need a coordinated strategy of the national states with their objectives and timelines.

I think there is one lesson we learned very clearly from the previous experience of the Millennium Development Goals, which is that we cannot wait and see years go by before we start working seriously on the implementation. I remember very well being in New York together with a number of you – with Linda, with Vice-President Timmermans and Commissioner Mimica – celebrating the achievements of the SDGs last September together, in this team approach that underlines that we have understood that this is an Agenda that implies our work on our internal policies as much as it does on our external policies, and that we are starting to work on the changes, the efforts, that are needed to shift the mentality we have in our daily work and put together the different parts of our policies that are connected with the implementation of the Agenda. This will require, as Frans Timmermans mentioned, internal-external coordination, interinstitutional coordination and also a similar kind of work inside all the different institutions, including Parliament. That is why I was particularly glad to see that this debate has involved many of you – coming from different backgrounds and active on different committees – to feed in the work of Parliament also on different aspects. Let me also say that – as many of you have mentioned, and as Frans Timmermans also mentioned at the start – the agreement was just the beginning, and now the real part – the implementation – starts. We have started to work with this comprehensive approach on the different elements of our implementation work: from the issue of climate change to the sustainable development part, but also migration. We often focus in this House and in this plenary on the different parts of our policies on migration and refugees, but I believe that if we managed to implement fully the SDGs, 95% of the work we need to do to tackle the migratory and refugee phenomenon would be done, because this is the root cause. What we need to respond to global challenges is integrated solutions, and this poses a serious challenge to our traditional way of doing things and of working. But I believe this is going to be an extraordinary opportunity for us to understand how we have to deal with the world of today, with this internal and external coherence that is going to be essential, and also to push not only the Member States to coordinate more – I would say one word on this for which I should jump to the other side of the Hemicycle – but also to, let us say, encourage the UN system to adapt to these challenges. The UN system also needs to reflect on its own working methods if it wants to implement the Agenda in a proper way. On the external side: we are working on how best to adapt our external action and our development policy to fulfil the Agenda, contributing also to the commitments we have undertaken on climate change at COP 21 in Paris and aspects of our EU global strategy that we debated in this Hemicycle just last night. Many of you referred to the fact that next Thursday we have a Development Ministers Council, or rather a Foreign Affairs Council, in its development ministers formation, and – once again I should jump to the other side of the Hemicycle to say so, but the Presidency will forgive me if I play my double hat in a flexible way – we will have a discussion on the review of the European Consensus for Development, including its adaptation to the Agenda 2030, and we will reflect on some new elements of the Consensus. Here I will need your help and our coordination – our common work – to be courageous enough to bring us to the next stage, because my impression is that we will need to work on including in our Consensus elements that we have not had so far. By way of example, I am speaking of our work on peace and security, which are consistent parts of our implementation of Agenda 2030; the important role of the private sector; our more and more differentiated partnerships with increasingly diverse partners, including middle-income countries, which will be a complicated debate, but we need to have it; on working together with Member States through joint programming and joint implementation, which I believe could be the key for us to mobilise resources in a more strategic way, coordinating more what we are already doing towards a common objective. We also need to look into the more traditional ones, coordinating all of this effort also with our reflection on the post-Cotonou reflections and proposals. I will continue to work on the external sides of this with Commissioner Mimica, with Parliament, with Linda and with the Development Committee, so that we can carry out this joint work in liaison with the work that Frans Timmermans, Vice-President Katainen and the others are developing on the internal side. We also have our public consultation process, which is of course also going to feed our work in this. I know that we can count on your very active support and also your contribution to this work, because we are in a field that was not there before, and this is a huge occasion for us not only to understand the complexity of the world much better, but also to interact with it in a more effective way.

And I believe that that was a reflection of our partnership, our friendship, which is strong, as we work with each other, but basically we support each other – which is sometimes more important than that – but that was also a reflection of the fact that those countries are facing that kind of challenge every single day that goes by. Because when we mention the effects of the Syrian crisis, we tend normally to focus on the refugee crisis – which is indeed the case, I will come to that in a moment – but we should not underestimate the risks in terms of security, the threats, the challenges that these two countries are facing due to the crisis in Syria and the spread of Daesh in their own region. So I think we should always keep this in mind: that they are exposed to different levels of threats and pressures, and the way in which they are resisting this storm, which is actually a perfect storm, is quite remarkable. And let me also mention that we discuss these two countries together very often. Our work with them is always highlighted together. They are very different one from the other – I know you all know that as regards their political situation, social situation and obviously this very same composition of the countries – but indeed they have some elements in common. First of all, they are giving shelter and hope to millions of people fleeing Syria. They show a great example of peaceful coexistence among different faiths and nationalities, which is an example for the Middle East, an example for Europe and also an example for the whole world. And they can play an important role in the solution of so many crises, starting with Syria, obviously – we sit together in the International Support Group for Syria. But let me mention, for instance, the key role that Jordan plays when it comes to the Middle East peace process. I believe we all agree across the different political families on this: that our support for Jordan and Lebanon is an investment, is in the best interests of the countries, of the countries’ citizens, of Syrian refugees, of the whole region in terms of stability and security, and it is also in the best interests of European citizens. There are over one million registered refugees in Lebanon. The real figure is likely to be higher – perhaps around 1.5 million – as the UNHCR, as we know, is no longer allowed to register new arrivals, which is something that should be fixed as quickly as possible. This means that one quarter of the Lebanese population are Syrian refugees – one quarter. Lebanon is just a bit bigger than Strasbourg’s region, Alsace; but Lebanon alone hosts almost as many Syrians as the entire European Union. I would like us to keep this in mind, very clearly, when we speak about these two countries, facing at the same time a neighbouring country that is torn by war and the threat of Daesh. So those who believe that refugees might destroy our Union should look at these figures and – allow me to be blunt – feel ashamed. There are over 630 000 registered refugees in Jordan. The recent census shows that 1.2 million Syrians are in the country. So these are the figures; these are the numbers; and these are issues that are not debatable. These are there, they are facts. But let us also keep in mind that we are talking about real people behind the numbers, with names, faces, stories to tell, hopes for the future, and that we have to support these countries also for the sake of the humanity that is behind these numbers. I visited refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon several times, and the last time was on the very day of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. If I can share with you on a personal note, it was very difficult for me in those hours to decide to keep the agenda of our meetings going with what was happening just a few metres away from our European institutions. For me it was important to hold the meetings inside the refugee camps in Jordan that day, as I did in Lebanon on the previous day, because in the camps, but also in the local communities that are hosting them outside of the camps, you very often meet people who are fleeing from the same atrocities that we sometimes experience in Europe. These are in most cases people fleeing from the atrocities of Daesh and who can tell you stories that you would never ever want to hear. Obviously, we had held other meetings and visits before that – myself, Commissioner Hahn, Commissioner Stylianides – on several occasions, and what I saw in those days, what my colleagues and friends have seen every time we go there, is people that even if they have experienced the worst atrocities in their lives, still have a smile on their face, still find a reason to hope and still believe that it can be possible to go back to their homes. When you ask them – sometimes 10-year-old boys and girls in the school, sometimes 17-year-old boys and girls, hoping to go to university – if you ask them: what is your dream, if you can express one wish, what would it be? It is not to come to Europe, it is to go back to Syria. All of them! So I think that we have a collective responsibility towards those hopes that are still alive in their minds and in their hearts. We have obviously a duty to work on a solution to the Syrian crisis. This is something that we are constantly doing. I was just in Paris for one of the meetings with the Syrian opposition and some of our partners in the region in Europe and the United States. To continue working on that, we will have another meeting of the Support Group for Syria next week, so our work on that side does not stop: it is tireless. But we have a duty to feed this hope with concrete measures every single day. In those camps and in the local communities that are hosting so many refugees, both in Lebanon and Jordan, we have almost always also seen the European Union in action. We have seen schools paid for with European support, food and clothes, both thanks to our help, babies born in hospitals that we finance. We are literally giving life in those places, and it made me proud of our European Union. It showed me that our work can have a direct impact on every single life that we invest in, and this makes the figures for our money, our support, our investments in the region, real when you see the baby that was born the previous day, when you see the children in school, when you see the food and water coming. The European Union is the first donor in the region. This means that we have been helping Syrian refugees with almost EUR 6 billion mobilised so far by institutions and Member States together – EUR 6 billion! And this is something of which I remind our partners around the world every time I meet them, from Washington to Tokyo. Because I believe that we have to reach a point where this is felt as a global responsibility – not just a regional one, not just a European one, but a global one – and I believe that we are slowly managing somehow to broaden the spectrum of actions that are taken also by other actors in order either to welcome refugees or support financially other countries that are welcoming them there. The pledges of the International Donors Conference in London last February are already materialising, building in many cases on long—standing efforts that, as you know, we have undertaken since the beginning. You know that more than half of the money pledged in London and which is coming in concrete projects comes from the EU budget, and if you look at the EU budget and Member States’ budgets combined, this makes up two thirds of the pledges in London. We are trying to address the refugees’ immediate needs but also, as I said, to keep hope alive. In concrete terms, hope is the possibility to go to school for the children, to learn a job, to imagine your own life after exile, and for this very reason we are very much focusing especially on two main issues – the support we give to children and young people and the support we give to women – because we know very well that these are the two engines for keeping hope alive in the families that flee Syria. This is important for Syria and its future. This is important for the Syrian people. This is important for the host countries, but this is also important for Europe because it is quite clear that hope can succeed where the fear of fences and border police can only fail. So this is also a very pragmatic approach that we can take. Investing in schools, education, job creation for the young people of Syria in Jordan and Lebanon is also a way of investing in their future close to home. At the same time, we also need to support the host communities and their resilience. So we are working on the compacts of mutual commitments with Lebanon and Jordan, which will come on top of the commitments agreed in London and will be annexed to our new bilateral partnership priorities. If an agreement is reached, and I am quite positive about that, the European Union could provide overall over EUR 1 billion in 2016 and 2017 for these initiatives, both in Jordan and Lebanon. And this is not only about aid, because when Europe acts as a union, as we managed to do in London, we can mobilise a unique and quite impressive number of different assets ranging from trade to policy dialogues. For Jordan, for instance, we are looking into a temporary relaxation of rules of origin to announce trade investments and job opportunities for Syrian refugees also. That would create job opportunities for the Syrians and for the Jordanians in the host communities that are more exposed. I called the compacts a win—win—win proposal. They would benefit the refugees, the host communities and us. In fact the compacts are being designed to build on mutual commitments, and let me stress how proud I was that we managed to shape these compacts in the London Conference out of a mainly UK idea, using mainly EU tools for the benefit of us all. And I believe this is something that our friends in the UK should consider when we talk about the added value of our common instruments. On our mutual commitments: for instance, while we provide financial support to schools for attendance for refugee children in Lebanon, we also need the local authorities to create a protective environment around the children, so the parents can feel confident about sending their children to school. In our relationship with Jordan and Lebanon we can learn a great deal; we can learn a lot from each other, and perhaps Europe has more to learn than we would want to admit. I agree with the wise words of the King of Jordan, His Majesty King Abdullah, when he says that countries that are hosting a relatively small number of refugees should maybe act more and preach less. But let me also take a moment to remember the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees stranded at Jordan’s north-eastern border, the ‘Berm’. The vast majority of them are women and children and they need urgent humanitarian assistance, which is difficult to deliver in such a remote area. I am aware that the issue is very sensitive and there are a number of aspects, so I am very grateful to the Jordanian Government for its decision to allow 20 000 people from the area to be hosted at the Azraq camp. This is a very important move, and I hope that relief and protection for refugees at the Berm can be found quickly. I know that this House, this Hemicycle, this Parliament supports the work we are doing with both Jordan and Lebanon, and let me tell you that your contribution will be important and will be welcome in continuing this important work. On my side you know that I will guarantee that I will always work to strengthen our ties with these two countries at all levels, especially because –I know we normally focus on the fact that they are hosting the refugees, but let me stress once more – their resilience is strategic to our security. This is not one region out of many; it is our region and it is the most troubled region in the world. So their resilience is somehow a very strategic element of our internal security as well. King Abdullah is a very respected and inspiring figure in the Muslim world. and I remember that we listened to his words here in this Hemicycle last year. And I have had the pleasure of meeting him and Queen Rania on several occasions. Let me say that obviously we are also focusing very closely on the political situation in Lebanon, especially on ending the political crisis. That is crucial to realising the full potential of our partnership, and maybe we will have another occasion to come back to this proper discussion on the future of Lebanon’s political and institutional situation another time in this Hemicycle. But let me close by quoting the words of King Abdullah of Jordan speaking in this Hemicycle, from that podium, one year ago, who said: ‘Our victory now depends on our unity. Europe’s role is vital ... It is essential that our regions renew the source of our great strength: the mutual respect that binds and sustains us.’ I believe that we have a responsibility to each other, and that responsibility is our duty to tell our friends and partners: Europe is with you as you are with Europe. We will not leave you alone because our common victory depends on our unity. I thank you very much. I look forward to listening to your views on that.

I am impressed by the speech. Because this speech, Mrs Mogherini, which you have given, shows us Europeans the mirror. We complain and hear some shouting from the outer sides of the House about the overburdening of Europe. When I consider what is being done in other parts of the world – and especially in the region – it is downright ridiculous what we have had in terms of pressures so far.  I have been to Lebanon on various occasions over the last two years. When I see that a country of four million people, which is just as divided by the Saudis and the Iranians and has 300 000 Palestinian refugees in camps for 60 years, has now taken in well over a million from Syria, that is an incredible effort and moral achievement. When I see that the King of Jordan, because of the Palestinian refugees who have been there for decades, no longer has a majority of his own in his country and this very poor country has now taken on this number of refugees once again, I would invite us all to extrapolate and look at the population of the city in which one lives. what there are in terms of loads. Incidentally, we must also include Turkey, which has also taken over these high burdens to a large extent. That is why I think it is important – and I believe it will be – that we give them our full support in terms of funding and also in terms of political support. This is a question of Christian charity, it is a question of humanity. And every single human life has to be counted here and not always the general bills are drawn up.  This is a matter of our security. If this region explodes, it will have dramatic negative consequences for us, and that is why we should finally realise that this is not a question of how we can be better off here – by keeping ourselves out of it – but that we fight for our interests when we help the people there – the states, such as the refugees.

This is the message we need, and it is a clear invitation to Member States to take action to show that our moral standards are equally practised and not only spoken – that they are not only good teachings for others.  The situation today in Lebanon and Jordan is not sustainable. There are more than two million refugees in two small countries, in which they represent between 10 and 30% of the population. The UN’s humanitarian appeal for 2015 shows that 61% of the needs have been financed. A lot was promised in February at the London Conference on Syria, but we know very well that funding shortages means that most of the vulnerable Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan live well below the UN poverty line. The generosity of the communities in the two countries is high, but it might not be enough. If we fail to help the two countries, then they could become the refugees of tomorrow. I quote you, Madam High Representative: ‘Jordan and Lebanon are rocks in the Middle Eastern storm’, and therefore I believe we have to support them by all means.  Jordan sets an example through its important efforts towards democracy and Lebanon is a stable but fragile state surrounded by so many threats. It is imperative to support their economic and social resilience in these difficult times. The EU has been a leading donor in the region, but we have to feel the sense of urgency and take difficult decisions. We also have to understand that if we want a comprehensive strategy to tackle the migration crisis, cooperation with Turkey is of equally huge importance.  On behalf of my S&amp;D Group, I urge the Commission for the pledges to be disbursed and for the EU compacts to be finalised as soon as possible in order to immediately strengthen our assistance and cooperation with them using the full range of EU policies.

EU aid in this dire situation in the form of the creation of necessary jobs – such as stimulating the tourism sector and improving the market access of Jordanian products to the European market – is more than welcome. I wholeheartedly agree with the requests of the Jordanian authorities in this. The situation in Lebanon is even more dramatic. Syrian refugees already make up 25% of the total population. Moreover, 90% of these Syrian refugees are Sunni, with all the consequences for the delicate religious balance between Sunnis, Shiites and Christians in the country. New Lebanese visa measures for Syrians have now led to large-scale illegal Syrian immigration into the country. The sad consequence is that 70% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon are currently in deep poverty. Just last month, a research report revealed that 70 percent of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon are being ruthlessly exploited in the labour market. An insider told me that there is widespread slavery and human trafficking, not to mention the abhorrent sexual slavery under which Syrian women suffer physically and psychologically in Lebanon.

During the last few months we have had a debate in Europe on the unprecedented arrivals and migrants on our shores. Heads of State have stated that Europe, the richest continent on the planet, can no longer cope with the numbers of refugees arriving. Let us be clear: we are facing a challenging situation. This is true, but this is mainly because we have completely failed to find a sustainable common European solution. If you were to spread the 1.5 million asylum seekers evenly throughout the Member States of the Union, it would imply that every city of 10 000 persons would receive 30 asylum seekers. Does this merit the crisis narrative? The amount of asylum seekers making their way to Europe over the past few years corresponds to not even 0.3% of our population. How about comparing that with the Lebanese situation where I, together with some ALDE colleagues, studied the situation a few weeks ago? Lebanon, a country approximately one-third of the size of Belgium with 4 million citizens, has received somewhere between 1.2 and 1.8 million refugees from Syria, which means that one in every four persons in Lebanon is a Syrian refugee.  This does not merit the crisis rhetoric. We in Europe are complaining over and over again that refugees should stay in the neighbouring countries as we sit back. Colleagues, mainly on the right wing of this House, are stating over and over again that it is not the same because the UNHCR and other NGOs will take care of the responsibility for them, but the truth is that the UNHCR only has the capacity to help about 15% of the refugees in Lebanon. In my view, while we must assist Lebanon and Jordan, we must first of all sort out our own failed asylum system rather than trying to close immoral deals or statements with increasingly authoritarian governments such as the Turkish one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1724, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Marisa MATIAS", "mepid": "96820", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, Madam Mogherini, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking you for your commitment to the political solution to the situation in Syria.

There are more than 4.5 million refugees living in the four neighbouring countries of Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq alone, and there is no doubt that the region will remain dependent on international aid for years to come. At the Syria donor conference in London at the beginning of February, EUR 5 billion was pledged for this year and a similar amount for the coming years. However, the sums required are much higher. I visited Lebanon last year and had intensive discussions with Syrian refugees. Most refugees are aware that they will not return to their homeland for years to come. It is therefore important that international and local aid measures go beyond basic services and open up prospects. Adequate schooling and access to the labour market are of central importance for refugees. Keeping perspectives open also means that Syrian refugees have a realistic chance of moving to the EU with their closest relatives.

I believe that there is substantial and strong unity of opinion on this issue among most Members of this House. Who would say today that we do not want to help two heroic countries such as Jordan and Lebanon?  In spite of myself, however, I find myself having to make an analysis and to reckon with what I regret to do in a certain way. If we look, for example, at the Trust fund \"Madad\", which is really concerned with helping Syrian refugees, and we go and compare what we do in Jordan and Lebanon, on the one hand, and in Turkey, on the other, there is a considerable discrepancy. We have reckoned before, we have said important figures: there are about 1 300 000 refugees in Lebanon, and at least 650 000 – but probably one million – in Jordan. We will therefore have some 2.5 million refugees who, in return, receive aid of 1.8 billion between the two countries. For Turkey, counting what comes from the Trust fund, the 3 billion refugee facility and another 3 billion from the March 2016 agreement, we get to over 6.3 billion, and I obviously do not want to count pre-accession funds.  In Jordan and Lebanon there have been refugees since the first Israeli-Palestinian wars, hundreds of thousands. There are incredible efforts to live together, while in Turkey we see an ambiguous attitude towards Daesh and an attitude that has yet to be condemned with regard to a not enough fight against oil trafficking, for example. In essence, I have to say: why do we use this positive discrimination for a country that, however, shows much less commitment? Is it because Turkey is blackmailing us, am I thinking? Can we accept that we are strong with the weak and weak with the strong? In the face of the efforts of these countries, I say no.  We must continue along the path of London, if we are to make a positive discrimination, it must be towards Jordan and Lebanon, greatly increasing efforts and not giving in to the blackmail of authoritarian figures who would rather bow to their wishes. Helping Lebanon and Jordan also frees them from the blackmail of other regional powers such as Saudi Arabia, which is far from sympathetic to refugees, but very interested in exacerbating, for example, the clashes between Sunnis and Shiites in Lebanon itself and proxy wars.

I myself had the chance last week to represent President Schulz at the first Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region of the Women in Parliaments Global Forum, and there I had also a chance to visit the Azraq camp, which is funded to a large extent by EU money. There was a big EU flag there which, they told us, had not been there for long – so now it is there! But the most touching thing was seeing kids in school: the education there. The young ones – like elementary school kids – were really eager to learn, so many of them, and saying what they wanted to become when they get older, also wanting to return. But then, the older they get, the fewer are attending school. We saw some preparing for graduation, and we heard that the reason why there are fewer of them as they get older is, in part, because there is no prospect for them to get scholarships to universities, for example. So my colleague Beatriz Becerra and I decided that we will start a small Parliament initiative, with – hopefully – other parliamentarians, to support those young people – mostly the young women, but also some of those young men – to get some scholarships to be able to do what Ms Mogherini said: to keep hope alive for them to have a prospect in life. That will, hopefully, be one of our small contributions, to also work on that.

When a country like Jordan, which is suffering from water shortages, hosts more than 600 000 additional people. We must support these efforts, with money, with more money and with the establishment of self-government structures, such as in Zaatari. We need these structures, where people can take matters into their own hands, educate their children in schools and become economically active.

I believe that we must place particular emphasis on one aspect: the Syrian tragedy has a huge impact in economic terms and in social and civil terms both in Lebanon and in Jordan.  The latest figures from some international institutes tell us, for example, that the youth unemployment rate in Jordan has risen from 19 % to 35-39 %. In Lebanon, the collapse in GDP growth – Lebanon is a country that has grown at a very high rate over the last ten years – and the increase in demand for primary public services could generate an estimated loss of around $7.5 billion. So this is not only a dramatic crisis from the point of view of reception, but we are facing a dramatic crisis which calls into question the very existence of the two individual States, from an economic and social point of view. That is why two guidelines are fundamental: on the one hand, to have coordination on resources, to have clarity and transparency on the impact of our policies, our choices. Those suggestions that have come from other Members go in the right direction, if not even imagine a real extraordinary plan of Europe towards what you have called our region.

Madam President, according to the most recent figures from the UNHCR, the number of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon exceeds 1.5 million souls. Lebanon in particular, which is a small country with 4.5 million inhabitants, is currently home to more than one million refugees. It is the country with the highest refugee-permanent population ratio in the world. As we all understand, this situation cannot continue for a long time without a major humanitarian crisis. Sooner or later these refugees will find themselves back on the road to escape and many of them will be heading to Greece. The European Union must take all necessary preventive measures to deal with the coming crisis.

Madam President, the European policy of providing support to Jordan and Lebanon on the one hand, and Turkey on the other, is completely wrong. Refugee numbers have already been reported in Lebanon, Jordan and, respectively, Turkey. Financial aid, of course, to Lebanon and Jordan and Iraq together amounts to EUR 350 million, as opposed to aid to Turkey amounting to EUR 6 billion. In Lebanon, refugees go through thorough checks and are given a residence card or deported if they do not meet the criteria. To renew the card they pay $100 or must guarantee a Lebanese citizen. In Jordan, refugees have access to the labour market, but if the work is claimed by a Jordanian and a refugee at the same time, the job is taken over by the country's national. In the Europe of diversity and open borders, all this seems racist. But it is democratic for the European Union to pay these sums to Turkey, which, along with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, created ISIS, drowns innocent souls in the Aegean, trades in oil and stolen ancients with the Daesh. For Greeks, in the evil he hears in the name \"Turkey of Erdogan and Muslim Sunni extremism\" there is a solution.

We have had – and I am sure we will have at other times – a debate on our political work on solving the Syrian crisis, which is a different debate – obviously linked, but a different one. I would love to discuss the recent developments with you. Some of you mentioned this in two different ways, some saying that a political solution is not on the horizon and others saying that it is already solved. As very often happens, probably the truth is somewhere in between. I am not completely negative about the fact that we might come to some sort of political transition in Syria in the coming months. We are working hard on this and believe me when I tell you again – we were together with John Kerry and others yesterday – the European Union is not only helping to assist in managing the effects of the Syrian crisis, but also playing a major role in the political work to find a solution to the Syrian crisis, but this is not the debate we are having tonight. Again, I would welcome another debate specifically on this in one of the next sessions. Let me come to some of the issues you raised during the debate. One: some of you mentioned something that I believe is critical and crucial. This debate is about us supporting Jordan and Lebanon, not only because of their hosting of Syrian refugees, but also because of their crucial importance and the importance that we attach to their economic, social and security resilience. Let me also be frank – as, you will know by now, I always am – I find it unacceptably cynical whenever we discuss our support for these countries just because we do not want refugees to come to Europe. To me this is completely unacceptable from a moral point of view. Let me also add that it is somehow striking that sometimes the same narrative of those who want to protect our identity – including the purity of our background, be it on a religious or cultural basis – do not listen to the words of Pope Francis, which tell us that this is what we have to do: protect people’s lives, make sure that our European approach to asylum is up to the values that we have in our foundations. I am not a Catholic myself, but being an Italian and a Roman, I can tell you that I have learnt in in my years of life something very basic. If you are a Catholic, if you are a Christian, you cannot pick and choose the words of the Pope that you like the most and ignore the others. This is not sustainable. Sorry, that came from my heart, because last week in the Vatican we had a very moving – and also very politically relevant – event where the Charlemagne Prize was presented to Pope Francis, and I think we had some lessons for Europe there as well. Coming to politics, I will quickly answer some of the questions you have mentioned. Regarding special arrangements for Jordan on the rules of origin, I told you in the beginning, in my opening remarks, that we are working on that. We will need all your support to make sure that this happens in a coherent way, which means that it would be good, when we come to the decisions, to be supported in translating our political will into concrete acts. I believe this can be a real game—changer for the Jordanian economy and the hosting communities because, in this way, we could create jobs both for Syrian refugees and for Jordanians, thus preventing a major social problem in the country and also an economic one.  The same goes for the budget. I took note of what Elmar Brok mentioned at the beginning of our debate – and I will remember it when we come to a debate on our budget – namely that we might work together on increasing the level of the budget we have for our external action in general and, in particular, for some of these aspects. We have now, as I mentioned, invested EUR 6 billion so far. This also means that, for instance, the World Food Programme, which I met just a few weeks ago, is now financed until the end of the year, which is something that has never happened before. This is thanks to European Union support. But I would like to mention not only the money we spend, but also the effects that we bring with this money. I understand that you all visited the camps, so you have seen some of the projects we fund, some of the children that go to school thanks to our funding, and some of the health and education facilities we support. I would like to mention some figures because, again, these translate into concrete action. With our funds, we support the enrolment in public schools of more than 112 000 Syrian child refugees. We have rehabilitated 35 public schools – and I visited one of them. Every school obviously hosts many children, allowing education, because we also need to focus on preventing radicalisation in the future, and we risk having a lost generation there, which is also an investment in our security and the stability of the region. We are guaranteeing psychosocial support for 8 000 children and you can imagine how key this is for the future of the region and the country. We are supporting immunisation for 310 000 Syrian and vulnerable Lebanese children. I could continue. I understand very well, as I am a politician myself, that you do not need only to tell your constituencies how much money was spent but what it brings, and this is what it brings, which again is a moral duty. In my opinion, it is a humanitarian duty but also an investment in our own security and stability. Here again, when it comes to the budget, I count on your support to translate our common position in words into something concrete. Let me close on one last point that also concerns money, namely the London pledges. Some of you mentioned the fact that we pledged a lot in London and that the money is not there. It is there. There is one thing on which you can always be sure: when the European Union pledges money, this translates immediately into projects funded. This is true for Lebanon and Jordan and is true for other projects on the humanitarian, and also on the development, level. This is true for instance – and this reflects a link with one of the debates to follow, because I love night sessions in Parliament and I never finish before midnight so we have another two! – on the pledges we made in Cairo for Gaza, where you can be sure the European Union pledges all translated into financing. So when we pledge, the money is there and the projects we have started to finance out of those pledges are already there. I and my team are ready to provide you with all the details about all the projects that are already in place. This allows us also to say to our partners in the region and in the world that we are doing our part, please do yours. Here I would call for you to help me in reaching out to parliaments all over the world and asking them also to do their part in what is a humanitarian duty that we all collectively share.

Two months ago we were discussing this and other issues relating to Latin America together in the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and I agreed at that time with many of you that only dialogue and cooperation among institutions could end the crisis and serve the real interests of the citizens of Venezuela. Since then, only two months, we have seen how badly the current political situation is impacting on the social and economic picture of the country.  Venezuela is a country with rich human and natural resources. It has the potential to be among the leading nations in Latin America and in spite of that, the people of Venezuela are suffering from violence, a world record in daily murders and random kidnappings. They are suffering permanent shortages of food, basic goods, most medicines and medical care. Water is scarce and no longer guarantees the former sanitary standards. Even electricity is subject to frequent rationing while Venezuela is, as we all know, the fifth largest exporter of petroleum in the world. Inflation rates are among the highest in the world. The economy is contracting at an impressive pace. Beyond the economic situation we are all aware, and I know how important this is for this Chamber, of the restrictions on civil liberties, the media situation, the situation of many of the opposition leaders, some of them in prison awaiting trial. Our institutions, and I personally, have regularly highlighted the violations of fundamental freedoms and urged respect for due process of law.  A country faced with so many challenges needs first and foremost functioning institutions at the service of their people. As you know, the clash between the government and the parliament is blocking any serious attempt to tackle the crisis and address the citizens’ needs; and the stalemates cannot curb violence or slow down the inflation. These are the solutions the voters asked for, and these are the solutions that the people of Venezuela need. The European Union is obviously distant geographically, but not politically. We are not a distant observer. On the contrary, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans hold a European passport as dual nationals. Many European companies which have invested in the country, generating jobs and growth, although they struggle to hold on in the current situation are there. Many are owed large debts by the States. I also want to add that we have an interest in avoiding a spillover of tensions into neighbouring countries and here I immediately think of Colombia, which could soon come out of a long painful conflict; it really does not need a destabilised country on its border.  So the question is how can we help Venezuela and its citizens? Parliament’s three resolutions adopted since spring 2014 emphasised that the crisis can only be overcome by peaceful and constructive dialogue in full respect of human rights and the Venezuelan Constitution. This is not about interfering in Venezuela’s domestic affairs, but we have a duty to offer our Venezuelan friends all the help they might need and want towards a peaceful solution of the crisis. We do so as friends. We want to see Venezuela thrive again. I really hope that the country’s leaders will accept a helping, friendly hand, because in extraordinary times like these, it would be only natural and normal to do so. We have been discussing the situation in the country with many international and regional partners, from the UN to the Organization of American States to UNASUR, with neighbouring countries, with Vatican diplomacy, and the message we are all passing on is that both the government and the parliament should move towards a more cooperative attitude. Whatever the solution to the crisis will be, the people of Venezuela need their institutions to address the security situation and to put the economy back on track.  This goes beyond ideologies and political systems. This is about serving the people of Venezuela, the only source of legitimacy of all elected institutions in the country. With no dialogue at all among different forces, the situation can only get worse. This is something that no one can afford either inside or outside of the country. Neither the majority, nor the opposition government nor parliament. The people of Venezuela are calling for action, all of them, regardless of their political views. They deserve a country that can guarantee them a normal life. And political leaders, all of them, have a duty to answer their call. We, at the level of the European Union, are always ready to support, and I am sure that this Parliament will support our efforts in this respect.

Since then, the food crisis, the medical crisis and the energy crisis have added to the political crisis and the economic crisis. Today a Venezuelan worker needs eighteen times the minimum wage to make the purchase for a week. In supermarkets it is impossible to find the essentials, such as milk powder, such as PAN flour, as diapers. Venezuela's citizens have to endure six-, seven- or eight-hour queues in order to get to a place where they sell something, with the question of whether there will be anything left to sell or whether they will have enough money to buy it. 80% of medicines and 50% of doctors are missing from hospitals. Because half of the doctors have left Venezuela and those who are still practicing there are doing so in conditions of war, without having the necessary to be able to care for patients. And this in a country that was rich. This in a country that had a phone before Spain had it, which had electricity before it was held by Spain, which had heating and air conditioning before Spain had them, which had cars before Spain had them. Other times, in this House, we have asked them for freedom, dignity, human rights for some country, even for Venezuela. Today we come here to ask for something different: in addition to freedom and freedom for political prisoners, bread and medicine. Even the Catholic Church is not allowed to distribute food in Venezuela today. We are on the brink of a social crisis and we have to do everything we can to prevent it. Venezuela inevitably walks towards disaster and in our hands it is that it does not happen.

I believe that, indeed, in Venezuela we are in a very delicate and very serious time. Everything you have described I share, but we have two institutions, both with a legitimate source of power: Parliament, on the one hand — last year's December elections - and the Government with its President, which also comes from a legitimate election by the Venezuelan people. And the two institutions don't collaborate. Here's the problem.  Unfortunately, political war is taking time. Both of you. I don't know if I'm the one to judge who has the responsibility. My view is that it is true that Venezuela lacks freedoms and it is true that the powers of the House under the sovereign mandate given to it by the people last December are probably not being respected. This is very likely to be the case, but the political question is what does Europe do? What do we do to help the Venezuelan people who cannot continue in this situation? And my answer is, like yours, to help ensure that there is a political agreement between Government and Parliament, between Presidency and Assembly, so that they can solve the problems of Venezuelans, and they must understand each other, respect the powers and agree on emergency economic solutions.

As supermarket shelves lie empty, a two-day week for the public sector workers has been imposed to conserve energy and government hand-outs grind to a halt, the situation in Venezuela is dire. In this respect, Venezuela has become a poster child for the populist, corrupt, crony, socialist ideology of Mr Chávez. Hugo Chávez’s mix of government giveaways and bloating of the public sector in a bid to cling to power for nearly two decades, whilst enriching himself and those around him, has clearly been an unmitigated disaster for that South American country.  Today, we catch on as a successor Maduro seeks to build on that legacy, only this time lacking both the oil market high prices and the charisma. As is only inevitable, economic crises are leading to political crisis, and with increasing calls now for Maduro to go, the country appears to be heading in a disastrous direction. Only this week, we saw the assassination of the opposition UNT leader German Mavare. As this all unfolds, it is difficult not to look at neighbouring Colombia and reflect on the economic and security achievements of that democracy, seen there without the high oil price advantages afforded to Venezuela.

Look, Mrs Mogherini, the last time I spoke in this House about the situation in Venezuela, I advocated an amnesty law and then for the dialogue and reconciliation between an opposition that won the Assembly outright and a Presidency of the Republic that barricades itself in Miraflores. What's happened since then? For, in the face of the call to dialogue, the Bolivarian regime sends thugs to beat the Secretary-General of the MUD, Mr. Torrealba, in a cowardly manner; that political prisoners are still in the dungeons and new cases are opened up against them and against the students, who are wanted to be criminalized; that the amnesty law is rejected by a judiciary that lacks all independence and equanimity; and that the Venezuelan people see their calamities increase and that their shortcomings are bordering on a humanitarian emergency. And in this situation, what to do? The opposition has initiated a collection of signatures for a revocation referendum process to remove President Maduro from the presidency. The process is constitutional and, although citizens know that verification of their signatures will serve, as was the case in the day, to draw up a blacklist in the totalitarian way of Cuban political commissioners, people are coming to the tables to sign, and in a few days 1,500,000 people have done so. To all this, the claims of freedom for political prisoners, the demands of democracy, President Maduro will call it \"interference\", deny us legitimacy and insult the President of the Government of Spain again, with the communist applause and complicit silence of his podemite partners.

Many of you mentioned the need to encourage dialogue in the framework of the respect of the will of the people, which is the source of legitimacy for any of the institutions of the country. This will mean encouraging and continuously calling on all actors to engage in a constructive dialogue among institutions and, on our side, standing ready to support in any possible useful way. I believe this is – and I see this as a common situation, a common analysis among us – as the best possible way, in connection and in coordination with regional and international actors, to address the difficult internal situation of the country, both from the political perspective and from an economic and security situation. Again, I would stress that the only way forward is overcoming institutional confrontation and finding ways to serve the citizens of Venezuela, which have expressed themselves clearly and deserve a normal situation and a normal life.

Once again, I wonder if there is a specific reason why these strategic debates always take place in the night sessions. I hope this is not a political sign.  We all know that the lack of progress towards peace, especially in the Holy Land, is always a prelude to a new escalation, and this is why we need to keep focusing on the two-state solution, even when Israel and Palestine do not make the headlines. This is a consistent, constant EU effort to work in that direction because we all know that, on the ground, the viability of a two—state solution is challenged on a daily basis and it is our key interest and also it is our political duty to keep it alive and possible in concrete terms. The expansion of settlements challenges the two-state solution. So does the growing trend of demolitions and confiscations of Palestinian structures, including those funded by the European Union and Member States. The same goes for the worsening living conditions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  Let me be very clear from the outset. Demolitions and Israel’s settlement policy are not the only challenges to the two-state solution. Unfortunately, we see many different challenges taking place on the ground. Terrorist attacks and hate speech challenge the two states and the possibility of people living side by side. The lack of Palestinian unity challenges the two states and their political perspective. A growing sense of disillusionment and despair on both sides among the people is a powerful enemy of peace.  So we always need to keep in mind the bigger picture, even when we focus – as we do tonight, because this is the issue on which you decided to focus our debate tonight – on one specific element of this bigger picture that is not encouraging for many different reasons and on many different aspects. But that still does not prevent us from continuing to work every single day for the two-state solution. Today, your focus is on settlements and on the issue of demolitions. Israel’s decisions to declare more parts of Area C as state land pave the way for further settlement activity and, as you know, settlements are illegal under international law, and the European Union always refers to them in this way and restates this position.  The European Council has stated several times that our Union opposes Israel’s settlement policy. We oppose a separation barrier built beyond the 1967 line. We oppose demolitions and confiscations, evictions, forced transfers, including of Bedouins, illegal outposts, settler violence and – let me remind all of us – we oppose all forms of violence on all sides, as I mentioned before, and we oppose the restrictions of movement and access.  This is not simply because we care about international law (which we do) and respect for it (which we do), but also because these actions directly reduce the Palestinians’ ability to use the land in Area C, something which is vital to development and growth in the West Bank and to the viability of the Palestinian economy. Israel, as an occupying power, has a duty to protect the Palestinian population and to facilitate its socioeconomic well-being.  You all know that the European Union is doing a lot to promote development and improve humanitarian conditions in Palestine. However, as a result of planning policies applied by Israel, projects funded by the European Union and Member States in Area C are often deemed illegal under Israeli law and are therefore demolished or threatened with demolition by the Israeli authorities.  EU humanitarian aid always respects the principles of neutrality and impartiality. We follow the humanitarian imperative of giving support to the most vulnerable, whenever and wherever this is needed, so where humanitarian projects are concerned, it is not conceivable for us to ask for prior authorisation from the Israeli authorities. It is our humanitarian duty. In the first quarter of this year, some 500 houses and other structures were demolished, and 650 people displaced. Approximately 20% of those structures were EU-funded. We are raising the issue with Israel in our regular dialogue, and we have established a specific consultation mechanism with Israel to discuss obstacles to the two-state solution and to the socioeconomic development of the Palestinians, including the issue of settlements and the issue of demolitions in Area C.  These mechanisms were used most recently last month on this particular matter of demolitions and dislocations and the issue was also highlighted in the Council conclusions we adopted last January. Tangible results have so far been very limited. Member States have agreed to continue the dialogue for six more months while pushing for an immediate moratorium on adverse developments in Area C, especially demolitions and confiscations. We are also engaging with Member States to agree common messages on this issue, including on the possible restitution or compensation for the confiscated or demolished EU assets. Demolition of a house or a humanitarian project has of course a very strong economic impact on those involved, and also on us, but this is not just about money and we know this very well: this is about the present for the people and the future of the political settlements.  We also know very well that only a serious and meaningful peace process can lead us out of the current downward spiral. There is an urgent need to improve the situation on the ground, and at the same time we have to keep an eye on the goal. Again, let me conclude on the bigger picture, because we are focusing tonight on one aspect which is important, relevant and serious, but we have to keep focused on the bigger picture. This is something you normally ask of me, but tonight I will be asking this of you.  We continue to work on a daily basis on two states living side by side, in peace and in security, to end the conflict and all claims. You know that we are working on the report of the Quartet together with the United States, Russia and the United Nations. The Quartet report will address these issues and will also include some substantial recommendations for the way forward, and I will be very glad to discuss the report with you in the coming weeks in one of the next part-sessions, because we know very well that what is key is working at the concrete perspective of the two states and how to put that in place in the near future.  I know this sounds like a daydream today, but we need to keep that daydream alive and to turn it into reality. We know very well, as Europeans at least, that this is the only way out of the cycle that we are seeing today, and we are stubbornly working in that direction.  I know that I can count on you and on your support to do this as we focus on the parts of the problem we are seeing, but let me ask you, at one of the next part-sessions, to come back to the process itself and the European Union’s contribution, through the Quartet report, to other initiatives that are also in place and being coordinated , such as the French initiative to hold an international conference, in coordination with the work we are doing in the Quartet, on our contribution to solve the crisis in the Middle East and to revitalise the political peace process to get to a two-state solution.

Mr President, Madam High Representative, thank you for this presentation of the issue before us this evening: demolitions in the West Bank. The reality is that the problem is complicated. Indeed, under the interim Oslo agreements to which Europe is a party, Area C, where these demolitions were carried out, remains under Israel's administrative military responsibility. The Israeli authorities point out that these are illegal constructions. On the other hand, as you probably know, as you have pointed out, Israel has repeatedly criticised the European Union, saying that it is financing constructions that are illegal and which aim to create de facto realities in violation of the Oslo agreements. In any case, they insist that projects funded in Area C must be coordinated with Israel. Since I understand, from the various press reports I have seen, that the Council is preparing a strategy on the issue of demolitions that may include the idea of compensation, perhaps we should first of all think about this necessary coordination with the Israelis? This coordination already exists at the bilateral level between the State of Israel and some Member States, but it might be a good thing to expand it. With regard to the broader perspective, I find that, of course, in order to restart the peace process, trust is an indispensable element. However, I believe that the Israelis in recent months feel that it is the lack of trust that is being put forward, they are told: \"We do not want to work with you.\" This is really unfortunate because Israel is still the only democracy in the region, we must not forget it. I know that the far left does not agree with that at all and wants to support terrorists.

The demolitions of projects financed by the European Union – or also by the European Union – are recurring and the time has come to do something to prevent this, because every demolition practically demolishes the bricks of an edifice called 'peace and two-state solution'. It is important, not only because it is a waste of European citizens' money, but also to avoid the continued displacement of Palestinian families living in these areas and to ensure that European assistance goes effectively to those in need.  In the absence of a political agreement, humanitarian assistance remains imperative, but has limited potential. That is why the Union's main objective remains to bring the peace process back on the agenda, as you pointed out a few moments ago. It is necessary to support the viability of two-state solution as the only solution to end the longest conflict in the region.  That said, Israel has an obligation to comply with the rules of international humanitarian law and to halt the expansion of the colonization of these areas.

Madam High Representative, you yourself have outlined the framework. We are, of course, only talking about one fact today, and these are the destruction of projects financed by the European Union. We could indeed talk about many other things, but let us stick to the subject.  The European Union is an ally of Israel and we all know that. But while we are talking about stopping the destruction, there have never been so many projects destroyed. According to UN figures, 75 buildings and structures financed by Europe and EU Member States were destroyed in the first quarter of this year, which is probably only a fraction of what was actually destroyed. Everything seems - and I am very careful now - that it is a systematic policy against the Palestinians. In this way, of course, we will never achieve the two-state solution that we all so firmly support. Schools, playgrounds, wells, solar panels, everything is destroyed. It doesn't go in with me. Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, we, the European Union, we have all given our support. But this is being destroyed with military arrogance. In the meantime, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of euros. For Belgium alone, we are talking about almost 150 000 euros. We know people are being bullied away. We know that 400 children have become homeless since this year. And yet here it remains quiet again in Europe.  Mrs Mogherini, Europe must ask that international humanitarian law be respected by both sides – let us be clear. Both sides must therefore respect it.

EU-funded projects are destroyed at a pace like never before. What is illegal is not schools built by the European Union; what is illegal are the weapons and bulldozers that destroy them. But with your statement here today, it seems to me that what you are doing is to raise minutes of failure, not your staff, yes to the European Union. I was there too, in the Bedouin camps. I am not surprised at General Dov Sedaka's recent statement, when he said that the solution for Bedouins is not to regularize their status, but to demolish their camps and move them to Palestinian-controlled Zones A and B. Today, the European Union silently allows the continued deployment of new settlements, openly at odds with international law. What are we going to do? Endorse apartheid impunity or act...?

I wish that could have been possible. I do not put limits on what could happen in the next three and a half years of my mandate – hopefully we will manage to move forward – but this tells us a lot about the fact that we have to keep focused and consistent in what we are doing. The European Union has a special role to play in the Middle East, not only because we are the first donor to the Palestinians and not only because we are the first trading partner to the Israelis, but because we are, I would be tempted to say, the only political actor that is constantly and so passionately focusing on this conflict – let us say that we are among the few in the world doing that – and because we have a special role that comes from our history and our geography. That is why I am a little saddened every time that we have a debate on Israel and Palestine in this Hemicycle, when I see that we easily divide ourselves between those who take one side and those who take the other side. I will be very clear on our principles, our firm positions and our firm actions. I believe that they are not negotiable and they are our strengths, but I also believe that we have to keep clear in our minds what our role is. Our role is that of trying to build bridges, trying to encourage those who still, inside Palestine and inside Israel and inside their societies, inside their political camps – and there are fewer and fewer by the day unfortunately – believe that peace can only result from Israelis and Palestinians working together and living together. This was self-evident in the time of the Oslo Agreement. I am of the generation that grew up politically with the Oslo narrative. I see very clearly that today we are facing the risk of generations of Israelis and Palestinians growing up – not only politically but in their own societies – considering this not to be normal, the idea of Israelis and Palestinians working together for peace.  I think that, as Europeans and as Europeans in institutions, we have a special responsibility in trying to help and in trying to facilitate. That is why I would like to thank those of you who took part in the Parliamentarians for Peace initiative, bringing together MEPs and members of the Israeli and Palestinian Parliaments to try and encourage them to bring forward an agenda for peace together because we are – and I remember that we have already discussed this, exactly in these terms, on another occasion in recent months – those who do not see problems but, on the contrary, see it as natural to say that we can – and we must – be friends of the Palestinian people and friends of the Israeli people. There is no contradiction in that because, as friends, we can advise, we can encourage and we can push – sometimes with more diplomatic words, sometimes with a tougher insistences – them to come together on the way towards peace. Indeed, some of you said that we have to preserve the confidence of the parties in the role of the European Union. I want to share with you – especially as a colleague mentioned the lack of confidence on the Israeli side – something that happened yesterday that to me was very important. The President of Israel, President Rivlin, came to the Europe Day celebration in the delegation of the European Union in Israel and passed on extremely positive and encouraging messages about the fact that, even on the things on which we do not see eye to eye, we can work hand in hand to move forward. I think that we have to pay attention to these kinds of messages and try to work on building bridges. Having said that – which is our political responsibility – our policy is crystal clear and evident to both the Israelis and the Palestinians. Time and again, we have demonstrated that there is a European unity on this position so that any attempt to divide Member States or institutions of the European Union does not work. I mentioned a few of the issues that are clear and firm for us: clearly, the fact that we oppose any kind of violence and hate speech, clearly, the fact that we oppose the settlement policy and, clearly, the fact that we consider our projects, funded by the European Union budget and by the Member States budget, as taking place under the humanitarian imperative. Our aid always respects the principles of neutrality and impartiality. As I mentioned, we follow the humanitarian imperative of giving support to the most vulnerable, whenever, whatever and wherever this is needed, and this is something we will not give up. This is our firm principle and our firm practice. We are also – as I mentioned in the beginning, but I noticed that many of you raised this so I will mention it again – working with the Member States on the steps forward, including on the possible restitution or compensation for confiscated or demolished EU assets. I stress that fact that we need to work, in this respect, together with all the Member States, building and keeping the unity of our Union because this is the point of strength that we have in every single step we take. Let me finish by saying that I really believe that the way forward for us is investing in the mechanisms and structures that we have in order to work together in a constant dialogue, both with the Palestinian Authority and with the Israeli authorities. That is why when some of you asked me for an assessment of the mechanisms we have put in place, I was very glad that we managed to put in place these mechanisms because, especially when you have difficult problems to discuss, you need institutional frameworks to do so in transparency, in clarity, in respect and with firm positions which sometimes we do not share with our Israeli friends. As many of you mentioned, the real point will be our capacity to bring forward the agenda for peace, which means the agenda for the two states. That might not mean the creation of two states in the next year and a half – I cannot promise that – but what I can tell you is that the work we are doing with the Quartet – which, I would like to remind you, a year and a half ago when we took office was basically not operative – is up and running , with the production and the work on the report that I also mentioned which will include substantial references to this issue in accordance with the work that we are doing with the US, the UN and Russia and in connection with some of the Arab countries, our partners, especially on the Arab peace initiative elements and including some elements of recommendation that , at that stage, the international community could put forward to the parties. Again, there is no magic wand and there is no magic solution that from one day to the next can create the two states but, when I see the trend of work that we have revitalised, re-energised, restarted in the last year and a half, together with our partners in the international community, I am confident of the fact that this could lead us , together with the parties, to some positive developments. I know that saying this today can seem very, very optimistic, but I think that if we are not guided by the hope of changing things, we will never manage to change things for real. So again I ask you to come together, as much as you can, in your efforts to facilitate this work, knowing that we have a special responsibility to the Palestinians and to the Israelis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1833, "date": "2016-05-10.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.
