In keeping with the spirit of the leaders’ agenda, presented by President Tusk, they are determined to engage more directly on politically sensitive issues. Brexit discussions will undoubtedly get the most visibility, and I will get to that in a moment, but there will be other important discussions for future work at the EU level that I will start with. The formal meeting of the European Council will be dedicated to security and defence, the social dimension, education and culture. As you know, leaders keep a close eye on developments in the field of defence to make sure that political ambition is turned into concrete action. This approach has yielded results. It is fair to say that we have made more progress in the last 12 months than in the last 10 years. The most visible example is the launching of the permanent structured enhanced cooperation (PESCO) and leaders will mark the occasion when they meet tomorrow. Against the background of the recently agreed new proposals for further joint work, leaders will exchange views on EU-NATO cooperation with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They will also use the occasion to review other work strands including the European Defence Fund and its European Defence Industrial Development Programme. The adoption of the programme regulation by the co-legislators is now a matter of priority. The Council’s mandate has just been adopted, on 12 December. Leaders will then turn to the social dimension of the EU as well as education and culture. Leaders will adopt forward-looking conclusions in all three topics, building on last month’s fruitful discussions in Gothenburg. The debate taking place over the dinner at 28 will be informal as per the leaders’ agenda working method. President Tusk considers that a serious political discussion is needed to pave the way forward on the external and the internal dimension of migration. It will be important to look at what has and what has not worked over the past two years and draw the necessary lessons for establishing an effective and sustainable migration policy. There will be no written output from the debate because the aim of the discussion is first and foremost to foster a shared understanding of the main issues ahead, as a basis for further work in the first half of 2018. On Friday morning, the heads of the 25 Member States who have ratified the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, joined by the Czech Republic and Croatia as observers, will discuss the future of the Economic and Monetary Union and the Banking Union. The Presidents of the Eurogroup, the Commission and the European Central Bank will take part as well. The aim of the leaders’ discussion will be to scope the priority issues on which work should proceed rapidly and to give a tasking to the Eurogroup and Ecofin to follow this up. To facilitate an open and political exchange of views, there will be no written statement afterwards. Now I turn to the state of play of negotiations with the UK. After breakfast on Friday, the European Council will meet in its Article 50 format, that is at 27. We are getting very close to sufficient progress on the three Phase 1 issues, thanks to intensive work in the past month. At the October European Council, our assessment was that sufficient progress had not been achieved and it was too early to move to Phase 2. Now, I believe that we are there. The UK’s new improved offer which Prime Minister May presented last week looks like a solid agreement, and accordingly our chief negotiator Michel Barnier has presented a positive assessment for Friday’s European Council. I would like to use this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for your work that has helped us to reach this point. This is a significant move from the UK, which I expect the EU 27 leaders to welcome. On Friday, the European Council, at 27, will adopt the guidelines with a view to possible transitional arrangements and on the framework for the future relationship. This, however, does not mean that we have finished with Phase 1 issues.

Mais les résultats sont là: le socle européen des droits sociaux, la coopération structurée permanente, une meilleure gestion européenne de la migration, des accords commerciaux avec le Canada et le Japon, et aussi la conclusion de la première phase des négociations sur le Brexit. Il était encore inimaginable, il y a trois ans, que les trois institutions européennes et les vingt-huit États membres proclament ensemble un socle européen des droits sociaux lors du premier sommet social organisé par l’Europe depuis ces vingt dernières années. Je me souviens aussi des regards perplexes lorsque la Commission a proposé de réveiller la belle endormie du traité de Lisbonne, la coopération structurée permanente, et que les États membres coopèrent davantage sur des projets communs en matière de défense. Personne n’y croyait alors.  Aujourd’hui, pas moins de vingt-cinq États membres se sont engagés dans cette voie. Les premiers projets qui feront vivre cette nouvelle coopération, en matière de cyberdéfense, de commandement médical ou de logistique commune, ont dès à présent été identifiés. La Commission a proposé un Fonds européen de défense pour donner un sérieux coup de boost aux investissements de recherche et de développement commun en matière de défense. Je suis heureux qu’hier, juste à temps pour le Conseil européen, les États membres soient parvenus à un accord, à une approche générale, sur cette proposition. La Commission compte maintenant sur le soutien de ce Parlement et nous invitons les États membres à présenter des projets pour que nous puissions démarrer les financements dès le début de 2019. Ce sont des idées que Jean—Claude Juncker et sa Commission défendaient depuis des années, mais ces idées sont maintenant finalement en bonne voie de concrétisation. L’avenir de notre Union, c’est aussi celui de la zone euro. Les deux vont ensemble, ce sont deux réalités indissociables.  Natürlich verleihen uns auch der robuste Aufschwung und die niedrige Arbeitslosigkeit Wind in den Segeln. Deshalb ist es unser Auftrag, Europas Zukunft und damit auch die des Euro selbst in die Hand zu nehmen. Das heißt konkret: Wir müssen die wirtschaftliche Schönwetterlage nutzen, um unsere Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion stärker, effizienter und handlungsfähiger zu machen. Die Kommission hat deshalb in der vergangenen Woche einen Fahrplan vorgelegt. Dieser Fahrplan enthält die wichtigen Etappen zur Vertiefung der Bankenunion, der Kapitalmarktunion und der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion. Von ersten Entscheidungen im Juni bis hin nach Sibiu (Rumänien). Dort werden wir bei einem Gipfel vor den Europawahlen 2019 wichtige Entscheidungen zur Zukunft Europas treffen. Der Fahrplan soll dafür sorgen, dass der Euro weiterhin sein Stabilitätsversprechen einhält, und gleichzeitig die Länder unserer Union enger vereinen. So gewinnen alle Mitglieder Stärke und Handlungsfähigkeit. Um das zu erreichen, müssen wir dringend die Bankenunion vollenden und Fortschritte dabei machen, Risiken parallel einzudämmen und zu teilen. Entgegen anderen Behauptungen haben wir bereits viel getan, um Risiken zu reduzieren. So haben die Banken in der EU ihre Kapitalquote seit der Krise fast verdoppelt, und der Anteil notleidender Kredite geht ebenfalls kontinuierlich zurück. Die Kommission hat vor einem Jahr weitere Maßnahmen vorgelegt, um Bankrisiken zu reduzieren, und ich hoffe, dass dieses Haus und die Mitgliedstaaten zügig zustimmen.  Mit dem Paket der vergangenen Woche haben wir außerdem vorgeschlagen, den back stop für den einheitlichen Abwicklungsmechanismus einsatzbereit zu machen. Etwas, worauf sich die Mitgliedstaaten übrigens im Prinzip schon 2013 geeinigt hatten.  Wie viele von ihnen bin auch ich uch davon überzeugt, dass ein gemeinsamer Währungsraum im Laufe der Zeit auch ein gemeinsames Einlagensicherungssystem haben muss. Genauso dringlich ist es, dass wir die Kapitalmarktunion vollenden, denn gut integrierte Kapitalmärkte stellen nicht nur sicher, dass Risiken über private Finanzkanäle geteilt werden, sondern sie sind auch einer der effizientesten Wege, Fortschritte bei der Risikoeindämmung zu machen. Mit den Initiativen zur Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion wollen wir auch bereits existierende Strukturen stärken und nicht neue Strukturen schaffen. Hier geht es nicht um einen Machtkampf, sondern um mehr europäische Effizienz. Indem wir etwa den Europäischen Stabilitätsmechanismus schrittweise zu einem Europäischen Währungsfonds ausbauen, werden wir Europäer selbst handlungsfähiger.  Wir helfen uns auch selbst, wenn wir die Mitgliedstaaten bei den notwendigen Reformen unterstützen. So stellt die Kommission eigens Strukturreformspezialisten zur Verfügung, um Verbesserungen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt, im Gesundheits- und im sozialen Bereich oder beim Management öffentlicher Haushalte umzusetzen. Dieses Haus hat schon lange gefordert, dass wir den Fiskalpakt in EU-Recht überführen. Wenn wir das nun tun, werden wir ein besonderes Augenmerk darauf legen, nationale Haushaltsverantwortung und Solidarität miteinander in Einklang zu bringen. Je robuster und erfolgreicher unsere gemeinsame Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion ist, desto mehr Schutz und Chancen, Arbeitsplätze und Wachstum schafft sie für die Menschen. Deshalb setze ich in dieser Frage ganz besonders auf Ihre Unterstützung. Sie sind das Parlament der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion. The next year will be critical in shaping our future. This is why I am delighted that President Juncker, together with President Tajani and Prime Minister Ratas, will tomorrow sign the new Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities for 2018. The Joint Declaration will help focus all our minds on the issues where we can make the biggest difference and show real results to citizens, ahead of the European elections.  Nowhere is this more important than in migration, an issue on the Leaders’ Agenda this week. We need a comprehensive European approach, including much more than just border management and support to Africa, but also solidarity within the European Union and preserving the Schengen Area of free movement. I firmly disagree with the statement that relocation as an emergency response has been ineffective. Over 32 000 people have been relocated. That is over 90% of all those eligible. Migration is an issue that will stay with us for generations, and we have to be ready for a possible next crisis. So let me be clear: all building blocks of our comprehensive approach are needed. Take one brick out and the whole edifice crumbles. Temporary internal borders may become permanent, with lasting damage also to the internal market. This Parliament has adopted its position on the Dublin reform. It is now time for leaders to unblock the stalemate in Council and strike the right balance between solidarity and responsibility. (Applause) Let the Treaty lead. What is up to co-legislators should be left in the hands of co-legislators, and not ‘returned’ to Member States. We will either find a European solution to the migration challenge, or there will be no solution.  (Applause) Only by getting the reform of the Dublin Regulation done will we be able to get back to Schengen. This cannot be left on the shoulders of a few Member States. Every single Member State will have to do its measure and show solidarity to the Union as a whole. We must also urgently improve the conditions of migrants in detention camps in Libya. At the African Union—EU Summit in Abidjan, leaders agreed to work in concert with the United Nations to save and protect lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and, in particular, inside Libya.  I want to briefly mention the successful conclusion of the final discussions of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. Last Friday, the negotiators concluded the talks for the biggest bilateral trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union. The Economic Partnership Agreement will remove most of the EUR 1 billion of duties paid annually by EU companies exporting to Japan. It will also open up the Japanese market of 127 million consumers to key EU agricultural exports. It will increase EU export opportunities in a range of other sectors. With this partnership, Europe and Japan send a powerful message in defence of open, fair and rules-based trade. Now let us do the necessary to submit the agreement for approval to you, the European Parliament, and to the EU Member States, so that our companies and citizens can start exploiting its full potential before the end of the mandate of this Commission.  Mr President, with your permission I would now like to pass the floor to Michel Barnier to enlighten us on the Article 50 negotiations.

This is an important step, there will be many more to take, but this agreement is important because with this joint and detailed report (96 paragraphs, 15 pages), we are dealing upstream with the difficult subjects of separation. that the UK wanted. If the European Council so wishes, taking into account your own resolution, this first step will allow us to consider the continuation of the negotiations in a more relaxed manner. We also affirm the stability of our continent. In a world - as we all know - uncertain, our Union must be able to find rational solutions with the United Kingdom and must then, or at the same time, be able to concentrate and concentrate its energy on all initiatives and all challenges that we have to face together and that Frans Timmermans has just mentioned on behalf of the European Commission. We are also sending a message of confidence to a lot of people, to a lot of actors, to a lot of citizens who are worried, sometimes even anxious, over the UK's decision to leave the European Union. In this negotiation - I have said this often among you - our state of mind has never been to make mutual concessions. It was not about making concessions on the rights of citizens. It was not a question of making concessions on the peace and stability process in Ireland, nor even of making concessions with regard to the thousands of project promoters who are financed by policies and by the European budget. I know that this line has always been shared by Parliament and also by the Advice. The agreement that was reached on Friday owes a lot - I mean it, Matti - to the permanent cooperation with the Council, with the Member States. This agreement owes a lot to your constant and demanding support, ladies and gentlemen. I would like, President Tajani, to thank you and sincerely thank you at this stage - we are not at the end of the road - your coordinator Guy Verhofstadt, the members of the Brexit steering group, which you have created, Elmar Brok , Roberto Gualtieri, Danuta Maria Hübner, Gabriele Zimmer and Philippe Lamberts, the presidents of your political groups and also the presidents of the committees, with whom I will continue to work. I would like to talk about the main points of our agreement. I would also recall that the objective which your Assembly and the European Council had set for me at this stage was, on an objective basis, to achieve sufficient progress. \"Sufficient progress\" does not mean 100%, but real sufficient progress, that is, sufficiently specific progress that commits and forms a solid basis for the continuation of our negotiations. It is this positive assessment that - Frans Timmermans could put it better than I - the European Commission and its President, Jean-Claude Juncker, have had on this joint report. The political commitments which were made at the highest level on Friday and which we have translated very precisely in the joint report seem to me - I say this with full responsibility - to meet these conditions. I want to be very clear on this point, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would never have presented this joint report in my responsibility as a negotiator if it were not the opportunity to act and take note, with the Kingdom United, real progress to secure the rights of citizens, to secure the promoters of projects financed by the European budget and to secure the peace process in Ireland and conditions of North-South cooperation. We will not accept any backtracking from this joint report. This progress has been recorded and will have to be quickly translated into a legally binding withdrawal agreement on each of our three subjects and on a few others as well which remain to be negotiated or clarified. This is one of the conditions for the successful continuation of negotiations. At the start of this plenary debate, I would like to focus primarily on the subject that has been our common priority from the start: citizens' rights. Four and a half million European citizens, whom you represent, have decided to live on the other side of the Channel or with us on the basis of Union law, which allows the free movement of people. Our joint report preserves their rights. It guarantees that all EU citizens who arrived in the UK and all UK citizens who arrived in the EU before the UK withdrawal date will be able to continue to live as today with safeguards applied without discrimination for nationality and for the duration of their stay. their life. This means, for example, that a citizen of the mainland or the United Kingdom who has chosen to live on either side of the Channel will be able to continue to reside there after Brexit. This right of residence will even be extended in relation to the existing law. If this citizen decides to return to his country and, therefore, is absent from the United Kingdom or from another country, he may return and regain his rights after a period of absence of a maximum of five years, against two years only today. A British student in one of the countries of the Union will not suffer the effects of Brexit. She will be able to continue her studies, pay the same tuition fees as the citizens of the country where she studies and even work there after her studies. This obviously applies to all European students in the UK. Nurses or doctors on duty before Brexit may continue to work in their host country. Their professional qualifications will remain recognized, as will be the case for other professions. Family members will retain their right to reunite with loved ones in the future, post Brexit, in the UK or in the EU. All children will be protected, even those born after Brexit. Citizens will retain their rights to health care, pensions and other social security benefits, even if they leave their host country for another country in the Union. This also applies to a point that was under debate until the last moment: the portability of rights to family allowances. I want to be also clear on the implementation of these rights. The Withdrawal Agreement will take precedence over national law, whether British, French, Slovak or Maltese. The guarantees it contains will be directly invoked by the citizens concerned throughout their lives. Finally, there will be no ambiguity about the interpretation of these rights on one side or the other of the Channel. Current case law of the Court of Justice will be part of the agreement and future case law that needs to be built will apply. UK courts will have to take it duly into account - this is what is written in the report - throughout the lives of the citizens concerned as well. Finally, the British authorities have planned to create an independent authority which can be seized by European citizens in the United Kingdom, just as British citizens can seize the European Commission with their rights. This independent authority will be detailed in its functioning later in the Withdrawal Agreement. So, ladies and gentlemen, there is another issue when it comes to all European citizens - 3.5 million people - who currently live and work in the UK, which concerns the registration process that the UK demanded for citizens Europeans on its territory. It seems to me - I know your sensitivity and attention to this point - that this is an administrative step which will be practical and necessary to facilitate the effective exercise of rights. But we have obtained - and this is written in the attached report - that this condition of this administrative process is reflected in the withdrawal agreement with the necessary guarantees. This is indeed a registration or administrative procedures for these citizens with a country that will become a third country on March 29, 2019 at midnight or 11 p.m. London time. What we have foreseen in this joint report is that the procedure that the United Kingdom will put in place must be easy to use, based on objective criteria, accompanied by the same procedural guarantees as today, in particular in terms of recourse. EU citizens who are already permanent residents in the UK will be granted this special status free of charge. For the rest, the costs should not exceed those imposed on UK citizens for issuing similar documents, around £ 70. But I want to repeat that the conditions of this administrative procedure - which the British authorities have demanded - will be clarified. You can check their simplicity in the Withdrawal Agreement itself, which will be submitted to you for ratification. Ladies and gentlemen deputies, we are not at the end of the road neither on citizens' rights - I just said - nor on the other subjects of the orderly withdrawal, so we will remain vigilant. Theresa May got involved on behalf of the entire UK government. It is now up to us to decide whether this result is sufficient progress to open, under certain conditions, the second phase of negotiations. If your resolution goes in this direction and if the European Council also finds sufficient progress on Friday, I will, on your behalf, initiate the work of formal drafting of the Withdrawal Agreement - and we can do that fairly quickly on the basis of this joint report, among others. We will continue negotiations on all subjects where we still need to clarify, deepen, negotiate the governance of the future agreement, various subjects such as geographical indications, the question of data and then Ireland which will be the subject of a specific negotiation route. We must find specific solutions for Ireland, together, each in their own responsibility, to respond to a unique situation on the island. Depending on the decisions of the European Council, we will also move forward in defining a transitional period which will be short and structured during which we will maintain, with European policies, the entire architecture of regulation, supervision and, of course. , the role of the Court of Justice. Finally, we will continue - if you wish - our internal preparation at 27, with you too, on the future relationship; we have to agree among ourselves on the framework of this future relationship. But already - I say this clearly and quietly - there are points which will not be negotiable: neither the integrity of the single market, nor the four freedoms which are inseparable and are the foundation of the single market, nor the decision-making autonomy of the Union, which the United Kingdom has chosen to leave. The United Kingdom will become a third country on March 29, 2019. We believe that a close partnership in the future must remain our common horizon. We know where we are today and we know where we can go. I suggest today that you recognize that this step is important. We have many more steps to come to an orderly UK withdrawal, which is far better than a messy withdrawal. Thank you, at this stage, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the future as well, for your support and your confidence, but also of your vigilance on the future course of the negotiations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, a few days ago, the Mail on Sunday published an opinion poll: 50% of British people are in favor of a new referendum. (Heckling) The British people now realize that Brexit means losing many things but not gaining anything. Let me mention just one example, which was an interesting one: the debate in recent days in Britain about the decision of the Commission that British cities can no longer be European Capitals of Culture. (Heckling) A very easy message that you can understand, the British will lose a lot. And on the other hand, the European Member States understand that sticking together makes all of us much stronger. (Applause) I want to use Ireland as an example of this. Whereas the United Kingdom could easily set the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the recent negotiations have clearly demonstrated that Ireland is today much stronger because it belongs to the European Union. (Heckling and applause) We are all Irish: that is the main message, and we Europeans have secured Irish interests in the negotiations in the last few weeks. I want to underline two concrete points: one is that in this first phase, the idea was to create trust between Great Britain and the European Union. I have to say that the recent statement by David Davis about what this outcome now means practically was not helpful in securing this trust-building approach, so we ask the British Prime Minister to clarify by Thursday that the outcome of the first phase is binding on both sides, and is a basis for future talks in the second phase. For the second phase we have a key role to play. We finally decide about the withdrawal treaty and for my group, one thing is clear: we can only accept a kind of transitional period if we have a sufficient outcome from the second phase. Without a withdrawal treaty there will be no transitional period - that must be clear for next year, 2018. Dear colleagues, I would like to turn to a second topic because we are in the December meeting today. If we want to convince people of Europe, we have to talk about our successes, as Frans Timmermans did today. In 2017, the year just ended, we launched a total of 74 legislative acts. We have made progress on the Paris Climate Agreement, on the economic upswing for Europe, on CETA, and on other international trade agreements we have shown that we want to build bridges, not tear down bridges. Historic steps have been taken in defense. There has been progress to report on defense cooperation and also on social union. We deliver on the matter. That is the most important message to the citizens. If we want to convince them of Europe, we don't need theoretical debates - we need solutions to the matter. We have made great strides in this area over the past few months. For 2018 I would like to make it clear that one of the main issues is border security. We have to make it clear to the citizens of Europe that we can secure our own continent, especially when it comes to illegal migration. Ladies and gentlemen! The European way of life is one of the issues that concern my group very much. It is important to define and protect it, especially in uncertain times. Therefore, today, as a third thought, let me introduce a very fundamental thought, namely that I want to point out, especially now at Christmas time, that our continent has Christian roots. 75% of all EU citizens are Christians. My group is proud of this Christian heritage that Europe lives in our churches, but also in our traditions and in everyday life. If we look today at the basic structure of our continent, at the ideas of solidarity, at the ideas of subsidiarity, at the ideas of tolerance in dealing with one another, then many of these basic values are inconceivable without the Christian-Jewish roots of our continent.We should be aware of these foundations.Even non-Christians, including people who reject faith, will be happy in the next few days that Europe is standing still, that we can come to rest on this continent.The legacy that Christmas is practiced all over Europe means that our lives and also our annual course have structure.That is why I would like to conclude by saying that these values are important to us as a group, that we should always be aware of the basis of this continent and that we can be proud of it.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of Christian traditions, I recall that today is the day of Saint Lucia, the protector of sight, who helps our governments to see the urgency of decisions. I hear that we must wait for the formation of a government in Germany: today Germany, yesterday were the elections in France, tomorrow those in Italy. We are facing the dictatorship of the immediate, and the dictatorship of the immediate distances the vision of a stronger Europe, endowed with a true governance of the euro area, a Ministry of the Treasury and Finance, a capacity for managing migratory flows and asylum seekers. This time the Commission has put a concrete proposal on the table. We would have liked it to be more ambitious. I refer to the proposal on Economic and Monetary Union: we think, for example, that the logic of the fiscal compact should be overturned and not simply softened, but the proposal is there and also presents positive innovations, such as the establishment of a European monetary fund that can help states in difficulty. But all this must be translated into concrete decisions, and these decisions are firm because the Council has to wait. I say to President Tusk: go ahead, don't raise the flag as you are doing, for example, on mandatory refugee quotas, try to convince the member states, because this is your role, not that of raising the flag as a sign of resignation. We must proceed: let us set up a real ministry of finance, which is not only the guardian of the accounts, but which can lean on a budget line and help convergence between different economies, and which is accountable to this Parliament. On Brexit: we have done a good job, thanks to the negotiators in Parliament, to the steering group - I don't mention them all but we know them well - thanks to the European Commission, thanks to our friend chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Now, let's not lose the momentum, and I turn to the British Government: enough with the imprudent statements, such as that of David Davis, who called this agreement a simple statement of intent. Do we have to think that this also applies to the Irish border? In this case, Prime Minister May would have to explain it to his government allies. This agreement, as Barnier recalled, contains many positive steps forward, we have protected the rights of British and European citizens and their families, and at a time when many point to Europe as their stepmother, Europe has demonstrated to be a mother who ensures rights and opportunities. And the same anxieties of the citizens of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland bring back the role of a Union that dampens conflicts and brings peace, and also on the fears of trade unions and workers, on the risks of social and environmental dumping. , the European Union with the negotiations recalled that Europe, the European Union, remains a force that protects. Finally, I want to conclude by talking about the joint declaration of the three institutions. As Vice-President Timmermans recalled, there are positive elements in this declaration, also produced by our initiative as Socialists and Democrats. But we cannot fail to reiterate our dissatisfaction with other points that are missing: social issues, economic governance and own resources. And I know that this responsibility does not belong so much to Parliament as to the Council, once again the Council holding back on these things. And even more so, these missing priorities must be part of a strong political initiative, in the coming weeks and months, of the whole European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, after last week’s talks, we are finally looking to the future and no longer just looking back at the past. This is a positive step for all of those involved. I know that there will be people on both sides of the English Channel who may not have got everything that they wanted. For some, what was agreed was too much. For others, it will never be enough. But for so many of us in this Chamber, who know the everyday realities of trying to find a deal, we know that where there is compromise, there are concessions. I believe that the important progress that we saw last week was made when both sides sought to avoid a no-deal situation, when both sides understood the need for flexibility, and when both sides focused on building a better future rather than looking back at the past. I am aware that within this House there were a large number of people that hoped for a different result to the June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom, including from my own political group and from my own country of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Amongst those people are friendships I value and opinions I greatly respect, but my message to them is simple: Brexit will not change our common interests in trading with each other and with the rest of the world, in sharing intelligence to tackle terrorism and crime, in cooperating on security issues to keep our citizens safe. I was in Latvia a few weeks ago as they celebrated the 98th anniversary of the British Navy helping the Latvians to defeat the Bermont West Russian army. The Latvian politicians I spoke to stressed the importance of looking to the future and continued military cooperation with the UK through NATO, a future where the UK continues to work with individual European nations as well as continuing to work with the European Union as a whole. A future where the ECR Group, and the Members sat behind me, will continue to be a voice for a reformed Europe, a voice for those who believe in free enterprise, free and fair trade and competition, a voice for those who believe in the freedom of the individual, personal responsibility and greater democratic accountability, a voice for those who believe in respect and equitable treatment for all EU countries, new and old, large and small. I hope that, last week, the British Prime Minister and Donald Tusk laid the first foundations for the journey ahead. A future where the EU signs a mutually-beneficial trade agreement with the UK, as one of the world’s largest economies, but where we both make the case for open and free trade. A future which reduces the burdens on businesses, allowing them to create jobs, growth and prosperity in all our countries. A future where both the EU and the UK cooperate where we have common challenges to build a better future for all our citizens. I just wonder whether I could end on a personal note, in response to Manfred’s comments. Manfred, as a Muslim, I fully understand the Christian roots of Europe. But you must not confuse that with Europe being synonymous with Christendom. When I see the lack of diversity in European institutions, you have a long way to go to make those who are not standard white Christian European feel comfortable in Europe.

I do not understand it. Mr Kamall, you criticise the European Union and then you say you want to continue (a), (b), (c), (d), up to (z). We will see.  I want to come back to other unfortunate statements, such as that of the Brexit negotiator, Mr Davis who called – as I think Gianni has already said – the agreement a statement of intent. I spoke to him yesterday on the phone, and he assured me that it is absolutely not his intention, nor the intention of the UK Government, to backtrack on their commitments. I take note of that and I think the best way, Michel, to secure this is, in the coming weeks, to transpose all these commitments into the legal text of a withdrawal agreement. That is the best way to do it – not in the coming months but in the coming weeks, when we start the second phase of the negotiations. Talking about this withdrawal agreement, dear colleagues, especially on citizens’ rights, there are three outstanding issues, I think, that need to be solved in the withdrawal agreement.  First of all, there is the fact that residing citizens’ rights should also be granted to future partners. There is no reason why future partners of European citizens should not have the same rights as the rights that we have defined here.  Second, we also want full protection for UK citizens living in Europe. From the beginning, it has been Parliament’s point of view that if a UK citizen living on the continent has the right of residence or a work permit in one country, our opinion is that this permit and this right of residence is in fact valid in all 27 Member States. That is our view and I have to tell you that I sometimes have the impression that we care more about this than the whole British Government at the moment. It is our task, as the European Parliament, to defend these citizens, be they European citizens living in Britain or UK citizens living on the continent.  Thirdly, if you allow me, dear colleagues, the concrete procedure. I think that Michel Barnier has done a great job. All rights are protected now. This is very clear. All benefits also. The word ‘settled’ has been skipped because we are not settlers. Europeans living in in Britain are not settlers. That is very clear. That word has been skipped but there is a problem with the procedure, and we need to solve it. The problem is that, apparently, nobody seems to trust the Home Office. In every letter that I receive from Britain and from EU citizens, they are saying that all their rights are protected, but be aware that it is a procedure in which an enormous administrative burden was created, and where the burden of proof is on the back of the citizens instead of on the Home Office. I think we need to take that into account. I think that this Parliament can never give the green light to the final agreement if, in the withdrawal agreement, we do not have a simple procedure, a declaration, one form per family, cost-free, and where the burden of proof is on the Home Office and not on the back of our citizens. It is not our citizens who decided for Brexit, yet they will have the negative consequences of a burdensome procedure that is introduced here. In our view, this is part and parcel of citizens’ rights because citizens’ rights are worth nothing if they are drowned in a sea of red tape and if they are bogged down in rules and regulations. To make it more understandable, we will never allow a situation where, for example, a European banker living in the City who has enough money to pay a very important lawyer can make it, and a Polish plumber or a Romanian doctor cannot make it. That we will not allow. There has to be a proportionate approach in this.  We will all be very keen, as Michel Barnier knows, on the issue of Ireland. Ireland cannot become the collateral damage of Brexit. We will always show solidarity and be fully behind Ireland in these negotiations. Finally, talking about solidarity – because being behind all our Member States and behind Ireland is a question of solidarity – I have to tell you that I was completely shocked yesterday by the paper issued by President Tusk, and I say this to the representative of the Council. He issued a statement and a paper in which he mainly says that the EU has only to assist the Member States, and that the Member States are responsible for the migration crisis. Echoing what Mr Timmermans said, I think the solution can only in fact come from the European Union. There will be no solution for the migration crisis if it is not a European solution. I mean a European Border and Coastguard to manage the outside borders, a European asylum package and not the Dublin approach, with the negation in fact of such a European approach, and also a European economic migration policy. Let us make the European Blue Card the sole system of economic migration inside the European Union. That is what we need, instead of a paper coming from Mr Tusk, who is undermining, in fact, the whole approach by the European Commission and, at the same time, the whole approach of our rapporteur here in Parliament, Ms Cecilia Wikström, who has worked hard to have an agreement here in this House. Let us go forward with European solutions and the European Council has to show that it is on the same level as Parliament and Commission in this fight.

In the first place I would like to pick up exactly here. I, too, consider the well-known letter from President Tusk to the heads of government to be very fatal. Instead of talking about distribution and criticizing it as the main problem of European refugee policy, it should be considered that the EU must change its policy towards countries like Libya and others so that people who are on the run are not ultimately locked in detention camps will. That would be a different approach, that should be considered. But to the main point that concerns us here today: That is the question of the interim results of the Brexit negotiations. I want to make it clear again: this is a political assessment. In other words, there is actually nothing that should enable us to say in advance: This is exactly what has now been decided once and for all, and that will now be the starting point. It must be the background for us to translate all of this into legal texts and for us to also check the resilience of what has now been agreed. We have doubts about it. We have doubts about the behavior of the UK government over the past few weeks. That didn't help build trust. A multi-directional government that almost surrenders to the DUP - a party that has never properly recognized the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, that opposes rights and is ready to reduce the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland, to exercise their influence. That can not be! That is why our role here in Parliament will also be crucial. We will say clearly: On the basis of our resolution of April 2017, we will ultimately evaluate the results in autumn of next year and decide whether we can then agree to a withdrawal agreement under these conditions. What do we see urgent Need for action? First of all with civil rights. Much has already been mentioned here, I would just like to mention this briefly. We are of course concerned with the question of family reunification, the view of the family as a family and not a few separated out. We are concerned with the future of children, we are also concerned with the future of possible new couples, we are concerned with protecting the rights of the family as a whole. We want full recognition of professional qualifications. We also want, of course, to secure the right of people to have access to the health systems, the education system, practically the public service in every respect, including in Great Britain. We want the export of acquired claims so that it continues and is not reduced. And of course we want the withdrawal agreement to be directly effective for the citizens concerned with the interpretation of the ECJ. Here we have doubts as to whether the planned eight years are really enough. We would suggest that in the event that the UK government is unable to set up an independent body, there is a continuation, an extension of the period of operation of the European Court of Justice. We want the free movement of British citizens within the European Union between the 27 Member States to be preserved; it must not be restricted. And of course we also want the new settled status to be linked to all rights and standards that are derived from EU law and apply to citizens. This is important to us. I would like to add one point to this: We are also concerned with keeping an eye on the fact that Brexit, the question of whether the case law of the European Court of Justice is bound by the British courts and also a possible, obviously envisaged free trade agreement, the rights of employees in Britain will restrict. Here goes it's not just about future rights, it's also about existing standards that UK workers have already acquired. Here, as a Parliament, we have a responsibility to look closely and not just look the other way and say: It is up to you how you deal with it. Northern Ireland, Ireland: We have a full commitment here, and to this end we, as Parliament, have pledged to fully commit to the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 treaty. It is important for us not only to look at what is being regulated there in terms of structural decisions, but also to see which rights are laid down there. What matters to us - and my group is still calling for it - is that there should be no reduction in the rights of the Irish on both sides - within the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland - under EU law . We will insist on that. We will measure many things by this. And I would like to make it clear again here: we as Parliament should take our responsibility to the EU citizens in the United Kingdom, the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland and also to the UK citizens who live in the Live to the EU, to accept the obligation that we will fight for their rights, that we are the guarantor of their rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, until some days ago I was quite optimistic about this Council: there might actually be some steps ahead, there were some positive developments and I thought that doesn’t happen so often, so I was quite optimistic. On Brexit there was a sort of agreement, even some hiccups, but there was a step forward. On the eurozone there was some movement, and even on migration there were some steps in the right direction – looking at the Commission, for example, and ECJ court cases... But that didn’t last so long. On Brexit, even though we had an agreement, it was then put into question in London, and that of course raises a lot of questions about any sort of agreement that we make here, that you are making with your counterparts. I would also say this especially concerns the future relationship, because you cannot trust one another if you are not sure that whatever you agree is actually going to hold, so this is going to put a major strain on any future relations. I would also add that this is not just for the European Union, because if the UK wants to be a global player and find their new friends elsewhere, then that is going to be just as tricky, or even more tricky because while we have a long relationship, others might find it even more bewildering if there is this untrustworthiness on the other side. So I hope this can be clarified. We will make a very clear deal, legally binding and everything, but I hope that this will not happen again in the future. On Northern Ireland, as colleagues have mentioned, this is of course a crucial issue that really goes into the question of peace and living together. This is something that will remain as the main concern of our group, but I am sure for other colleagues as well. There we still have a square to circle: we all agree there should not be a hard border and whatever, so that’s nice... but we don’t say yet how we are going to do that. We cannot have our cake and eat it, we need to find a solution here. And I join with colleagues in saying that we must ensure there is no restriction on the rights of Irish citizens and of people on both sides of the border in Ireland, we must ensure that their rights will be safeguarded. But there is no solution yet. I hope we will have a proposal soon, but for us this remains the main issue along with the rights of citizens. Of course, there as well we have made some important progress, but there are also important problems – the rights of future partners and spouses, for example. Already now we hear stories of major hiccups with administration, where residency permits are not being granted as they should be. This is something that urgently needs to be addressed. On migration, as has already been mentioned, I did find the letter of Tusk extremely irritating because basically, just when the Commission stands up for solidarity, goes to the ECJ, and has been bringing infringement procedures, now basically the Council and Tusk come and shoot the Commission in the back. That is not a nice way to proceed and I think Mr Tusk, and I think the entirety of the Member States, will have to answer some questions here. How should it be understood when Tusk calls solidarity ‘ineffective’? How should this be understood by the Commission, which was standing firm by this Parliament? We actually have the same parties here in this House as in the governments in the Member States. We are not a detached, totally different galaxy. We are the same political groups, the same parties, but we have managed to find an agreement in the European Parliament on the Dublin reform and on the future asylum system. Sure, it wasn’t easy, but we managed to put forward an ambitious proposal, but apparently this is ‘ineffective’, this is irrelevant for Mr Tusk – I do find this really irritating. What about the Member States who have been calling for many years for more solidarity? What about Italy? What about Greece? In the past it was Malta and Spain, and it could be Poland tomorrow, as well. There is no guarantee that any Member State will be spared, so to say. So I am wondering whose president Mr Tusk is trying to be here, and I hope that this will not be reflected in the leaders’ meeting, and I hope indeed that the other co-legislator will make progress here because we in Parliament have been ready for a long time. I hope too that the Heads of State and Government will have a look at what EU Member States have contributed to the misery that we see in Libya and also what they are going to do in order to alleviate that misery. I think that proposing just 1 000 resettlement places for the whole European Union, well that is really a meagre number so I hope that the Member States will add on a little there.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I don’t think I have ever heard so little criticism of the United Kingdom in this Chamber in all my life, and I guess it doesn’t really take much working out why, does it? Mr Barnier said earlier that there were key areas upon which he wasn’t prepared to make many concessions. Well, you didn’t need to, sir, because you were up against Theresa May, and she was all for making as many concessions as she possibly could, including agreeing a ludicrous bill of up to 40 billion sterling for us to have the right to leave, a continued role for the European Court of Justice and, in line with that, family reunions that mean, frankly, that open-door immigration from the European Union is going to continue for years to come, and – almost bizarrely – a commitment for ongoing regulatory alignment. It is as if, even though we are leaving, effectively the British Government wants to keep us in some form of single market relationship, so I am not surprised that you are all very pleased with her. Theresa the Appeaser has given in on virtually everything. But as an observation in an exercise of power, it’s fascinating. Whether we like or dislike the European Union, we cannot deny the power that it has got, because you managed to make a British Prime Minister leave Downing Street in the middle of the night and fly to Brussels to forge an agreement with unelected bureaucrats based in Brussels. It’s a form of ritual humiliation, which she was prepared to put herself through. She has danced to your tune all the way through this – you must be very, very pleased indeed.  And now we enter into what perhaps may be the biggest deception yet, played on the British public. She is seeking a transition phase, and there are one or two comments here about whether the Brits will get that phase. Of course they will, because we are volunteering to go on paying the membership fee, to accepting all the existing rules and all the new rules. We will effectively, once transition is granted, have left the European Union at the end of March 2019 in name only, and if that transition phase lasts up until the next general election, there is a real possibility that a new incoming British Government/coalition could sign us up to a single market and the Customs Union forever.  So I do understand why many in this place feel encouraged by the performance of our Prime Minister and, I can assure you, millions who voted for Brexit are increasingly feeling frustrated and perhaps even now moving to the point of anger.

This implies no jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, no restrictions on free trade agreements, application of UK law with regard to EU citizens, and these are to us the central elements of any acceptable deal. Having said that, migration is again an important topic of the European Council meeting, and rightly so. Mass migration still threatens the survival of our civilisation, our security and our culture. These illiterate illegal fortune-seekers believe in the barbarism of Sharia, Hadith and Quran. They come to the EU and still come in hundreds of thousands to benefit from our prosperity, and they do not contribute a single bit to our societies. They take without giving and if necessary by force. This has to stop. So I praise the governments of the Visegrád countries who stand for their own traditions, for their people and culture; they lead the resistance against Juncker and Timmermans, they are the ones guiding Europe. This is how you deal with illegal migrants: first, no admissions, and next no incentives, and that is: no housing, no social benefits, no family reunion and no endless legal procedures. I also praise the courageous Libyan coastguard who set sail against aggressive human traffickers and rogue NGOs while risking their own lives. The coastguard of a country that was destroyed by France, the EU and the US, now protects the EU borders. The EU cannot show more clearly that it is utterly bankrupt. Schengen has to end now and national borders must close now. Finally, the migrants who are already here must be returned straight away. Do not tolerate them, do not pay them off, do not send them back, but round them up and bring them back.

There will be no special status. Northern Ireland’s businesses will have unfettered access to the United Kingdom single market; there will be no internal trade borders within the United Kingdom. We share the goal of ensuring that there is no hard border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. It is our view that these issues can only be fully resolved in Phase 2 of the negotiations. However, the union that matters economically to Northern Ireland is the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where trade is worth six times more than trade with the Irish Republic. Let us be absolutely clear, Northern Ireland’s constitutional and economic stability will not be damaged by EU bullying in the Brexit negotiations. It is important that we now move on to the next stage of the negotiations. We should not miss the opportunity for a new relationship based on shared democratic values, trade and security.

That the Council is not only concerned with Brexit, but that it is taking an essential step towards creating the European Defense Union, that proposals for an economic and monetary union based on solidarity, conditionality and strengthening the EU are discussed, that the question of a social pillar is discussed and progress is being made here - all of this shows that the European Union is moving forward and not just waiting for Brexit. But with Brexit we have to make it clear that an agreement has been reached here that I consider to be binding. When I hear from my British colleague here today that none of this applies, then I have to make it clear to us that in our relations only the attitude of the government is binding, and the government has made a clear commitment and this commitment must be included in the exit agreement . This exit contract is a condition for a transitional arrangement to come or for a commercial contract to be concluded at all. So I ask not to mess around here.

We consider this a sufficient basis for moving on to the second phase. At the same time, we underline that any positive development of the discussion on the future relationship and the transition requires that the commitments defined in the joint report be translated fully and in a timely manner into the draft withdrawal agreement. This includes on Ireland, where full regulatory alignment means full regulatory alignment, and our final consent vote is conditional upon this. I’m confident that this drafting exercise –and we will be vigilant on that – will ensure the goal that this Parliament has committed to achieve: the full safeguard of the rights of the four and a half million citizens affected by Brexit, and the full protection of the life choices that they have made. We are glad to see that, despite some propaganda by some Brexiteers, the joint report clearly states that all the rights established by EU law and interpreted by the Court of Justice shall have direct legal effect through the withdrawal agreement, and that any inconsistent or incompatible rule or national rule set out in the national legislation will be disapplied. And we are proud to have contributed, together with the Commission, to broadening the personal scope not only to all family members, but also to all future children. All this is very far from the original UK proposal of ‘settled status’, but this should not be seen as the success of one part over the other, but rather as a common success for all our citizens and for all our common European principles.

Mr Weber was apparently enjoying the fact that there are a lot of negative economic effects for the British economy.

I must remind Mr Timmermans of the fact that to map out a future trade deal with Canada or Japan is one thing, but to map out a trade deal with a country with which we have had relations for more than 40 years is quite another. There are a lot of logistical and sophisticated supply chains which are at danger.

According to the Daily Telegraph, ministers only accepted the deal because they were told that points in it were ‘meaningless, not binding or simply included to secure Ireland’s approval’.

It is a pleasure to see Mr Barnier as the only person in charge here. First of all, on the Brexit issue. Time will tell whether it was the right tactic to divide the negotiations into two phases or not. I am also surprised that there was great outrage here about what David Davis said about 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'. This phrase is familiar to all three institutions in the negotiations, it is nothing new, and I think the outrage is a bit false. Of course, I am also pleased to hear the leaders of some groups who are very concerned about the fate of Romanian and Polish plumbers in Britain, while at the same time trying to drive migrant workers out of the European Union market in a number of sectors, as we do with the mobility package for drivers. With regard to economic cooperation with the United Kingdom, in the second phase, I think it is extremely important for the Council to listen to the economic interests of the smaller Member States in the United Kingdom, in cooperation with the United Kingdom. There simply cannot be a situation where their interests are said to be 'anti-European, so we will not take your interests into account in the second phase of the negotiations'. This notion of 'anti-European' also causes me outrage at the criticism of Mr Tusk by the European Commissioner, who has not been given a mandate to define what is anti-European and what is European. So what did the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Tusk, do about migration policy? He simply said that the quota system in migration policy was ineffective. And is she effective then? In Estonia, as in my country, Latvia, many hundreds of sent migrants have entered voluntary quotas, who - in the case of Latvia - have virtually all left the country with or without documents, and they are most often in Germany, so I repeat - we are democratic system, let us not allow ourselves to be judged by the fact that only one of the staff in the Commission can judge what is anti-European and what no.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Catherine BEARDER", "mepid": "96955", "text": "   – Madam President, Ms May said one of her first goals is to ensure that citizens can carry on living as before.

We also have ahead transition negotiations and the future relationship is still to be identified. The most difficult is yet to come.  The transition period raises many legal issues which will have to be considered with the highest caution. It will have to provide for connection with the future framework, foreseeable at that time, and the talks on transition will precede the negotiations on the future relationship, so there is no reason to call transition an implementation phase. But transition is not only about bridging with the future framework; it has its own challenges. It is true that there is no time to negotiate a bespoke transition agreement, so its major part will be the prolongation of the acquis, but it only looks simple.  We have to bear in mind that the EU acquis is strongly interdependent in a legally and politically complex way and this is a challenge in itself, but there will also be parts of the transition deal going beyond prolongation of the acquis, and this will require in my view a strong credible joint oversight mechanism with a strong role for the European Commission on our side.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 36, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Maria João RODRIGUES", "mepid": "124737", "text": "   –Madam President, this is certainly the time for ambitious European solutions, but this is not the case for the joint declaration to be signed tomorrow by the three institutions.

Today I have the impression that the physical sense of security related to terrorist threats, border tightness and migration will be a more important battlefield against populism than social security, because the economy is simply doing better. And if this social pillar is built in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, it will not multiply promises that cannot be fulfilled at the EU level, that's fine. For example, if it is to strengthen the Erasmus + program, cooperation between universities, recognition of qualifications, everything that serves mobility on the market, because there is still not enough mobility on the common market. But there are reasons why the slogan \"social pillar\" awakens the vigilance of many countries, especially in the east. Then, when the slogan of social dumping appears in his company and tough regulations are born, then the Polish plumber comes back a bit, which was promoted as the main threat during the French referendum. Now it turns out that truck drivers from the east or Spain or construction workers are stealing dream jobs from richer countries, which is not true.

In strategic sectors, at a time when the British will necessarily have to rebuild their commercial attractiveness to the whole world, the United Kingdom must not serve as a Trojan horse for foreign investment. So, on our side, let us maintain our efforts. The report that I am bringing to Parliament for better monitoring of foreign investment will complement the work carried out to reform our anti-dumping methodology and to modernize our trade defense instruments.

Congratulations, Mr Barnier, on your work and congratulations on conducting the most transparent negotiation in history. We have finally agreed to divorce. Now we have to talk about what the open relationship we want to maintain in the future will be like. We have agreed that the rights of citizens are protected by law and that our law will be incorporated directly into British law and, to guarantee this, that for eight years the European Court will be able to rule creating jurisprudence. We have agreed that the settlement bill will be reasonable and will meet three rules: that no one will have to pay more than what they are paying; that the commitments acquired will be fulfilled; and that the UK will pay no more than if it were a member of the European Union. On Northern Ireland we are committed, even if there is no hard border, to respect the Good Friday Accords, the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom and the integrity of the single market. It is very difficult and here we are going to have to use ourselves thoroughly because we are all going to support the position of the Irish Government until the end, until this declaration is possible. During the transitional period, the United Kingdom will continue to be part of the customs union and the single market, respecting the four freedoms, but will no longer be able to participate in the election or in the decisions of the European Union. What then remains to be done? The most difficult: closing the technical details of this political agreement; determine the length and scope of the transitional period and begin negotiating a trade agreement. This agreement is not the end of anything, it is simply the beginning of everything. This is a political agreement, with many loose ends from a technical point of view that Mr Barnier will now have to negotiate and will have to tie up. We have made it easy.

Also, something which has not been mentioned enough is the willingness of the European Union to continue Peace (Programme for Peace and Reconciliation) and Interreg funding into the future, post-Brexit.

Hopefully, she will get the backing of all her colleagues because this is not a time for disunity.

It is not helpful when people make statements that commitments are only statements of intent. A commitment is a commitment, a guarantee is a guarantee, and nothing else.

Telegraphically, Manfred Weber spoke earlier about the transition. I want to confirm that the only legal basis for a possible transition is Article 50. There is no transition if there is no agreement on Article 50, a withdrawal agreement. I would also like to thank Esteban Gonzáles Pons for using the word \"transparency\". This is a key to the trust between us, with the Council as well, and we will continue, in conjunction with Guy Verhofstadt and the members of the Parliament's Brexit Steering Group, to practice these permanent confidence dialogues. On Ireland, Seán Kelly, Mairead McGuinness and other parliamentarians recalled the sensitivity of this issue. I will continue to be the negotiator of the Irish government like that of the twenty-six other governments and - if you will - by your side. The unity of the twenty-seven in the past months and for the months to come is very fundamental. I listened with great attention to Mrs in't Veld, Mrs Keller, Mr Kelly, who earlier mentioned the rights of citizens, as Roberto Gualtieri and Guy Verhofstadt also did with many by force. Two points on this question: first free movement, in the future, will be part, Mrs in’t Veld, of the next step in phase two, but I will not forget this question. The very important point on the procedures, which is a sensitive point: we put in the joint report very precise conditions, co-signed by the two parties, and I will endeavor - you can be sure - to ensure that these conditions are reflected in the withdrawal treaty itself, so that these procedures are simple and as less bureaucratic as possible. We are not at the end of this issue and the issue will only be closed in the Withdrawal Agreement. So, from that point of view, the vigilance of the European Parliament is fair and justified. Mr Mavrides, just a word on Cyprus: we will need to find specific solutions to preserve the current situation of the citizens concerned by life around the two military bases in Cyprus. I'm just saying it in passing. Gianni Pittella, Guy Verhostadt and, of course, Elmar Brok spoke about the strength of this joint report. It is serious work that we have done together, methodical, precise. It will be the basis of what we are going to transfer and transcribe into law, through a draft treaty. I say to Guy Verhostadt that my intention is to put on your table, before the end of January, this draft treaty based - for the most part - on the content of this joint report. As Elmar Brok said, it's about trust. The word \"trust\" is much more than a word, at this stage, between the British and us, because we cannot build a future relationship in matters of defense, security, judicial cooperation, for the university. , for trade obviously, without having confidence. Just one word about the context of these negotiations: they are difficult, and they are tough, very tough, because the issues are extremely complicated and because the consequences of the Brexit are very serious. I personally want to say, in response to a Member of the House of Commons, that Prime Minister Theresa May is courageous and respectable. I certainly respect her. I would like to say now, as Syed Kamall, Gabriele Zimmer and Manfred Weber alluded to the future relationship, that there is, with this agreement on the joint report, a step important thing that is done in the direction of an orderly withdrawal - and that is the condition, this orderly withdrawal -, through a treaty that will be submitted to you, and you will have the final say - to build a future relationship. From this point of view, I would just like to emphasize a point to which we will come back. This is the first time in the history of European trade negotiations - and we will have to build a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom -, that we will have, in a negotiated trade relationship, to work to control the divergence rather than to encourage convergence. We're going to have to get the regulatory divergence under control, to prevent it from becoming a dumping tool against us, rather than encouraging convergence, as we usually do. This is a very important point relating to the way of life, which Manfred Weber mentioned earlier, and also to a level playing field. This is a common thread, Mrs Berès, indeed, that this joint report, in the direction of an agreement, as Danuta Maria Hübner also said very well. Maria João Rodrigues, along with Daniel Caspary and others, spoke about the reforms that Europe needs. President Timmermans spoke about it. I think, I repeat that the future of Europe, which is made up of these reforms, this voluntarism, is much more important than Brexit. That’s also why, I think we had to stabilize this negotiation, so that the energy, your energy and the energy of the Europeans are devoted to this reform agenda. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your appreciation of our work. I will share this appreciation without any complacency and even less with triumphalism. It’s really not my state of mind. I will share this assessment with my whole team, the Commission services, with the Parliament team, the Council team, who deserve it.If I may conclude in English: Let us keep calm and continue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Michel BARNIER", "mepid": "72776", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I would like to thank Members for all their comments made during this discussion this morning.

He is not listening either, because he has not listened to this Parliament, nor is he listening to the efforts that the Commission is making. The European Council seems to insist on a proven wrong path on migration and refuge, which consists in moving away, in making larger borders, in preventing more and more urgently the legal routes for migration.

The resolution under discussion therefore constitutes a good compromise text, which reiterates the red lines defined for negotiation defined by the European Parliament, identifies points to be safeguarded in the negotiation process in the field of rights, the issue of Ireland and financial compensation and delimits the future potential framework for association between the EU and the UK as a country outside the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Carlos ZORRINHO", "mepid": "124739", "text": "representative of the democratic opposition of Venezuela awarded with the Sakharov Prize 2017. - Mr. President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, honorable members of the European Parliament, respected assistants and guests, delegation from Venezuela that accompanies us to receive this award today, girlfriends and friends. Undoubtedly, it is not easy to speak when your lips are as close to your heart as at this moment, but I want to convey to all of you that, since some sailors arrived on American soil centuries ago, Europe and Venezuela have had a one-way relationship. back. Although some try to change history, we have been twinned ever since. Today we Venezuelans have to thank Europe, you! They have extended a helping hand in what, without a doubt, are the darkest hours of our republican history as a nation. That is the same hand that we Venezuelans offered in the 20th century to thousands and thousands of Europeans who emigrated with the scars of war on their souls and bodies. Among them, my own parents and my grandparents. Some have returned to their places of origin, expelled by the devastating effects of the so-called \"21st century socialism\" that has been tried to establish in my country. And sadly, young Venezuelans have also left their land behind in the hope of finding in Europe, and in other corners of the world, the future and the opportunity that the Government of Venezuela has taken from them. This round trip, this common history between America and Europe has brought us here. Today the European Parliament recognizes the brave and tireless struggle of the opposition of the Venezuelan people by awarding the Sakharov Prize to the opposition democratically represented in the National Assembly - which I have the honor to preside over - and to all the political prisoners in my country. I would like, please, that we give applause to those who accompany us: Antonieta and Leopoldo López, my parents personal friend Leopoldo López; Antonio Ledezma, who had to flee from Venezuela, from the unjust prison to which he was subjected; Patricia de Ceballos, wife of Daniel Ceballos, who has been deprived of liberty for almost four years; in addition to the relatives and representatives of Lorent Saleh, his mother, Yamile; José Ignacio Guédez, representative of Mayor Alfredo Ramos, and Alejandra González, sister of Andrea González, imprisoned for three years and also a Spanish citizen; likewise, to Yon Goicoechea and the thousands and thousands of exiles from Venezuela. (Applause) We receive this award with deep appreciation. It is welcomed by the whole country. Venezuela makes it his whole and united. It is a recognition for the mother who deprives herself of food to save her children; for the child who rummages through the garbage trying to satisfy hunger; for the grandfather who dies of decline due to the shortage of medicines. It is also received by that young man who today has emigrated desperate to seek opportunities in other latitudes. This award is also received by the teacher who overcomes ideological blindness and clings to the task of forming free men and women for Venezuela. It is received by those who fight for human rights in Venezuela. It is received by Venezuelan journalists, who risk their entire lives to show the reality that seeks to be silenced. This distinction also goes through the bars of the dungeons in which more than three hundred and fifty young Venezuelans are unjustly detained. They and their struggle are also recognized and are present with us today. (Applause) But, in a special way, the Sakharov Prize honors the memory of one hundred and fifty-seven Venezuelans killed by the brutal repression of the government during the peaceful protests that we carried out during this year 2017. When Andrei Sakharov was recognized with the Nobel Prize of the Paz in 1975 could not receive it personally. He was standing outside a Lithuanian court, awaiting the unjust sentence that would mark the life of his friend, the scientist Serghey Kovalyev. In the Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which his wife read, were the names of more than a hundred political prisoners and exiles. His wife apologized for the ones she didn't remember, but she assured something important. She said: \"Each name, mentioned or not, represents a concrete, hard and heroic human destiny, of years of suffering, years of struggle for human dignity.\" These words, without a doubt, today stir the soul of every Venezuelan and summarize the persistence of the struggle that we have and will have until we achieve democratic victory in the country. (Applause) I am convinced that our noble challenge is not alien to Europe. To you, honorable MEPs, the fight we are waging in Venezuela against domination and fear is not strange. In the 21st century, we Venezuelans resist and face a totalitarian state, a second Cuba but with the largest oil, gas and gold reserves in the West. I can assure you that we, like you decades ago, are determined to persist and overcome that perverse pretense of colonizing the conscience of every Venezuelan. The regime has hijacked democracy in my country. He established hunger to administer misery. Destroyed the healthcare system to manage death. He expropriated thousands of companies to spread misery. He indoctrinated the classrooms to offer ignorance. Unlike social democracy, the socialism of the 21st century is a renewed version and just as traumatic as the real socialism that you suffered for decades. And although it is doomed to failure, it has become the greatest obstacle to peace, progress and human rights in Venezuela. (Applause) The imposition of this system on our nation has caused unprecedented destruction and misery. Please listen carefully to the following. After having experienced the biggest oil bonanza in its history in recent years, The Venezuelan economy has just entered a traumatic process of hyperinflation: this year the cost of food will reach 2,000%. In other words, in Venezuela it is enough that a few hours pass to register the inflation that the European countries accumulate in several years. Hunger was established as a political system in Venezuela. 75% of Venezuelans have lost ten kilos, per person, in recent months and, as if that were not enough, official studies show that four out of ten children suffer from some type of malnutrition. Death also progresses in pharmacies: out of every ten medicines, nine are not available and people with chronic diseases are sentenced to death. The tragedy is obvious and painful. Only the pride of those who conceive power as a form of domination ignores this reality and underestimates it, to the point of closing the doors to many countries like you, who have generously offered us relief. Today I want to reiterate it in front of Europe: the opening of humanitarian cooperation for food and medicine is urgent for Venezuela. It is a requirement that cries out to heaven and that we have presented in all national and international instances. And, in an incredible way, the Government of Nicolás Maduro refuses to cooperate with medicines and food for the people. Sooner rather than later the long struggle for dignity referred to by Sakharov will bear fruit and allow us to regain freedom. We also cling to what our Rómulo Gallegos, great libertarian and president of Venezuela, said. \"Evil is temporary,\" said Gallegos, \"but truth and justice always reign.\" Far from what those who want to dominate us want, those of us here and those of us in Venezuela suffering are not full of hatred. And for this reason, I want to share with you what I consider one of our great triumphs: we do not hold a grudge against those who have done so much damage to Venezuela. Almost daily they push us to hate them, but they have not managed to do it and we will not do it. But neither will we lose hope nor will we stop fighting until we see a free Venezuela and of all Venezuelans. (Applause) The situation in our Venezuela is difficult. We are urged to carry out a political change towards democracy to face this terrible humanitarian crisis created by the regime that I have just described. We have not stopped raising our voices despite the distorting effect of censorship and propaganda. We stand firm in all spaces and on all possible terrain. That is why we turn to the international community, to you, to the free world, to invoke the principles of international social justice and find ways that contribute to the democratic rescue of my country. That is why we fight in the streets, in the Assembly, in the international arena, peacefully protesting to recover democracy in Venezuela. In our memory the images of the brutal repression that the State security forces deployed against unarmed citizens are still clear. Many of them young, who are in prison today and who are not over twenty years old. The arms of the Republic were dedicated to mourning one hundred and fifty-seven Venezuelan households. These weapons should not be used to resolve what we can resolve through word and vote, which is the vehicle for millions of Venezuelans to express themselves. The vote cast in freedom is a declaration of independence. Therefore, we are obliged to rescue him. In the coming months there should be a presidential election in Venezuela and we ask Europe and the free world to put all their attention on these elections. We are challenged to regain electoral conditions that allow Venezuelans to express themselves freely at the polls, without blackmail, without pressure of any kind, without repression, and that their will is respected. It is a fight that summons us all and demands the best of all of us. Therefore, we take with I am happy with the words of President Antonio Tajani and we formally ask that an electoral mission of the European Parliament accompany these elections that must take place in Venezuela, so that they are free elections and there can be a democratic transition in my country. Honorable MEPs, these are difficult times, but we look to the future with hope. I long for the moment when the cells will be opened, the exiles return and all Venezuelans embrace each other, we cry with joy and work together so that the Constitution is respected, we have the rule of law and a democracy full of opportunities. Friends of Europe, Christmas is approaching and many Venezuelan households will receive the Savior in the midst of serious material shortages, with nothing to eat. Surely, with the same humility, faith and love that Mary Most Holy and her husband Saint Joseph did so more than two thousand years ago in Bethlehem. On behalf of them, of those who suffer the most, of those who deserve a future of opportunities in Venezuela, I humbly welcome this award, which has been conferred on our indomitable love for peace, democracy, justice, progress and human rights. . On behalf of the Venezuelan people, many thanks to all of you!

I should be standing tall on this rostrum before you with a smile on my face, but I don't even have the strength to simulate it and, paraphrasing Sakharov, I repeat like him the words spoken by the lips of his devoted and unconditional wife when, at the moment of Receiving the Nobel Prize in 1965 - as our colleague Julio Borges reminded us - she said, on behalf of her husband, \"that she could not be content and happy receiving that award knowing that there were prisoners of conscience in her homeland.\" Well, I cannot be happy or content receiving this award knowing that in the dungeons of Venezuela more than three hundred political prisoners remain unjustly deprived of their freedom. Sakharov, you who are spiritually present in this sacred place, allow me to greet you and thank you on behalf of humanity for your life dedicated to the defense of peace, progress and human rights of the beings that populate this earth and ratify, in the name of of the Venezuelan citizens who today, of course, proudly decked out with this distinction, that we receive it with the humility that has characterized our people, but also with the gallantry and courage that it has put on the showcase of our country as an example of the people in whose name we receive this laurel fight tenaciously. We want to turn this award into flowers. May we turn this trophy into flowers to take to Franklin Brito's grave. A man whose last days he lived in a cot, where he died starring in a hunger strike, defending the land that had been usurped. And in the face and in the face and in the name of Franklin Brito I see the peasants, the farmers, the Venezuelan ranchers who have suffered the attacks of authoritarianism because their farms, their farms, their property have been over and over again invaded. We turn this trophy into flowers to take to the graves of more than 350,000 Venezuelans whose homes are in mourning. Venezuelans like those who last year, more than 29,000 citizens, lost their lives at the hands of the underworld in a country where the rule of law has disappeared and the rule of law does not work but the whim of rulers who have pulverized the rules of the game designed to guarantee coexistence in a society with a democratic spirit such as Venezuela. This award will be in the tombs of the young squires who, as Julio said, shed their blood in the streets of Caracas and all the towns of the country to draw our sentimental map. Young people who did not reach twenty years of age; who fought for a democracy they never got to know. For these young people I invoke in this room a posthumous prayer as a tribute to those who knew how to defend the ideals that were not agreed upon and who did not play with the conscience of a people that today proudly receives this laurel to continue fighting for Venezuelan freedom and democracy was chair for Latin America. (Applause) This is a tribute to the children in Venezuela who are dying of hunger. This is a tribute to human beings who have ceased to exist simply because they don't have a medicine on hand. And this happens in an immensely rich country. Julio Borges has spoken of the thriving Venezuela in whose entrails is the largest oil reserve in the world. But it turns out that a country whose government has administered more than 1.5 billion dollars in recent years, an amount ten times higher than the budget allocated to the European Union, today exhibits - as we saw in the images that were projected a few minutes ago - human beings rummaging through garbage in order to survive. It is a people that fights for its survival. And in order to be free we have to have freedom. And it is the voice of those political prisoners on whose behalf Leopoldo López sent me this phrase or this thought that I want to share with you. Leopoldo says: «Freedom for those who live in healthy democracies is often an abstract. For those of us who lack it, it is as vital as oxygen. We ask Europe to remain firm in its commitment to achieve the freedom of more than three hundred prisoners and thirty million Venezuelans who today do not breathe freedom. (Applause) This is the reflection of all political prisoners. It is the reflection of a people that wants to resolve their difficulties through civic and democratic means. That is why we proposed a constitutional referendum last year. A civic, democratic, legal path to settle our differences. We are not looking for God in the corners. We are not stoking the fire in the barracks or the garrisons. Because, unlike those who today illegally hold power in Venezuela, who rule with guns or bayonets, trampling on the Constitution and the laws of the Republic, we want peace. Here we do not come to seek revenge but justice. Here we come free of hatred and resentment, because those are feelings that make the spirit sick and pervert the soul. We want Venezuela to regain its freedom and coexistence. And we wanted to propose electoral paths that the same regime closes, because Venezuela is in the hands, and I say this with regret, of criminals who have turned our State into a failed State. We are ashamed that today Venezuela is being talked about because there are high-level officials who are related to drug trafficking. And the Vienna office that controls narcotics operations in this continent has said it: that more than 60% of the cocaine that enters Europe comes from Venezuelan territory. And those who are not related to drug trafficking have links to international terrorism. And those that are not related to terrorism or drug trafficking they are filled with scandals or acts of corruption. More than 600 billion dollars that have been stolen from the public finances are deposited in tax havens around the world. And that is the paradox of an immensely rich country, with a people suffering within and with a pilgrimage of more than two million citizens of Venezuela who today suffer the pain of an absent homeland between their chests and backs. Therefore, friends, this award reinforces us. This award gives us more energy to continue fighting for the values ​​and principles of democracy that you share. To tell the world that peoples never again suffer from dictatorships. Let there never be talk of torture or political prisoners in towns that have dressed up as democracy. Never again speak of emotional divisions or fractures. May we open the way to harmony. And with the words of the Galician teacher I say goodbye saying to you: \"Today more than ever we are convinced that the more one belongs to oneself the more one has his will and his whole life at the service of a collective ideal.\" Long live Venezuela! Long live democracy! Long live the freedom of the world!

We have a chance now to see whether it is not only talk but also action in the fight against tax evasion and money laundering. We need to put an end to the race to the bottom on corporate taxation and regulation in Europe. We need to put an end to the situation where the super rich, global corrupt elite are above the tax law and above the law as such.

Ten years ago, on 6 December 2007, the Council decided to lift internal border controls for nine Member States that had joined the Union in 2004. The decision, which applied as of December 2007, marked a significant step forward for the benefit of people travelling in the enlarged Schengen area with no internal border controls. In recent years we have been faced with migratory pressures and terrorist threats to an extent not seen before. This has put the Schengen area under heavy pressure, but we have not remained idle. Many steps have been taken to sustain the full and proper functioning of Schengen, and many proposals are in the pipeline. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council in October this year, ministers had an extensive exchange of views on Schengen, particularly on the proposed Schengen border, the Borders Code Amendments, in relation to temporary internal border controls. While progress has been made on a number of files, a number of questions remain outstanding, with internal border controls in place in six countries in the Schengen area. It is therefore necessary for us to further intensify our work to get back to normal operation of Schengen, including viable alternatives to internal border controls.  Against this background, the Presidency organised an informal debate between the Ministers of the Interior at last week’s Justice and Home Affairs Council on 7 and 8 December. Ministers had a good and constructive debate, and even if there are diverging views on some issues, there is a general consensus that we must do our utmost to reinstall and strengthen our trust in Schengen.  Ministers took stock of measures already taken, such as the entry/exit system. We looked at measures currently discussed, such as the EU Travel Information and Authorisation System, the Schengen Information System proposals and the proposal for amending the Schengen Borders Control. And, in direct relation to the issue discussed in our debate today, Ministers also reflected on how we can move forward on the pending full application of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania. Both countries have fulfilled all the necessary conditions and have made significant efforts to guarantee the security of the EU’s external borders. However, the decision to fully apply the Schengen acquis for the two countries, for which we need unanimity, is still outstanding.  The improved situation regarding migratory pressures, and expected early agreement on a number of the measures currently under discussion, could perhaps change the situation. The Presidency on 7 December was happy to conclude the discussion, concluding that we have to continue working hard in the coming months on strengthening the Schengen area, including via enlargement. As for Croatia, it is still in the process of being evaluated in the run-up to full application of the Schengen acquis. The Council has already adopted several implementing decisions setting out recommendations to address the deficiencies identified with a view to Croatia fulfilling the conditions necessary for the application of the Schengen acquis. A small number of issues remain to be evaluated and we are looking forward to receiving the Commission’s proposal for implementing decisions thereon in the near future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 135, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks for adding this very important debate to the agenda and, in particular to thank Mr Gianni Pittella for this initiative. I know that this was – and remains – a priority for all political groups. Only some days ago we also had a fruitful and frank discussion in the Justice and Home Affairs Council with the Ministers of the Interior.  Let me start by highlighting the following. No matter how much work we collectively do in the three institutions, in the end, we will be judged by our success or failure only on three or four topics. Schengen is one of them. For our citizens, it is the symbol of the European Union itself. It is the most tangible example of European integration. It represents all the rights and benefits of being European, as it is closely connected to the freedom of movement and the notion of European citizenship. You all know my personal commitment to safeguarding and upholding Schengen since the very first moment I took office. We said in the past that a unified Schengen is a stronger Schengen. We are convinced that Bulgaria, Romania and also Croatia, as soon as it is ready, should fully join the Schengen family. This will enlarge the area of free movement and make the Schengen tools perform better and thus increase security. For a long time the Commission’s position is that Bulgaria and Romania already fulfil the necessary conditions. They were positively assessed between 2009 and 2011. As you know, it is now for the Council to decide on the lifting of internal border controls with Bulgaria and Romania unanimously, and it is high time that this happened. Our discussion with the Interior Ministers last week left me optimistic that there is agreement that this issue must now again be seriously considered. As far as Croatia is concerned, we are working closely with the authorities to identify the areas where improvements are still necessary in order to positively conclude all the Schengen evaluations as soon as possible. This will allow us in the Commission to complete the first stage and conclude that Croatia is also ready to join Schengen. Then it will again be for the Council to decide. The Schengen evaluations in 2016 and 2017 verify the necessary conditions for the application of all relevant parts of the acquis. In some areas, Croatia meets the necessary conditions for joining Schengen. In other areas, further improvement is required, and we stand by the Croatian authorities to continue with the same commitment. A full implementation of the Schengen acquis will also allow the drawing of full benefits from systems such as a Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System in relations between Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and the other Schengen states. It would also allow them to implement the Entry—Exit System in the most efficient way, without installing it in border sections which would become internal borders after their accession to Schengen. The implementation of the EES will be a particular challenge for Croatia given its long land border. Here the European Union is willing to provide support. Finally, the setting up of the ADS will strengthen the management of the external borders and therefore Schengen. Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia are playing their equal part in protecting the European Union’s external borders. Fully joining Schengen is not only politically fair, but it is also needed from a security point of view, because the internal security of one Member State is the internal security of all and the security of all our citizens. I hope that we can welcome these Member States to Schengen soon following a positive decision by the Council. As I said before, from the moment that I took office, I have been advocating that we need a strong and unified Schengen. Today I would like to commend and to praise the authorities of the three countries for their commitment. We are running the last mile. Let us run it all together. Today the Parliament and the Commission, tomorrow the Council. I hope your message will be heard by the Council, Mr Pittella.

It is a dream come true. After World War II, few people could imagine that one day Europe would be united and living in peace. Seventy-two years after, borders between European countries do not exist any more. They exist only on maps and in the heads of those who want to destroy the Union. Four hundred million nationals of more than 25 different states travelling free with no passport check, with no border controls and within a single country: this is what Europeans have accomplished, and we have to be very proud of it. But Schengen will not be completed until all members who want to be part of it have the chance to join. My Group has a clear position on this: any Member State that fulfils the membership criteria should join Schengen, and the truth is that Bulgaria and Romania fulfil these criteria. Already in 2011 this House adopted the Coelho report confirming that Romania and Bulgaria were sufficiently well prepared, and regarding Croatia, even if they have not yet fulfilled all the conditions, they are making great progress. In this situation, trying to politicise this debate with different issues is a huge mistake. First, because these three countries are not in the same situation, and second, because accession to Schengen cannot be mixed with the cooperation and verification mechanism. The decision on accession to Schengen must be based on technical criteria, and a delay based on political reasons is simply unacceptable. There are no first-class and second-class countries. We are all European countries and we all deserve the best. That is why we stand today with our Romanian, Croatian and Bulgarian colleagues. This is what we can all call solidarity, and the day we stop showing solidarity among us is the day we will lose the right to call ourselves Europeans.

As was already said, it is difficult to imagine the European Union today without Schengen. This is a very tangible expression of our solidarity and of the freedom and unity of European citizens, and it brings a lot of economic benefits – but not for all Europeans. For six years now, Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the criteria for membership, and what is happening is a double standard and treating the two countries in a discriminatory way. It should be stopped, because it may look as though this is an issue only for Bulgaria and Romania, but it affects very fundamental issues and principles of the European Union. First, it is about credibility if we as a Union follow our own rules. We do not. Second, the economic benefits will bring benefits to all citizens of the European Union. Thirdly, it is about security. Instead of wasting money for internal controls, we should strengthen through resources and enough financing the external borders of the Union. This is what is needed; this is what is effective. We often complain that anti-European forces, populists, are using arguments against the European Union.

Since then, the Commission has been monitoring the situation through the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, called CVM for short. Recently, together with my ECR colleague Macovei, I denounced recent developments in Romania. The government had issued ordinances to condone tax crimes and thwart police investigations and lawsuits, all to keep corrupt rulers in power. I asked the European Commission to follow up on the matter. Romania was therefore judged on this in this year's CVM report. When assessing the eligibility of these three EU Member States, we should focus on the CVM reports of November 2017. This also applies to the provisions on organized crime. After all, the Schengen area has no internal borders. It is therefore fundamental to avoid importing crime into our regions in this way. However, little progress has been noted.

That is the European ideal, and that is being expressed by Schengen. Every Member State has the right, but even the obligation, to join Schengen as soon as it fulfils the criteria for the common membership. And those conditions, those criteria, are very clear. They are crystal clear and the procedures should not be changed in the middle of the process.  Precisely because Schengen is so important, it is such an important right for all European citizens, it cannot be withheld from particular Member States and from their citizens. It is a right, and we cannot allow second-class citizens to be established. Another rightful expectation of citizens is that the rule of law be upheld. If we are looking now at Romania, this does not seem to be totally guaranteed. We are very worried about the proposed changes to the justice laws that are currently being discussed and debated in the Romanian parliament, and EU citizens in Romania are expecting Europe to do something about it. I think we absolutely have to do something, and I want to thank those people in Romania who go out on the street and demonstrate for their rights, for democracy, and are telling all of us, all the time reminding us, that democracy is more than going to vote once in a while, it is more than having the rule of the majority. It tells us that there is also the responsibility of the majority for all citizens. We stand with you.

Dear colleagues, democracy is about respecting the vote. In Romania, the prospect of joining the Schengen area has become a kind of discussion about the sex of angels, Mr. President, colleagues - that is, as scientific as it is useless. All politicians promise in the election campaign that they will convince Europeans to receive Romania in Schengen, but neither the citizens nor the politicians themselves believe such a thing. A few months ago, President Macron came to Bucharest and from there went to Sofia to convince us to support France's position on the Posting of Workers Directive. When asked about the Schengen area, he cut it short: Schengen must be reformed and, only after that, we are talking about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. I understood very well the retention of the Western countries regarding the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to Schengen in 2007. I also understood it in 2010. I was able to accept this in 2012. During all this time, the efforts to secure the border cost many, many money. In 2015, however, the invasion of refugees did not take place in Romania or in Bulgaria, dear colleagues. It is clear that keeping these countries out of Schengen has another reason. I can also understand this reason: namely that some countries or some politicians in the West believe that the Union must have two speeds. I can also understand President Macron, who suggests that he would like to renegotiate the Schengen agreement. What I can't understand is hypocrisy and false friends.

To intervene to stop this Islamic terrorism. I address this plea to you: we must stop these terrorists, we must stop Islamic terrorism, the invasion, the immigrants who are arriving.

At the heart of that, he said that Schengen was precious to the whole idea of the European Union. I have never heard, in all the years that I have been here, a stronger case made for anything about the central cause of this European Union. Let us also be clear about this institution, the European Parliament, for anyone who is in any doubt. Since 2011, for six long years, the European Parliament in its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), has had unambiguous majority debates, well—examined, detailed debates, making one conclusion, namely that second class status for Romania and Bulgaria is not an option. They must be fully integrated into Schengen. We have supported the measures to grant Romania and Bulgaria access to the Entry-Exit System, the Visa Information System. We have even talked about visa-free travel to the US. We are doing this and being proactive in this cause, not just because we believe it, but because we have examined the case for these countries. This is a case not just for justice but for practicality. This is not just a case for the politics, but for understanding what it means for Romania and Bulgaria to be full members. Then I refer again to the Commission and I ask the Council on this: this has not been a static process. In all of these six years, we have been strengthening the external border: Entry-Exit System, external border controls, the border agency, one of the fastest files ever created in this Parliament. All these measures and the hard work that has gone on with all of the issues of privacy and individual liberties that we had to tackle was to safeguard the external border. With all of this, we can surely ask that today there is an unambiguous and clear demand that two countries have justice and are fully integrated Member States of the European Union.

Freedom of movement without internal borders has been balanced since the beginning of this idea. Balanced not only by the important protection of the external borders, but also by a system of a number of other related regulations. Over the last two years, the security aspect of the Schengen area has significantly strengthened.

Since the summer of 2011, the Commission and the Parliament consider that Romania is ready to enter the free movement area. Since then, several European governments have opposed this entry. The argument was that the security of the Schengen area is affected by the defective way in which the rule of law in Romania works. The Cooperation and Verification Mechanism thus became the key that was to open the Shengen gate. In the last five years, the governments of Bucharest have had three attitudes regarding MCV. The first was the direct undermining of justice, including constitutional justice. The Ponta government and the majority of PSD-PNL threw Romania, in the summer of 2012, into a very serious institutional crisis, adding new criteria to be met in the MCV file. Later, upset that the Europeans were waiting for an independent judiciary, Prime Minister Ponta and Foreign Minister Corlățean said that they were no longer interested in Schengen. The second attitude was the effort to improve the functioning of justice. It is the short period, unfortunately, in which Dacian Cioloș was prime minister. Finally, at the beginning of the year, the assault on the rule of law was resumed by the Grindeanu and Tudose governments. The majority of PSD-ALDE wants to limit the independence of magistrates and protect the corrupt. In January they used an emergency ordinance adopted at midnight. For several weeks they have had a voting machine at hand, well greased by corrupt people, sailors or incompatible deputies.

It is not the Jamaican repeater, but the Schengen space is, for me, the most large realization of the European Union, for all the citizens, and all of them in Europe, but also for our economies. Plus, Schengen is a symbol of confusion between member states. This is a sign that European countries work together, live together and not against each other. If the migratory and security defects are not necessary because of the strains, adaptations, reforms of the Schengen space, and the implicit face-to-face approach to return to the future. These members will, on the contrary, be placed together as one, in one Schengen space more than one. This is because Bulgaria and Romania, at the same time, have deviated members from the interior of the Schengen area and Croatia has the same distance as before. Bulgaria and Romania have demonstrated their capacity to carry members within the Schengen area and can only be measured in a very good way. The space of Schengen space resides in the right balance between two important principles: freedom of movement and the necessity of getting face to face with importers of security. Also, the reproduction of the controls on the internal fronts stops the reception, the repetition stops the reception. This is why the Commission has submitted a proposal to modify the Schengen frontier codes in order to maintain this balance and to achieve a coordinated approach of the European Union in terms of internal frontier controls. Contraceptive of a possibility of longer reintroduction of control over internal fronts, in order to tighten the procedures and to cooperate with the moving members. There are several constituent ravines like Bulgaria, which Assuring the presidency is determined to advance these dossiers as a matter of priority. Continuous, permettez-moi of parler for every few minutes in Greek to respond to the preoccupations of the Greek members of Parliament. Mr President, I have just said that you will allow me to respond in Greek to the concerns of Greek MEPs. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that Germany has imposed increased controls on flights from Greece. But both the Greek and German authorities are cooperating to resolve this issue and of course I in turn encourage the continuation of this cooperation. We are also in contact with the authorities of both countries. As you may have recalled, a tripartite meeting of experts was held on 22 November at the initiative of the Commission, ie Greece, Germany and the Commission. The meeting facilitated the constructive exchange of views and the discussion on practical issues in order to reduce, in particular, the burden on passengers. I do not hide the fact that I accepted with satisfaction the assurances given by Germany, according to which the checks will now be carried out only at the gate inside the Schengen arrivals area of ​​the German airports. Checks are practically limited to the authentication and validity of travel documents. So far we have not received any information to the contrary from either the German or the Greek side. I also welcomed the clarification by the representatives of Greece regarding the strengthening of the existing controls at the Greek airports. We will continue to work closely and in a always constructive spirit with Germany and Greece to resolve this issue. As far as Belgium is concerned, the Belgian authorities have officially informed us that they are carrying out non-systematic, ie simply sporadic, police checks at Brussels airport, on the basis of risk assessments, and this is not the case. only with flights coming from Greece but also from other member states of the European Union. I must tell you that the Greek authorities do the same from time to time, when there is exactly a risk assessment. All European Union countries have this right and from time to time they exercise it when there is a notice. So it was something that happened once; it has not happened in between. Let me tell you that I also travel from Greece to Belgium and I did not feel that there was anything special. I think the reaction was excessive but it was right, in any case, to clarify this issue as well. Let me remind you that these police checks are not arbitrary. They are provided for in the Schengen border code and that alone. Especially for France, since it was mentioned earlier, let me remind you that it has reintroduced temporary border controls like other countries. In my introductory speech I explained how the situation is. Now you will allow me to change and speak English again, to answer questions from your colleagues. I will turn to English to answer some of your questions. One of them was from Ms Fajon. Yes, six Member States are currently carrying out temporary internal border controls in line, as I said before, with the Schengen rules. I welcome that these Member States too share the goal of returning to an area without internal border controls. According to these Member States, the controls are being carried out in a targeted manner and strictly limited to safeguarding public policy or internal security, and the impact on free movement will be limited. The Commission is in close contact with them. My services are finalizing the analysis of all letters received and, whenever further clarifications are needed, follow-up letters will be sent. As I said already, internal border controls are an exception used only as a measure of last resort. It is important now that Member States make progress in the discussions on a proposal to update the Schengen Borders Code to be fit for the current context. Here I want to be crystal clear: the Commission’s objective is and will continue to be to preserve and strengthen the Schengen area as an area without controls at internal borders. I am glad to see that we here share the same objective. I have also carefully listened to the strong message of Mr Moraes, Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). I would like to qualify him as a guardian of Schengen because he has been advocating and fighting for it from the very first moment. He has been expressing the full support of this House, through the LIBE Committee, for Bulgaria and Romania and Croatia to join Schengen as soon as possible. Once more, I hope that the Council - because it is now up to the Council to take the final decision - will hear this double call from this room: the call of the Commission and the call of Parliament, and that we will all of us very soon be in the happy position of opening the doors of the European Union to our co-citizens, co-Europeans, of Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 171, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Josef WEIDENHOLZER", "mepid": "111014", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, please be reassured that the Presidency has taken good note of all the comments that were made today on this subject, including that of Commissioner Avramopoulos at the end of the debate.

The pillar has rightly attracted a very high level of attention. On 17 November at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg, our three institutions – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – proclaimed the 20 rights and principles of the social pillar. The purpose of the pillar is to serve as a guide towards more efficient social and employment outcomes while taking into due account different socio-economic environments and the diversity of national systems. The tools for delivering on the pillar are in the hands of the Member States, the social partners, civil society and the EU institutions. We must respect national competences, as well as the diversity that exists in Europe. We must all do our utmost to make the pillar a reality for our citizens. This is our shared political commitment and responsibility. The pillar sets the framework for various legislative and non-legislative initiatives, including the first legislative proposal on work-life balance, which is currently under discussion in the Parliament and in the Council. The Council is also looking forward to working with you on the proposal to revise the Written Statement Directive. Further initiatives are included in the 2018 Commission Work Programme, more specifically the social fairness package with proposals on a European Labour Authority, access to social protection for atypical workers and a European social security number. As far as the implementation of the pillar is concerned, another very important instrument is the European Semester for economic policy coordination. The European Pillar of Social Rights also ties in with the discussion on the social dimension of Europe taking place in the framework of the broader debate on the future of Europe. During the Estonian Presidency, the Council adopted political commitments to reduce gender segregation in education and employment to facilitate independent living and to respond to the ongoing changes in the world of work. We also reached a general approach on the European accessibility act. I would like to thank the European Parliament for its strong commitment to a more social Europe. Your strong impetus helped to make the social pillar happen. We all agree on these principles, it is now time to put our values into practice. We look forward to working together as co-legislators in an endeavour to promote the social dimension, hand-in-hand with further deepening of economic convergence, implementing and enforcing the single market in all its dimensions by June 2018, just as our Heads of State or Government have repeatedly called for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, on 17 November in Gothenburg, the three European political institutions proclaimed our European Pillar of Social Rights at the first social summit in 20 years. This proclamation is a unifying message to our citizens and to the world. In Europe, we share important social values and we stand ready to defend a shared vision for a fair society now and in the future. The European Parliament had indeed a major role in shaping the Pillar, and I would like to thank the President of the Parliament, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), the President of the EMPL Committee and the rapporteur Ms Rodrigues and the shadow rapporteur Mr Tom Vandenkendelaere and the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their steering role and political commitment to the Pillar ahead of the Gothenburg summit. The Pillar is our chance to reconnect Europe with its citizens. As the Commission President rightly said, if we want to be credible, we have to deliver. The time has come to make sure that the Pillar’s rights and principles are effectively guiding our actions at European, national, regional and local level. The Pillar is essentially a joint endeavour. Its implementation should entail full respect of subsidiarity and the division of competences within the Union, as well as of the role of the social partners in delivering employment policies in Member States. This is the message that I have just sent to all Ministers, social partners and all the stakeholders. I strongly encourage Member States to continue their efforts to make the Pillar a reality on the ground, in close cooperation with the social partners and the civil society at large. We, from our side, will make full use of the European Semester. The European Semester will be the key instrument to steer the process of social convergence every year, and we are starting now. The 2018 Annual Growth Survey already makes clear that the Semester will be key for delivering the Pillar. The joint employment report includes the new social scoreboard to monitor areas covered by the Pillar, such as the share of school leavers, the youth unemployment rate or the impact of social transfers on poverty reduction. The employment guidelines – as you know, the legal basis for the country specific recommendations – have been aligned with the principles of the Pillar. We will now bring this forward in our bilateral contacts with Member States within the framework of the Semester, where we will identify together the main challenges. The Commission is already doing its part to translate the Pillar into concrete initiatives. We proposed an initiative on work-life balance, and I welcome the Estonian Presidency’s efforts to make progress on our proposal, and I count on you to deliver on this important file within the mandate of this Parliament. As the social partners could not agree to start negotiations for an autonomous social partner agreement, next week we will present a proposal on the revision of the Written Statement Directive. The aim of this proposal is to increase the rights for the most vulnerable workers. We want to ensure clarity for workers and employers on their contractual relationship, irrespective of the type of the contract. We are also working on a social fairness package, to be launched on 7 March 2018. This social fairness package will include a proposal for a European labour authority and one on a European social security number, to ensure that European Union rules on labour mobility are enforced in a fair, simple and effective way. It will also comprise an initiative on improving the access to social protection of people employed on non-standard contracts and in various forms of self-employment. To achieve our aims, we also need a budget. The negotiations on the financial programming after 2020 are crucial. The European Pillar of Social Rights should be a compass to guide us also in these negotiations. We count on the support of the Parliament for working in this direction and to make the social dimension of Europe visible also in the next Multiannual Financial framework (MFF). We can only build a fair and a more social Europe by working together. Our common goal is to improve the life chances of every European. I count on you to help deliver on all our legislative initiatives that are implementing the Pillar, and I count on all Members of this House to be ambassadors of the Pillar, and to tell your constituents that the European Union stands up for the rights of its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Tom VANDENKENDELAERE", "mepid": "129164", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - The European Pillar of Social Rights was signed on 17 November at the Social Summit in Gothenburg.

At the same time, a strong signal has also been given that the European story is not only about the economy, but also about the social, that we must move forward in both areas. And that is necessary. The rise of digital platforms and the associated economic revolution is undermining all established principles of our labor market. New forms of work are emerging. Old jobs, such as the man or the woman at the checkout in the store, will eventually disappear and new jobs, such as the Deliveroo bicycle courier, will take their place. Our social security and labor market policies really have to adapt to this. The key question is actually very simple: who will protect those people? My answer is clear: then we must do. Europe must do that and the European Parliament must also be able to do that. In doing so, we should not only focus on fair competition, as we do with the abuse of posted workers. We must also ask ourselves what the new labor market will mean for European citizens. What about pensions, social rights, digital literacy? That's where the social pillar can show us the way. That is precisely the function of the social pillar as a compass.

This is the level of ambition we should bear in mind. And we should have a second ambition, which is to make sure that all European citizens, wherever they live or work, in all Member States, can count on a powerful upward social and economic convergence, because we are still dealing with many inequalities, and without stronger cohesion there is no future for the European project. Now, after the proclamation, the time for delivery has come, and let me be precise on the expectations from the S&amp;D Group. We are now really focused on making sure that all people in employment, whatever the kind of job, can count on two very important things. One is a transparent and decent labour contract. This is particularly important for young people. The second thing is full access to social protection throughout the life cycle, and we believe these are two key pieces to building a welfare system for the 21st century. So we are now expecting the Commission to table a legislative initiative on this, now that the social partners could not come to an agreement. But let me also say that we believe that updating social standards and social law is not enough. We need to redirect social policies and economic policies, and that is why the European Semester is so important, because the European Semester must become a powerful process to coordinate these policies for upward convergence.

The competence for the European labor markets lies with the nation states for good reason. Each nation state is responsible for what social benefits it can afford and what it cannot do financially. That is why there is also a ban on assuming liability in the euro zone. Every nation-state must answer for the social benefits that it should not have afforded. With the social pillar, the planned creation of a European labor authority in the first half of 2018, the European social security number and various other legislative initiatives, attempts are being made to draw labor market skills to the Union level. The foundations of the European treaties will be changed, because responsibility for politics will also shift responsibility for costs to the European level. This undermines the principle of personal responsibility. Furthermore, one would like to enforce convergence, the economic approximation of the member states, especially within the euro zone. This requires transfers between the Member States. Social rights should lead to the right to transfer. These transfers will create convergence from above, the exact opposite of what was promised to people at the beginning of the Eurosystem. The fiscally responsible countries should share their relative prosperity, if one can speak of it, with everyone. The social rights pillar is not just a catalog of ideas for Member States to use. Although the concerns presented in the 20 principles are not legally binding and the implementation is to be transferred to the responsibility of the national governments, the choice of words, the emphasis on \"rights\" and \"principles\" can be used by courts, possibly also by the European Court of Justice, that is actually derived from this Claims.The ECJ has already used political documents of this type in other cases to assess the division of powers.The FCR is skeptical of the social pillar for the reasons mentioned.We reject a substantial work and social model of the EU.Subsidiarity and personal responsibility are our principles, and they used to be the principles of the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Enrique CALVET CHAMBON", "mepid": "129407", "text": "au nom du groupe ALDE. - Monsieur le Président, c’est toujours un plaisir de débattre avec vous, Madame le Commissaire, et d'avoir l’honneur de vous parler, mais je continue in Spanish.

A brief reply to Mrs Trebesius: I do not know whether you can argue with the same self-confidence and arrogance towards the homeless and hundreds of thousands of poor people in the European Union that the European Union should still be a Union in which first the interests of the banks and the economy are served and in which we are no longer interested in what we have in common - the cohesion of the Union.

So I just want to address one point because I think we're still going around in circles at the moment and the cat is biting its tail. If it has now been decided that the Fiscal Compact will be transposed into EU law, in my view that does not mean any improvement in our situation and the contradictions in which we find ourselves. As long as the priorities in the European Semester are still directed towards not exceeding the debt limit, intervening in budgetary management and allowing cuts, especially in social, educational and health expenditure, we will always come into conflict.

This, dear colleagues, is the wording of Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this perspective, we are delighted that the European Pillar of Social Rights has finally been officially validated by European Heads of State or Government. If all the rights set out in this document - the right to equality, the right to education and health, the right to a job and to a decent income, the right to social protection - were realized in practice, the He European Union would have made immense progress on the path to shared prosperity. But now, this catalog of rights is at this stage only a declaration of intent, and we do not yet see the emergence, within the European political space, of a majority to transform it into binding legislation, a necessary condition that these objectives are achieved. We have seen this with the “EU 2020” strategy which gave us the objective of reducing the number of poor people in Europe by 20 million and, three years from the end, that is to say 2020, we can do anything. at most hope that this figure, after having increased by 6 million, returns to its level of 2010. The situation is clearly catastrophic within the euro zone. So, well-meaning people will tell me that the best way to guarantee social rights is employment. The Commission recently welcomed the unemployment rate to return to its pre-crisis level, but at what cost? To that of constrained part-time work, even 0-hour contracts, to that of wages below the poverty line or that of massive exclusions? Even the European Central Bank admits it: the rate of underemployment, twice that of unemployment, is the only true measure of the phenomenon. If work lifted people out of poverty, we would not have 21 million working poor in Europe. The crux of the matter is that, in their choice of economic policy, the majorities in power in the Member States and at the European level go completely against the requirements of the social rights base.

And on November 17, two years later, so after long gestation times, in great fashion, with great fanfare, in Gothenburg we finalized the creation of a container, nothing more. A beautiful vase that today, however, we have the duty to fill with concrete proposals and effective measures. Certainly an important instrument, which must guarantee social justice, must guarantee hope for all those citizens who today, within the European Union, see their rights and protections increasingly mistreated, from the essential ones, such as housing. , like food, like clothing, to wages, to occupational ones. Today we have an important commitment to make, which is to make an instrument, a base, a truly solid instrument, a vessel filled with concrete proposals. The Commission will probably provide us with the proposal for some directives; those must be the basis for giving concrete answers. Europe asks us for hope, it thirsts for hope, it thirsts for social justice. Here, I believe that starting to put pen to paper legislative proposals that give a real dimension to the need for hope is a commitment. Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the need to create this pillar aimed at upward convergence. The document on which we worked with my colleague Rodríguez is fundamental, and I will never tire of saying that I believe that the European minimum guaranteed income instrument is an effective tool, which can allow the millions of citizens living in poverty and social exclusion to to have guaranteed a dignified life. I believe that upward convergence is done by thinking that the rules do not apply for some and are interpreted for others.Mr Trebesius, I come from a country that has a non-positive vision in the eyes of him.Yet what do we want to do with the surplus from Germany?When will your country decide to take responsibility for the macroeconomic imbalances it has caused in other states?There is a need for upward convergence, yes, but there is a need for social justice.So the rules must apply to everyone, my country will respect them, because it is right and necessary, but it is also necessary that the other countries, those that for years and in a thousand different ways have been damaging certain economies, take on the responsibility of putting an end tocertain practices and policies that certainly damage the economy of others, who unfortunately now live in conditions of poverty and social exclusion.This is not a polemic against him, but I firmly believe that solidarity is a principle on which the European Parliament was founded and that it must be respected.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Auke ZIJLSTRA", "mepid": "103246", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group.- The Ministers of Social Affairs have approved 20 principles as social pillars of the European Union and these are mainly socialist principles, which are priceless and deprive freedom.Intervening in the labor market, intervention in wage development, intervention in entrepreneurship, intervention in pensions, the unions are back in power.Now socialist ministers are allowed to pursue socialist ideals, but this is worse.They will be EU principles and soon European values.That is why it is no longer part of our national democracy, we have lost that sovereignty.With this socialist policy as EU law, it becomes illegal to pursue other political principles nationally.Socialism becomes the state religion.Am I now the only one here who finds the European Union getting a little scarier every day?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS", "mepid": "125090", "text": "- Mr President, with the pillar of so-called social rights, the European Union is even surpassing itself in making black and white.

The pillar should lead to better access to social security for all, longer parental leave and better working conditions for workers in the platform economy. However, the plans for the reform of the EMU do not take the pillar into account, and the joint declaration to be signed tomorrow does not mention the social pillar. Also in the Commission work program for 2018 there is more emphasis on economic proposals than on social ones, not to mention the competence battle between Member States and the Commission. You no doubt understand my concerns and the concerns of many of my colleagues. After all, it is time for concrete measures to be taken that so many Europeans long for.

We have realised that they are creating a problem in every single European country, making it impossible to form the government, spreading xenophobia, etc., which are serious problems, and therefore we started to fight them by closing the borders and starting to be protectionistic. I feel this is the wrong way to go. It might jeopardise growth, it might jeopardise openness and mobility, and it might end up by not minimising the extreme right. Then we have a double problem. The social dimension is the right strategy if we want the EU to be something more than a single market, but do not let it be nationalism and protectionism.

Social scars that have above all a common pattern: inequality. Inequality between countries, divergence - when we were a converging machine - and inequality within countries. An inequality that has generated pockets of poverty, fear, uncertainty, and resentment. Things we have seen every time we opened the polls on the continent in recent years. And it is in this framework - in a time of social fractures - that the European institutions have agreed on a European pillar of social rights. A positive step, a step in the right direction, a modest step - it must also be said - that wants to establish opportunities, working conditions and social protection. Which for us is seen, for the socialists, as the soul of the European project. But we need this soul to take shape, to take shape in the form of binding regulations, public policies, instruments and resources necessary to regulate working conditions in the face of precariousness and wage devaluation; to fight against gender discrimination; to face the pockets of child poverty that we have. And to do all this also within the framework of the European Semester, the true machinery for the coordination of economic policies of the Union. That is why we are disappointed that the Commission's legislative agenda is still poor. This cannot become another source of frustration for citizens.

And if they fall on the scaffolding or get injured, then they do not have to wait for much help, because the social cuts that follow from the fiscal pact and the European Semester have pulled the safety net away under the vast majority. That is why it also sounds hollow when the EU elite last month launched a social pillar to solve the problems. After all, the European Semester and the Internal Market are enshrined in the EU's fundamental treaties and take precedence over everything else. And then \"a social pillar\" becomes just fine words.

Big and beautiful declarations of intent are still the best thing Eurobeaters can do. But consider, for example, the question of the minimum wage. Six Member States, and not the least, do not have minimum wages set by law or by cross-sectoral agreement: Denmark, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, Finland and Sweden. And among the other States, what disparities! In France, the gross minimum wage is around 1,500 euros, as in the Netherlands, Belgium or Germany. In Luxembourg, it is almost 2,000 euros, but it is less than 500 euros in no less than nine countries, even going down to 275 euros in Romania. How can we not believe that harmonization will lead to a race to the bottom? But beyond these disparities that cannot be eliminated with a magic wand, the fundamental problem with all your catalogs of good intentions is the total lack of questioning. The European Commission claims to provide solutions to problems for which it is largely responsible: budgetary austerity, unfair intra-European competition, with in particular the posting of workers, a single currency whose rigidity and management penalize the economies of many our countries and, of course, the removal of border protections. We used to talk about the \"social pillar\", now it's the \"base\". The Commission is thus trying to create an illusion of stability, but the European Union is - you know - more fragile than ever. In a recent interview with a Belgian daily, you said, Commissioner, that “we want competition to be fair”. So you recognize that it is not!

Let me continue if you will allow me, dear Mr President, in my mother tongue - in Dutch - because I know that we have a perfect interpretation service here. The proclamation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, ladies and gentlemen, is ultimately, as we all know, a start. It is a good thing that we are having a good debate here today, because we ultimately need to build on a social Europe here. We must discuss the next steps together. I see this debate today as the start of that debate. We have set ambitious goals, most certainly. We have said that we want more convergence in Europe, that we want upward convergence in Europe, that is, better working and living conditions for our citizens. We also said that with our pillar we want to adapt our social institutions to the conditions of the 21st century, to ensure that we have a competitive, a dynamic, but also an inclusive market economy, that we can build a social market economy that makes it possible for our people to have and to take good opportunities in the field of education, training, lifelong learning, access to the labor market, fair working conditions and access to social security, to social protection and adapted accessible, affordable basic services. That is our ambition, no more and no less. And we must of course do this with respect for the internal market, that leaves no doubt. The internal market is also an asset to achieve this. Many colleagues have said in the debate that we ignore subsidiarity, that we are entering the territory of the Member States. I would ask all those colleagues who have commented on this to read the preamble to the pillar. Look at points 17 and 18 in the recitals and then you will see what the framework is that we put together have agreed. We have to make that happen together. We are not changing the division of powers, but that means that the importance of cooperation is all the more important and that is why it is also good that we have proclaimed the European Pillar of Social Rights together with the three political institutions. This also means that we must take responsibility together, each in his own field, and that we must also work on this in the future. There have also been quite a few comments about the fact that on the economic side the Commission is not quite sure what it wants on the social side and vice versa. Let me point out that we have taken a clearly deliberate approach from the start of this Commission. This applies to tax policy, budgetary policy, our trade policy and the way we deal with the social partners. In the field of tax policy, I refer to the numerous proposals that have already been made by my colleagues in charge of tax policy, Moscovici and others. By the way, these proposals are supported throughout the Commission, by the decisions taken by Mr Vestager, to ensure that we get fair taxes, that taxes are not eroded. We make maximum use of the powers that we have for this purpose. This Commission has a smart budgetary policy. We make maximum use of the flexibility available in the Stability and Growth Pact and we speak to Member States so that we do not have to penalize. That is not our point, but rather encouraging the member states to pursue a sustainable fiscal policy. Because let us not forget that: without sustainable tax conditions we cannot develop sustainable social policy. On trade, I invite you to look at the new trade agreements concluded under this Commission. You will see that there is a lot more attention to the social and to a number of aspects of our citizens rightly expect from us. There is more transparency and more attention is also paid to a number of aspects that may have been slightly pushed aside in the past. And with regard to the social partners, the social dialogue, I would like to point out that this Commission has made and continues to make a great effort to relaunch the social dialogue and in order to build capacity in the Member States, the social dialogue must be launched or should be promoted. We also consult the social partners in much more areas than we are obliged to under the treaty and we like to do this because we very much appreciate their added value, both for the design and the implementation of our policy. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen in Parliament, Mr President of the Council, the Pillar Proclamation sends a very clear message. That is a message of unity, a message of hope and a message of action. A message of unity, that we in Europe know what we want together and defend the same values, the values ​​that we have proclaimed together. The Council with a mandate from all 28 Member States and the other institutions have jointly proclaimed this pillar. That is a sign that we defend the same values ​​and we must now prove that we do. The responsibility for this rests with each of those who have signed and proclaimed this pillar. It is also a sign of hope, because it gives hope to the people that we are doing things, that we know that the future is in our hands and that if we have a good policy we can shape that future in such a way ' In a way that all people can count on us to accompany all changes in society and in the economy and that they themselves, and also their children, still have a good future. It is also a message of action, because we have taken joint responsibility. This should give a boost to everyone to act effectively on the words one has itself proclaimed.That is also the atmosphere, ladies and gentlemen, that I have felt here today in this debate and that strengthens me, as far as I am concerned, to continue working from the Commission on the implementation of that pillar.Because it ultimately comes down to realizing that pillar in the field.We have promised a lot and we will all have to work on it now.If we keep our promise, each in their own field, and if we are all ambassadors of that pillar together, then we should succeed.That is the task that awaits us.As mentioned, that pillar is a beginning and not an end.It depends on us what we make of it, but I'm optimistic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 231, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and the honourable Members for a very rich and timely debate.

It does not detract from the intention to level below the living and working conditions in Europe. On the contrary, it gives you shelter. Social justice is inseparable from economic policy. A truly social Europe is not compatible with the policies of the Euro, Banking Union, Economic Governance, the European Semester, militarization and securitization, the constant attack on sovereignty and the development of peoples. It is clear that, while discussing the “Social Pillar”, it is decided to internalize the so-called Budget Treaty in the EU legal order.

demonstrated strong leadership in the negotiations that led to the adoption of the 2030 agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015. We must continue to lead the implementation phase as well. After agreeing on what to do, we now have an obligation to do it at national as well as at the EU level.  The joint adoption of the new European consensus last June is certainly a very important step, as it will guide both the EU and its Member States for the next 12 to 15 years. The Member States have been leading by example, notably through voluntary national reporting in the context of the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. However, more needs to be done in terms of implementation at the EU level across all policies – internal and external. The Commission Communication of 22 November 2016 was a step in that direction. However, the Council, in its conclusions from 20 June 2017, urged the Commission to elaborate by mid-2018 a comprehensive implementation strategy to reflect the 2030 agenda in all relevant EU policies. The Council largely shares the views expressed by the European Parliament in that regard in its own-initiative report that was adopted last July. The EU needs a clear vision of how all relevant EU policies will contribute to the realisation of the 2030 Agenda in a comprehensive and holistic manner. At this stage, the Council is certainly looking forward to receiving more specific sectoral implementation proposals from the Commission. In this respect, the Council adapted its working methods to be better able to monitor the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals at EU level in a holistic manner.  The Council, under the Estonian Presidency, established a dedicated Council working party that will deal with the Agenda 2030. The mandate of this working party will be to ensure systematic, effective, participatory, transparent and integrated follow-up and review of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at EU level in order to track progress, assess achievements and ensure accountability.  The working group starts its work in early 2018 and will be reporting to the General Affairs Council. Also, in November the Council welcomed the first implementation monitoring report on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in the EU prepared recently by Eurostat. Even though this is still early days, the report provides useful insights in terms of trends, showing that our performance is on the right track with some goals, but less so on several others. However, there is a need for a fully-fledged analysis of gaps and a comprehensive EU implementation strategy to ensure that all policies are covered, both internal and external.

The 2030 Agenda prescribes a regular follow—up and review of progress towards the SDGs as a crucial element to support accountability to citizens. Governments have the primary responsibility for follow—up and review at national, regional and global levels. To follow up and review the goals and targets, the 2030 Agenda foresees the development of a reference indicator framework for global monitoring, complemented by indicators at regional and national levels, which will be developed by the Member States. The European Union has its own monitoring process. The Commission Communication on ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future’ of November 2016 announced detailed and regular monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals in an EU context. It also announced the development of a reference indicator framework for this purpose. On 20 November 2017, Eurostat released the first monitoring report. This monitoring report is based on the European Union SDG indicator set, which the Commission developed in cooperation with a large number of partners and stakeholders, including the European Union Member States, Council committees, academia, civil society and international organisations. The indicator set will be regularly reviewed to make sure that it includes the most relevant and highest-quality indicators and that it aligns with the UN global indicators. The European SDG indicator set includes indicators which are relevant from an EU policy perspective and which are already available. They include detailed information on gender, age groups, regions, educational level, degree of urbanisation, income, and disability. Fifty-six of the 100 European Union SDG indicators are also part of the UN set.  Eurostat’s monitoring report builds on Eurostat’s long experience in monitoring sustainable development in the Union. As a matter of fact, from 2005 until 2015, Eurostat regularly monitored progress towards the objectives of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. The report finds that, over the last five years, the European Union has made progress towards all SDGs. Progress for some goals has been faster than for others and within the goals movement away from the sustainable development objectives also occurred in specific areas. The European Union has made significant progress over the last five years towards the overall achievement of the goals concerning affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, life on land, sustainable cities and communities and good health and well—being. But let us be clear about this progress. In this way that progress towards a given goal does not necessarily mean that the status of that goal is satisfactory for the European Union. For example, in the case of terrestrial ecosystems, the indicators mostly show good progress, but this should not lead to the conclusion that ecosystems or biodiversity in the Union are in good health. As an example, common bird species have been declining in the Union since 1990 and only recently showed signs of slight recovery. We also have eight SDGs in which the European Union has, over the last five years, made moderate progress. These concern quality education, partnership for the goals, industry innovation and infrastructure, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, no poverty, zero hunger and reduced inequalities. These results are visually presented on a newly created and dedicated section of Eurostat’s website, which I invite you to consult. There you will find links to additional products, a short brochure, and a series of online articles in the style of Wikipedia, which aim to reach the widest possible audience. To conclude, monitoring progress towards the implementation of the SDGs is essential to meet the expectations raised by the 2030 Agenda.

Next year, the Commission will present a reflection paper ‘Towards a sustainable Europe by 2030’.

Then, on the other side, when we look inside – and I thank Commissioner Thyssen for mentioning this – when you are getting closer to the goals or you have progress that actually does not mean that you have achieved the goal or that the progress would be anything else than just nominal as we can see in biodiversity or in the state of oceans when we refer to life below the waters for example, and other such matters, with the climate effect actions that are being dictated here in Europe very heavily at the moment.

It is a sine qua non for the future of our planet and for the future of our people. Therefore, reaching the sustainable development goals within the EU is vital. To do that, today we now have the Eurostat monitoring report, which should show us the way in the progress that we are making within the European Union. Let me be frank. There is something fundamentally wrong with this report. It says that we are making progress and we are moving in the right direction. It gives us nice arrows and these arrows are painted in hopeful green, but when we peel off the green glitz, we are left with an unsatisfactory report lacking the essential data, focusing on the past and missing the point of the universal character of the SDGs by not taking into account their interconnection nor their impact on EU policies. You could say that, in times of fake news, it is good to have data. Of course that is true, but when you look at the data and you see that, for instance, the 1% is being qualified as progress of the highest category, then we are fooling ourselves. Some say that 15% is a good way forward in the 12 years to come, but if we know that we need 40% to get, for instance, the Paris climate goals in place, then we know that we are fooling ourselves. Heading in the right direction is not the same as being on the right track fast enough to go in that same direction. As you mentioned, Madam Commissioner, some of these SDGs will not be met. They are in your portfolio – no poverty, reducing inequality, decent work. That is really worrying, because it outlines that we do not sufficiently take into account European policy and governance. Let me conclude. We need to revise our measuring tools, using better indicators and data and providing a clear plan for the future. You need to do that not just with Parliament, but also with NGOs.

The survival of our planet is at stake neither more nor less. These objectives adopted in 2015 by 193 countries seem to be reduced for some of our Member States to an essentially academic function. Indeed, their implementation is slow to start. This is not surprising, because this is not the first time that announcements made with great fanfare have not been sufficiently followed up. This is particularly the case for official development assistance. Announced four decades ago, we are still only halfway towards the target of 0.7% relative to GDP. The reason for this failure? It is the lack of a method for obliging Member States to report on the objectives to which they have subscribed. However, the same causes produce the same effects, which is why it is important now to equip ourselves with a method to achieve the objectives for sustainable development. To this end, it would be desirable to know the strategy of each Member State. In addition, it seems to me essential to specify a time axis to know who does what and when. So that these efforts are not in vain, the establishment of a parliamentary control system seems essential to me. Said system of parliamentary control and supervision should respond to the prerogatives of both national parliaments and the European Parliament. Member States responsible for significant gaps in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals should come to the European Parliament to report on their political action in this area.

This is of course what we also have to practise in our external programmes and policies. There needs to be a deep commitment to fighting inequalities and in favour of equality.

We cannot work in silos, and I think this has been understood but not really implemented yet. For instance, in our House we don’t have a mechanism, to my knowledge, to make sure that our efforts for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals are concerted and coordinated. I think we should all together think about a mechanism for how that could be done, because we need to reach true coherence in our policies.  In fact we do have some ideas already from existing policies. We do have the notion of policy coherence for development, which we have been insisting on very much, Mr Goerens, for at least five years if not longer. We should use the mechanisms that we have been able to put in place for Policy Coherence for Development and expand them to all Sustainable Development Goals.

Red and green traffic lights and arrows are not enough, we need deadlines, targets and effective indicators.

We are talking about resources that are needed now, not after 2030, as well as using GDP as the only indicator for sustainable economic growth, and I could go on. Progress in one area does not necessarily mean being on the right track, and in some cases reasoning without quantitative targets based on mere percentage increases can be very deceptive. We have set ourselves a deadline, 2030, unfortunately few politicians work on time horizons that go beyond the next elections, but here we need to make an effort.

Therefore, this shortcoming sends a strong signal on the need to revise the indicator set, to fill the existing gaps and to put in place a more ambitious and comprehensive monitoring system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Krzysztof HETMAN", "mepid": "124895", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

First of all, the Eurostat report indicated that in almost each of the individual objectives there are indicators that have remained unchanged or even deteriorated in recent years. In particular, the lack of progress in reducing inequality and poverty is of particular concern. The Union is presented to other countries as a model of a well-conducted social policy. It can be seen, however, that we still have room for improvement in this area.

I would like to stress that for the Commission the importance of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is beyond dispute. The Council has invited the Commission to prepare for the first EU report on the internal and external implementation of the 2030 Agenda by the EU at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum by 2019. We are starting to prepare for this report with the Reflection Paper due in the second half of 2018. The Reflection Paper is part of the discussion on the future of Europe. It will include the reflection on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as well as the reflection on economic and societal changes. I repeat that this Reflection Paper will be accompanied by a ‘distance-to-SDGs’ analysis to provide, besides the trends, also an understanding of the distance we still need to cover.  The Commission also established, as you know, the SDG multi-stakeholder platform, and there the European Parliament and the Council will be closely associated with the work. You will be engaged via the relevant institutional fora. Moreover, in relation to development policy, the Commission will produce a joint synthesis report with Member States on our implementation of the consensus, including the impact of their actions in support of the 2030 Agenda in developing countries, as a contribution to the EU reporting to the High-Level Political Forum. Some honourable Members mentioned that there are no data for four indicators. It is true that those data are missing. Eurostat is working on it, together with the United Nations, to define those missing indicators. I can tell you that in Europe we have much more data than is available at the United Nations. However, in some cases, data series do not exist and therefore we cannot now show progress in the last five years – I hope it will be progress we can show and not regress, of course. I can tell you that in the future this will be possible, and it will also be possible – I say it again, also possible – to look at the distance from goal. Let me tell you also that the current list of indicators is not fixed in stone; indicator development will continue and the EU framework will be adapted accordingly.  Mr President, dear Members of Parliament, Mr Minister, having said this, the SDGs are sharply formulated goals, and those goals address the main questions of our time. We all know that. Making progress on them is not easy and does not come quickly. That should not be a surprise to any of us. But we also know that we have to measure to know, and indeed monitoring our performance is the first step to knowing where we stand, which in turn is the first step to making progress, and that first step is now taken. I am looking forward to continuing to work together with all of you on the many, many next steps on our way.

Therefore, I would like to start by thanking the European Commission for having very quickly delivered a legislative proposal to amend the Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism. The Civil Protection Mechanism is a good mechanism. It is a very concrete expression of European solidarity, focusing both on the response and on supporting the Member States in preparing for disaster. But the context in which we operate today is evolving rapidly, as we discussed in October. We are faced with an increased number of disasters with a high impact on lives and infrastructure. Forest fires, which hit several Member States in recent months, have shown that we have gaps which affect our capacity to respond effectively to disasters and that we need to prevent and prepare better. I will not go into the details of the Commission’s proposal, which by now is well known to you. Let me just say that this is a very ambitious proposal. It merits a thorough examination by the Council as a matter of urgency, bearing in mind the importance of European solidarity, but also of national responsibility. Discussions will start in the Council as early as next week. In parallel, the Presidency would encourage the Commission to work together with the Member States on all possible intermediary measures which do not require a change in the current legislation. These can bring immediate, concrete improvements, allowing for faster deployments of Member States’ capacities, especially in view of the next forest fire season.

I am grateful for your initiative to debate our proposals to strengthen the Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism and create Rescue, the new structure for our mechanism regarding civil protection. In 2017 we witnessed intense forest fires, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, disasters that claimed human lives, damaged properties, livelihoods and of course the environment, not only inside Europe but also across the world, and unfortunately the list is long. As the Minister has already said, devastating forest fires in Portugal, also in Croatia, Spain, France, Italy, Greece – an extended fire season that lasted until the end of October. It is a very unique phenomenon because, of course, of climate change. At the same time, Hurricane Ophelia in the UK and Ireland caused severe floods, deadly storms also in Greece, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, storms that are ongoing and that keep producing disastrous floods. Albania is the most recent victim. Natural disasters have become more frequent and more intense. Their effects are more unpredictable, all the more for emergencies that can completely overwhelm the national capacities and national resources.  I am proud, as Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, of the support we could provide for such crises through our current system, our current voluntary pool Civil Protection Mechanism. I would like once more to thank all our Member States that have actively contributed to help countries that are victims of disasters and emergencies. But the reality on the ground is different today. Climate change has changed the game, and unfortunately this is our new reality. Maybe this is our new normal and we must adapt and be prepared to face this new reality. I strongly believe that European support in disasters and emergencies is strongly needed. As you know, this European support is based on voluntary contributions by our Member States. But it is very hard, and I saw on the ground – it was a very painful experience even to me and other ministers – it is very hard for any of our Member States to help one another if they both face disasters or risks at the same time, simultaneously. What happened recently in Portugal is the most painful example. Countries with strong records of solidarity could not help Portugal this time because they were also facing forest fires at the same time. It is clear that the current voluntary system has reached its limits.  Three weeks ago you know that the College of Commissioners adopted my proposal with the strong support of our President, Jean-Claude Juncker, to upgrade the current system of the Civil Protection Mechanism and create Rescue. Rescue? What is Rescue? Rescue is a structure based on two pillars.  Firstly with Rescue our Union will have its own capacity with command and control to respond to disasters. You can think of Rescue as a safety net when national capacities and national resources are not enough. In essence, Rescue means that no European country will stand alone when facing forest fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or epidemics.  Let me stress one critical point. Rescue will not replace national capacities. I would like to repeat, it will not replace national capacities. It will support and complement national capacities and resources. I am very firm on this point. The primary responsibility to prepare for and respond to disasters remains with our Member States. Through Rescue we will also increase financial incentives for our Member States to make their own capacities available to others. This will be the European Civil Protection Pool.  The second pillar of these proposals means prevention and preparedness. I want to be frank on this. Solidarity comes with responsibility. Prevention and preparedness are at the heart of a comprehensive response to natural disasters and emergencies. Member States have to improve their risk assessment, their risk management plans. We are here to help them and we will also help establish a common cultural prevention and preparedness. It is quite important to see and to improve this culture of prevention. For this to be done, Member States need to be supported through the Structural and Investment Funds, and they also need to be supported through all related Union policies and instruments. I am thinking of environment, climate, health, research and others.  Dear colleagues, Rescue demonstrates the Commission’s commitment to strengthen the EU support to our citizens when natural disasters or emergencies threaten their lives and their properties. Today, I am here to ask for your support for these proposals. I know many of you have already expressed your interim support, and thank you so much for this. I am sure that through our exchange of views we can do more to cultivate all aspects of these proposals. I am looking forward to listening to your remarks and thoughts.

It is no coincidence that every time, Commissioner, that we have been in this House debating these issues, a natural disaster had just happened or was underway. Fortunately, less serious than the others, but even in recent days a wave of bad weather has hit our Europe, and Italy in particular. We still have, for example, in Emilia Romagna and other regions thousands of displaced people, interrupted connections, enormous damage.

Well, we need this review. We need to increase the ability to act quickly and effectively, but above all we need to strengthen prevention and preparedness, which are the basis, as you said, but are also the best way to prevent the loss of life and the huge losses, including economic ones. So we need to work on this and improve access to structural funds, all the support possible.

First of all, my congratulations. The catastrophes of 2017 have shown that our resources are insufficient: more than two hundred fatalities - one hundred in Portugal in the last fires - and one million hectares burned in the last year, which is three times more than what was burned in the last five years in the European Union. In short, consequences of climate change that are devastating and that need a more coordinated and stronger action. But it is not only climate change, it is also earthquakes or health threats such as Ebola or Zika. Ultimately, the resources are insufficient, which shows us - as the Commission stresses - that we need a permanent mechanism with its own resources and also one that has comprehensive action, from prevention to reparation. And, focusing specifically on the Commission proposal, I would of course like to underline the specific area of ​​climate change and four aspects. Anticipation: in order to prevent, we need to evaluate the risks well and for that a risk map of the different regions that also includes the water resources that we have in the different regions. Complementarity: we need a sum of efforts, as the Commissioner has well said, not substitution of resources from the Member States. Coherence: coherence between all the political and financial instruments of the European Union and especially on climate change. It is a global challenge that requires coordination and transversal actions. We would need a specific body for climate change, capable of facing - as I say, in this coordinated way - this great challenge. Y reparation: specifically, the Solidarity Fund.We have to modify the Solidarity Fund.We have seen in recent catastrophes that it is insufficient, that it penalizes those regions that are large when evaluating global GDP and not real wealth by GDP per capita.We need to modify it and also introduce the environment as a criterion for repair.In short, despite everything I have said, I think this initiative is a great success and I offer all our support so that it sees the light.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 274, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, in recent years, due to climate change, we have witnessed enormous natural disasters.

In addition, Egelados visits more and more often Greece and Italy, which are affected by catastrophic earthquakes. It is therefore clear that, in addition to the national civil protection mechanisms, the European Union must build an ancillary civil protection mechanism, which will act as an aid to national authorities in complementary dealing with the consequences of natural disasters.

I am referring to the recent tragic disaster that occurred a month ago from the floods in Mandra and Nea Peramos, near Athens, where 24 people drowned. The risk of flooding in this area was known on the basis of the preliminary flood risk assessment studies defined by Directive 60/2007. There are responsibilities for inadequacy and indifference of the governments, which did nothing, because the directive provided that for those areas where the preliminary studies showed that there is a risk, final flood risk management plans should be prepared by the competent Ministry of Environment by December 12, 2015. Here, Commissioner, everyone has to take responsibility, and I want to ask you: When it became clear that the December deadline had passed and the Greek authorities had not implemented the required flood risk management plans, what did your services do? Did they inform the Greek authorities? Did they push and how? Which authorities did they contact?

So start with prevention and use the structural funds. We can do that: use the solidarity fund and other funds up to 95% to do that. So today a compliment, but at the same time an invitation to keep each other on their toes. The Member States in particular, especially the Council, must ensure that we are at the forefront of fighting climate change.

Three ways to do this. In a top down logic, reinforce common means, streamline processes, combine information and share knowledge. Supporting the strengthening of Member States' resources and indirectly creating harmonization and interoperability that will help to improve national prevention and response systems. Finally, promoting cooperation and synergies between the available means, a practice that has occurred on several occasions, but, as I said, with phenomena that are endemic, systemic and transnational, there is often no possible answer for all needs.

Disasters are becoming more frequent and complex across Europe. The effects of climate change have hit many Member States hard in recent years. Just a few months ago, Portugal and Italy in particular faced a number of summer fires that had never occurred before. Against this, the current disaster response tools are limited and often unable to provide rapid assistance to Member States during a crisis, because the current production mechanism is based on a voluntary system and on additional capabilities that Member states can offer to another country in need. The creation of a system capable of increasing disaster response capacities in the European Union is undoubtedly going in the right direction, increasing integration and solidarity between member countries.

I took careful note of your remarks and ideas. As I said in the beginning of my intervention, this demonstrates this Parliament’s active interest in and commitment to these proposals.  Recent disasters were damaging but they taught us several lessons. Firstly, they showed that our collective combined capacities to respond to disasters are not enough when large-scale disasters happen; we have to be frank. Secondly, they showed the limitation of the current purely voluntary system. This is the hard reality. Finally, of course, they showed that the negative impact of disasters would have been reduced if effective preventive actions had been in place. As you said, prevention is better than cure. It is as simple as that.  We have to focus on prevention and preparedness in order, of course, to save lives, but also to reduce our costs. At the same time, there is also some good news. We are not starting from scratch. We have a lot of accumulated knowledge and experience because of the current system, and through Rescue we work towards maximum efficiency with minimum bureaucracy. We don’t need more bureaucracy. We have to find ways to reach maximum efficiency with minimum bureaucracy; this is very important for all of us and this is why I strongly believe that Rescue is a cost-effective and cost-efficient system. Through Rescue we can provide tangible European solidarity to our citizens, not in theory but in action. Action that helps save lives, livelihoods and of course our environment. Remember that Rescue is first of all about economies of scale. It is very simple to understand this. Secondly, it is a tool to directly help our citizens in very critical times of floods, forest fires, epidemics and earthquakes and, as I have already highlighted, a cost-effective way to ensure coordination and a harmonised approach to prevention and preparedness.  Some of you raised the issue about the national risk management plans and the risk reduction plan. At present our European Union Civil Protection Mechanism is not responsible for the national risk reduction plan. It is a national competence. Now, through Rescue, we can find ways to fund this cooperation between our services and national services in order to increase and to improve the national plans for management and risk reduction. Through Rescue we can improve ourselves across Europe.  During the terrible forest fires in Portugal last October – and our colleagues from Portugal know well the situation in Portugal at that time – Jean-Claude Juncker said that Europe must and should offer more than condolences during natural disasters. He asked all of us for immediate and concrete action. I strongly believe that we can provide our citizens with more than condolences. We are all aware that the next disasters can happen at any time in any country, because no country is immune and self-reliance should not be taken for granted. It is an illusion for anyone to believe that any country can face alone the size of the current natural disasters because of climate change.  Thank you again for your support. I am sure you understand the importance and the urgency of adopting the proposal. It is for this reason that I count on your swift action. I strongly believe that we can work together in order to persuade anyone who, until now, may show some reluctance, but we have powerful arguments in order to convince them that this is very important for Europe, for our citizens, to save lives and livelihoods.

I am grateful for the opportunity to be here and to present our views on this topic.  This discussion is important for several reasons. First of all, reports from the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe confirm an alarming increase of intolerance and hatred in Europe. There might be several reasons explaining this worrying phenomenon, but let me be clear on this, there is no justification for it.  Secondly, we notice an increasing use of Nazi and fascist symbols on social media platforms but also in public, both online and offline. This shows that some of our citizens have not learnt from history. As we know, this can be very dangerous. Those who forget mistakes of their own history risk repeating them.  We are therefore obliged to take all incidents of that kind seriously and never ignore them. On a positive note, the EU has adopted specific legislation on combating intolerance and hatred. I refer in particular to the 2008 Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. In June 2016 the Council invited Member States to ensure the effective transposition and implementation of the framework decision and other relevant hate crime laws at national level. In addition, it asked Member States to develop effective methods to report and ensure proper recording of hate crimes. According to this legislation specific offences exist when directed against a group of persons, or a member of such a group, defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. They include, among others, public incitement to violence or hatred, public dissemination or distribution of propaganda material and images.  I have already mentioned that social media is one of the main vehicles enabling hate speech to go viral. One possible remedy against this epidemic is a harmonised and determined European response. As for the steps taken in the Council, the Estonian Presidency and the previous Maltese and Slovak Presidencies have done important work to tackle these issues. In October the Council conclusions on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in 2016 were adopted, where the Council welcomes the measures coordinated by the Commission High-Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We also welcome and support the ongoing EU-level dialogue with major IT companies to address hate speech online, also through the implementation of the code of conduct launched by the Commission for this purpose. Last but not least, we should remember and commend the remarkable work done by the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field. But all these countermeasures would be in vain if we forget the important role of education and youth work, and more precisely the need to develop democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance, critical thinking and conflict resolution skills in the learning process.  To sum up, we have different tools: we have knowledge, education, counter-narratives, but also condemnation of any form of anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim violence, hate speech or discrimination. Accordingly the responsibility rests with all of us: politicians, teachers, civil servants, students, parents, and if needed also judges and prosecutors. No one can close their eyes or ears and pretend not to see injustice, discrimination or hatred.  I would like to conclude by stressing how important it is to prevent our societies from becoming dominated by hatred. Our role, and on this I know I can count on your support, is to remind ourselves of our responsibility for what we say. Words and symbols have power, including the power to harm. For this reason, freedom of expression has its limits. It is our common responsibility to find the right balance, and this is never an easy task.

The Commission shares the concerns of Parliament over the worrying trends in the rise of racist and xenophobic attitudes, which sadly have found their way into mainstream politics and mainstream media.  Under the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law the Member States must ensure that public incitement to violence or hatred, including through the use of Nazi and fascist symbols and slogans, is criminalised under national law. National law enforcement and judicial authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting any such instance. The Commission rigorously monitors the application of this legislation.  In the past couple of years nine Member States have made amendments to their respective criminal laws in order to bring them in line. The Commission will continue to work on reducing the remaining gaps in national legislation, but laws are only as good as they are effectively implemented in practice. This is why the Commission has been stepping up its efforts to assist Member States to build the capacity to ensure the effective implementation of the law, but also to support targeted measures to prevent and tackle intolerance in practice. This includes the work of the EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance.  The EU High Level Group was set up in 2016 to foster discussions and synergies between Member States, civil society and other key stakeholders with a view to improving responses, including guidance on how to train police and judicial authorities on hate speech and hate crime, and guidance on how to ensure adequate support and protection for hate crime victims.  The Commission has been leading major initiatives such as the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. The recent guidance Communication on Tackling Illegal Content Online adopted by the Commission in September also provides key impetus for further progress in this area. Continued efforts are also being devoted to initiatives on remembrance. As the Commission remarked in its statement on the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes on 23 August, it is essential not only to remember the victims of these regimes but also to use remembrance as a guide for the future so as not to repeat mistakes and let discrimination and hatred spread again. I used to say that history does not really repeat itself; men repeat history very simply because they do not read it and they do not draw lessons from what has happened in the past. This is why the Commission strongly reaffirmed on that occasion the rejection of totalitarian and authoritarian ideologies such as Nazism and fascism. It is crucial to remember past horrors in order to give us the knowledge and strength to reject those who seek to revive these heinous ideologies.

Also, I thank you for making this item on the agenda, so that we can talk about this in the European Parliament, but unlike our colleagues from Western Europe, we in Croatia still have fresh memories of a totalitarian regime that was neither fascist nor Nazi, but he very much dealt with dissidents, individuals and groups whom he considered a threat to himself. The recent history of the world speaks of millions of deaths directly or indirectly connected precisely with communist regimes and their symbols are equally unacceptable in 21st century Europe as fascist and Nazi. I therefore regret that in today's title of the agenda item, you proponents have not included communism. Of course I oppose all totalitarian symbols and slogans. I will try to illustrate the situation for you. There are different interpretations of the past in the Croatian public space, and fostering a culture of remembering human rights violations and resisting undemocratic regimes is not systematic and comprehensive. Neither the current administrative nor judicial practice regarding the display of symbols is uniform. That is why the Government, headed by Andrej Plenković, established the Council for Dealing with the Past, whose task is to propose recommendations to the Government and legally regulate the display of content that glorifies undemocratic regimes.

We have ensured that our differences are no longer the cause of divisions, but the foundation of our being together according to common values, built over the centuries. Values ​​such as democracy, human rights, freedom of thought and the principles of the rule of law. Values ​​that we have come to deny in history, through the devastating experience of dictatorships and Nazi-fascism. This is why our Union today represents the exact opposite of what fascisms have meant in history. For this reason, Nazi-Fascism is not an opinion, it is not a normal exercise of freedom of expression, but rather its opposite: it is the denial of freedom, it is a crime, a crime that cannot be limited to a specific historical moment. As Primo Levi said, Mr. President, every time has its fascism: it begins by spreading in many subtle ways the nostalgia for a world in which order reigned supreme and in which the safety of the privileged few rested on forced labor and the forced silence of lot of. Order and cleanliness: fascism also begins like this. From the rehabilitation of a language capable of arousing deep divisions in society, propagating ideas that incite the suppression of democracy, the criminalization of diversity and oppression, Mr President, it can never be considered as a simple exercise of freedom of expression. We are free to express our thoughts, precisely because we have put an end to Nazi-Fascism, which was and still is an extraction of violence. There are those who believe that all this is limited to the folklore of the distant past. However, it is necessary to have a solid historical memory to be able to look to the future without making the mistakes of the past, and to ban Nazi-fascism, to condemn its apology, to relegate its symbols to museums and to history, is not to deny another's freedom, but to guarantee that of all of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 296, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Jussi HALLA-AHO", "mepid": "124727", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I think it is very childish to try and ban symbols, even if they represent repulsive ideologies such as National Socialism, or Communism for that matter.

Nazism originated in Germany, but it was Germany that was the first and best of all to decide to punish all those who glorify Nazism or use its symbols or slogans. Italy did so in a similar way to fascism. Unfortunately, there are still countries and authorities in the European Union that treat the symbols and slogans of Nazism, Fascism or Ustashaism and Chetnikism without serious sanctions and strong reactions. The European Union was created with the desire that the war in Europe would never happen again. The evil of Nazism that originated on European soil and spread to many other countries has been defeated, but clearly not eradicated. That is why we need to act. Right here. That is why not only the Member States, but also the European Union itself, this Parliament, this Commission must propose concrete legal solutions at European level.

The neo-Nazi organization White Rex in Russia, under the guise of business, is opening a gap in neo-Nazi ideology. In Italy, a few days ago, a group of masked members of the fascist Forza Nuova declared war on La Repubblica and the weekly L’espresso, US President Trump retweeted messages from British neo-Nazis and apologized to participants in neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville. Serbs and Croats have been declared war criminals convicted in The Hague. One of them, Vojislav Seselj, is sitting in the Serbian parliament, while Croatian extremists are erecting a monument to the fascist state formation in the Jasenovac concentration camp.

Only in Italy, within a few days, there were very serious episodes: the raid in Como of a group of skinheads in a meeting between volunteers who help refugees, we had a fascist blitz in Rome under the headquarters of the national newspaper La Repubblica , and in Bologna, city symbol of the anti-fascist resistance, the burning of the plaque commemorating the shot partisans. As in Italy, the spread of hatred, xenophobia and fascism is reaching worrying levels in the rest of Europe. More decisive and firm action by the European Union is needed, including on social media. The EU Charter of Rights must also apply to all social networks, regardless of their location. The apology for fascism is a crime in Italy, but not on Facebook: it is necessary to block the pages that incite hatred and fascism: in Italy alone there are more than 300 according to the data of the National Partisans Association. Here, the Union arose from the ashes of the tragedies of the world wars and from the horrors of Nazi and Fascist ideology.

In 21st century Europe there should be no place for fascism, for racism, for anti-Semitism, for any type of exclusion or discrimination, for any sort of totalitarian regime. We have the laws at European and national level to protect our fundamental rights, but we must also practice the spirit of this law in our everyday language and actions. To defeat xenophobia, racism and discrimination takes not only legislation. It is not all about laws. It’s about efforts and justice. Democratic Europe stands for these principles and does not forget. It also takes leadership, responsibility, democratic duty, citizens’ vigilance.

The European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, approved your proposal for a Regulation in 2014. It was the so-called David Martin report. And it is true that it did so without an agreement with the Commission and without an agreement with the Council and, therefore, it was not possible for it to be approved, but we did it - the Parliament of 2014 - so that the initiative would not die at the end of the previous legislature. Since the person speaking to you was appointed rapporteur for this matter by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that is, since September 2014, I have been trying to negotiate with the Commission and the Council and I have met with all the presidencies that have There have been since then: with the Latvian Presidency, with the Luxembourgish, with the Dutch, with the Slovak, also, of course, with the Maltese, and with all of them we have had different conversations, always well-intentioned, to solve this problem. But we never got start some serious talks, formally, to resolve the differences, the concerns that the Commission and the Council expressed in their day about that old text. In October 2016, the Slovak Presidency proposed to us a formula for solving the problem and raised the possibility that the legal services of the Commission, Parliament and the Council would meet discreetly, informally - we could say it that way - to draw up a common text, if they were able to resolve the technical differences that existed around the previous text. And I want to tell you that these meetings of the legal services of the three institutions have been taking place from October 2016 to May 2017. And during nine very serious meetings the legal services of the three institutions have reached a certain approximation. They have not solved everything, because they are not responsible for doing it either, but they have - let us say - delimited the differences and established a text that could solve this problem. But from May 2017 until today the situation has stagnated again, because the legal services have raised their agreements with their political leaderships in the Council and the Commission and the political resolutions of the Commission and the Council have not been produced. So, ladies and gentlemen, the facts are that three long years have passed and we have not been able to initiate conversations with the institutions. Despite our willingness to do so; despite the multiple forms of dialogue that we have proposed; despite the multiple alternatives that we have proposed to make our texts more flexible. And here are my assessments, ladies and gentlemen, because until now they were the facts. My first assessment, ladies and gentlemen, is that I want to denounce that, in my opinion, both in the Commission, as well as in the Member States, as well as in the Council, there is strong resistance to the European Parliament drawing up a rule with powers to that the investigation commissions investigate what is produced throughout the parliamentary life. Secondly, what is happening is that reality is adding more and more research experiences. Only in the last two years we have had two very important investigative commissions. Today we have approved here, in Plenary, the report on the Panama Papers, which presents a set of extremely important resolutions on an issue that caused social alarm throughout Europe, which is flight, tax evasion or unfair competition between states in the European Union itself. And we have had the Commission on the Measurement of Emissions in the Automobile Sector. And every time there will be more. And the question is whether or not this Parliament will have a provision, a capacity to have its own regulation. I would like to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Parliament is ready to dialogue, to negotiate and to reform if necessary. To dialogue and reform if necessary. If the Commission and the Council inform us - albeit informally - that they accept the text that the legal services have prepared and we can start this negotiation, I undertake to bring to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, if necessary, a text that can be negotiable with the institutions. If this is not the case, ladies and gentlemen, let me end by saying on behalf of Parliament - and I think I express the opinion of all my colleagues, fellow shadow rapporteurs from the different political groups - that your silence is a contempt for the European Parliament. That your refusal to negotiate offends the European Parliament and that your behavior so far does not correspond to the institutional loyalty that we owe to each other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 333, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Ramón JÁUREGUI ATONDO", "mepid": "97078", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, let me start by assuring the House that the Council shares the view that committees of inquiry are important instruments for this Parliament to exercise its political control. In this spirit, and in respect of its duty of sincere cooperation, the Council is therefore prepared to examine constructively proposals for a revision of the current rules on the exercise of Parliament’s right of inquiry. As you know the first proposal for a regulation on the exercise of the Parliament’s right of inquiry, the so-called Martin Report from 2011, raised serious legal and institutional concerns in the Council and in the Commission. Indeed it foresaw a far-reaching extension of the rights of committees of inquiry, which was considered contrary to Article 226 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Also a more moderate revised proposal from 2014 did not resolve the fundamental legal and institutional issues with regard to the limits imposed by the above-mentioned Article.  Following informal contacts between our institutions it was thus agreed in October 2016 to mandate the Legal Services of the three institutions to further spell out the legal and institutional issues, with a view to helping Parliament clarify the content of its proposal. On the basis of this mandate the experts of the three Legal Services had nine meetings at a technical level between December 2016 and May 2017. In May they submitted the result of their work to their respective hierarchies. We have been waiting for a meeting at directors-general level to take place in order to finalise the joint paper before its submission to the political authorities of the three institutions.  The Council stands ready to continue the work once we have the outcome of the three Legal Services on the table. I would not however expect that the Legal Services will come up with a ready-made solution, or ready-made solutions, to all the thorny legal and institutional issues raised by this file, and indeed laid out by the previous speaker, but their input will facilitate finding a common way forward, including helping Parliament to elaborate on a new text which will have a chance to obtain the consent of the Council and the Commission.

Article 226 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets forth Parliament’s right to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law, without prejudice to the powers conferred by the Treaties to the other institutions and bodies. This tool represents, in the European Union Treaties, the traditional control functions of the Parliament over the activities of the executive branch, a key component of every functioning democracy. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the current rule from 1995 needs to be replaced by a new regulation proposed by the European Parliament. However, it needs the consent of the Council and the Commission before it can enter into force. As we all know, this has been a complicated and politically sensitive file ever since the Parliament presented its proposal for a regulation in 2012. To be sure, the Commission has engaged in constructive dialogue, at technical and political level, honouring the principle of sincere cooperation between the institutions. At the same time, the Commission has always been very clear about the points that raised concerns while offering constructive solutions.  The Commission takes good note of the solution-oriented attitude the Parliament has taken so far, and I would like to thank in particular the current rapporteur, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, for his continued commitment and constructive approach with regard to the trilateral work.  Let me stress here the Commission’s continued willingness and commitment to engage in constructive trilateral discussions with the Parliament and the Council. Our aim is to find appropriate solutions to the divergences that still exist between the institutions, so that after Parliament’s vote on a final legislative resolution, the Commission can give its consent in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, with due regard to its institutional prerogatives. In this respect, I’m pleased to reaffirm that, in the Commission’s view, the constructive cooperation of the representatives of the Legal Services of the three institutions, which was started at the end of 2016, has borne its fruit. It has been overall a useful exercise that allowed for identifying possible agreement on large parts of a common text as well as avenues for possible compromise on other issues. However, although our legal experts have made significant progress on pending legal and institutional issues, important divergences still exist between the institutions. Throughout the process, the Commission has been very transparent about its concerns. To briefly sum up. Firstly, this is particularly the case for the scope and duration of the mandate of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry. Secondly, the incompatibilities between the investigations of the Committee of Inquiry and ongoing legal proceedings established by the Treaty. Thirdly, the rules on specification of document requests and the protection of sensitive documents or testimonies.  Moreover, the Commission believes that there are other issues that merit serious further discussions, including: the investigative means at Parliament’s disposal, the coercive measures which the Parliament asked to be put in place for failure to cooperate or for unsatisfactory testimony by natural and legal persons and political sanctions and legal remedies. The Commission also believes that the future legal framework for Parliament’s right of inquiry must be discussed in the light of the practical experience of the recent EMIS and PANA Committees of Inquiry. Earlier today this plenary presented its recommendations to the Council and Commission following the work of the PANA Committee, which includes recommendations on the implementation of Parliament’s right of inquiry. With this valuable, practical experience now fully available, the inter-institutional work in view of the update of the legal framework for the exercise of Parliament’s right to inquiry could usefully be resumed. Let me emphasise again the Commission is standing ready to resume trilateral work at the appropriate level, I now look forward to hearing the views of all Members and of the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 335, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Danuta Maria HÜBNER", "mepid": "96779", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, it is true that I am a member of the European People’s Party but I speak here today as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs under whose responsibility and competence this dossier falls. I would like to start by saying that we have been insisting, without success, for more than three years and five Council Presidencies now, on an interinstitutional process of dialogue being opened with the Council and the Commission on the regulation of the European Parliament on the right of inquiry.  Recent events and the work of our two latest inquiry committees – which the Commissioner mentioned, Emission Measurements in the Automotive Sector (EMIS) and Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion (PANA) – have shown that we need new and more efficient rules on the role and powers of European Parliament committees of inquiry if we want to have effective public inquiries on matters that, by their very nature, go beyond the competence of national institutions.  Parliament voted today with a sweeping majority on establishing a permanent Committee of Inquiry. Public opinion requires those inquiries. This means that it is indeed politically important, not only politically difficult. To have clear rules is also in the interest of other institutions and also people who are called to testify in general in this Parliament. It will bring transparency and legal certainty to the procedures of inquiry, and yet we have been waiting now for more than three years, not to conclude the procedure but just to sit at the table and discuss whether an agreement is at all possible.  That is why we drafted this oral question. We are not asking the Council and the Commission to agree with us. We are asking them to sit at the table and negotiate. That is how problems are solved in the European Union and we have a duty to try at least to do so. On this we count on the Bulgarian Presidency.

And yet we are still here, almost a whole political life later, and we have still not managed to get this made a reality.  A committee of inquiry is a key feature of parliamentarianism. This is a fundamental right for Parliament, and without an effective tool for committees of inquiry the European Parliament will have difficulties in fulfilling its role as an effective control of the executive, of the implementation and enforcement of regulations, etc. It is long overdue.  As a Parliament we have repeatedly proposed such regulations and we have repeatedly, formally and informally, explained our openness and willingness to negotiate. Nothing helped! The Council stubbornly refuses to negotiate with Parliament and to grant it only a part of its natural and necessary rights. This is problematic.

It's not just about controlling governments, it's about controlling matters in which governments are sometimes involved. This right is insufficiently developed for the European Parliament. It is a right from the last millennium and it is urgently necessary to change that right. The Lisbon Treaty offers these possibilities. But if you read the text, it also contains an obligation for the Council and the Commission to participate. And it is precisely this participation that is massively refused.

Since then, they have obviously been waiting for an appointment with their bosses, biting their nails, so that they can have an appointment with the general managers at some point. Don't think that we don't know what's wrong! The point is that we want to bring evidence. The point is that we want to summon witnesses and also have to justify the witnesses if they do not come. And the point is that if someone tells the untruth before this committee of inquiry, he will then also be punished according to his national law and sanctions can be expected.

Let me reiterate that the Commission attaches great importance to Parliament’s role of scrutiny and political control. The ultimate aim of this control is to guarantee that citizens’ concerns regarding the implementation of European Union law are properly addressed. This is what the Treaty stipulates. However, I have also stated our genuine concerns, that need to be redressed. The trilateral work that has been done so far, including by our legal experts, and the practical experiences with Parliament’s recent committees of inquiry have shown us where common ground exists and where divergences still exist and need to be brought together.

Our report is a call of urgent action to join forces to stop child sexual abuse and protect children. The directive to combat child sexual abuse, online and offline is a historic step forward. We have provided a strong legal framework with stricter sanctions and common standards to prevent and prosecute crimes and protect victims. But implementation is far from satisfactory. Member States must do more, better and faster, to ensure zero tolerance against child sexual abuse and exploitation. We are talking about such terrible crimes that police dealing with these cases take turns on duty and need support.  When shown on the Deep web the images, the cheers of enjoyment among perpetrators – I just couldn’t sleep at night. What if it was your child? A missing child? An unaccompanied minor? Any child? This concerns all children in Europe. An entire generation that lives on the net.  With our report we modernise European policies. Since 2011 new forms of crime such as revenge pornography and sex extortion affect many teenagers online – mainly girls – and cyber bullying and grooming have grown. Moreover, thousands of migrant children have disappeared, are sold and sexually exploited by organised crime in Europe, making billions on children’s skin. Trafficking is the slavery of our times against the most vulnerable kids.  Criminal networks and child sexual abuse online are sophisticated, and law enforcement authorities face new challenges. We cannot lag behind for lack of resources and modern means of prosecution. Therefore, we call on the Member States to give adequate resources to police, to child hotlines and helplines, to enforce the directive in a future—proof way, upgrading digital investigation tools to keep pace with technology, to remove illegal material at source and block it when it is not possible to remove, with faster procedures and safeguards, and to increase cooperation with third countries, Interpol and our great American partner NMEC to remove illegal material when the source is outside the EU.  We also urge the internet industry to take their shared responsibility. Much is being done, but it is not enough. The technology to detect, generate alarms, report to the police child sexual abuse material online exists – it should be used by all the IT industry. They should also work on innovative solutions to protect children online.  Migrant children are particularly exposed to child exploitation. Member States must ensure that they enter and remain in the protection system. Minors must be registered with fingerprints and given a guardian to avoid going missing. The time has come for all the Member States to fully enforce the anti-trafficking and protection of victims directive. We need to ensure that there is no impunity for any child sexual offender. Perpetrators must be brought to justice.  Children are right-holders. They must feel it is not their fault, that their voice is heard. Civil society plays a key role, taking children by the hand and assisting them in building trust. Children must be protected throughout the proceedings. Interrogation trials must be child-friendly to avoid double victimisation and victim blaming.  The time has come to break the silence and shift the guilt from child victims to adult perpetrators. Let’s launch a ‘me too’—like movement for children – ‘kids too’. If it is hard for woman to speak up, to share her story, to get justice, how hard can it be for a kid or a teenager? We need to mobilise, raise awareness and make sure children get justice and support. Today we reach out to all children who feel scared, ashamed, lonely and we say you are not alone. We care. We are determined to join forces to ensure that Europe truly means safety for all children ", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 347, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a long night but I am more than happy to share these thoughts with the House. I would like to thank you for this debate about one of the most abhorrent issues of our times and I would especially like to express my thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Corazza Bildt, for her personal investment on this issue, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. Anna Maria, you have done an excellent job. Congratulations. Child sexual abuse is an appalling crime that the Commission is committed to eradicating, together with this Parliament. This is a fight that we cannot relinquish or soften until we have entirely eradicated it. The Child Sexual Abuse Directive adopted in 2011 is an ambitious and comprehensive instrument that binds Member States to achieve a number of objectives. We issued two extensive transposition reports in 2016 which assessed the implementation measures adopted by Member States. I welcome Parliament’s report, which builds on our work.  Member States have invested considerable effort to comply with their obligations. They have adopted around 300 legal acts amending criminal codes and procedures, sectoral legislation, increasing their administrative capacity and improving coordination of national actors.  However, this progress needs to be followed up with further efforts. Member States still face challenges related to prevention, intervention programmes for offenders, definition of offences, and assistance and support for victims. I therefore welcome Parliament’s call on Member States to further improve implementation because, for the children that are affected by this atrocious and inhuman crime, legislation on paper does not matter if it is not implemented and enforced properly.  This is why ensuring complete implementation by Member States of the Child Abuse Directive is an utmost priority for the Commission. In the coming months, we will continue to support Member States to achieve conformity of their national implementation measures and we will make use of our enforcement powers under the Treaties, if necessary. We will also support Member States in facilitating the development and exchange of best practices in specific areas, such as prevention and intervention programmes.  Work is already underway in this regard. For example, we recently supported child protection projects such as the Barnhuset, which is mentioned in the resolution, or integrated inter-agency and multidisciplinary support services for child victims of violence. We would like to see more Member States integrate such child rights-based models, building on what has been done in the Daphne Promise project. We will share information with you on these different elements to the maximum extent possible regarding specific data requested by the rapporteur.  While Member States are not legally required to report data regarding follow-up of law enforcement authorities, delays in takedowns and use of stored data by judicial authorities, sharing of information is, of course, key.  However, what matters most are the results, not reporting. Member States have to remove, or block, content online linked to child sexual exploitation and pornography. This is what counts. The Inhope network of hotlines plays a major role in practice in the transposition by Member States of their obligation regarding removal and blocking. We will be launching, at Parliament’s request, a study into the way the Inhope hotlines work, including how they interact with national law enforcement authorities and internet providers, and how they could improve their effectiveness. I will be glad to share the findings with you once they are available.  Finally, we note in Parliament’s report the strong calls on Member States to adopt measures that go beyond their obligations under this Directive. This includes: mandatory criminal background checks for persons working with children, exchange of information about child sex offenders, proactive searches of child sexual abuse material by hotlines and mandatory reporting by internal internet providers of child sexual abuse material detected in their infrastructure. These are very valuable suggestions and we will examine them carefully. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your valuable comments.

So I also welcome the commitment made here by the Commissioner. We call on the Member States to cooperate more in this regard. We must adapt the fight against these crimes to the digital age. A more efficient exchange of information will facilitate the prevention of further crime in other Member States. For example, half of the Member States have taken voluntary action to block child pornography on the Internet.

The sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography is a cross-border crime which requires an international response. It is a sobering fact that every nine minutes the Internet Watch Foundation’s analysts encounter a web page that shows children being sexually abused.  The speedy elimination of these images and the protection of children from abuse and exploitation must be a priority of the EU. It is our responsibility to ensure that the victims of child abuse are not forgotten. To do this, we must use developing technologies for the detection and removal of material and the identification of victims. The gender aspect of abuse and child pornography also must not be forgotten. Research suggests child sexual abuse affects girls at a higher rate than boys, and we should take this into account. What is more, non-consensual distribution of pornographic material, including so-called revenge porn, overwhelmingly affects women and girls, some of whom are under the legal age of consent.

The centrality of the directive is in the exacerbation of penalties and in the criminalization of a wide range of situations of abuse, favored by the use of IT tools, such as the solicitation of children online and the display of child pornography. To stop the distribution of this material, the directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure the timely removal of web pages containing or disseminating child pornography. States must endeavor to obtain the removal and blocking of these pages. This is not about political ideology, but it is a categorical imperative to protect our children from these criminals.

I am proud to have been able to work here. Ladies and gentlemen, children are the rarest and most fragile creatures we have and are worthy of our utmost attention and protection. There is a call for real action across Member States to protect children from the settlements of criminals who want to sexually abuse them and thus destroy their innocence, all for perverted pleasure. This is a horrible sight. What does this say about our society if some people use their skills to profit from filming children, and even babies, in sexual abuse. We are a really sick culture and society if we allow such things to happen. The statistics are threatening. Up to 28,258 people watch porn every second. Porn production has become a huge business in which nudity and human dignity are traded. The report legitimately calls for the prosecution of perpetrators and the protection of victims. I consider it important that we demand an obligation from all Member States to help the victims of these perversions. Many consumers of porn material can very easily, in search of more and more perversity, become guilty of consuming child pornography. A good example is the Pink cross organization, which works with people addicted to pornography and former porn actors. Pornography is a modern drug. It destroys the integrity of individuals, breaks up families and adversely affects society. Safe surfing works in a similar way and needs to be supported. Since 2011, the Directive on Child Sexual Abuse and Child Pornography has shown us to implement programs aimed at re-educating perpetrators of sexual violence and helping to stop them, as well as the harmful criminal habits they develop.

I am naturally delighted with the result of our work. Tomorrow we will adopt a strong and comprehensive report on combating sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children, an area in which we absolutely must move forward and redouble our efforts. I would of course like to thank, really from the bottom of my heart, our rapporteur with whom we fight, on a daily basis, on these themes, particularly within the \"Children's Rights\" intergroup. I would like to thank her for her work and her strong commitment in all these areas. But, at the same time, I am sorry tonight because, if we are having this debate, it is because the situation is far from satisfactory. Since 2011, we have had a directive which constitutes a real step forward, but we are almost in 2018 and the results are disappointing: late transposition, incomplete transposition on the part of the States, of the Member States which have still not modernized their law criminal in relation to all these new forms of offenses existing in the field of sexual exploitation of children, little has been done in terms of prevention and assistance to victims and a still too slow withdrawal of content presenting sexual abuse. We are told that the directive has not reached its full potential, but how is it possible to be satisfied with such a response? Government and NGO reports are damning, the exploitation figures are alarming, the victims are younger and younger, the content is increasing: there is therefore a need to redouble our efforts against these atrocities. I would like to highlight three points. First, prevention: how to prevent these abuses which often take place in the direct and family environment? How? 'Or' What prevent these rapes?How can we better protect our children before they fall prey to these criminal networks and predators?Secondly, with regard to internet content, Member States must ensure that such content presenting abuse against children is promptly removed at source and they must have functional takedown notification procedures.Third, the training of actors: judicial and police actors must be sufficiently equipped by the Member States to adapt to this evolving and terrible nature of these crimes.The actors of childhood too, to conclude, must be accompanied so that they succeed in detecting the victims, because this is absolutely dramatic for the construction of these children, who risk remaining and too often remain invisible victims.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 354, "date": "2017-12-13.json", "name": "Ángela VALLINA", "mepid": "125050", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for this report.

But, faced with this and despite the adoption of a specific Directive, most of the States have transposed it badly and late, including my country, Spain. Furthermore, the Commission has published its report on the application of the Directive a year late and has received many complaints about its superficiality. Keep it in mind.

I also want to pick up the points that have been made in that we would hope that the Commission’s next report will give us fuller details and better data. That is listed throughout the report in front of us today. As others have said, child abuse, whether online or not, is growing. It is big money and it is permutating in the light of new technologies and new opportunities, such as unaccompanied minors left in isolation and thus vulnerable, or children with disabilities. Even children who consider themselves street smart can find their images used or worse.  So I welcome the report’s emphasis on raising awareness and empowering young people to help them stay safe and to report. We learn that boys are less likely to report sexual abuse. I think this is where hotlines become so important because they offer confidentiality, they offer advice and they also bring action. The cross—border dimension is increasingly important and the Commissioner and others have referred to some of the initiatives – some of the things that we stressed in this report – such as tracking known sex offenders, improving cross—border police cooperation through the work of Europol, Eurojust, and the EU’s role in helping to develop and acquire the necessary investigative expertise. Again, I welcome what the Commissioner has said on that. I think many of us are disturbed to discover that many Member States still do not have functional notice and takedown procedures.

UK legislation includes a very important law which permits British nationals to be prosecuted under UK law for crimes they have committed abroad.  Given the prominent rise in child sex tourism overseas, our citizens must be able to feel the full force of national law when committing these crimes, but more must and can be done by our governments to protect children. In particular, we must do more to tackle the ever-growing issue of illegal content being posted on the Internet.  Whilst this may be more prominent in underground online websites on the so-called ‘Dark Web’, it is also a serious issue in our day-to-day social media outlets. In fact, a BBC investigation this year found that 80% of items reported as child sexual abuse were not actually removed. This is simply not good enough.

For my part, I want to focus on a few measures that I feel are both necessary and urgent. We must ensure that Member States exchange the information they have on pedophiles, in order to prevent those of them who move to another Member State from being able to carry out an activity which brings them into contact with children. We must, in cooperation with internet service providers, provide ourselves with the technological means to detect and block child pornography content, as well as payments intended for such services.

For this reason, this Directive, which fights against sexual abuse and child pornography, is the necessary response so that children and adolescents who should live in safety are not duped by adults who subject them to humiliation, rape and abuse and then use those images, leading, in many cases, these minors to suicide, because they are victims again and again. It is necessary to criminalize sexual extortion, which affects more adolescent girls every day. When will the protection and greater protection for the most vulnerable victims? We need Member States to have a clear definition of child pornography; that the penalties for possession of child abuse material be toughened; that websites that broadcast content are blocked; greater police and judicial cooperation; and that the internet industry assume once and for all its responsibility to guarantee the safety of minors.

This is because millions of Romanian citizens work in the richer western Member States of the EU and many are leaving their children behind, leaving their upbringing to grandparents, friends or their own.

According to one statistic, tens of thousands of such children live in the country and apparently many do not appear in official figures. This phenomenon is also known in other Central and Eastern European states.

Together, let us really make sure that the Member States prioritise child protection. I would also tonight like to pay tribute to the police, the judges, the lawyers, the NGOs, the INHOPE network, Eurojust, Europol, the EU Anti-trafficking Coordinator, the Fundamental Rights Agency, for their relentless efforts to protect children. They are the heroes of our time and deserve our support. According to UNICEF, 53% of children abused are as young as 10 years old, and sexual abuse causes longstanding trauma for children. Often kids denounce their aggressors only when they are adults. Therefore we call on the Member States to extend the statute of limitation for these crimes. I welcome the fact that France has just passed a law to this effect. We also asked for the adoption of aggravating sanctions for offenders who are in a position of trust and authority – teachers, guardians, coaches, a relative – and mandatory background checks. You said it, Commissioner, and I am glad you are going to follow up on our new proposals for persons working with children. Tougher sanctions also for offences against children with disabilities. As regards orphans: yes, institutions that cover up crimes should be held liable, because silence is complicity. On sex tourism, I would like to say that it is criminalised by the Anti-Trafficking Directive. It is a crime under European law, and Member States must do more on prevention: setting up prevention programmes, identifying men at risk of recidivism, training officials, and education for children and parents on the risk of the net. It is important to empower our kids to defend themselves on the net. Updating registers of child sexual offenders and sharing information on criminal convictions and disqualifications.  Child sexual abuse is a cross-border crime and it requires a European response. We have to make full use of the tools that are available at European level – the European Investigation Order, the Arrest Warrant and the Joint Investigation Teams – and we have to share best practices on investigation tools; covert infiltration is not used enough by all the Member States. We also need to improve information-sharing and interoperability.  I shall finish by responding to the issue of data. Yes, we need more data from the Member States so that the Commission can really make a thorough assessment.

And the situation is bound to worsen, as Europe faces a record influx of unaccompanied minors to its coasts, the latter of course being the prime targets of traffickers. The greatest firmness is required with regard to the perpetrators of such acts. However, not only has the European Union failed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the 2011 directive, but many additional measures are needed to effectively combat these abuses. Thus, while Australia has recently instituted exit bans for those convicted of pedophile acts, it is inconceivable that European states do not also crack down on sex tourism, which, in addition to the human tragedies it provokes and permanently tarnishes the image of Western states in the regions affected by these practices.

We cannot waste time, as child pornography takes its victims much more widely than the public perception would be aware of. Exemplary international cooperation is needed to curb this phenomenon, as the Internet knows no borders, so it is not enough to fight one by one at Member State level. In particular, I would like to welcome the fact that the report calls on the Member States to set up hotlines across borders to search for missing children quickly and efficiently. A very good example in this area is AMBER Alert Europe, the European Child Rescue Alert and Police Network for Missing Children. According to the organization, 250,000 children are reported missing in the EU each year. In 76% of cases, the child's life is most at risk within three hours of abduction. As law enforcement often stops at national borders, a rapid international response is essential, especially in border areas. Effective cooperation and joint action between law enforcement, border guards and local authorities will make it possible to find abducted children and save children's lives.

Furthermore, one of the recitals recognizes that \"men are less likely to report abuse.\" I believe that we should deepen this path that makes male victimization visible, imagining solutions to reduce social stigma and forms of intervention better adapted to the needs of children and boys who suffer abuse, from prevention to treatment. I also want to draw attention to an important aspect of child sexual exploitation not included in the report and that has nothing to do with production but with consumption: the massive availability of pornography in this digital age and its negative impact on moral development and neuropsychological of children, adolescents and adults.
