It is with great sadness and emotion that we find ourselves opening our session with words of condolence, while our thoughts turn to the victims of the latest Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe, and our thoughts go out to their families and friends.  A fatal stabbing in Dresden, Germany, in early October: an infamous terrorist attack. On 29 October, three people were killed inside and near a church in Nice. Then again on 2 November four people were killed and several injured in central Vienna. Every victim is part of us and every attack, wherever it occurs, must feel like an attack on us, an attack on the fundamental values that we fight for, which we discuss: freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of conscience. They are attacks on the open society that we want, attacks on the inclusive society in which we believe. It is therefore our common responsibility to combat all forms of extremism and to remain united in solidarity against violence and hatred. The European Parliament will continue to make a major contribution to our living together, in peace. Please join me for a minute's silence in memory of our victims.

Maybe you missed this little detail. I have never received an official request to add to the agenda the proposal you made just now.

Mr Ferber, your request has never been officially submitted and has therefore never been discussed. With regard to the second point you made, I would remind you that the decision on the register of signatures was taken unanimously by the Bureau of Parliament. Of course it was taken for two reasons, and since there is a certain animation I want to explain them.  In recent weeks, hundreds of cases of contagion have occurred in Parliament, and so there was a need, in order to protect our institution and the functioning of Parliament, to take a decision so as not to crowd Parliament. Parliament's Bureau unanimously decided, for a few weeks, to suspend the register of signatures, which can of course be reinstated. But listen to me, otherwise it becomes a dialogue between the deaf! I'm explaining to you what the situation is like. This decision was made for a few weeks. At the next meeting of the Bureau this measure can be corrected.  However, it was important, for everyone's health and for parliament's efficiency, to allow the trilogues we had, the institutional commitments that we had, very importantly, not to close Parliament, because in recent weeks there have been hundreds – including Members, collaborators, Parliament staff – infected people. In the penultimate weekend alone, we had 171 positive cases.  A temporary measure was taken at that time, which I am well aware of is true in order to prevent the possibility of closing Parliament down at the moment. But, of course, we all hope that this measure will be suspended and that it will return to normal.

Yesterday I think that we, all together, made history. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission negotiating teams reached an unprecedented agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Next Generation EU, and on own resources. We started this journey in 2018 with Brexit as the biggest challenge for the next EU budget. At that time, of course, nobody could have imagined that the COVID-19 pandemic would have sadly taken and threatened the lives of our citizens, and put a strain on our economies, businesses and the internal market. This new context has been very present in our MFF negotiations. We are demonstrating that Europe is up to the challenge, that the European institutions can live up to their responsibilities in the face of this unparalleled crisis. Unprecedented circumstances call for unprecedented responses. That is why, once adopted, the new long-term budget and Next Generation EU will represent the largest package ever financed by the EU budget, with a total of EUR 1.8 trillion. This package will help Member States, business, regions and citizens face the pandemic and rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe. A new Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient, and better fit for the current and forthcoming challenges. These negotiations have been lengthy and difficult. But yet, thanks to the constructive spirit of all institutions, including this Parliament, which I thank, we have managed to reach a good deal for our institutions, and most importantly for our citizens. May I say, on a personal note, I want in particular to thank the key representatives of Parliament in these negotiations. We all know it was not always easy to get an agreement, to find a common position, but at the end of the day you made it, we made it and I think this is something I would really like to honour, to salute and to acknowledge. It’s a good deal for the Parliament, I have to acknowledge, and I am grateful for this, because you have attained a number of achievements including the reinforcement of EUR 50 billion for specific programmes compared to the European Council agreement of 21 July. This includes flagship programmes of our Union and key priorities of this Parliament, such as Horizon Europe, InvestEU, Erasmus+, Creative Europe, Health for Europe... you name it. The increase is very substantial for programmes such as Rights and Values, and as I mentioned already, EU for Health, which will, respectively, double and triple compared to the level agreed by Member States in July. Moreover, 30% of EU funds will be used to fight climate change – the highest share ever and a key priority of this Parliament, while the Do No Harm principle applies to the whole of the EU budget. Let me just underline that we must also endeavour to translate this ambition into sectorial legislation. The agreed package also pays attention to biodiversity and gender mainstreaming. The agreement boosts the modernisation of our policies. Considerable funding will be allocated to research and innovation, fair climate and digital transition via the Just Transition Fund and the Digital Europe Programme; and to preparedness, recovery and resilience via the Recovery and Resilience Facility, rescEU and the new EU4Health programme. Parliament called several times for flexibility, and this budget will have increased mechanisms to guarantee it has the capacity to address unforeseen needs. The Flexibility Instrument has been increased further by EUR 1 billion. The overall functioning of special instruments is preserved even with a new set of special instruments, which followed the European Council agreement. The Commission has also committed in a declaration to present a review of the long-term budget by 1 January 2024 and, as appropriate, a proposal for revision. Another big achievement by Parliament and the Union as a whole, which I salute, is a clear roadmap towards new own resources to repay the borrowing for Next Generation EU. A reform of own resources has not been undertaken since the 1980s and we have also succeeded in this during these difficult times. Another collective achievement is our agreement on a rule of law mechanism giving us more power to protect European Union taxpayers’ money. This will be accompanied by an integrated and interoperable information and monitoring system to ensure the collection and comparability of information on the final beneficiaries, to avoid and counter conflicts of interest, irregularities, issues of double funding and criminal mis-use of funds. So I count on your support in translating these provisions into the sectorial legislation. With all this good news we must not forget one thing: we still have essential steps to take for the MFF and Next Generation EU to be in place as of 1 January 2021 as agreed, for the annual budget and completing the sectorial instruments. Time is extremely short and the COVID-19 conditions remain extremely challenging. Our citizens and businesses need the EU budget support. We are on the final sprint and once again I thank you for your strong commitment and dedication.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Jan OLBRYCHT", "mepid": "28288", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. We are almost at the end of a very long road which, as the Commissioner mentioned, started around 2018. It was a complicated road, because it was going in different situations.  Firstly, we had to react to the forthing Brexit. And remember, in Parliament at the time, our decisions indicated that, after the United Kingdom's exit, we wanted to keep the European Union at the same level and that we did not agree with the reduction of the Union's ambitions. And that's what we're sticking to. We believe that Brexit must not bring about a change in the union's actions.  Secondly, there was the problem of a pandemic, which completely changed the situation. Thirdly, there have been new developments which have led to an interest in the rule of law in the European Union or the maintenance of the entire democratic system in the Union.  These new situations, which have arisen recently, mean that the negotiations this year are quite different from in previous years. These are not mere negotiations, when we are trying to find a solution for each other, but a situation in which we have to take into account all the elements. That's why these conversations were so difficult. Please also note that we are considering preparing a conference on the future of Europe, and if we look at these negotiations, the way we talk about borrowing, the ratification of certain actions, the granting of credit and the creation of own revenues, we have in fact already started a discussion about the future of Europe. The European Parliament has already spoken for the first time about the future of Europe. We believe that europe's future lies stronger in Europe, which is why we have fought for certain solutions.  The first very important signal to citizens from the outcome of these negotiations is this: we believe that cuts in important European policies that concern the future of Europe are unacceptable, and we need to strengthen these policies. Not as we would like, of course, but as much as we can. Secondly, we believe that there are important issues for all citizens, such as safety, health, border protection, research. And that's why we put pressure on them. But for us, the future of the European budget also matters. How will it be constructed? How will it work after seven years? What will be the consequences of the financial perspective we are starting now? Hence our very clear emphasis on the design of the budget, on internal mechanisms.  Please note that we have not violated the political agreement reached in the European Council in July this year, but together with the Council and the European Commission, we have found solutions to strengthen policy without violating it. We can really say that everyone has actually benefited from this.  I therefore point out that one of the most important elements in our work was the unity of the European Parliament, which was very visible in our negotiating group. We acted together despite differences of opinion and views. I wanted to make this very clear, because this is an important lesson for Parliament: only acting together gives good results.  At this point, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the negotiating group very much. I have a lot of respect for them because it's hard, but very interesting work. I wanted to thank our colleagues, assistants, advisors. I would like to thank the European Commission and the Commissioner for their cooperation.

We started the week with the news on the vaccine and I hope that today too, the European Union can offer new hope to so many people who are having a hard time. We are asking people for great sacrifices to protect each other. Apart from death, illness and loneliness, thousands of people are losing their jobs, their savings, the business they had so hard to open. We see poverty increase and how there are large inequalities to work from home or care for the elderly and vulnerable. Therefore, no one would understand that here we did not agree to act as soon as possible, especially when the Plan is already on the table. No one can, outside these walls, understand that it is intended to block aid or that procedural issues remain outstanding. A European proposal needs to be addressed to start talking and responding to people's problems. That's what we're here for. The Union takes no action against anyone and is not taken by the link between the rule of law and the Community budget. The new mechanism has been a success of this Parliament and, therefore, of the whole European Union. Because in this chamber, where European popular sovereignty resides, we work to strengthen the democracy and the framework of coexistence that we have given ourselves. Because, without strong institutions, it is citizenship that loses. Please, let's get over the divisions, the blackmails, we're going to think about people. We are already immersed in the second wave of the pandemic and it is difficult to calculate the extent of economic and social damage. The contraction of 8% of GDP is expected this year. Even with a vaccine in the coming months, we would not resume previous growth until 2022. And that's why we need an effort over the next year to cushion the blow and lack of recovery. The Union was soon reacting on the first wave and that is why we now need to regain the initiative. Let's not go mess it all up now. Parliament was the first institution ⸺and I would like here to recall⸺ which urgently called for a Recovery Fund to include debt mutualisation, and the Council adopted it in July. It was a historic decision and I would like this Plan to be a historic success of the Union, of Europe. And it will be if we can implement the next financial framework as soon as possible and also if we get new sources of funding. We're on the right track. For the first time, Parliament has managed to raise the figure adopted by the Council: an additional EUR 16 billion which will enable us to strengthen public health systems, research, Erasmus, culture, development cooperation and, moreover, we have introduced the horizontal principle of equality into the budget between men and women. Moreover, a legally binding commitment to own resources. And we have done this, our negotiators have done it, to which we have to be very grateful because we have remained united and united. You will always be able to count on the loyalty of the Socialists and Democrats to move forward in Europe. For the sake of citizenship, I am confident that the other groups will also maintain Parliament's unity and I hope that no one is thinking right now of using other possibilities to reintroduce austerity or macroeconomic conditionality measures into the Recovery Plan. There is a clear position of this Parliament and that is what we have to defend. I ask you to focus now on ensuring good agreement on own resources, because that way we can finance the recovery. In my political family we are putting everything on our side to make sure we get out of this crisis without leaving anyone behind. They won't see us blackmail or torpedo agreements, or get last-minute tricks out of the joker to take advantage of this juncture. We're here to work for citizenship.

It is a historic achievement not only in the figures, by the amounts we put on the table to respond to this crisis, but also because this reform of the budget means a step forward, it means strengthening two essential and truly European pillars of this budget. I'm thinking here first of all about my own resources. This is the first time that the European Union has borrowed from external financial markets to finance a crisis, is making a decision very quickly, and here we are able, we are able to make a decision because these funds that the European Union assumes with a loan will be repaid from new own resources. It is an essential pillar of the future European budget, because these own resources will contribute not only to those who pollute, because we want a green economy, but also to those who have so far sought, large companies in the digital sector or in other fields, to avoid paying taxes to the European Union, even if they were taking advantage of the common market. And secondly, a second essential and strong pillar of this budget is respect for European values and principles translated into a mechanism to make funds a matter of law, to respect the rule of law. This is the first time that we have made a direct link between the European budget, between European taxpayers' money and respect for values and the rule of law, which is the foundation for the establishment of this European Union.  And here is that when the European institutions are working in the same direction, when the European Parliament really assumes the bargaining power and representation of its citizens, we can move very much forward in strengthening the European Union. Beyond that, and this time, the European Parliament has managed to obtain complementary amounts to what the European Council has proposed in order to strengthen truly European programmes. And I am thinking here not just of the European health programme, which, even though it was proposed with great enthusiasm, was left without funding or with very little funding by the Council. After Parliament's negotiation, this health programme comes out strengthened. We also have more money for research, which we see how important it is these days, we have more money for young people or for strengthening European borders, behold, more money for truly European projects. Beyond this, it is now important that we can also move forward on the negotiations on the instrument of recovery and resilience, where the European Parliament must have an important say at the same time. I conclude by saying that this time no one will be able to say that the European Union is a colossus with feet of clay, because the European Union and the European Parliament have shown strength, flexibility, dynamism and courage in these negotiations, and the European Parliament has managed to turn a crisis into an opportunity to strengthen the European Union.

Have you learned the lessons of the first wave? Last March, in the face of total unpreparedness, in front of Europe deprived of masks and medicines, in the face of the economic collapse caused by the breakdown of supply chains dependent in particular on Asia and China, you seemed to react. We had heard the words \"sovereignty,\" \"strategy,\" \"independence,\" which our current of thought had so far been the only one to bear. But do these words lead to realities? Will we fund, will relocations be encouraged? Mr. Thierry Breton claimed that they had begun. Do we have any figures, statistics, specific examples? We believe that part of the recovery should be played on recovery incentives for companies. Will these aids be conditional? Will there be quid pro quo? Will the vulnerability of our small and medium-sized businesses be taken into account? Finally, it is essential that the autonomy of European states can be developed. We must invest in localism, i.e. bring producers closer to places of consumption, shorten supply chains and regain industrial independence on our strategic activities. These objectives are essential and this recovery plan must devote all its efforts to achieving them. Let us invest for our security, our future, our peoples and our nations. Colleagues, the recovery plan, which must serve our jobs, our businesses, our production, our citizens, our peoples, is taxpayers' and citizens' money. But you are only a citizen of your country. The artificial citizenship of the European Union, the detestable citizenship of the world, fantasies of uprooted cosmopolitans, have and must have no political reality. However, the European Union seeks to take away the right to raise taxes in the name of a regal prerogative. Until now, the European Union's financial revenues have come from payments by The Member States of amounts set on a fraction of GDP or from certain national taxes - no doubt, in the eyes of this European Union, it was still too much room for States, even if this place was only that of the sheep being mowed. But here comes the European tax, this tax that will make all the French, all the Germans, the Italians, the Spaniards, the Belgians, all the citizens of European countries, the tax subjects to the euro-globalist super-state. It is this tax, hitherforthed, forked under cloak, that the health crisis gives the opportunity to establish. Finally, these new citizens of the European Republic will have the privilege of repaying the giant loans that the European Union will raise on the financial markets because the Union, nor the Member States, has the right to finance itself from its own Central Bank. Adopted in the midst of the crisis, in haste, these worrying changes, which change the political status of each of the 450 million inhabitants of the European territory, represent a danger to democracy. If we want to finance ourselves, there is no shortage of solutions: public subscriptions with treasury bill issues, increases in state payout rates or the repeal of scandalous rebates granted to northern states in exchange for the adoption of the stimulus package. According to its Constitution, France participates in the European Union, but it must not blend in with it. Colleagues, in line with the industrial dispossession allowed by European ultraliberalism and the fiscal dispossession provided for by the New European Union's own resources, here is finally the most detestable dispossession: political dispossession. The recovery plan provides for conditioning European aid, not on the relocation of companies or the maintenance of employment, but on respect for the rule of law, i.e. full submission to so-called liberal-libertarian progressivism. Our compatriots, by dint of hearing it everywhere, confuse the rule of law with the legal state - the legal state is the one that respects the right to act, the rule of law is something else: it is the state that obeys certain political principles that themselves dictate the law. But what principles? Who chooses them? Who decides them? Gianni Buquicchio, chairman of the Council of Europe's Venice Commission for the Rule of Law and Democracy, said on radio on 5 November that the rule of law did not impose anything on its own and depended on what politics put into it, that is, what democratic choice decides to put in it, nothing but the democratic choice. When the peoples of Poland and Hungary, freely and voluntarily, elect Euro-refractory governments, affirm their attachment to their traditions, to their history, they define the political doctrine that the rule of law must apply. They have a sovereign and legitimate right to do so. And their rule of law is beyond reproach. When foreign governments, even unelected technocrats, such as those of the European Commission, who support other political principles, come, through a despicable blackmail of big money, to summon Poland and Hungary to betray the decisions of their peoples, it is these governments and technocrats who violate the rule of law. Such a behaviour of moral authoritarianism, which seeks to impose hegemony on the conscience of Europeans, is unbearable. If the people choose, the state executes: the rule of law is guaranteed in Hungary and Poland. If you do not like the voice of the people, you are the one who has a problem with the rule of law, ladies and gentlemen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not dwell on the merits of the agreement, but rather affirm my pride, my pride in two respects.  First of all, that of being part of a European Parliament which, this time, had the courage to defend its convictions. In the past, this same Parliament spoke loudly, rolled mechanics and then, in many cases, lowered its flag without even defending its values in the face of the Council. It was not the same this time.  Parliament wanted a more ambitious budget, wanted a budget aligned with the values of the European Union, starting with respect for the rule of law, and also wanted a more forward-looking budget, starting with the ecological and solidarity transition. And, on these three areas, it is undeniable that the agreement reached yesterday substantially improves the Agreement of July obtained by the Council.  Of course, it is never enough - I can already hear some colleagues say so. That is true, but in the political balance of power that the elections gave us, I think it was the best deal that was possible. The second topic I wanted to address is the fact that today we live in a political world where it seems that, to succeed, the recipe par excellence is to polarize our societies, to oppose the camp of good to the camp of evil. I think that logic is deadly for our societies.  On the contrary, it is the logic of dialogue, the logic of compromise, the logic of collective intelligence that has enabled us to give the European Union an instrument, not the only one, but a crucial instrument to address the social, environmental, democratic, economic and health challenges we face.  Well, I am proud that this logic of compromise prevailed, and I would like to say a greeting to our Conservative, Liberal and Socialist colleagues and salute their spirit of openness and compromise throughout the proceedings. Because the compromise we have reached is a compromise that goes beyond political families, but also a compromise that goes beyond institutional boundaries.

These negotiations have been intense, or intensive, because all those engaged were fully aware of what was at stake. First of all, I want to thank all the delegations involved, the Council and the Commission, but certainly also my colleagues in the negotiating team – most of them are present here today – for their efforts and their constructive cooperation during those weeks. It’s fair to say that we have been working hard and we needed to work hard because we were faced with a fait accompli. The July conditions of the Council conclusions were untouchable: that’s what we heard and that’s what we had to change because we thought there was a lot wrong in those conclusions. We fought for our priorities and there can be some satisfaction with what we reached or what we achieved. From the start of the negotiations, I emphasised very much that it is very important that we strengthen the future-oriented, innovation-oriented programmes like Horizon, InvestEU, Erasmus... and EU4Health, of course. When drawing up the budget for 2020 we already made an important change in that direction, and that has been strengthened now. Additional resources will be available for all those things that are crucial – for future jobs, future growth, future competitiveness and also, certainly for the fight against climate change. Compared to the European Council’s conclusion of July, we have EUR 15 billion extra for these flagship programmes. And let me especially draw your attention to the fact that for EU4Health, we have been able to triple the budget, and we also secured that adequate new resources are available, or will be available, to honour the considerable future burden of the EUR 750 billion for the Next Generation EU. With the conclusion of these negotiations, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) can finally be activated. This is absolutely important to get us over and beyond the crisis, and it’s up to the Council now. We’ve heard repeatedly in recent months and weeks that it is Parliament that is stalling, Parliament that is delaying, Parliament that is responsible for this or that. Well, the short answer to these allegations is no!

We have a budget that strengthens the present and protects the future. It strengthens the health program (tripled it). Citizens are well aware of this importance. We need a vaccine: it strengthens the investigation. We need jobs: it also strengthens the InvestEU programme.  It also protects the future, protects citizens. For the first time, we are committed to the Council that the European Union's own resources, the sources of funding, are introduced in such a way that they are sufficient to pay off the debt created by the Recovery Fund. We have a basket of own resources, so there are no cuts in funds and programs. This is also a crucial point for the future.   It is that, at the moment, the costs of debt that are in the budget ceilings are only 0.01 % of the budget for seven years. That's €12.9 billion. But after 2027, the cost of debt will be €15 billion a year, it will be 10% of the budget and therefore it is crucial that we have new own resources to protect the budget in the future, so as not to burden citizens at the same time, to avoid cuts in programmes that are essential and also in their funds. That is why this agreement, which is binding, an interinstitutional agreement also has a timetable for the introduction of new own resources with a simple principle: those who do not pay must pay. And it's only fair that the digital giants pay. It is right that there should be a tax on financial transactions or a carbon adjustment mechanism at borders that will at the same time even help to give competitiveness to our small and medium-sized enterprises.  Then we have also strengthened the legitimacy of this Parliament. We will be involved in the Recovery Fund and we have also done something historic in Article 122 that has not been mentioned, an article that the Council has used not only for the Recovery Fund, but, for example, also for the European Stability Mechanism. From now on, Parliament, when the Council wishes to use Article 122, will be involved, with the aim of reaching a common understanding in joint meetings on the budgetary implications.

Every one more important. And the truth is that 2020 has been a very tough year and we needed good news and finally it seems that November is bringing them to us.  On the financial framework and own resources, I would also like to highlight the history of the agreement. What has been achieved is a radical change: for the extra 16 billion and also for the introduction of new own resources, because it was urgent to address this debate. We need better funding for budgets, we need it for the recovery plan, and we also need to end the shortcomings of a fragmented, unfair and insolidary system that many take advantage of.  And to historical agreement, which we also reached last week on the linkage of the European budget with the rule of law, which was not so long ago unthinkable. Finally, we have a clear and applicable mechanism on which this Parliament had been working for years.  In this agreement we have succeeded in improving the scope, linking it with the values defined in Article 2 of the Treaty. We have introduced the preventive nature, added a list of examples and on top of that we have included tax evasion and evasion among the objectives. And we have also established a system to provide guarantees to final beneficiaries—that is, students, universities, researchers, NGOs—so that they are not affected by the freezing of funds to their governments. And, also, we will evaluate the effectiveness of this mechanism in three years because it is a new mechanism.  And finally—and we keep making history—the recovery plan. Here we still have the final negotiation of the content with the Council and, for this, Parliament already has its position. I hope to find in the Council the same goodwill as in the previous dossiers.  The incredible welcome these two historic agreements have had shows that when we work together and with the aim of building a Europe that protects its citizens, things go well.

Let us take time, let us be aware of what was achieved yesterday by MEPs in this House: EUR 16 billion. Sixteen billion! This is an unprecedented victory. In 2006, four billion euros. In 2013, zero billion euros of fresh money. We tripled the health budget, where Member States saw it as a national competence that should remain national, even in times of pandemic. We have corrected this nonsense. What happened yesterday is proof that Europe is not driven only by states, and only by states. By fully exercising our role, we MEPs have shown that we are the guardians of Community Europe, the guardians of the interests of Europeans, who demand more money for the mobility of students, who ask for more money for research, who demand more money for our borders, who demand more money for our cultural sector. Colleagues, we have done it! We were laughed at, we were told to go back down to earth, that we would only have bums... We did it. And on own resources, now, what should we say? Because the $16 billion is nothing in terms of volume compared to what we are going to get from these new own resources. We're finally going to have a carbon adjustment mechanism at the borders, we're finally going to have a tax on the digital giants, we're finally going to have a tax on financial transactions. And this tax on financial transactions, like the others, if we got it, it is because we negotiated, not by making trials of intent to those on the other side and around the table. Be aware: we have not created a real resource of our own since tariffs. That was 50 years ago. Let us therefore take stock: in April, we called in this House for the creation of a massive recovery plan. Today is 11 November, and we have a plan of 750 billion euros, but we also now have the assurance that this plan will not be reimbursed by European citizens, but that it will be reimbursed by the digital giants, by the financial institutions that speculate, or by the non-European companies that pollute. My friends, what a victory! What a victory! Even the Greens have told us that they will vote in favour of this budget. How long has this not happened, ladies and gentlemen? Since when? Ladies and gentlemen, I say congratulations to this European Parliament, I say congratulations to this European Parliament!

We are in a dramatic pandemic. Almost the whole of Europe, including parts of this Parliament, are in lockdown, and the lesson of COVID should be that together we invest more in our public health system. That is why we were shocked when, after the Council summit, we realised that the Heads of State or Government wanted to cut back on health. Instead of cutting back on health, we are now tripling the European health programme, and I believe that this is a very central success that we have achieved here together in the European Parliament.  The culture and the creative sector are also very much affected by the COVID crisis. We are all experiencing this in our countries, theatres and cinemas have to close, many tours are cancelled, artists are fighting for their existence. That is why it is more than just a signal that we have negotiated over EUR 600 million more for the Creative Europe programme.  But COVID is also a global crisis. Poorer countries outside the EU do not have the same opportunities to respond to the crisis as we have in common in the European Union. That is why it is right and proper that we have mobilised EUR 1.5 billion to help other countries, to contribute to global development. But COVID is above all also a crisis of democracy when we see what is happening in Poland, what is happening in Hungary, but also in many other countries. That is why it is absolutely right and sensible that we should now have an instrument that makes it more difficult for democracy destroyers such as Viktor Orban to carry on with their policies as before. And it is right and proper that we will double the Rights and Values programme to help NGOs – democracy—NGOs, LGBTI organisations, but also organisations fighting for equality – to fight this fight on the ground.  We must fight all crises, and the biggest crisis remains the climate crisis. And even if this budget decision, which we will take in a few weeks' time, will not solve everything, we have managed to make important instruments binding in the budgetary objective: the principle of damage prevention, a binding biodiversity quota, which will mean that biodiversity is not simply taken more into account in the budget, but that nature conservation becomes a separate budgetary objective.

Immediately we, the European Parliament, recognised the good parts of that agreement and we also pointed at those areas where the agreement could still be improved. We recognised that the allocations which the 27 heads of state and government had negotiated amongst themselves for each country was something that the Parliament should not challenge. But we also said that, in the European programmes – in the future—oriented programmes, those programmes which should make Europe more digital, more modern, more competitive – the heads of state and government had made cuts and more money was needed. And our negotiators, after intense negotiations, have managed to achieve a very good result, and the number is EUR 16 billion more for the people of Europe as a result of the demands and the fight of the European Parliament. Is that a lot? Yes, it is an amount which makes a big difference to the budgetary lines it will go to. Let me just mention some figures: on the health programme, we are tripling the budget from EUR 1.7 billion to EUR 5 billion; the research programme, EUR 4.4 billion more – and just two days ago, we learned that the European company which received European support from EU money for research is in the lead with regards to discovering a vaccine; Erasmus, EUR 2.2 billion more, which means almost one million young Europeans will be able to have a scholarship in the next seven years because of the achievements of Parliament. And we are also reinforcing the Rights and Values Programme because, yes, we have an agreement on the rule of law mechanism, there is conditionality. Those who breach the rule of law should be sanctioned, but those NGOs who defend the rule of law, they should be supported. The rule of law mechanism also contains, as a demand of the Parliament, one very important prerogative: it says that the beneficiaries of EU funds should never suffer if a government attacks the rule of law. There are three pillars for the EU budget for the next seven years. The multiannual financial framework I just spoke about was a good result. The rule of law I just spoke about was also a good result. And there is also the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and here, Commissioner, I can report that the European Parliament is on track. This week we are giving the final mandate to our negotiating team, to the three co—rapporteurs, and one of them for the final negotiations with Parliament. What will we demand? We will support the allocation criteria and the amounts for each of the countries as negotiated in the Council, but we want to prolong the programme from three to four years because we now learn that Corona is a longer—term crisis, and we want to make sure that money gets where it’s needed. The more money you spend, the more you need to make sure that the control is good, that there is a strong goal for OLAF and for the European Public Prosecutor, and a strong goal for reform.

And this can be a starting point for changing the structure of funding for the European Union budget. The 7-in-7-year discussions of the famous 1 % that Member States pay and which verbalise, but never verbalise, the benefits of belonging to the European Union and the internal market. We have ensured that the costs of next generation EU will not be paid at the expense of European policies, Cohesion Policy or the CAP. We have strengthened the powers of the European Parliament in the Recovery Fund, thereby ensuring more transparency and democratic accountability. We have also managed to strengthen European policies by EUR 16 billion.

What is clear is that the Member States – as we saw at the summit – are only fighting for their own interests. It's just about how much they pay in and how much they get out. If we really want to make Europe fit for the future, we need to focus more on what we need together for the future. And the European Parliament has achieved a great deal, achieved as much as possible. But we must also say that in the conference on the future of Europe, we must talk about how we can create even more for the future of Europe.  And we have successfully tackled a second issue, that is the rule of law. After all, it is not acceptable for EU funds to be taken, but for EU values to be trampled underfoot afterwards. And because a previous speaker from the French right has just said, well, there are actually no common values and the rule of law, because that is different in every country, and that would also depend on traditions and so on, I would like to make it quite clear here that there are clearly common European values in Europe, and every Member State has committed itself to them by joining the European Union. It is not the case that some people come from Europe and say that you have to stick to any values now. We have set them together in Article 2, and we will defend them here, and this Is what this European Parliament has fought for, ladies and gentlemen.  We must make it quite clear that we have achieved a great deal in this. We have finally ensured that the rule of law reappears in this regulation and that this was not just such a small addition, as the Council wanted, but rather that we also protect the independence of the judiciary again. We have linked it to the annual report on the rule of law, so that we can bring together the various instruments there. We have also ensured that the recipients of the money are protected, because in the end we do not want to punish ordinary citizens, but governments that do not abide by European values. We have achieved a great deal in this.  This mechanism is not what we dreamed of. But it is more than I dared to hope for in the meantime, for example, because the negotiations with this Council were really difficult. One had the feeling that Viktor Orban was sitting at the negotiating table. And to him, who is still threatening to stop this whole budget and everything because of the rule of law, I want to make one thing very clear here: if he does that, he will clearly show that he cares nothing about the European future, nothing about the future of his country and its citizens, but only about his corrupt friends.

I can even see some historical components in it. Of course, in such a complex deal one can always find flaws and disappointments. But the question that we have to ask ourselves is: with this comprehensive budget deal, are we making the EU stronger or weaker? My answer to that is stronger. Especially when it comes to the post-pandemic Recovery Fund, the new own resources and the rule of law conditionality. These three instruments are a step forward towards more integration. They could have been more ambitious – true, but it’s also true that they could have not been there at all. The selfishness of Member States regarding an outdated understanding of national interest – all this could have made all the efforts derail, as so often happens, but this has not been the case so far. Concerning the content of the MFF (Multiannual Financial Framework), this is the least ambitious part of the deal. For instance, the research programme gets far less money than it should, while military spending appears too much in this budget.

We have delivered in own-resources. For the MFF, we have delivered on flagship programmes and, for me, most importantly, we have delivered on the rule of law. Last Thursday, we reached an agreement with the Council as regards the rule of law conditionality. I honestly call this a historic milestone for protecting European Union values, a milestone that we have waited for years to come true. For the first time, we have established a mechanism that enables the European Union to stop funding governments that disrespect our common values, such as the rule of law. Most importantly, we did not compromise on the values. We made sure that the rule of law is seen in the context of all the Union’s values enshrined in the Treaties, such as the independence of the judiciary. With this regulation, every breach of the rule of law – any breach of the rule of law – can be covered by the mechanism, from individual breaches to systemic or recurrent breaches for which no mechanism has existed so far. And more than that, we opened the scope. We have a separate list for breaches of the principles of the rule of law. We reduced the timeline from the Presidency’s proposal; we put back in the text the protection of the final beneficiaries.  I really want to thank my co-rapporteur Eider Gardiazabal Rubial and the whole European Parliament negotiation team. I believe we all agree that this mechanism may not be perfect, but it is a significant improvement compared to the proposal we received from the Presidency. In this connection, I would also like to thank the German Presidency for very, very constructive negotiations. Going back just a couple of years, there were not many who believed we could achieve this much, if anything. We, as the European Parliament, listened to the will of the citizens and pushed for a real rule of law conditionality mechanism that actually works.

Community programmes such as EU4Health for public health, Horizon Europe for research and training, creative Europe for culture, Erasmus for our young people will not be cut to repay interest on European public debt, because that will finally require the Union's own resources, which have been talked about for decades. No more taxes for citizens, as some would have us believe, but the possibility of finally putting our tax system back on track, with the web tax, with the tax on financial transactions, with the carbon border tax. The risk that, with Europe's extraordinary aid plan for the economic recovery from the pandemic, the important contribution of the States would be considered exhausted and that we would have to be satisfied with a budget even lower than the current one, that risk was high.  On the other hand, the message that starts from here is clear: we do not want to sacrifice the future in the face of the dramatic needs of the present that we are experiencing, but rather Europe is facing the present precisely by looking up to a future recovery that leaves no one behind and that does not pass on the costs to future generations, who have the right to live in a Europe that lives up to their expectations and that is cohesive around its values.

We have a tool to fight back against democracy backsliding and to make sure that EU support reaches those who need it the most, instead of disappearing into the pockets of corrupt oligarchs. But our work is not done yet. We need to continue to be the voice of our citizens who witnessed the abuse of EU funds up close day by day and who have spent years calling on Europe to finally do something about it. We need to make sure that Europe continues to listen to them.  This rule of law mechanism is not only a piece of legislation. It is a resounding commitment that Europe is ready to take action. Let me tell you, action could not be more urgent. I am sitting here in Budapest, where every day there is a new scandal breaking. Our country, this morning, woke up to the news that the government is about to amend the constitution to make it easier to funnel public funds to oligarchs. They should be protecting lives but instead they are protecting their own pockets. And, up until now, EU action has been disappointingly slow or even completely absent. But now, we have all European institutions, all major political groups, lined up behind this commitment. Now there are no ifs, no buts and no excuses. Let us remember, a few years ago such a rule of law mechanism or new own resources existed only in the visions that were outlined by my fellow MEPs, Guy Verhofstadt or Sophia in 't Veld, at the plenary of the Parliament. And I was one of those EU citizens who was inspired by them and who kept on enthusiastically hitting the like and share buttons on social media. And now, thanks to this Parliament, these visions are within our grasp and it is very humbling to be present when this first draft of history is being written. This budget shows the stark difference between those who bet against the European project and those who never stopped believing in it, because even a few months ago, it was unthinkable that we will have a budget of this size and this ambition. This was the bet of European populists – they have written the EU off. They believe that European democracy is losing and the future is creeping authoritarianism from Russia, China or even Donald Trump’s United States. But they were completely wrong.  The best thing about liberal institutions is their capacity to constantly renew and reinvent themselves and this is why Europe always rebounds. This is why those writing us off could not be more mistaken. We will keep on fighting and no amount of midnight legislative crackdowns will be able to stop us.

Let me have a rather contrasting look at the package that is now being proposed to us. We have a formula in France that is often used and reused here: this agreement deserves neither excess of honour nor indignity. No indignity, because this is the first time that we have a recovery plan that allows us to have European solidarity and that is something that did not exist. No indignity, because we also won on the setting aside, a little bit, of the Semester, which forced us to austere policies - we see obviously that this is not the right thing to do today. No indignity, either, because there are first leads to own resources, but I will come back to that. No indignity, finally, because, it is true, for a very long time, this is the first time that we have a slightly - very slightly, but still - revalued multi-year budget, to the tune of EUR 16 billion. But no excess of honour either, because there have been missed opportunities in these negotiations. Now I want to go back to own resources. These own resources are fundamental, for two reasons. Firstly, they are the ones that guarantee us that we have European sovereignty where we are not under the constant blackmail of the Council to decide our budgetary fate. They are also very important because that is what makes it possible to have a fair tax system. And the Council's refusal of the financial transaction tax is an extremely serious political fault. During this period of crisis, the richest continued to enrich themselves through the financialization of the economy and speculation. This tax on financial transactions would have been a means of bringing tax justice to the level of the Union, and the Council refused to do so.

Why is this a big step? Because we are in fact breaking three long-standing taboos in Europe. The first taboo was no eurobonds, no recovery bonds – that was impossible. That was the call of the Council and of everybody after the financial crisis. And what we will do now with this programme is launch nearly one trillion of these bonds on the market, and the first bond that has been launched is a huge success. The second new thing we are doing concerns own resources. I have heard for years ‘no, it’s impossible to have new own resources’ – for 10 years we have fought for that. It’s there and it’s not taxing the ordinary citizen, it’s taxing Google, Amazon, the big tech companies in America, imported products from China, which are in fact bad for our environment, and so on. So I don’t know what Mr Eppink has against taxing Google and Facebook and Amazon – who is against it? Not the citizens, anyway. And then there is the fact that there will no longer be money for authoritarians. But I want to give two short warnings. The first is to the Commission. Mr Hahn, tell your colleagues to use now the tools. I hear already in the corridors, ‘now we going to use this and we’re going to try to find out if Hungary and Poland are in accordance with the system’... but you have to do nothing at all, that has already been proved! You have now to use it and not wait two or three years before doing it. And my second warning is this: let’s not stop the reform of the European Union. There are other things to tackle: the lack of a European Defence Community, the unanimity rule, and the fact that we cannot elect our own leader.

This agreement that we approve today is a good proof of this.  For Boris Johnson or Donald Trump, Europe was just a market to compete against. They were wrong. Europe is its values and principles, against which competition cannot be enjoyed. Without its values and principles, Europe is nothing. That is why today we put the rule of law before the market.  Today we create a mechanism on the rule of law that will enshrine in this continent that principles and values always lead to the market. It is born with the confidence not to be used, because what it seeks is not to punish anyone, but to protect us all. It is our alarm in the face of authoritarianism; it aims to protect us from present or future temptations of those who abuse power and pretends that those who order what to say and what to think, what is true and what is not, do not dare to do so because they find punishment.  Nationalpulism, like all viruses, does not discriminate by frontier, race or gender. Look, if not, what's going on in the United States of America, where the strongest, most stable and uninterrupted democracy in 250 years hasn't been able to stop its acting president from accepting an election result.  If what Donald Trump is doing was done by the president of another American country, the US Congress would already be talking about sanctions. That is what this mechanism is all about: putting democracy before the economy.  The rule of law is respect for the equality of men and women; it is respect for diversity, for religious, educational freedom; respect for freedom of expression, freedom of the press, independence from justice. All of that is more important than the market.  This rule of law mechanism is not born against anyone; born to defend us all.

And the result was: 16 billion more, for a total of about 1 800 billion for this multiannual budget. But it is not just the figures and the quantity that count, there are two other aspects that I would like to highlight. The first is the system logic that has been used for the first time, I would say revolutionary: the multiannual framework has been approved together with the revision of own resources and we can finally ask for heavy contributions from the multinationals of the web, we can ask polluting companies not to do it again and to pay taxes, if by chance they do and do not help us in the fight against climate change. The review of own resources will enable us, in a package-specific way, to finance the NextGenerationEU. This had never happened, they are extraordinary answers to gigantic needs. In fact, we cannot be small when the demands are enormous, we cannot back down when colossal demands arrive. The second element is the relationship between the budget and democracy: the budget is the beating heart of democracies, it is the way in which we explain to our citizens what we do and how we do it. We need a healthy, clean and transparent EU budget to make it clear where we are going; we need an ambitious budget to prevent this devastating crisis from spreading.

I note that the Council is absent, which is strange because they are the other half of the agreement, but apparently they don’t care. And there is a contrast between the attitude of the Council and Parliament. Colleagues, do you remember the scenes of last summer, the balcony scenes, where they were fighting like cats and dogs over money, where there were political games, where there were vetoes, blackmail, and acrimony? It was the worst of the European Union, the image that they showed the citizens. Compare that to today. The European Parliament has a lot less drama than the Council, but we deliver, we deliver on change. We made a qualitative change. We deliver on the rule of law. We deliver on climate. We deliver on recovery from the COVID crisis. The European Parliament has done its job, as always. We take responsibility. On the rule of law conditionality, I’m very happy that we have the mechanism, but now we also expect the European Commission to act on it. And we need to remember that this is about conditionality, it’s not a sanctions mechanism. That means that every single penny that will be spent has to be checked against compliance with the rule of law standards. Every single penny!

Finally, I think the situation with Mr Orbán shows that we desperately need to change the system. It cannot be that a single autocrat is holding the entire European Union hostage.

What a bizarre fantasy land these people live in. Hungary and Poland are among the biggest recipients of EU funds.

I think one thing is pretty obvious: that those that are screaming the loudest now about this are the ones that have to fear the most from this new conditionality. Just last night, the Hungarian minister, as some colleagues have referred to, has put forward new constitutional changes that would make it impossible for the opposition to run in a coordinated fashion.

We are discussing a very broad package here today, including the building fund. This week, on Monday, in the Committee on Budgets and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have finalised the votes on this issue and are now ready to negotiate this package with the Council.  I am pleased that we have managed to reach a common broad approach here in the European Parliament. I do not want to hide the fact that there are, of course, a few downsides in this dossier. Of course, it was our task to bring into this programme what the Heads of State or Government did not do, namely to create European added value. However, while the Heads of State or Government have said that this must also be conditional, there was a large group here, namely the Social Democrats, which said: no, there must be no conditions. Not even the conditions that we now have in the Structural Funds regulation, not even the conditions that we have for other support programmes, the only one is the rule of law, but I will come back to that in a while. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, anyone who sees this aid fund only as a money-saving bank, where it is easy to withdraw but does not have to meet conditions – this is not our world, and I hope that this can still be corrected in the negotiations with the Council.

After all, after many citizens were sceptical at the beginning of the pandemic that the EU had been doing too little too slowly, we are now proving that there is a cross-border, a European, powerful response to this pandemic – in the interests of the citizens. I am sure that this will increase confidence in the EU.  But another point, or one that is included in it, is even more existential for confidence in the European Union. For the EU's acceptance has long suffered from the fact that there are governments in Member States that have distanced themselves from the soil of common values. Here, too, we are sending a powerful signal with the conditionality of the rule of law. The most important signal is that all Member States are equally committed to the values of Article 2. No Member State can claim to have its own interpretation of these values. We know the situation, some governments are probably confusing rule of law with rule by law. They believe that because they have a majority, they can do and leave what they want, make the judiciary dependent on themselves, subjugate the media, curtail the rights of the opposition, thus making any democratic control impossible. It is good that the EU is sending out a signal.  I am particularly grateful that the full scope of Article 2 is covered, that the Copenhagen criteria are also mentioned and that the preventive nature of the mechanism is emphasised. United in diversity – yes, we can all shape our systems differently, but we are all on the ground under Article 2, and at the end of the day we decide what the rule of law means, and that is the European Court of Justice. And what was particularly important to social democracy is that in the end it is not the recipients of the grant, the recipients, not the towns and municipalities, the companies, the cultural workers, the students, the research institutions, but the governments that are sanctioned. The money must reach the beneficiaries, and the Commission must ensure that. It hasn't become what we wanted, it's not ideal.

We don't want economic macro-conditionality. We do not want European Semester reforms to be imposed that have nothing to do with the mechanism. We want ambitious climate targets that do not spend money on polluting activities. Parliament will say this and I hope and wish the Council to listen to us in the negotiations we will begin.  We are at a very important time for the European Union. We will double the amount of resources available by the European institutions.

Universities and research will receive more money, young people's exchange programmes will also be safeguarded, and more resources will also be put into monitoring the Borders of the European Union. It is also important that we now have an agreement on the EU's own resources. It will safeguard the EU budget for the next few years and will also allow us to finance a large recovery fund.

For example, the EU's carbon border tariff is something that will certainly receive broad support.  But what is particularly historic about this solution is the agreement on the rule of law.

Well, to all those who went to the polls even with skepticism and doubt, the message this afternoon is very clear. Here is proof that the European Parliament matters. With a historic achievement, for the first time it has managed to double the firepower of the multiannual financial framework, the Recovery Fund and all the instruments to ensure the necessary funding for education, innovation, culture. But the Council's proposal has also increased the Council's proposal by EUR 16 billion.

Our three institutions involved in the legislative process have just demonstrated that we can leave behind the obstacles that once made it impossible to make the progress that we will soon approve. The second factor of change is the new U.S. administration that will be put in place, with a return to correct reports: is it not going to change anything? For the optimist that I am, it will change everything: international cooperation, multilateralism - badly damaged, alas - and the fight against climate change are once again becoming real perspectives.  Good news for us, good news because the gravediggers of our fundamental values, the enemies of a free press, as well as the friends of a justice at the boot of the ruling party, have just lost a major ally in the fight against European integration. The decision to introduce a compliance clause is timely. Recipients of European funds will now have to comply with the commitments to which they themselves have signed up. Good start for the new decade, good start for the Commission which will have to apply this clause with great skill, a lot of talent and a lot of perseverance.

I believe that it is an important step for the European Union in this crisis, and we could only achieve this step – as Mr Herbst has just said – because we were united and self-confident.  And today's debate shows that, of course, we will need this unity and self-confidence in the coming weeks, too, in the coming weeks, so that we can keep the Member States – 27 in number – all in line, whether on the subject of the rule of law, whether on the issue of own resources or on the issue of increasing the EU budget. But this unity and self-confidence, Mr President, wins an assembly like this – we have learned this several times in history – as a democracy from the demos. We do not live in a video cracy, and that is why it is important that we retain the opportunity to meet here, under special security regulations and to a lesser extent, even in the crisis. That is why the debate today is important.  When Mr Aguilar of the Socialists points out here that we represent forty-four million people, he is of course also doing so in order to make it clear that if we stick together, if we stand together and confidently, we will achieve precisely this objective: to give the citizens of Europe an understanding that we want to show solidarity and that the budget is an expression of this solidarity.  Mr President, I would like to add, however, that the European Parliament has always seen itself as a supporter of the Commission, particularly in the budgetary field, in this crisis, but we have never had the impression that we are there to finance the Member States. That is why, on the one hand, when monitoring the EUR 750 billion in the Recovery and Resilience Instrument, we are asking for real control that these funds are also spent at European level and do not serve as a kind of money-saving account for Member States' budgets.

Here is the proof: from yesterday, the Orban government has today submitted, under the cover of night, a constitutional amendment that will make it very much easier to steal public funds in Hungary, while at the same time starting a unilateral one-party overhaul and revision of electoral law. Orban showed everyone in Europe in one night that we made the right decision when we introduced the rule of law condition, because this will be much more necessary in the future than ever before.  We must finally make the Hungarian Prime Minister understand together that he cannot do anything to the Hungarian and European people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Marc ANGEL", "mepid": "202073", "text": "   – [Inaudible] While negotiating the multiannual financial framework and the recovery fund this Parliament stayed strong and didn’t allow itself to be blackmailed by some autocratic governments or by some of the so-called frugal governments.

The concrete roadmap on new own-resources is the merit of this House, and this will allow us and our budget not to rely too heavily on contributions from Member States which would continue to divide our Union into net payers and net receivers. As a member of the S&amp;D Group, I’m especially pleased that own resources like a financial transaction tax and corporate tax base ensure that everybody pays their fair share.

This is extremely helpful in backing our work because we are not yet there. We have found a political agreement which was important, but now it’s about taking the necessary approvals and then of course it’s about implementation, and this was highlighted by several speakers. I think we have really to focus on implementation throughout the seven years, but in particular at the beginning of those seven years, because this is also related to the response to the COVID crisis, where people need our support, where businesses need our support in order to survive and to protect jobs, for instance, which is equally important and therefore I am very grateful for this strong support. By the way, we have also protected and safeguarded the political priorities which we have discussed for many months, if not to say years here in this House, the Green Deal but also digitalisation, and to work together here. I am confident that we can also achieve in due time all the necessary approvals in order really to start working, and to implement what we have discussed, what we have decided and what we have envisaged. I once again thank you and I ask for your further support. I have no doubts. I didn’t have any doubts, and after this discussion have even fewer doubts that we will get the right backing from this Parliament for these very ambitious goals for the next couple of years. Plus, as was said by almost every speaker, it’s about Europe, our citizens and it’s about helping people to overcome this crisis, and to be even stronger afterwards, and this should be our goal. But we should, by the way, not forget our responsibility in the world. This was also highlighted by several speakers. Europe can only be successful, finally, if we are part of a more peaceful, a more cooperative world, and in that respect I think also the recent developments in the United States should give some hope.

Unfortunately, the success of these negotiations is deeply overshadowed by the departure from the compromise conclusions of the Council of 21 July this year and the adoption of solutions on the so-called conditionality of budget expenditure, far exceeding the protection of the EU's financial interests. The solution, which was initially adopted on 5 November in the trilogue, is nothing more than the creation of an ideological baton that the Commission wants in the future to put in place right-wing governments that are disliked in Brussels, and some negotiators have made no secret of the fact that this was their aim.  Going into a confrontation with the Council threatens to block both the multiannual budget and the recovery plan, which, in the context of the deep recession of the economies of all EU countries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that negotiators have put the political interests of some EU countries above the economic and social interests of 450 million EU citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 88, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "César LUENA", "mepid": "197721", "text": "  in writing. – The agreement reached this week with the Council for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-27, after months of negotiations, is a historic success: for the first time since the Multiannual Financial Framework exists, the European Parliament has managed to increase the amount of money initially agreed by the Council.

In addition, the agreement reached establishes a roadmap for the introduction of new own resources for the European Union, which on the one hand will allow us to finance our programmes, and on the other hand have a fairer taxation, which requires us to pay taxes in Europe on large technology and large multinationals, for the most polluting companies, and those who make financial transactions only for speculation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 96, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Alfred SANT", "mepid": "124781", "text": "  bil-miktub. – The results obtained by the European Parliament negotiators seem impressive.

Compared with the European Council's july proposal, the package improved. In July, I criticised the fact that member states cut major EU programmes, recorded a loose position on the rule of law mechanism and left the debt payment open. Now, in the further negotiations, changes have been made to these points. The most significant improvement was the linking of funding to the rule of law. There was a strict limit to the record of conditionality. In addition to cases of misappropriation of EU funds, the mechanism also applies more broadly in the face of the union's fundamental values being jeopardised. The risk of breaches of the rule of law is sufficient to apply the law. This is an important step in safeguarding the EU's fundamental values. If this had not been successful now, the next opportunity to turn off the money taps on member states that trampled on fundamental values would have had to wait a long time. Another important improvement was the additional FUNDING of EUR 16 billion for flagship EU-added programmes such asEU4Health, Erasmus+, Creative Europe and Horizon Europe. However, as far as the horizon is concerned, we still cannot be satisfied with the outcome. Funding will remain at just under EUR 85 billion, which will rise slightly from last season. A transition to a climate-resilient and digital economy would require much greater research efforts. Europe's low level of INVESTMENT in THE CZECH Union is a big disappointment, which the Member States now also have to correct through the e-plate package. When debt is received for recovery funding against the EU budget, it is also up to us to agree on the repayment of the debt. I therefore welcome the fact that new own resources, such as the plastic waste levy, can contribute to the costs of the recovery package. Next, I hope that Parliament and the Council will swiftly adopt the package.

I’m glad to see that you give this event all the importance it has and have a look at the future of our partnership with the US – it’s an important thing, a priority of our future engagement and our future foreign policy.  Unfortunately, we will not have a lot of time today to discuss this, but I’m sure that we will have other opportunities to come back to this issue soon and to examine our transatlantic relationship in depth.  Indeed, last week the whole world was following, with a lot of attention and suspense, the elections in the US. And I want to congratulate the American people for the largest participation in US electoral history, which shows clearly that the American citizens were very much aware of the importance of these elections. Americans demonstrated the importance and capacity of democratic institutions and civic engagement and I want to congratulate warmly President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for their historic victory.  We are now looking at the opportunities to advance our strategic partnership. This morning at the college, the Commission took a first look at this opportunity and how we are going to manage this new era of our relationship with the US. All the Commissioners participated in this debate and I am happy that the Parliament also wants to advance a first approach to this issue.  I don’t have to explain that we have had a very significant bilateral relationship globally. We have a common history, shared values and we adhere to democratic principles. This partnership reflects how cross all economic fields underpinned by broad cooperation.  It’s not a secret either that in the past four years things have become complicated in our relations. I am looking forward to getting back to a frank dialogue. Well, the dialogue has always been frank and wherever possible we have formulated joint strategies and put in the necessary resources to make them possible.  First of all, I think that we have to welcome the clear commitment of President-elect Biden to restore unity and respect for democratic norms and institutions and work with allies based on true partnership. We are a partner and a capable and strategic approach to the European Union-United States relationship has to build on this idea of partnership.  For this reason, we have to proceed with our work to enhance what we call Europe’s strategic autonomy, a word that will be very much in use, I hope, in the near future, because this means our ability to act and to defend ourselves effectively and at the same time work together with the US in many frameworks, including defence frameworks and others.  Let me take a quick look at the wider spectrum of global challenges that will be at the heart of our transatlantic agenda. I think that there are some priorities that they want to highlight: to re-energise cooperation for multilateral fora, in particular the United Nations; we are continuing to work towards promoting respect for human rights; to address the difficulties of the World Trade Organization, especially the dispute settlement mechanism; to cooperate in fighting COVID-19, including strengthening the workings of the World Health Organization and the capacity of the global health systems, starting with preparedness and response to emergencies; to accelerate ambitious global climate action and to invest in harnessing that in a logical transformation; to look at China and Iran and our neighbourhood, and we will try to reach a common approach with the US. We already started with the previous administration over the last few weeks but for sure it should now be easier. We also need to become a stronger global player for a stronger transatlantic partnership that benefits NATO. It’s a busy agenda and our capacity for developing digital strategy partnerships will be more effective if both partners are strong and committed, and of course here in Europe we speak with one voice when we engage with the new President, the new administration and the new Congress.  We need to invest at all levels and talk to our American friends across the aisle. For sure the Parliament will also have an important role to play through the transatlantic legislators’ dialogue and other contexts.  From our end we will also step up people-to-people programmes – a priority that was supported by this Parliament as well and one I hope will continue. All in all, the European Union and the United States are, and will remain, key strategic partners of first resort in critically difficult moments, such as the one that we are currently experiencing. A strong transatlantic partnership is of key importance and you can rest assured that we are ready to engage quickly with the new administration, although for that we still have to wait until 20 January, because as you very well know there is quite a long transition ahead. Let’s hope it’s not going to be a bumpy transition.

We Europeans are therefore pleased with the President-elect's announcement that he will rejoin the Paris climate agreement. We also welcome the intended return to the World Health Organisation. Together, we must make the WTO fully operational again. China's behaviour in the WTO is one of the reasons for today's problems. We are therefore not equidistant between the United States and China. Together with the United States, we want to achieve a well-coordinated approach to this systemic rival. We know that the new administration is still cautious about free trade. However, I am convinced that the West can only successfully meet the Chinese challenge in the long term if the EU, the US and other allies such as Canada and Japan jointly organise free trade and set global standards.  I would like to thank the United States for also taking care of vulnerable partners such as Taiwan in terms of security policy. We should supplement this with our own contribution, for example through a bilateral investment agreement with this important trading partner. We support the important American ideas to rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement. Nobody in the world wants an Iranian bomb. Therefore, all the parties must be behind it, and Iran must comply with the agreement again. Then we can also talk about what else is complaining to us about the country, but that is a separate matter.  For Europe's security, the US remains an indispensable nation. However, we will only keep them anchored in Europe if we make burden-sharing fair. I want to make it clear to our European doubters that the 2% target for defence spending has not been imposed on us by Mr Trump, it was a decision taken by the NATO summit in Wales in 2014 in the face of Russian aggression against Ukraine.  I know that there are also political currents here that do not want to advocate strong defence or even compliment the Americans out of Europe. \"Be careful what you wish for\" is a beautiful English saying that I would like to give you here.  It is important for us Europeans that arms control and disarmament agreements are guaranteed. We know that the new START agreement will soon expire, I hope that the United States will agree to the one-year extension there, and that time must then be used for negotiations. There are other agreements that we would like to see, as Europeans in particular. For this, a predictable US administration is a better partner, including for Russia. Finally, we are pleased that Joe Biden is a friend of Europe, but also of Ireland in particular, and has made it clear to him how important it is to him to preserve the Good Friday Agreement. We trust that the US, under his leadership, will not support an agreement that threatens peace and well-being on the island of Ireland. So far on this subject.

This is a coincidence, but Rule 156 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure says: 'In each sitting, a attendance list is interpreted for signature by Members'.

These were the words spoken by the new Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in her victory speech. To every little girl watching she said: ‘dream with ambition and lead with conviction’. Joe Biden and his Vice President spoke about the people rather than about themselves, about their plans rather than their egos, and they spoke to inspire, not to divide. The past four years have been tough for our American friends, tough for transatlantic relations and tough for the multilateral global order. Five years ago, we watched in horror as this chapter in American history began on the golden elevator in Trump Tower. On Saturday, we saw it coming crashing down in the parking lot of Four Seasons Total Landscaping. While this year will go down in history as the year of a global pandemic, economic decline and authoritarian power grabs, the US election result is a clear symbol of hope for all of us. Our American friends have demonstrated that yes, democrats can defeat autocrats, yes, facts can defeat disinformation, and hope can defeat fear. The long nightmare is over. Well, almost over. It is, of course, worrisome to see that McConnell and other prominent Republicans are doing everything in their power to cast doubt on the fairness of this election, and I believe it’s time to face reality. Some of Trump’s friends in Europe also had to swallow: they hoped for four more years of support for their repressive illiberalism, and they are left empty handed. Mr Trump has been fired by a majority of the American voters, but he hasn’t conceded. The next 70 days will certainly be bumpy, but they won’t change the facts. I’m hopeful that in the end the democratic institutions will halt the power grab of President Trump. On behalf of the entire S&amp;D Group, let me congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris on winning the most important US elections of our generation. We are happy and relieved, while we also know that Trumpism is not gone. We know that things have changed in the last four years, and that the EU also needs to take up its own responsibility as a global player. However, it’s good to have an ally in the White House again. And it’s a joy for millions of girls around the world, especially girls of colour, who in Kamala Harris have the brightest demonstration that there’s nothing they cannot achieve. Mr President, let’s make it very clear that we are stronger if we work together, that the damage done is reversible.

To date, the results of the AMERICAN elections would indicate as the new President Joe Biden, to whom, if the data are made official, we wish him well in his work. The new American administration, of whatever political colour it may be, democratic or republican, will always find in us in the League a serious and reliable ally, firmly aligned with the Atlantic alliance in defence of the values and interests of the free West. Our pro-Atlantic position, which is even super-Atlantic on some particularly sensitive issues, such as 5G and the defence of human rights, has never been called into question. The same cannot be said, in Italy and In Europe, of so many parties or political subjects who say they are democratic, such as the PD and the 5 Stars, but who in reality defend the positions of communist dictatorships, such as China and Venezuela, or criminal regimes such as Iran. We do not accept lessons from false Democrats, Italian and European, who in recent years have waged an absurd war against the Trump administration and therefore against the United States. We all know our sympathy and appreciation for Trump and his administration. The trump administration's successes in economic and foreign policy are in everyone's eyes, and only the blind persist in not seeing them. Trump was the first leader to put the great danger posed by Communist China in the spotlight of world public opinion. To paraphrase a great American President like Ronald Reagan, Trump has the great merit of making the West understand that communist China is the empire of evil of the third millennium, potentially much stronger and more dangerous than Soviet communism, because it is a danger that affects the daily life of each of us. But Trump's foreign policy is not just China: think of the iron fist against Maduro's dictatorship in Venezuela; think of the fight against Islamic terrorism, with the destruction of Isis and the targeted killing of Soleimani, the military leader of a rogue country like Iran who would like to destroy Israel with the nuclear bomb. Or think about Trump's decisive role in the historic peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. And let us always remember that President Trump did not start any new war during his term of office, unlike his predecessor, who has combined many wars and damage around the world. We need only think of the chaos created in the Mediterranean area with the Arab Spring and the unholy war in Libya, which has had very serious consequences that Italy and Europe are still paying for, especially those linked to the emergence of illegal immigration. I mean, Democrat Obama should take away the Nobel Peace Prize and give it to Trump. Now the question everyone is asking is what Biden will do in foreign policy: Will he follow Trump's bold and successful path, or will he go back down Obama's chaotic, warmongering path? What will Biden do about the hottest dossiers, China and 5G, the Middle East and Iran? Will he have the strength and foresight of Trump to continue the tug-of-war with China? Will it have the strength to combat the beijing regime's strategy of penetration and infiltration into our society, our economy and even our institutions? We hope that Biden will continue the right battle against china's Communist dictatorship, which is the greatest threat to our freedom and democracy. And we hope that Europe will finally also abandon the double games, the ambiguities, the blood-stained business done with Beijing.  We are at a crossroads in history: on the one hand, the free world of Western democracies, on the other the world of dictatorship, tyranny and repression. \"Do not be afraid\", said Pope John Paul II.

Trump is out, even if he himself doesn’t yet want to believe it. I’m sure he will see soon. Joe Biden and his promise of politics based on respect for each other, for facts, and for science has won. Kamala Harris, Vice President-elect, achieved something truly historic. A first woman, a woman of colour: Harris smashed many glass ceilings, and while a lot remains to be done on gender equality, this breakthrough will have a long-lasting impact.  But, while Trump is voted out of the White House, Trumpism – or whatever you want to call this disastrous mix of nationalism, racism, and narcissism – got a lot of support. And it also has a lot of support in Europe and even among some EU governments, as we have seen. Democracy, equality and rule of law are not a given on either side of the Atlantic. It is something we have to strive for every day and never take for granted. Movements like Black Lives Matter, like Me Too, and journalists, democracy activists and many more fought back and defended democracy in the US for the past four years. They are the ones that should be celebrated in these elections.  Transatlantic relations have taken a hard hit over the past four years, and while we all hope and we can be sure that they will become better now, the lesson learned for Europe is that it needs to stand more on its own two feet. In order to be able to do that, we need to also stand stronger together and more firmly. For that, we need to have a common understanding of fundamental values because if we don’t know on what grounds we stand as a Union then we cannot grow. And equally, we cannot shy away from the responsibilities of our actions in the external world. That goes for the climate crisis, for weapons exports, for conflict parties or for shady energy projects with even more shady partners such as Nord Stream. If we want Europe to be taken seriously by the world, we have to take ourselves seriously first, and that means taking responsibility for our actions and their impact in the world, no matter who rules the White House.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Democracy has triumphed. Short, but after four years of Trumpian contempt for democracy, after attacks on the press and minorities, after open cooperation with the far right, and even racist armed militias, voters in the United States have said: Stop getting out of the White House with this autocrat.  Because this election in the United States was not a normal choice between two candidates from different parties. It was the choice between democracy on the one hand and authoritarianism on the other. And after four years of Trumpism, voters have opted for democracy and against authoritarianism. And this result, ladies and gentlemen, came about through an alliance of left ists to liberal forces. And it will hurt demagogues, autocrats, and dictators and their friends all over the world, and also in the European Union, and strengthen all the forces that stand up to such guys as Trump.  It is against this background that I have also spoken and spoken in the run-up to the elections, and I have also asked your boss, Mr Borrell – unfortunately you are no longer here – to do so. For a clear statement from the European Union – not for either of the two candidates, but for respect for democratic values and basic standards – would have been a sign of foreign policy strength. Their silence was not. Because when democracy is under threat, democrats must not remain silent.  Donald Trump still can't concede defeat and defiantly barricades himself like a little kid in the White House. It must recognise the outcome of the election and guarantee a peaceful transfer of power. The fact that the result is nevertheless so close should give us all something to think about. We must address the causes of the emergence of such anti-democratic politicians, that is, to overcome the social divisions in our societies and resolve the issues of the future, such as digitalisation and climate protection, socially justly.  I want to congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on their convincing win. This victory also belongs to the young people and the marginalized communities who have fought so hard. But the dangers of Trumpism remain. The narrative that demands like Medicare for All, or movements like Black Lives Matter, pose a threat to progressive electoral victories is completely wrong. The evidence shows the opposite is true: it would be a fatal mistake now to sideline the new generation of leftist leaders who contributed to this victory.

Yet something has changed, and it is no coincidence that the whole world has held its breath and spent sleepless nights in the exhausting expectation of a verdict, which has never been expected as in this case. A new and delicate phase is opening up: for the United States, which in these elections has been painted as a country still divided and in search of a new normal, and for the whole world, which in recent years has undoubtedly suffered the lack of a clear direction expressed by Washington, of a reference on which we had perhaps, blessly , all too well set in past decades. Let me make it quite clear: I expect a great deal from this American Presidency. I expect the fight against climate change and the rise of inequalities, the biggest systemic crises of this generation, to be back on the US and global agendas. I expect an end to a senseless and perpetual trade war that we have seen in recent years; coordination and not confrontation. I still expect the EU to find its American partner in global governance and for the US to regain its place in the international multilateral system, reconsidering some critical decisions taken by the Trump administration, such as participation in the Iran nuclear deal. I expect that once again the indissoluble transatlantic link, a link based on our common values, on the staunch defence of democracy, the rule of law and freedom, which has never been discussed but which has certainly been put to the test, indeed extremely tested, in recent years, will be reconfirmed, and that this will also be done in the light of the renewed process of integration and the search for strategic autonomy of the EU.

My thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends. My thoughts are with the French and Austrian people and I know yours are as well. Let’s be clear: these were attacks on our European values, on fundamental rights and freedoms. Samuel Paty taught history, geography and civics. His brutal murder was a direct attack on our values, rights and freedoms – the freedom of expression and information, the right to education, the freedom of thought, conscience and religion. We need to unite and show strong solidarity as a Union. No Member State can or should face this threat alone. We need to unite as a society. We need to show that our values are unbreakable and that we cannot be divided on this, and we need to do more to protect our citizens, our societies and our values. The Vienna attack shows the need to stop illegal firearms. Member States must urgently implement the Firearms Directive. Before the summer, we launched an action plan against firearms trafficking. We are working closely with Western Balkans partners to fight the smuggling of illegal guns. And we need to register all known foreign terrorist fighters in the Schengen Information System so that we can detect them when they try to cross EU borders. The Vienna attacker tried to buy ammunition in Slovakia. There were contacts in Germany and Switzerland. We need to better share information and to share better information across borders. The Schengen Information System is central here, but so are PNR – passenger name records. They are essential to deter and detect terrorist suspects. Member States should implement the PNR Directive. I am planning to update the Prüm Decision to make it easier for law enforcement to exchange DNA, fingerprints and number plates, and, in future, possibly also photos and police records. I want us, together in the European Union, to move away from ad hoc police cooperation towards systematic police partnership. The Commission has started work on an EU police cooperation code. Better information-sharing also means making sure that IT systems can talk to each other. Member States need to work hard to achieve full interoperability by 2023. Europol is the backbone of European police cooperation and Europol is providing concrete and invaluable support to the French and Austrian authorities as we speak. Already this year, I will propose a reinforced mandate for Europol so it can do an even better job at fighting crime and terror. The recent attackers struck in a church in Nice and in the streets and cafés of Vienna. The Commission is supporting Member States to increase the protection of public spaces. Small actions can make a difference, sometimes between life and death. Last year, a far-right terrorist attacked a synagogue in Halle in Germany. A reinforced door and the security cameras helped to save thousands of lives. The Commission made EUR 12 million available to improve security in places of worship. I’m looking into possibilities to increase this amount. Samuel Paty’s murderer used the internet to identify his horrible crime and afterwards posted pictures of his victim online. The Vienna attacker posted a picture with an AK-47. In one month, in July this year, Europol’s Internet Referral Unit took down 2 000 links to terrorist content, including tutorials on how to carry out an attack. Europol will continue to work with platforms who want to help, but voluntary cooperation is not enough. Member States need to be able to order the removal of terrorist content from any hosting service provider, irrespective of its place of establishment, with EU-wide effects in one hour. I call on this House, this Parliament, for an agreement on the proposed regulation to prevent the dissemination of terrorist content online as soon as possible. Besides police intervention, the European Union also invests in the prevention of radicalisation. Prevention is better than cure. It’s difficult to measure terrorist attacks that are prevented, but our police forces, with the help of Europol, work hard every day to do justice. The Radicalisation Awareness Network connects teachers, social workers and community police officers. When they successfully lead someone away from violence, there are seldom big headlines, but the results are spectacular. There are former neo-Nazis, former violent Islamists who now reject violence and help others to do the same. Without the Radicalisation Awareness Network and their job, these people would perhaps still be a danger to society. In a few weeks, on 9 December, I will present our new counter-terrorism agenda. The objective will be to identify and close security gaps in law enforcement cooperation, in the use of technology and information-sharing, to prevent radicalisation, to protect public spaces and to work with Member States, regions, cities and towns and also with key third-country partners. But we also need to look beyond counter-terrorism. Terrorists seek to divide us: to draw a line between ‘them and us’. We can only counter this by offering an inclusive, cohesive society in which everyone has a stake, where there is no ‘them and us’. Later this month I will launch an action plan on integration and inclusion, based on opportunities and obligations. Everyone who has a legal right to be in Europe should have the opportunity to take part in society, a society where everyone is protected by European values and fundamental rights, and where everyone must respect those same values and rights, that includes the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression. Fundamental rights, the EU will defend – that includes also the freedom of religion, but we will never accept violence in the name of religion. Education, culture and sport also have a key role to play in this. Mr President, today is Armistice Day. Europe commemorates the end of the First World War 102 years ago: a war that started with a violent attack – the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. New attacks have such cataclysmic consequences. But this is what we mean by ‘terrorist offence’: international acts which, given their nature or context, may seriously damage a country or an international organisation. This reminds us that our struggle is not a new one. When I grew up, there was the RAF, the Red Brigades, the IRA, ETA. The terrorists change, their causes change and their methods change. What doesn’t change is the fear, the death and the suffering that they bring. What we must do is to be united as a Union and as a society and to do everything we can to oppose them, to fight them, to defeat them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. The terrorist attacks in Paris, Nice and Vienna are shaking Europe. And attacks are attacks on the whole of Europe, on our values, on our ideas, on our democracy, on our way of life.  The focus is first on the victims. We also mourn with the relatives. In Paris, a 47-year-old teacher with a son, in Nice, killed three people, including a 44-year-old nurse who simply left work. In Vienna, four dead, a 44-year-old woman on her way home from work, a 39-year-old owner of a Chinese restaurant and a 22-year-old art student from Germany. People were murdered indiscriminately. Much suffering from the relatives, and these thoughts are first in our hearts.  I would also like to thank the authorities, the police, the emergency services, the emergency services, the medics who helped. They, too, have done an excellent job, and they deserve our thanks. Grief alone is not enough. In the last twenty-two months, 119 terrorist attacks have taken place in Europe. Almost every country in Europe, almost every city in Europe, already has victims and knows the threat, knows the fear and knows the grief.  It must now be said that enough is enough. We do not allow ourselves to be forced to their knees by the perpetrators of violence. Combating radical Islamism and Islamists is the task we must tackle now. They are fighting our way, and that is why we must now take the most out-of-the-way action against these Islamist perpetrators.  Terrorists do not kill alone. They are following propaganda. They are recruited and supported by structures in the background. All these radical Islamists are fighting our democracy and are enemies of our freedom – including religious freedom. That is why we must now dismantle the networks and structures.  What concrete action should be done? The first important point is that there are many people who, unfortunately, grow out of our societies and become radical. That is why we have to ask ourselves the question: what will go wrong if people who have enjoyed education with us, who grew up with us, become radicals and individual perpetrators?  We need to convey more ambition and invest in our values of tolerance and freedom. And we must ensure that recruitment on the web, on social networks, can no longer be done so effectively. That is why the EU-Commission's directive on the eradication of online content, which calls for terror and glorifies terror, is so extremely important. I would now ask the colleagues of Renew and the Social Democrats to put an end to their blockade of this legislation. We have already lost too much time. Legislation has been on the table for years and, unfortunately, is not making progress. It is now time to complete this legislation.  The second is that we need the full implementation of the Arms Directive, as the Commissioner has said. I also call on the Commissioner to put pressure on fellow ministers of the Interior to ensure that the existing laws on regulating and preventing access to arms are uniformly implemented on this continent.  Another major issue for us as the PPE-DE is a key threat file. Unfortunately, the Schengen Information System is based only on voluntary action. We need it to be mandatory. All the dangers that we have on this continent, which are monitored by the national authorities, must be entered in the common databases in a compulsory and binding manner, so that all police forces have the same level of information.  Terrorism is cross-border, and Europe must also respond to it across borders. That is why we are also in favour of extending Europol's powers so that it not only acts as a consultant, not only supportive, but also builds up independent investigative capacities in the fight against Islamist terrorist cells. We also want to strengthen Europol in this context.  Last but not least, the border protection, which has now been discussed at the mini-summit in Paris. Yes, border management needs to be improved. Yes, Schengen needs to be revised. There must be no entry without a passport, as is already the legal situation in Europe today. And we need a binding, mandatory networking of files, so that it is possible to check at the external border whether there is data against certain dangerous persons. And the biggest problem is enforcement, which must be tackled accordingly.  Mr President, Commissioner, there is much to be done. We must now tackle this together. The question of terrorism is back on the political agenda, and the most important thing we have to say is that we must not allow the radical forces to split between them in the fight against terror. religions. Religions enjoy freedom on this continent. This is not a battle between religions. It is a fight against terror that we are waging.

The recent terrorist attacks in France and Austria fill us with sadness, but they will not bend us. On the contrary, we will pursue fans without giving up our principles. I would like to reiterate my condolences to the victims and their families, all our solidarity.  We cannot give up freedom of expression and freedom of education. Europe would not exist without them and are fundamental principles of our Union. Also in cases where I do not agree with the content, I always support freedom, because it is the basis of a democratic and pluralistic society. We must educate on freedom of conscience and critical thinking. That is why I would also like to pay tribute to Professor Samuel Paty. His legacy will not be forgotten. But we must also not allow the violent to divide us, because that's what they want. We must distinguish between Islam as a religion and radical Islamism as a political ideology that does not accept freedom and pluralism. Let us respond to the terrorist threat from unity in diversity. And we must do so with the instruments of the rule of law. Every time barbarism strikes us, we repeat the same thing: the need to strengthen the exchange of information between Member States. What does the Council expect to create a true European intelligence agency? We must also ensure that terrorist groups do not take advantage of any legal rifts to fund their death campaign. And, at the same time, we must invest in social inclusion, to give a future to young people who, perhaps disillusioned and marginalized, are dragged away by fanatics. That's why it's critical to tackle terrorist content circulating on social media. These have become a powerful tool for radicalization and recruitment. We will continue to legislate to end misinformation and hate speech. In this regard, Parliament will adopt new rules for online platforms to remove any content that promotes terrorism. I heard Mr Weber today in his speech and some Members of the European People's Group these days. Make no mistake, gentlemen of the European People's Party. Do not intend to place guilt and responsibility on those of us who are working on this issue with the same commitment as you. We need to find a balance that guarantees security but also freedom of expression. We don't want to give up any of them. I would also like to refer to the Schengen debate. Some voices deflight the focus and propose border controls in the Schengen area, linking migration and terrorism. But, as Europol reminds us, there is no conclusive data to link the two phenomena.

Emotion in the face of the pain of the innocent must become the engine for our action as politicians, because we are co-responsible for the response against atrocity.  On behalf of my group, I stress zero tolerance against intolerants, and that means using the force of the law, of the whole law, but nothing outside the law; means assessing changes in the threat so as not to leave any blind spots that the killers can escape through.  Terrorists are great moral manipulators: they are identified as victims—they, the murderers—and they want to impose their obsessions on us. And no, we are not responsible for their heinous acts, but they can poison many; and, therefore, we need to innovate in the prevention of violent radicalization, especially at local levels; and that is why the work of the school and public opinion against the frameworks of intolerance and in favor of freedom of expression is as important as Samuel Paty knew.  The European Parliament has been very useful in the previous mandate after the Paris attacks, following the attacks in Brussels, Germany, Manchester, Barcelona, Stockholm, Liege, and it must also be so now, after the bombings in Hanau, Paris, Nice, Vienna. Society and victims need answers, recognition and solutions.  In the previous term, Commissioner King or Gilles de Kerchove were really important and so was this Parliament, and now it has to be important again. Great consensus was generated to improve coordination between countries against the financing, against impunity, for the rights of victims; we strengthen Europol.  We intend to develop recommendations from the Special Commission on Terrorism. Terrorism can only succeed in places where institutions are degraded, with incapable rulers, with politicians who discuss what they do not have to discuss, with poorly guided public servants, in broken societies. This is not our case, but it is also true that terrorism is not defeated without effort and commitment.  And we are effectively negotiating with the Council the Regulation on the removal of terrorist content online. It must be effective, it must have the safeguards of rights and freedoms. And we know that those who have the most power have greater responsibility and, therefore, I hope that it will be possible to reach consensus very soon. Of course, my group will not stop fighting without fainting until we get it.  Commissioner, those who are radicalizing must know - and the whole of Europe must know - that we are not going to leave any room or resquicious for their anti-democratic strategy, and our work, when well founded, deactivates them, discourages them.  The novelist Amos Oz once wrote that the essence of fanaticism lies in the desire to force others to change: terrorists have pretended it from cruelty. The Renew Group wants to make it clear that we have reason and reasons to defend freedoms and coexistence.

What was attacked in Nice and Madrid, Amsterdam, London, Milan, Stockholm, Toulouse, Brussels, Copenhagen, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg? Just a few hours ago, the Consul General of France was again targeted in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, while presiding over a ceremony on 11 November. Almost all of our countries are affected and all are threatened. Too many to mention, no victims should be forgotten: 450 people have been killed by Islamist terrorism in Europe, from the vile attack in Madrid in 2004 to the one 10 days ago in Austria. What is under attack is our civilization. You wanted to build the European Union and its treaties by forgetting our Christian roots. You wanted to build a super-state on abstract universal values. You wanted to deny our common past to make a supermarket without identity.  But today, it is our deep being that is being targeted. The Islamists come to remind us. It is not secularism, not colonialism, not even our freedom of expression that they vomit: it is above all what we are. They attack us for who we are, not for what we do. We will not be able to fight this battle if we refuse to designate the enemy. We cannot win it if we refuse to assert and defend our identity. Today, in the Chamber, to deal with this fundamental subject, you are planning only a short debate and a single round of speakers. The title itself carefully avoids the term \"Islamism.\" As our civilization is under attack and besieged, what do you propose to us? Emmanuel Macron, the French president, claims to fight Islamism by strengthening communitarianism, by generalizing the learning of Arabic in schools and taking over the training of imams by the state - a ludicrous idea that Charles Michel, for that matter, immediately took up. So we would have imams trained by the European Union? Will it soon be necessary to have a European Commissioner for Islam? Recently, Mr. Borrel, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said it was up to the refugees to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to return to Syria. And as recently as yesterday, Mrs Johansson, you said, in a mixture of naivety and total irresponsibility, that, I quote, 'migration is not a danger'. Wouldn't migration be a danger, Mrs Johansson? The last three attacks in France were carried out by migrants. He's a Pakistani who attacked journalists in Paris. He's a Chechen who slit the throat of a teacher in Conflans. A Tunisian man who arrived via Lampedusa murdered three people in a church in Nice. Taking advantage of your procrastination and cowardice, Erdogan is also moving forward. Because the European Union does not dare to act, it is waged war on Armenia and Libya, deploying jihadists from the ranks of Daesh. It threatens our continent with migratory submersion. He converted St. Sophia's Basilica into a mosque. Turkey, and with it the Islamists of the world, are part of the longest memory, unlike you. You want to train imams, we want to expel hate preachers. You want Frontex to secure the crossing of migrants, we want Frontex to take them home. You are watering subsidies and customs facilities from Islamist countries like Pakistan or Turkey, we want to punish them. You regard free movement as an untouchable dogma, we consider that the security of Europeans is an inalienable right. You are funding Islamist organizations, we want to dissolve them. Yes, I weigh my words, you finance Islamist organizations. Here in this Parliament, Islamist organizations, such as The Femyso, have been able to participate in official events. When you don't give them a voice, you give them money: 51,000 euros for the CCIF, 584,000 euros for the Islamic Human Rights Watch, which called Charlie Hebdo Islamophobic, 5.6 million euros for the networks of the Muslim Brotherhood. In total, over the last five years, the European Union has paid EUR 36.5 million directly to Islamists or the projects they were associated with - I have sent a written question to the Commission on this subject so that this can finally stop, and I am still waiting for the answer. You want to turn illegal immigration into legal immigration, we want to put an end to illegal migration, family reunification and settlement immigration, because mass immigration is obviously the breeding ground for Islamism. We must stop the arrivals and consider that the welcome and generosity of our countries are not definitive. The installation of foreigners on our soil should not be considered irreversible. If we show weakness, then they will dominate us. If we show cowardice, they will submit us. If we are able, on the contrary, to proudly affirm who we are, we will resist. If we are able to fight forcefully for our values of civilization, we will prevail. Aeschylus already said of the Greeks and, through them, of all Europeans, that they \"believe that they are not slaves or subjects of anyone\". The time for compromises, of which you are unfortunately often customary, must stop. We must not give in to the injunctions of the Islamists. We will not submit, and all those who want to impose it on us, all those who prefer Sharia law to our laws and our way of life, all those who want to weaken our civilization and replace it with theirs will have to leave. Our freedom is at that price.

Mr President, the brutal murder of Samuel Paty, Nice, Vienna, Kabul: all these innocent victims have in common the desire for freedom. Voltaire said, \"I don't agree with what you're saying, but I will fight for you to have the right to say it.\" But how?  The fight against terrorism is part of the long time, in analysis, in understanding and in action.  The fight against terrorism is above all to promote freedom of expression and education, it is to come out of a binary vision of good and evil, a world that confronts each other, it is to promote fraternity, tolerance. To preserve our rights, duties and values is to transmit them, to educate, to dialogue, to exchange, to cultivate.  The fight against terrorism means promoting an inclusive, egalitarian society on a daily basis, in which no discrimination has a place because terrorism feeds on hatred and divisions of those who suffer the exclusion, oppression, disrespect, and distance of sources of information and education. The fight against schooling, illiteracy, misinformation, for literacy, are constant struggles to be fought among our young people, rich in their diversity. The fight against terrorism is also a fight against ourselves, against our prejudices, our oppressions, against individual and systemic racism. The true doctrine of a fight against terrorism is a doctrine in favour of the citizen of the world, with its culture or its cultures, its history or its his stories, without prioritization, without domination. And these times of crisis are all too often reclaimed by short-termist populist discourses that divide and fuel terrorism, far more than they advance the fight against barbarism. The rights and freedoms that the state must protect risk being restricted by actions that are supposed to defend them. In a security environment, some discriminatory actions gradually become acceptable in response to attacks. Finally, if we renounce respect for human rights, equality and the protection of the rule of law in order to fight terrorism, we risk playing into the game of those who attack us under these values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Nicola PROCACCINI", "mepid": "197820", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must point out that it is a serious mistake that the adjective 'Islamic' is not being used as the title of this debate, as mrs Johansson has just said. The fear of associating religious motivation with the terrorist attacks that have bloodied Europe in recent days, as in the last twenty years, prevents us from preventing them, as well as combating them. The fear of naming Islam is the most striking demonstration of the effectiveness of the terrorist fight, which not only wants to reap victims among the infidels but above all wants to change the way we think, live and express ourselves. The fear of naming Islam prevents us from bringing out a thought of secularisation among Islamists, of giving courage to those Muslims who want to live in peace in Europe, legitimately professing their religion. The fear of giving things their name leads us to hide the cultural roots of our rights of freedom, which are religious: they are Christian roots, do not pretend not to know! Where do you think we have learned to give Caesar what is Caesar's and God what is God's? Who told us to give the other cheek if I offended? Who taught us to respect women, considering them like men, and who commanded us to defend the oppressed? The fear of making the right choices, even in the fight against illegal immigration, not only discovers the side of our cities and schools to terrorist violence, but at the same time prevents us from identifying upstream those who need humanitarian protection, those who really want to share our system of values, possibly without being forced to put themselves in the hands of the smugglers or risking losing their lives at sea , as has happened again today. We have to govern departures so we don't have to handle arrivals. We don't know how to tell you anymore!

Mr President, in Conflans, in Nice, in Vienna, three times in less than a month, terrorism has struck us in our flesh. On behalf of our group on the European left, I first of all want to join in the messages of emotion and solidarity for the victims of these heinous murders and for their loved ones. While our societies are weakened by the health crisis, the climate catastrophe and the explosion of poverty, this series of abject attacks has a clear political objective: to weaken us by dividing us. And today I issue the warning with seriousness: let us not let them win. The European public debate, by repeating the increasingly hateful rhetoric of the far right, takes a disturbing turn by venturing into the dangerous slope of assumed authoritarianism and uninhibited racism. In France, a witch-hunt was initiated by the government, which sometimes accused opposition parties, university professors, of complicity with terrorists, which implied the existence of a link between the halal shelves of supermarkets and the rise of religious extremism. Politicians across Europe are calling for the creation of new emergency laws to free the fight against terrorism from the most basic rules of law, as if taking back the enemy's methods would protect us from doing so. This is a fundamental fault. On the contrary, in the face of terrorists, the rule of law is not a weakness, it is our most powerful shield. Any questioning of our fundamental freedoms is a defeat in the face of their ambition to bring down our democracies. Any stigmatization of Muslims as scapegoats is a gift for those seeking to revive the wars of religion. These drifts are as dangerous as they are ineffective.  On the contrary, the terrorist threat must be approached firmly and seriously, around an absolute imperative: the maintenance of our cohesion. Of course, we must actively fight against jihadist networks, by providing sufficient resources to our justice and intelligence services, by attacking tax havens and banks that launder the dirty money of terrorists, by profoundly changing our commercial and military alliances with the states that subsidize them. But we must also tackle the breeding ground that allows jihadists to recruit and fundamentalism to thrive. Discrimination, racism, ghettoization, the disappearance of local public services, precariousness, are allies of terrorists. Our duty is to actively combat the systematic relegation of part of our populations. Investment in the education system must finally be our compass. It is our teachers, like Samuel Paty, who teach young people freedom of conscience and expression, the right to caricature, respect for the opinion of others. It is at school that the citizens of tomorrow are formed. Our teachers are the best weapon against obscurantism.

It is not only security and public order that are under threat, but also individual rights, peace and social cohesion.

In this context, on issues such as surveillance, detection and removal of online content, if the impact of anti-terrorism legislation on fundamental rights is not assessed in a balanced way, there is a risk of giving certain authorities dangerous tools to combat arbitrariness and abuse, to the detriment of freedom of expression and access to information.

He pulled the police officer to safety, he took off his own shirt, he tied it around the officer’s leg to stop the bleeding. You know what? He risked his life despite suffering appalling racism. He was bullied at his job for having the same first name as Osama bin Laden. A mayor also tried to block his family from buying a house because they were Muslims.

Two beheading attacks carried out with blood-curdling cruelty in France and the Vienna shootings that claimed four innocent lives shocked Europe. These events are alarm bells that Europe must wake up and use radical means to counter the threat posed by illegal migration against the people of Europe and the European way of life. European left-wingers are still unable to admit that the wave of terror has something to do with immigration. Until they do, the threat of terrorism will continue to increase and we will witness more attacks. Anti-Semitism, racism and various forms of religious intolerance and discrimination not only threaten the security of individual persons, but can also contribute to creating a climate that is toxic to communities, which is favourable to the rise of terrorism and crime. Education plays a key role in addressing all these conflicts, biased views and prejudices.

Madam President, EUR 600 billion, the report we are going to vote on this week to say how climate and social chaos can be avoided, says that an additional 600 billion investments are needed every year.  Faced with governments that did not want to give up a euro, the team that negotiated for the European Parliament got 2 billion more. Thanks to Margarida and has the whole team. Well done, that's really good. But, in conscience, we all know that this budget is not up to scratch.  Mr European Commissioner for the Budget, dear Johannes, Madam Secretary of State, dear Bettina, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly convinced that, in the coming weeks, it is still possible to complete this budget - I mean to complete, not renegotiate it, to complete this budget in order to be up to the task, to give more resources to health, climate and employment.  If we were in a period of stability, if all went well, I would say congratulations, thank you, and I would stop my hunger strike. But we all know that we are facing three historic crises, three crises on a scale never seen before.  To deal with the health crisis, we need immediately more resources for hospitals, we need more resources for research, to find new vaccines, to prevent future pandemics. To deal with the social crisis 18 months ago, Ursula von der Leyen said: we are heading for a new economic crisis and to avoid a surge in unemployment, all Member States will have to be allowed to develop the Kurzarbeit. Ursula von der Leyen said: Europe must help every country protect jobs. The Kurzarbeit system is very simple: if a company is facing an economic shock, instead of laying off a third of employees, it lowers working time, wages are lowered, aid is maintained by 95% of income. Ursula von der Leyen said: we are heading for an economic shock, we must avoid a surge in unemployment, Europe must help the Member States. Why is there not a line or a billion for these employment protections today? To cope with the ecological crisis, some believe that, with the economic crisis, the evolution of CO2 has calmed down. Alas, that is not true. Wildfires in 2020 have reached an all-time high. Australia's wildfires: 440 dead - 440 dead in Australia in wildfires! Forest fires in Siberia, America, make 2020 the worst year for CO2 developments. Of course, CO2 is directly linked to slowed economic activity, but overall it's going to be one of the worst years, so we can't wait to act on climate.  We must act forcefully. Humanity no longer has time for the policies of small steps. Humanity wants us to stop the rubbish, it is time to propose a new deal for Europe. As we all know, my friends, Europe is at a crossroads. We are all aware that the mix of the social crisis, the climate crisis and the health crisis can lead us to collapse. It was said the other day in the Committee on Budgets, with the crisis of 1929, Europe has sunk into barbarism, and we all know that the current crisis is worse than the crisis of 29. And we are not, collectively, up to the task. But with the rule of unanimity, I think it was impossible to do better, our negotiating team did the maximum. The rule of unanimity is impossible to continue like this. With unanimity, it is the stupidest, the most selfish, the most blind to the dangers of the medium term, which can block any negotiation. No human group operates with unanimity - neither a football club, nor a choir, nor a company, nor a democratic parliament. Unanimity is paralysis.  That is why, in the report we are going to adopt this week on the financing of the Green Pact, we say that we must get out of unanimity and relaunch with closer cooperation, without delay, the negotiation on the financial transaction tax, with 10 or 15 countries. We cannot, in the name of unanimity, block means for health or climate. In this report, we call for the speeding up of this enhanced cooperation on a financial transaction tax that would bring in $57 billion, as is marked in the report. Parliament wants the real tax on financial transactions, not the very small one. Yes my friends, it's time to invent something new! If we want to avoid chaos in the next 10 or 15 years, it is time to propose a new deal for Europe. New deal: this is the name of my party in France, in reference to Roosevelt's New Deal. And when Mrs. von der Leyen talks about a Green New Deal, it's obviously a reference to Roosevelt's New Deal. But for Roosevelt, it wasn't just beautiful speeches.  Roosevelt has given himself the means to create millions of jobs, he has tripled the federal budget. He tripled the federal budget and wanted a balanced budget. That's why he creates a tax on millionaires, that he introduces a tax on corporate profits. The bankers are furious and say that Roosevelt is a communist who will kill America. But Roosevelt stands firm, he did not kill America. On the contrary, as Europe was moving towards barbarism, Roosevelt saved social cohesion and saved democracy, and the United States was able to help Europe afterwards. So, yes, when you have a real ambition, you have a real budget.  What is our ambition today, what are the means we give ourselves? I would like here, together with Bettina Hagedorn - you represent the Council of Heads of State and Government - I would like to address Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron.  Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron, by your statement of 18 May, you really had a catalysis effect, a catalytic effect. You have proposed a very courageous plan: 500 billion common debts for a stimulus package. Obviously, at the beginning, there were four countries that said no, no, never. But two months later, the momentum was so strong that everyone agreed to a plan of almost 400 billion investments. It was impossible, but you did, and Parliament thanks you for that. Similarly, if we want to find ways to get more money for hospitals, for climate, for research, for employment, it is still possible to find new resources. It is possible to launch very quickly - we have been talking about it for nine years, the directive has been on the table for nine years, it has been nine years since we did the impact study which shows that it is possible - it is possible to create a tax very quickly on financial transactions with the countries that want it. Show, Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron, that your commitment is serious.  Mrs Merkel, you absolutely want a climate agreement, an ambitious agreement on 10 and 11 December, and you are absolutely right. You have been interested in climate for 25 years - you were the one who hosted the first climate summit in Berlin 25 years ago. But the only way to get a real ambitious agreement on 10 and 11 December is to unlock funding, otherwise many countries will block the climate agreement, and that is dramatic. In the coming month, the European Parliament is proposing a lot of its own resources, but the only one that is technically ready, I repeat (1,200 pages of impact study), the only one that Parliament supports and which more and more countries support - Poland, Belgium were hostile five years ago and now agree - is the financial transaction tax. My friends, humanity no longer has time for small-step policies. Climate scientists tell us that 2020 is much worse than they thought. Climate change is collapsing and the social crisis can lead us to a democratic crisis. We do not know which countries will still be democratic in five or ten years if we continue like this. It is time to take strong initiatives. In May 1950, Adenauer and Schuman, to avoid war, took a historic initiative. Schuman says: \"World peace cannot be preserved without creative efforts, to the extent of the dangers that threaten it.\" This is why Germany and France are offering their neighbours a limited but decisive initiative. A limited but decisive initiative is to combine coal and steel. We had been at war for decades, and in just two weeks, in two weeks, Schuman and Adenauer decided to combine coal and steel. Adenauer said, \"It was the happiest day of my life, I saw the sky open before me.\" My friends, I think we have done a lot of work to negotiate the current budget and that it is urgent to supplement it, to have new resources for climate, health, employment. Mrs Merkel, you are a great European, it is time to take a limited but decisive initiative: Europe was born with coal and steel, it can be reborn with a climate, health and employment project financed by a tax on speculation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 143, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Olivier CHASTEL", "mepid": "197463", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at first glance, I would like to first of all, of course, welcome the political agreement reached in the multi-year financial framework and on the recovery plan, as well as the exceptional work of our negotiating team. The European Parliament has been able to move the Lines of the Council: this is a first, it is a real victory and we must congratulate ourselves on it.  By voting on our budget proposal for 2021, we are responding concretely to the concerns of European citizens who are facing an unprecedented long-term health and economic crisis every day, with the economy contracting by more than 7% this year. We cannot disappoint them with European programmes that have been planned when they have not yet recovered from the first wave of this crisis and are already facing the second. When Member States make decisions on major research health policies, the transfer of these powers must go hand in hand with adequate financial and human resources. That is why the European Parliament has been a tireless advocate for an ambitious budget for months. We are asking for a substantial additional budget for the 2021 budget to finance the European Union's flagship programmes: Erasmus, EU4health, Horizon Europe and InvestEU. We want to be able to make people understand that European solidarity is not limited to slogans, that European values are not empty words, that only real solidarity from 2021 will ensure the financing of structural reforms and the effectiveness of the Union's policies. Our budget, which is the first year of the multi-year fiscal framework, must be able to support a facility for a sustainable and resilient 4-year recovery. The Council has chosen an arithmetic approach to the amounts proposed by the Commission for 2021 for several programmes, based on the position of the European Council and without identifying any real political priorities. Cuts to the Union's flagship programmes, clearly forward-looking, such as climate and digital transition, health, research and youth and culture, are already undermining the very foundations of this recovery. In these particularly difficult times for entrepreneurship, youth, the hospital environment, or civil society, Europe proposes an exit from the crisis, bringing collective and solidarity projects. Only a common political will has enabled us to conclude an ambitious, fair and balanced political agreement on the next multi-year financial framework. The principle of just return is outdated. The conciliation that will open on 17 November is crucial and it is equally crucial to make full use of it: 21 days of conciliation in a constructive and open spirit so that, through frank and honest exchanges, we meet the legitimate expectations of European citizens from 2021. We must learn from this major crisis and build the foundations of European sovereignty in terms of health, digital, industrial and even security, in order to be able to deal with current and future challenges by freeing up European decisions that bring about sustainable investments and human cooperation at the service of all European citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, the 2021 budget is also the budget of our institution, the European Parliament, and indeed of the other institutions. It is clear that policies that will lead to the future cannot be built without operational, efficient, modern, environmentally friendly and interactive institutions that are therefore capable of functioning, even in the event of a force majeure.  That is why, together with my colleagues from the five main political groups, we have decided to restore the Council's cuts, at the request of the institutions, when they were justified, because here too, the Council has made proposals for horizontal and systematic cuts, without taking into account the specifics of the institutions. Adopting such an approach would have hindered their functioning and would have reduced the vital contribution they make to the proper functioning of the Union, in the same state of mind.  And on the basis of this same approach, we have restored the staffing table. Finally, with regard to the Commission's proposals for cuts, we considered in a limited number of cases that it was necessary to restore the estimates of these institutions. And I will conclude, Madam President, by pointing out that a euro spent in the European budget saves much more than one euro in our various capitals, on the basis of the principle of budgetary subsidiarity. Member States should consider payments to the European Union, not as spending, but as investments in a globalised world, where Europe must be able to deal on an equal footing with China, Russia and the United States, thanks to European autonomy essential to defend the interests of our citizens and future generations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Olivier CHASTEL", "mepid": "197463", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I’m really grateful for the opportunity to address you even under these very difficult circumstances and I’m also happy to see that Mr Larrouturou is with us and still quite well and I hope it stays like this. Let me first congratulate all of you on the political agreement concerning the Multiannual Financial Framework, which we all could reach just yesterday. Indeed, it required serious compromises on both sides, but it came just in time, and it shows that the Union is ready to act. This unprecedented agreement is historic both in size and magnitude. At times, when the epidemiological situation is worsening, and economic forecasting is predicting challenging times for our companies, citizens and regions. This demonstrates the Union’s ability to act. As you know, the MFF is a pre-condition for having the annual budget and all the programmes adopted. Ultimately, the envelopes for Union programmes depend on the final agreed MFF ceilings.  The Commission will therefore work tirelessly to introduce the budgetary impact of the MFF agreement in the annual budget procedure as quickly as possible.  We were just about to conclude our work on the amending letter but now we are happy to finalise it taking the MFF agreement into account.  I hope that this will enable us to swiftly come to an agreement on the 2021 budget in the conciliation. I think we can all agree that recent agreements should not directly be re-opened, especially considering the sweat and tears that went into this MFF agreement.  Concerning the budget nomenclature, we have, at the technical level, worked proactively with the Parliament and the Council to find the right balance between flexibility and transparency. The amending letter will provide proposals, which should meet the main concerns. On the substance of the Council and the Parliament position, I would like to address one issue also raised by State Secretary Hagedorn last time when we met in this Chamber few weeks ago. This concerns the proposal to reduce 162 posts in the Commission’s establishment plan of which 140 posts relate to staff increases in the Union’s decentralised agencies.  While we fully share the objective to ensuring the efficiency of our administration, I simply cannot accept the rationale in offsetting increases in posts for decentralised agencies by cutting Commission posts. The decentralised agencies work in areas where Member States agree that resources are better pooled for activities that would otherwise have to be performed by national administrations: border control or food safety are just two examples. The Commission doesn’t perform these tasks and the pooling of national activities in the decentralised agencies has no impact on the workload within the Commission. Therefore, I urge the Council and the Parliament to reconsider their position on this.  Let me just remind you of the next steps in the annual budgetary procedure. Firstly, we will present the aforementioned amending letter by the end of this week. Secondly, we will also present the executability letter in the coming days. It’s one of the Commission’s inputs for the conciliation. The executability letter provides the assessment of the implementability of the amendments proposed by the Parliament and the Council.  I am now fully confident that, after reaching the difficult and important MFF compromise, we will also be able to agree on how to translate it into the 2021 budget.  There’s no margin for failure in the draft budget 2021 calendar. The conciliation, which starts this coming Tuesday, 17 November, is our one and only shot to find an agreement on the next annual budget. Now, the negotiating teams will, with their political agreement on the MFF, pave the way to an agreement on the 2021 budget as well.  We have only these 21 days until December 7 to reach an agreement. So I trust we all understand the heavy responsibility that this places on everyone, because what is an MFF without an annual budget?  Let’s make every single day count and work together proactively and constructively. This is critical if we want the Union’s response to the crisis to continue at full force next year.  I have to say my services and I are available at all times to help this process because, once again, we cannot lose any time and it’s our one and only last shot, if you like, and this is something which has to be fixed in due time in order to really to enable us, starting on 1 January next year to implement what is necessary in the interest of our citizens.

The first: \"Money is not everything, but nothing is nothing without money.\" I do not know who is the author, but the second quote I can attribute to Woody Allen, who said, \"Money is important, if only for financial reasons.\"  I think he is absolutely right and, for us, the agent is important, for financial and political reasons. We have just adopted our multi-year financial framework and I want to congratulate all our teams, who have done some hard work, who have managed to move the lines and deserve our respect. The next seven years at least will be marked by the fruit of their efforts. We have succeeded in making it clear to policy makers that there is no question of letting Italy down, that there is no question of letting down Spain, Portugal, France, the countries of the South, the countries of the East. There was a Franco-German initiative , and the rapporteur referred to it a few moments ago - which gave the necessary political scope to the initiative of the European Parliament, which had already decided before on a very ambitious recovery plan. Perhaps the only small complaint that could be made about this stimulus package is that it might, with the second wave of COVID, not be enough.  But with the political prowess that we have been able to do, I think there, too, we will find an answer. I hope that the needs will not be too great, but in any case the political reflexes of the Union are starting to work. As my friend and colleague Valérie Hayer said this morning, for the first time in 50 years, we are creating new resources of our own. This is a real success and, even if that money does not go directly into the budget, it will help us pay off the debts incurred in the months that follow.  2021 may be a healthy year, it will be the first year of the budget cycle, it will also be the first year that will be a test of resistance for the new clause respecting fundamental rights. This stress test should not be postponed until 2022. No, it is now, because it is now that we must fight against violations. They have taken place, they are still taking place and, when I hear the political speeches of some Member States, they are not disappearing, these violations, so we are going to have to be very vigilant.  Finally, as co-reporter on the NDICI, I would like to say that 2021 may also be the first year that the European Parliament will be able to benefit from new political prerogatives in terms of programming.

An agreement providing for new own resources aligned with the Political Priorities of the European Union.  We have to invest in retirement, investment and job creation. A recovery that must protect and innovate: protecting those who have been most affected by these uncertainties (women, young people, children, precarious workers); innovate in the economy. This time, we didn't make the mistakes of the last crisis. A more unequal society is a society with less confidence, more unstable, insecure and subject to radicalism that we reject.

The 2021 budget is of particular importance for the entire fisheries and aquaculture sector, and it comes at a time of severe economic instability. The new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) should help the sector to meet the new objectives of the EU, in particular, to deliver on the Green Deal, and that comes with significant costs. This alone would have well justified an  increase in the budget for 2021 but, not only is the budget in decline, but the sector is in difficulty and facing unprecedented crisis. The sector is suffering from the consequences of the massive drop in demand for fisheries and aquaculture product throughout Europe. We don’t even know yet how many waves of lockdowns will hit Europe, we don’t know how long and often restaurants and hotels will remain closed in the majority of Member States, with substantially reducing demand for fisheries and aquaculture products and business opportunities for our fishermen. The amounts proposed by the Commission are well below what is needed: a drop by 13.5% in comparison to 2020. The Council position is even worse. This is simply irregular, irresponsible and unacceptable for us in the Fisheries Committee. This is why the text proposed by our committee for the plenary raises direct management for the EMFF. It would bring it in line with Parliament’s original position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and also it would help the sector and those in need to act fast and get help very fast.

This has been highlighted in the report in which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs sets out some clear priorities. Firstly, the increase in funds devoted to promoting the involvement and participation of citizens in the democratic life of the Union. Secondly, the inclusion of a chapter of expenditure devoted to the conference on the future of Europe. If there is no funding, it is not possible to hold the conference, and the Commission has done well to significantly increase investment in communications services, but we need a further effort to combat disinformation. I believe that we must also increase the fund available to the Commission representations and Parliament's liaison offices in the Member States. The agreement reached yesterday between the Council and Parliament reaffirms the centrality of this House as a body that has control over the budgetary procedure, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs therefore considers it essential to ensure the transparency of our budgets.

There is no doubt that gender-responsive budgeting must be mainstreamed in the 2021 general budget as well as in future budgets to better align policies promoting the equal participation of women in the labour market. This is particularly important in times of the COVID-19 crisis, which poses a serious risk of rolling back decades of gains achieved in gender equality in labour market participation. Thus, we welcome the reinforcement of employment and social innovation strands to support programmes and training targeted at advancing women’s participation and tackling their precarity on the labour market. It is also extremely important to secure the Daphne strand to fight violence against girls and women, which has escalated over the last few months.

However, one thing always remains the same, namely our duty as MEPs to use our citizens' taxpayers' money sparingly and efficiently. The financial resources are not there to make up for past failures in the Member States, but they must be channelled into our defined objectives. Investments in research, innovation, education, digitisation, the competitiveness of our European businesses, the security of supply by our farmers, but also in general security guarantee a high quality of life for our citizens and keep us on an equal footing with the other world powers. The rule of law as a guarantor of democracy must be the DNA of the European Union, and therefore a causal link between the allocation of funds on the one hand and respect for our values is imperative. Our strong European community of values is not invulnerable, as we unfortunately saw last week in Vienna as a result of this terrorist attack.

It will also become the first sign and symbol of European ambitions for the next seven years.  I will start with key programmes. Enhancing Horizon Europe is highly important to boost the digital transformation. This is pretty straightforward. The COVID crisis has shown us all how much we depend on technologies – technologies which are both not perfect and not equally available to every EU country and every European.  Investment in research and innovation must both bring new advanced solutions and narrow the gap between Member States, regions and social groups. Fighting digital inequality will in future be as crucial as fighting social or any other inequalities we are dealing with right now.  As part of the overall MMF deal, the flagship programme Horizon Europe will receive an additional EUR 4 billion for research and innovation – which is great news for European scientists – and that means we have to stand for a corresponding increase in annual allocation for 2021 already.  The COVID crisis has proved once again that medical workers and healthcare systems are probably as important as military personnel and armies. Our enemy right now is invisible and we need medicine and vaccines, rather than guns and bombs, to defeat it. EU4Health is the answer to major cross-border health threats and one of the much-needed steps to create a European Health Union.  An additional EUR 3.4 billion as part of the MFF triples the budget of the programme. We all understand that in order to meet current challenges and to prepare for future ones, we need to increase financing for 2021 significantly. This budget is crucial in order to increase the quality of healthcare systems around Europe and their affordability and of course in order to deal with inequalities between Member States and regions.  Another of the enhanced 15 flagship programmes to mention is Erasmus+. It is our strategic investment – investment in our youth, in social cohesion, in European integration. It is investment in our values, identity and heritage that we wish to pass on to future generations. The investment means EUR 2.2 billion of additional money for the next 7 years, and at least EUR 165 million next year. At the same time I would like to outline that Europe can afford much more for its values. The 2021 budget is a good tool in helping us in both enhancing and rethinking the way European institutions work during the COVID crisis and after it, when the ‘new normal’ will arrive. Starting with the European Parliament itself, all the institutions are fighting with the challenges of teleworking in 24 different languages, with different quality of internet and technical advancement around the continent. Nevertheless, they all work hard, bringing Europeans and their ideas together, like for instance the Committee of the Regions or the European Economic and Social Committee.  Our experience from previous economic crises tell us, ‘cut down the estimates for institutions’. That is not the case this time. The estimates for the other institutions and agencies take into account both the tasks to be performed next year and the level of possible transformation that each institution may go through, finding the best suitable way to work in future.  I wish us all good luck in the forthcoming negotiations with the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 2, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 158, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Valérie HAYER", "mepid": "135511", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the mother of all battles is coming to an end and already a new budgetary joust is starting, the first of this new framework, reinforced by us as recently as yesterday. Much has already been said today, I will not go into detail about the additional reinforcements hoped for in this text. I will just point out that the Commission, Commissioner, as you have pointed out, will rectify its proposal on the basis of the agreement reached yesterday. And, undoubtedly, there will have to be adjustments. Beyond the numbers, the important thing is the political message we will send: what priorities for the Union in 2021? The Union which will still suffer from the effects of the pandemic. Personally, I think we need a budget that focuses on recovery, a smart, green, digital and solidarity recovery.  It is this recovery that will bring prosperity back to us and protect the most vulnerable among us. So, yes, to put the package on health and research and innovation. Our economies will be better off and our jobs can be multiplied. But where to find the money? Less VAT, our customs duties have decreased because of the slowdown in our trade and, it must be said, because of the 5.5 billion that we leave to the Member States to do the job, to fill out paperwork, to control goods, a job that is far too expensive, without a doubt. But it takes what it takes to buy the consent to Europe of certain heads of state and government. As a result, by 2021, we will still have to go to the states to adjust our finances. Fortunately, dear friends, all this will soon be ancient history. Our collective fight for the creation of new recipes was decisive. They will be created, tomorrow we will have a carbon adjustment mechanism at the borders, a tax on the digital giants, a tax on financial transactions. Pierre is no longer here but I invite him to work together to make this tax happen. These own resources, once created, will enable the Union to take responsibility.

And I wish we could find a different solution here soon and return to the plenary session as we are used to. This is really a de facto exclusion of one of the parliamentarians from Parliament, and how is the work to be done? I see a major problem here, and I really cannot judge it any other way than to quote from my group: 'The distance participation is unfortunately appropriate and not an appropriate substitute for actual hearings and debates'. We cannot bear this in the long run. I therefore ask that we really take this point to heart.  In addition to this disempowerment of Parliament, on the one hand, there is a certain degree of self-empowerment by Parliament when it comes to the budget now. Why do I call it that? Now, even the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, said recently, three weeks ago, that please stop asking us to keep asking for money. In the end, we cannot do that.  Today we have received these sixteen billion, but basically the task of a Parliament as guardian of the budget is being turned completely on its head. Normally, as the Committee on Budgets, we should also ensure that money is used sparingly and economically. The exact opposite is being done here: one uses the existing crises – which are unfortunately there of God – and, to a certain extent, in the shadow of these crises, one hangs on to it and demands more and more money and really inflates this budget until it is almost unsustainable and bursts. And that's a big problem.  And another problem that is not addressed is the question: where do you take the money from? Unfortunately, the revenue will not flow next year, but the 46 billion that Mrs Marques, or who ever spoke of, will only arrive in five years' time. Next year, we will have only one of the six new own resources, namely this plastic levy for packaging. Do you really believe that with this money all the programmes that you now want to re-run can be supported with it? That is completely impossible.  We need to get back to sound, normal financial management. We must do what a budgetary legislator has to do again: he must control the Commission, cut the Council – even in its claims – and make sure that the money remains in his pocket, otherwise the return carriage will come.

In this budget, there are some very positive advances from this point of view, with the 30% climate, 10% biodiversity, with the idea, of course, not to use the remaining percentages of the budget to destroy what is being implemented with the climate criteria and biodiversity criteria. This is one of the issues on which we will continue to debate. To also say that, in this report, there is this 60% percentage, which is consistent with the 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, to remember that it is 65% that would be needed, that is the spirit of the amendment I have tabled. Also increase the budget of Parliament's Environment Directorate General to push and work on the ecological transition.

An amendment has also been proposed to make these mega-contracts transparent, which is very important. In conclusion, we are therefore part of this urgent will to act.

I had the personal honor of a few weeks to be in Bulgaria and their capital Sofia where I had the opportunity to speak. I have had the privilege of speaking in front of tens of thousands of protesters who have been protesting against the Bulgarian government for four months. Citizens were outraged that the European Union, now 13 years after Bulgaria's entry into the European Union, was funding the Bulgarian establishment. At the same time Bulgaria is, unfortunately, among the poorest countries in Europe.  My Croatia is also right alongside Bulgaria among the poorest countries in Europe, and in Croatia citizens are outraged at how money from European funds is spent. There is no effective control of European funds in Croatia de facto. When an irregularity is detected, it is reported to OLAF. OLAF puts this down to a national body, AFCOS, which is part of the Ministry of Finance and according to their own claims, they do not have the mechanisms to control how this money is spent. They send an inquiry to the Croatian State Attorney's Office, which is traditionally ineffective, on the one hand, and on the other hand, to the very body that tenders, to control itself. So he wonders the thief if he's a thief. He replies that he is not a thief and it is concluded that there is nothing wrong with this money.

I note that the European Parliament continues to spend millions of euros every year on the construction of new buildings, funding states that call for a boycott of our French products, such as Turkey or Jordan, which penalises our French farmers. I remind you that some of my fellow ultramarine countries are still in great difficulty in accessing drinking water in 2020, to date, within the European Union! On the programme of options specific to remoteness and insularity, that is poseI, I call on the European Commission and the Council not to reduce this programme, which now amounts to EUR 280 million annually for France. I draw your attention to the fact that POSEI maintains the balance between distance, insularity and the additional costs of an island. It allows us to finance major local and national agricultural policy projects, in order to guarantee food sovereignty for our islands and regions. With regard to the European Fund for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the FEAMP, the proposal to introduce a 50% cap on the extra cost compensation plan, to which France is also opposed, must be rejected, because otherwise it would be direct aid to ultramarine fishermen. We must also remember that the Union's cohesion policy has a aim: to reduce regional and social inequalities within the European Union. So it is time to take concrete action for our French islands and regions, to move towards more administrative simplification, flexibility, accessibility for every European aid for our territories. Today, the ecological shift that some are trying to give to the European Union budget must stem from major policies to relocate and protect sectors, such as agricultural, fishing or handicrafts. This budget must move towards the defence of traditional fishing, family farming, more protected geographical identification but also more intelligent protectionism and fewer free trade treaties, which penalize our farmers. We now know that Europe is already a very ecological continent, very clean, with many innovative sectors. So why do we continue to put sticks in the wheels of our farmers, our fishermen and all those who participate in our economy and feed us?

It is an exceptionally important budget for all of us for two reasons. Firstly, this budget must trigger a real transition towards a CO2-free Europe, implement the green transition to which we are all committed. Secondly, this budget must also be an instrument by which we lift Europe from the coronavirus crisis to new growth. And these two things still have to support each other. I am delighted that the budget proposal before us is a good one and supports these two major issues. More money for research and university research and innovation is a necessary condition for Europe's success. Another important principle is that 30% of the budget is spent on combating climate change. They're big steps forward. However, I would also like to raise one more point that I consider important, which could be more on the agenda in this budget. It is the fight against money laundering and the resources involved. Billions continue to move in money laundering outside other activities of society, paying a tax burden on those who have to pay taxes. It is therefore important that next year we make progress in the fight against money laundering. In this context, it is particularly important that our police officer Europol's money is in the right place. I hope that improvements will be made to this issue during this parliamentary term.  I am also pleased that the 2021 budget is the first budget conditional on the rule of law. It is an important decision and will impose obligations equally on all Member States. In doing so, we will maintain the Union's ability to act and also its credibility, both in the eyes of its citizens and in relation to the outside world.

One of the few powers that the European Parliament has is precisely the time of the budget. So we must, on the one hand, find the courage to dare and, on the other hand, find the courage not to continue to make mistakes, because the next budget that is being carried out for some is worth +15 billion, that is, 15 billion more is being demanded of taxpayers. So you have to figure out where you want to find the courage to find this 15 billion. And I say, let's ask the Chinese government! We call on those who have created a global epidemic to compensate our families, our businesses and our economy. Europe has this great opportunity: we expect the Chinese Government to enter the European budget in compensation. We cannot think once again of finding this money in the pockets of Italian citizens and in the pockets of European citizens. It is also important to take stock of how we can help our businesses, to help our bars, our traders, our craft activities and our production activities, which are in serious crisis; the same jobs, in Italy but also in Europe, are in serious crisis. So, on the one hand, we find the resources and ask the Chinese Government, which created the tragedy of this epidemic, but on the other hand we also cut waste, we cut the Strasbourg office: we have seen that it is not necessary, we can intervene from Milan with an efficiency that I would say unique, without having to move and have a seat in Strasbourg with the associated costs. We also cut agencies, agencies in seychelles or agencies like that, the last one I read, on gender equality, parent one and parent two... Soon we will also do the agency on water or the agency on seven and a half or the agency on butterflies... I don't know what we can waste money on. I say no, of course, to a budget like this, which still includes money for Libya, money for Turkey, money for roma integration, money for reception.  I say that this budget should also find the courage to wipe out the share of VAT that comes into the pockets of the European Union. Italian citizens pay 2 billion VAT to the European Union every year. Then the European Union, with this budget, is giving up EUR 2 billion and leaving the EUR 2 billion in the pockets of the Italian citizens, who really need it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ID", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 1, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2020-11-11.json", "name": "Angelo CIOCCA", "mepid": "183793", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank the Thank you very much to Parliament for this dedicated and detailed debate. There have been a wealth of suggestions which will certainly be the subject of intensive discussions in the coming weeks. I am not sure that all the suggestions can be implemented, because a deal with China on the repayment of damages or damages is likely to be unenforceable by the beginning of January. But we will still try to provide the money – the money for the citizens who really need it now, also to keep their businesses afloat, so to speak, the money to ensure that jobs remain secure.  We have the SURE instrument. Yesterday we had another very successful auction in order to provide the funds so that funds could be made available, especially in the short-time working phase, especially in those countries that do not know this instrument to date. We will have REACT-EU, a tool that, as the name suggests, will make it possible to claim costs arising from the COVID crisis in the middle of February this year. So there are a lot of possibilities.  However, I would also like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the honourable Parliament, to ask that the sectoral negotiations be taken forward together with the Council. Because one budget is one thing, the use of the possibilities is the other. And at European level, this is essentially done on the basis of sectoral legislation that is the basis on how this money can be spent. Even then, we still need appropriate programming, which must also be carried out in order to make the funds arrive where it is necessary, namely the citizens, the entrepreneurs, the researchers, the creativepeople of this country.  In other words, yesterday we made a big impact with the multiannual budget. But now it is a matter of putting things into practice – that is the crucial point – and there is no time to lose and therefore full attention to the 2021 budget.

The European institutions have shown responsibility and care for today and tomorrow's generations, developing new programmes such as the Next Generation EU, designed to boost economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic. Romania, through the negotiations held in the Council, is the fourth country in the fourth most budgetary allocation after Poland, Spain and Italy, with a significant increase compared to the allocations from the previous budget. Reducing economic, social and territorial disparities will be made possible by money dedicated to cohesion policy, while Romanian agriculture and rural areas will benefit from increased budgets under the common agricultural policy. The new budget also comes with significant increases for the whole of the EU through: the European Health Programme, Erasmus, research and external border security.

Ladies and gentlemen, the 2021 budget is of particular importance to the fisheries sector as it comes at a time of serious economic instability. The new EMFF should help the sector to be part of the EU's new objectives, in particular the Green Deal. This should have justified an increase in the budget for 2021. Not only is the latter on the decline, but the fishing sector must also overcome an unprecedented crisis: the Covid-19 crisis. The sector is still suffering from the consequences of the massive decline in demand for seafood across Europe. The EMFF must be sufficiently sufficient to support the sector and must face possible new demand shocks related to the health crisis. We do not know how many waves will hit Europe next year. We do not know how long the restaurants will remain closed, substantially reducing the demand for seafood and the opportunities for our fishermen. That is why we, the European Parliament, must defend the fisheries sector and in particular the allocations of the FEAMP in order to give it a real strike force for 2021, which promises to be particularly complicated.
