They have a very dense agenda which will be spread over two days. The first item on the agenda is migration. The Eastern Mediterranean route and the Western Balkans route are largely under control. The most pressing issue today is the Central Mediterranean route. In February, leaders agreed on a list of measures to address the situation. Member States and institutions have followed up on this guidance and significantly increased their engagement. Still, the magnitude of the crisis and the harrowing numbers of lives lost at sea remind us every day that more is needed – more efforts and more coordination to implement what has been decided. The European Council will review the state of play and look at how to improve the effectiveness of our action. Leaders will also revert to the reform of the Common European Asylum System. The European Council is expected to give a steer for further work to continue under the Estonian Presidency. Second on the agenda is security and defence. In the light of recent tragic attacks, notably in Manchester and London, leaders will again speak out firmly against terrorism, hatred and violent extremism and will look at what more the EU can do. As concerns external security and defence, leaders established a comprehensive work programme in December. Since then more progress has been achieved than in the last ten years. Building on this new momentum, leaders will discuss further steps on some issues, for instance, permanent structured cooperation, EU battle groups or the industrial dimension of EU defence. Turning now to jobs, growth and competitiveness, which is the third item on the agenda, a year ago leaders set the deadline of 2018 to complete the Single Market in all its dimensions. They will therefore look at what has been achieved, and where we are lagging behind. This deadline should remain a strong driver to make headway at all levels, including in interinstitutional negotiations. Furthermore, in the light of recent developments, the European Council will return to trade policy. Leaders are expected to reaffirm the EU strong commitment to our trade policy. They will also discuss how the EU can make sure trade remains free and fair for all. To conclude, I would like to mention two other important topics. First, leaders will show their strong and continued support to the Paris Agreement on climate change. This is an important point, and we will discuss this here later on in the morning and I think that we should expect some strong language on this issue. Second, in preparation for the Estonian Presidency, leaders will encourage a broader outlook on the digital dimension of Europe. As demonstrated by recent cyber attacks, digital issues go beyond the Digital Single Market. They have a bearing on many if not all other EU policies.

In Europe, determination will always triumph over fear. These attacks will not undermine our resilience. They do, however, bring into sharper focus the discussions on defense and security that we will have at this month’s European Council. Europeans expect their Union to keep them safe from threats, whether they be from within or without, and whatever their nature. That was recognized by EU leaders in Bratislava and in Rome when they pledged to step up their defense cooperation. They highlighted defense as one of the key issues for our Union when moving forward. To support that, and faithful to what I told this Parliament last September in the State of the European Union speech, the Commission last week published a reflection paper on the future of European defense, showing how far we can go depending on the level of ambition and political will of our Member States. We have all the tools we need in the Treaties to make it happen, including permanent structured cooperation, the sleeping beauty of the Lisbon Treaty. But now is the time to decide, and this House must play a full role in that debate. Whichever road we go down, our ever closer partnership with NATO will remain the cornerstone of Europe’s defense and security. On defense, the European Union and NATO are like twins. We are part of the same family, and rivalry is not an option. Within NATO there is a great deal the European Union can do to improve its own cooperation. The simple truth is that no European country alone can tackle the scale and complexity of the challenges we face, nor can we rely on any foreign power to do it for us. We cannot outsource our own security. That starts with the need to invest in a more efficient way. The United States already spends twice as much as all European countries combined, while Russia and China have dramatically stepped up their defense budgets in recent years. And 90% of the money we invest in defense, research and technology in Europe is spent without any kind of coordination at all. That leads to inefficiencies and duplication that could easily be avoided. That is why the European Defense Fund that the Commission proposed last week will support Member States' budgets and facilitate cooperation on joint research and purchasing of equipment and technology. We have earmarked EUR 590 million to support defense by 2020, and have proposed to allocate at least EUR 1.5 billion each year after that. The fund is both an investment boost to our industry and a statement of intent to our citizens, who expect us to do more to protect them. I was encouraged to see already vocal support for our proposals at last week's high-level conference on security and defense which I hosted with Prime Minister Sobotka in Prague, but also the Franco-German announcement for the development of a European drone program and the joint training of officers. We are not talking about the militarization of the European continent. It is about doing more together for the stability and peace of our continent. Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, il est normal que l’Union européenne s’implique fortement dans tout ce qui relève de la sécurité et de la défense. Mais la sécurité mondiale exige bien plus que les seuls efforts en matière de dépenses militaires. La stabilité européenne comme la stabilité mondiale dépendent aussi de nos efforts dans les domaines de la coopération au développement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques, dont nous savons à quel point ils redessinent notre planète et sont source d’instabilité. Notre terre et tous ses peuples en subiront les effets. La montée des eaux n’a jamais été aussi rapid: elle menacera la côte du Bengale, comme la côte de Floride et certaines côtes européennes. Tous les peuples ne sont pas égaux face aux conséquences des changements climatiques. La partie la plus pauvre du monde, qui n’est responsable que de 7% of emissions from CO2, est la plus vulnérable. Cette fois-ci, nous ne pourrons pas prétendre que nous ne savions pas. À travers le monde, le nombre des catastrophes naturelles liées au climat a plus que triplé depuis le début des années 60. Chaque année, ces catastrophes ont provoqué plus de 60 000 decès, principalement, mais non exclusivement, dans les pays en développement. Les épisodes de sécheresse deviennent de plus en plus nombreux et de plus en plus graves, provoquant de véritables situations de famine, comme c’est actuellement le cas en Afrique de l’Est. Réduire les budgets de l’aide au développement ou remettre en cause les engagements pris à la COP 21, c’est porter une lourde responsabilité en nuisant gravement à la stabilité mondiale. Ce message, l’Union européenne doit continuer et continuera à le porter. Vous pouvez compter sur moi et le monde comptera sur nous. Nous avons connu, ces dernières années, le plus important afflux de réfugiés depuis la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, mais nous devons aujourd’hui prévenir une crise bien plus grave encore. Agissons sans perdre un seul instant, car ne pas tenir aujourd'hui les engagements de l'accord de Paris, c'est risquer de jeter, d'ici à 2050, jusqu'à 250 millions de réfugiés climatiques sur les routes de l ' exile. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! We have actually already taken on a pioneering role in reforming the European asylum and migration system. Even if public and public opinion often claim that the European Union is not making headway in the refugee crisis, this is not entirely true. This is proven by our current migration package, which the Commission sent to the European Council yesterday. We see more solidarity than before, but we don't see enough solidarity yet. And we see ours External borders are better protected than ever before. The Union and the Member States support Greece and Italy; we have redistributed 20,000 refugees from these two countries. This shows: where there is a will, there is a way. And we have set up central reception centers on site, to which we have sent EU officials, staff from EU agencies and experts from all Member States. At the same time, we have made the protection of our common external borders our responsibility. Thanks to the European Border and Coast Guard, we can now better secure the most endangered sections of the border. At the moment there are already 1,600 European border guards on duty - but nobody says it - to support the national border guards: 967 in Greece, 402 in Italy, 168 in Bulgaria and 65 in Spain. In addition, a pool of 1,500 border guards is immediately ready for action. We show solidarity not only within the Union, but also towards those states that take in a large proportion of the refugees. This includes Turkey. At my most recent meeting with President Erdoğan at the end of May, we both confirmed that we wanted to continue working on the successful implementation of the EU-Turkey refugee agreement. The EU is true to its word, and Turkey is also true to its word. Because today 98% fewer refugees come from Turkey to Greece than was the case before the agreement. But of course we will not rest on what we have achieved. Our reports clearly show where there are still shortcomings and where the Member States need to make further efforts. This is about very practical questions, such as the lack of equipment for European border and coastal protection. But it is also about fundamental questions, namely how Member States implement EU law. After a total of twelve reports in which we have repeatedly warned that some countries must do more to improve their There are still three countries - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - which have either not accepted a single refugee from Italy and Greece or have not accepted any refugees for over a year. That leaves us with no choice but to start infringement proceedings against these countries today. I would like to underline this: this is not about sanctions, it is about making it clear that the decisions made are applicable law, even if one has voted against it. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and we must do our duty, as we are doing today in 137 other infringement cases against a total of 27 Member States. We should stop arguing that initiating infringement proceedings equates to sanctions. This is about compliance with European law, and anyone who insists that European law be complied with does not sanction. (Applause) European solidarity cannot be a one-way street; traffic has to move in both directions. I am not giving up hope that the European spirit, European reason and our European values ​​will ultimately prevail and that we will not have to resolve this question of solidarity before the Court of Justice. European solidarity issues do not have to be resolved in court, but cry out for an immediate political response. Solidarity, however, cannot be enforced with a crowbar; it has to come from the heart, especially when it comes to human life. I will remind the Member States intensely of this at the next European Council.

Let me start with a frank analysis from our side: I do not think it is a good result, because we were asking London for clear orientation and stability, and what we see today is a situation of disorientation – some are calling it a chaotic situation – in London. Theresa May gambled and she lost, and the country is deeply divided. Twelve months after the Brexit result, when we look at the political landscape all over Europe, we now see clear leadership in France, Spain is stable, Italy is stable, Germany is stable, and so is Dublin. So Europe is united, but we are seeing a lot of problems on the table in London. So the main message for people in the European Union is that it is better to reform the European Union, if needed, than to destroy it or to leave it. (Applause) One inspiring element of this election is that the youth is back. They abstained in the Brexit decision, and now they have gone to vote and have taken their destiny into their own hands. That is a very promising thing, because they are in favour of partnership and in favour of Europe. A hard Brexit was what Theresa May offered, and I have to say that there is no majority for this option. In Great Britain, people are rethinking their priorities, and today they are mainly discussing jobs: that is what we should also focus on. Let us talk about jobs, let us talk about the economy, and about people’s daily lives. That is one thing.  The second thing is the official agenda: there, the most important thing is that we have had enough papers on the table and we have had enough talks on the issues. It is now time to act. That is what people all over Europe expect from our leaders. On defence, it is obvious we have the Commission’s very good papers – Jean—Claude Juncker’s papers – on the table, and we have the Bratislava decision on the table. So let us now start with cyber war, with drones, and with action in the Sahel Zone. It is now up to us simply to do it, and that is what we expect from the Council. On migration, for the EPP Group, the precondition for all further measures was always that we need strong border control. We have to protect our borders. When we listen to our Commission President, this is now much better organised and works much better than it has done in recent years. Now we can go a step further. I want to underline that on the question of solidarity it is not Europe which is failing, because Brussels – I should say the Commission – is offering a clear proposal, and we in Parliament have a clear majority in favour of practicing solidarity in the European Union. It is not Europe that is failing, but for the moment it is national egoism which is failing and not bringing results. That is why we should move. Let us go on and let us show leadership. With Brexit in mind, the most convincing thing that our leaders can do now is act.

And thanks to the leader of the British Labor Party Jeremy Corbyn for the great victory obtained, which is a victory of courage in the political and programmatic proposal and also a victory of a just conception of Brexit, neither hard nor soft but right and fair. A joke about terrorism: if we want to be serious, the first thing we have to do is to strengthen the cooperation of the intelligence services, the rest is propaganda. With regard to refugees and immigration, the surveillance of the external borders is good and the infringement procedures are good, albeit late, because some Member States have been blocking the refugee relocation scheme for some time. I am sorry - I must say this to the Council and not to the Maltese Presidency, whom I thank very much - that the European Commission's proposal on the revision of the Dublin system lies in the Council like a closed book and not even leafed through. It is serious and shameful that that proposal was not even worthy of an opening for discussion, while Parliament has worked hard and is working hard. The problem is not just that of refugees, President Juncker, you know this well and Commissioner Avramopoulos knows it too. There is a big problem concerning the flows of irregular immigrants and we have to put one thing in our heads: if we want to reduce the irregularity of the flows we must guarantee the legality of the flows, that is, open legal channels for immigration. This is the main road, together with the other one that of a serious partnership with Africa, not bartering - we give some money, a few, to Africa and in exchange they accept return, repatriation - but a true partnership. political, economic and social that makes it possible to solve the great challenges facing Africa. Juncker talked about it, with reference to climate change, to the theme of education and to the theme of democracy.As long as Africa is the prey ground of multinationals that pocket gigantic revenues and give no return to African citizens, as long as there is no democracy and we do not help them build a democratic system and an autonomous and indigenous development, we do notwe will resolve the issue of irregular immigrants, because there they have two paths: either they come to us or they go with the terrorists of Boko Haram, there is no other path for those young people, for those girls.We have to offer perspective.If we offer this perspective to Africa, we also offer a better perspective to Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the agenda for this Summit highlights some of the big challenges ahead: security, migration and asylum, Turkey, as well – as others have said – as some discussions on the Brexit negotiations. Topics we have discussed before and no doubt topics that we will discuss again; but each time we have to ask ourselves: are we any closer to solutions and real action? If you will allow me, let me start with the British general election. An election in which the Conservative party lost seats but not enough to lose power, and where the opposition gained seats but not enough to gain power and ended up 56 seats behind, and just as in any other country, for example the Netherlands at the moment, the largest party will seek to form a government with support from a smaller party. But the UK Government expects to begin negotiations later this month, for we have kept you waiting long enough.  Just as in this Parliament, the largest party will need to build wider coalitions in order to pass legislation. Now if that means addressing concerns over civil liberties while drafting new laws to tackle the threat of terrorism, to my mind a wider coalition is not necessarily a bad thing.  Can I also take this opportunity to thank colleagues from across the political spectrum for their messages of condolences and solidarity after the recent terrorist attacks in both Manchester and my home city of London. We may be divided on our politics but we are united in not wanting to allow the terrorists to win. (Applause) I hope the Council will understand the importance of tackling terrorism at different levels. At the international level: military cooperation without undermining NATO, better data sharing between national law enforcement agencies; at the national level: upholding the rule of law, our shared values and the security of our citizens, as well as making sure that any shared intelligence is actually acted upon; and at a local community level: encouraging local projects to tackle radicalisation at its roots.  But security is just one of the issues facing us. The migration crisis continues as does the EU-Turkey deal, and the ECR believes that the EU should focus on a new relationship based not on the false promise of membership, but on an honest relationship based on cooperation. Because while the deal with Turkey appears to be holding for now, the Council must seek consensus from all Member States to effectively tackle the migrant crisis, in case that agreement breaks down, by getting the basics right – processing asylum applications quickly and efficiently, returning those who do not qualify to their country of origin, agreeing clear criteria for qualification, based on the Geneva Convention – and by not continuing to pursue a struggling relocation scheme without the full support of all Member States.  Our discussions on the challenges will continue way beyond this Summit and future ones, but how many times do we have to discuss them before our voters see real progress? While others will call for new rules, the ECR Group calls for the EU to make what we already have work better. While others will call for more agencies, the ECR Group calls for more action and while others will call for further political integration, the ECR Group calls for political cooperation for a reformed EU which does less, but does it better.

He said that there is at least one positive outcome of the British election: the disappearance of UKIP and of those who want not only Britain out of Europe, but who want to destroy the European Union from inside. I think that it is true that there will be a lot of items on the agenda in the European Council next week, but the main point on the agenda is whether we can now start the negotiations on Brexit. It is three years since the start of the debate, a year since the outcome of the British referendum and three months since the triggering of the notification, and we are not still not in a position to start negotiations, because there is – for the moment anyway – no clear position from the new government in the United Kingdom – if there is already a new government, because every day I read that there is a deal, but then six hours later there is no deal and they are still discussing it. But there are five pressing questions that need to be answered on a short—term basis. Mr Kamall, maybe you can help the government to respond to them. First: is the British position still that of the letter of 29 March, or will the new government take into account the outcome of the election, which was a little different from the hard talk of the letter of the 29th? The second question is: will it be the opinion of the Tories or the position of the whole nation? Party interest or national interest? Because this is not about the Tories leaving the European Union but about the UK leaving the European Union. The third question: what about the Good Friday Agreement? What is the proposal so that the Good Friday Agreement can be kept in place and that no hard border will be created between the Republic on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the other hand? The fourth question: will the British government – as we do on the European side – one hundred per cent guarantee the current rights of EU citizens living in Britain, like we are ready to guarantee the current rights of British citizens living on the continent? Finally, the fifth question: is it still the opinion of the UK government to leave the single market and the customs union? Is the populist illusion of limiting free movement in Europe really more important than the prosperity and fortune of British workers, British industry, British companies and the British economy? Because let us face reality. This Brexit has already had a negative impact on everybody in Europe, and especially on Britain. Zero growth in the first quarter in Britain; for the moment it is three times less than in the last quarter of last year. And because of what? Because of the uncertainty that has been created. So I think the time is now right for us to receive from the British side clear answers to these five questions so that these negotiations can start. I know that yesterday Emmanuel Macron, the new French President, spoke about an open door. He said that, if Britain is changing its mind, it will find an open door. I do not disagree with him but, like in Alice in Wonderland, all doors are now the same. It will be a brand new door with a new Europe: a Europe without rebates, without complexity, with real power and with unity. That is the door towards Europe. For me, Jean-Claude, the most important thing now is the reform of our Union, and for this reform not to be bogged down in these Brexit talks. Brexit talks for the moment look more like the Echternach Procession – you are from Luxembourg and maybe you can explain to everybody what the procession of Echternach is – namely two steps forward and one step back. That is typical Echternach. I am very grateful to the Commission for the different reflection papers that they have put on the table, but the Commission is more than a think tank. I think the moment is now there, when we start these Brexit talks, to have also legislative proposals on the reform of the European Union, on defence – as you have done – and on economic and monetary union. But not only reflection papers: we also need legislative proposals. Do not leave the space open for the Council. It is not for the Council to fill in the space; it is the Commission that will have to do it with legislative proposals. We have now a new president in France who is pro-European, and we will have German elections. That is the moment to go forward. We always say do not waste a good crisis. Well, do not waste a good election cycle either.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Gabriele ZIMMER", "mepid": "28248", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! In my opinion, there are three topics that are very topical and that must certainly play a role both officially and unofficially at the Council meeting: On the one hand, there is the migration crisis, which I will come back to in a moment, the Brexit, but also the situation in Greece. I would like to ask you for the Council, too, to take a position with a view to the upcoming meeting of creditors and euro area finance ministers, in order to make it clear that we must finally put an end to blackmail. Now finally money has to be paid. But now negotiations on a haircut must finally begin. How do you want to talk about jobs and growth on the radio if you just let parts of the European Union break away and don't ensure that conditions arise there that make jobs and growth possible in the first place? That's the one point. I would just like to make one comment about Brexit because a lot has already been said: Theresa May is getting the support of the DUP. I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that this fact alone violates the mandate's requirement that all parts of the Good Friday Agreement must be observed. The British government is committed to neutrality and impartiality between the two ruling forces in Northern Ireland. I really ask for your attention here. When it comes to addressing the issue of the migration crisis, I would like to remind you once again: Please ensure that legal and safe channels are opened! The dead in the Mediterranean do not allow us to continue shirking this decision. In my view, they do not allow us as the European Union to organize deals with Sudan and Libya. Both are regimes - some of them are failed states. We finance forces directly in Sudan that were among those who took massive action against migrants from other regions, from other countries in Africa, deport them again or are responsible for inhuman treatment, for torture, for theft, for everything. We know that the Libyan coast guard is on the move, for example to impede sea rescue. We know the letter that “Sea-Watch” and “Doctors Without Borders” wrote to the Federal Chancellor, in which they asked her to finally put a stop to it, to finally ensure that we get this money - for example the 140 Millions to Sudan to finance the fact that Sudan is holding back the refugees with its forces - kindly put in the countries from which the refugees come. We must finally give concrete and long-term help to all those countries in Africa; Otherwise, the demands for closed borders are simply inhumane, because they lead us to keep putting people back. You, Mr Juncker - and this is my last request here today - spoke of the Union helping Greece and Italy: Please go to the hotspots! Yes, there is help, but on the other hand there are also efforts to hinder family reunification, for example, and also to return migrants to Greece and Italy. We can't let that happen. Solidarity is not voluntary in the European Union. You are right about that, and we will support you there. Infringement proceedings against those who do not participate are correct. Sanctions in the sense that funds are cut - that's not the point. It is really about making solidarity a compulsory part of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I share the calls of some of our colleagues for more solidarity on the refugee issue. I think it is super disappointing that the Council has dropped any progress on the issue of solidarity from the agenda, and I am afraid that if you cannot even solve that task, then I really have a hard time imagining how there can be progress in other areas – at least not in a way that will be satisfactory. I think the reason for that is that for solving problems you would actually need to tackle their root causes. You would have to look at the root cause for why people have to flee, and do something about that. You would have to look at the root causes for conflict and not just spend more money, and also look at the root causes of radicalisation and terror. Your answer to conflicts and violence worldwide is just to push for more military spending. You want to actually take money away from SME funding and from structural funds and put it into the weapons industry. But I do not really think that that particular industry really needs that extra bit of help, but what we are actually doing here – or what we would be doing here – is actually to make a 29th or 28th sort of defence policy. But rather than doing that and wasting a lot of money, we should make pooling and sharing the rule, and not the exception. This sort of cooperation could actually save us something like EUR 100 billion every year: money that is actually urgently needed to tackle all the root causes of conflicts, for example, in the world.  On terrorism we also urgently need answers, but I do not think that your recipe of simply collecting more and more data is going to do it. Rather, we need more policewomen and policemen on the ground. We need to strengthen the exchange of data on actual suspects and unknown risk persons, so that the tools that we already have today actually serve the security of our citizens. And yes, of course we need to prosecute those who pose a real threat to us and our way of life – absolutely – but we also need to look further into the root causes of radicalisation so that fewer people become a threat to our security and to our freedom.

Let me give you a sense of perspective: in the 2015 general election, just 13% of voters voted for parties – namely UKIP, which was the only one – that wanted to leave the European Union. Last Thursday, over 85% of British voters voted for parties on a manifesto not just of leaving the European Union, but of leaving the single market as well. In fact, on the morning of the general election, 70% of the British public – whichever way they had voted in the referendum – simply wanted the government to get on and complete and conclude Brexit.  I know that Theresa’s terrible campaign has cast a bit of doubt on this, and I saw that Emmanuel Macron yesterday – a call echoed by Mr Verhofstadt this morning – said that there is still time for the United Kingdom to change its mind; that it does not have to leave. Let me tell you that the only certainty in this mess is that we will be leaving. But that has not stopped a parade of former prime ministers and of former European Commissioners from lining up and attempting to get the British Government to backslide on its commitments. There is now a big push, a big drive, for us to opt for a Norway-style option, and I have to confess that your chief negotiator, Mr Barnier, is right: it took Theresa May nine months to trigger Article 50, and by the time the talks start it will be nearly four months since it was triggered, so I do accept that we go into this, as a British Government, with a British Prime Minister in a very weak position. And she is caught in a bit of a pincer movement, because the political class would like us to stay in the customs union and to stay in the single market, but the people have made it perfectly clear they want us to leave both of those things. And I would say this: that unless Theresa May – and it is difficult for her, because she never really believed in Brexit – stands up at the summit next week, in those negotiations, and makes it absolutely clear that she is not giving an inch – that we are leaving the single market – then her own party will get rid of her, and then yet more time will be lost in the Article 50 process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "EFD"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Marcel de GRAAFF", "mepid": "125025", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group.- On 22 June, the Council will discuss, among other things, EU defense, Brexit and migration.Let me be clear right away.On EU defense: we do not want an EU army, but cooperation of sovereign states within NATO.That got us through the Cold War.There is no need for a bureaucratic, money-consuming EU army.About Brexit: England is leaving the EU because the EU is a failed project developing into a second Soviet Union.So I don't want a billion dollar bill for England.The EU must stop and make way for economic cooperation between sovereign states.On migration: the EU appears unable to stop NGOs that have already picked up tens of thousands of migrants from Libya with rented boats instead of dragging them back.I hereby express my support for Hungary and the other Visegrad countries in their fight against Islamization.Let the Council follow this example.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Krisztina MORVAI", "mepid": "96661", "text": "   – Mr President, colleagues, citizens in Europe and overseas, I am also asking for solidarity, but in this case solidarity with my homeland: Hungary.

We have just heard from someone like that about how great Brexit is. The result of Brexit is plain and simple: there is a government here that is no longer able to negotiate, people are sliding into an uncertain future, and there is more enthusiasm for Europe in the rest of Europe. That's the truth, that's the result. I think we must now use the result as an opportunity for ourselves and seize the opportunity. And here the Council - which in recent years has not always been able to act as we would have liked - to seize the opportunity to make the best of it now. Incidentally, this also means, Madam, that rules that have been agreed upon are observed by everyone. If they are not adhered to, then you get criticism. That's the way it is in life. If I park incorrectly, I get a problem too. Rules are there to ensure that they are adhered to, in all questions - in all questions, including national debt. The second point is that if the Council meets now and wants to seize the opportunity, then I think that the Commission's presentation, especially in the area of ​​security and defense, is extremely interesting and good. Just take two or three things out of it - you don't have to do everything - take two or three things out of it and put a first point and show the people in Europe who are now back on the streets and say: “Europe is great, is valuable “: We can solve that, we take care of the problems that arise, and we also create very specific concepts. More cooperation - specifically, not generally, but practically doing something in the field of cybercrime, doing something in the field of drones, implementing it, delivering realities. This is the very best. And in this respect, Commission President Juncker has just made something important. Maybe we explain this far too little.Of course, Ms. Keller has not finished the refugee issue.Who thinks that?But we can at least say: We still have a lot of work to do, but we have also achieved a lot.It is true that these agreements with Turkey were successful, even if I do not like everything that is happening in Turkey.But the results aren't that bad.The numbers have fallen, relocations are working - far too little, but in part.It doesn't work for all states to participate, yes.I can also tell everything that doesn't work.But wouldn't it be intelligent now, at a time when people in Europe are having fun, hope and interest in Europe again, to report on their successes?I invite you: just take part!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Maria João RODRIGUES", "mepid": "124737", "text": "   – (inaudible) version just suffered a big blow: the 27 are, in fact, more united in implementing the roadmap adopted in Rome.

The Maltese declaration must be implemented and the European asylum system reformed.

It is indeed a great honour and privilege to address you today. I come from a country whose beauty is as breathtaking as its vulnerability. Our ancestors refer to our islands as ‘jolet jen Anij’ or ‘Gifts from God’. Midway between Australia and the United States, the Marshall Islands comprises more than 1 000 islands dotted within 29 different atoll chains, often no wider than a road. While our territory, mostly ocean, is vast, our population is about 50 000 – far smaller than this beautiful city.  It would seem that my country and yours could hardly be further apart or more different but there is much that we have in common. On a personal level, some of my ancestry is European, German to be specific. On a national level, we are strongly committed to liberal democracy, to human rights and the rule of law. Like the European Union, my country also believes deeply in a multilateral approach to solving global problems. The gravest of these is the battle against climate change. We are all vulnerable to climate impact. No one can escape, but the Marshall Islands is on the front-line. Wherever you stand in my country you see the ocean. With an average elevation of two metres above sea level, we have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. King tides and droughts have become more regular and frequent with disaster often hitting us in different ways in different parts of the country at the same time. One of my first acts as President was to declare a state of disaster because of an unseasonal and prolonged drought. We had less than three weeks of fresh water left. At the very same time we were on high alert for widespread inundation. The drought lasted seven months and cost us nearly EUR 3.5 million. The year before that, a typhoon wiped away more than 3% of our economy and the year before, that many of our people were left homeless by a single king tide. Climate change is not a hoax. This is what the everyday struggle against climate change looks like. For us and our Pacific island cousins the ocean that has been our lifeblood risks becoming the cause of our nightmares and through no fault of ours. Unless the world keeps its promise to pursue efforts to limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius my country and others like Tuvalu and Kiribati risk becoming completely uninhabitable before the century ends.  But the current geopolitical situation would seem to make achieving the 1.5°C limit more challenging than this time last year. In the 18 months or so since the historic Paris Agreement was reached the world seems to have been turned upside-down more than once. The leader of the world’s largest historical contributor to climate change has announced that he wants to leave the Paris Agreement. In my view, that decision was, at best, misguided. It was also disappointing and confusing for those of us that have long believed in the importance of US global leadership. This is particularly so for my country, a long-time committed ally and friend. In the coming three years before the US can legally withdraw, we all have a duty to work together to convince President Trump of the importance of climate action. We have compelling arguments and evidence to help change hearts and minds. Because of that, I am cautiously optimistic and so are my people. I have come here today to explain why and to ask for your help. The Paris Agreement that we all fought so hard to achieve is a balanced, fair and durable agreement. It is a ringing endorsement of multilateralism. It will stand the test of time. The Agreement gives countries flexibility to determine their own contributions towards fighting climate change in the context of collective science-based goals. The Agreement will bring countries together every five years to take stock of progress towards achieving those goals with a view to raising ambition. The Agreement provides for transparency and accountability and sets out provisions relating to means of implementation, adaptation, and loss and damage. Importantly, the Agreement recognises that the national circumstances of countries must be considered in its implementation. It took us well over 20 years to achieve the Paris Agreement. We cannot do better and we do not have the luxury of more time. The Agreement is not open to renegotiation. Almost 150 countries have now joined the Agreement; some 50, including more than a quarter of the G20 since the US election. No one else is walking away. In fact, they are doing the opposite. Some have joined in the last few days. I have been overwhelmed in recent weeks by the widespread global support and commitment to the Paris Agreement, including leaders, governments, cities, regions and business community and individuals. I commend Italy for its climate leadership in the G7 and expect no less of Germany in the G20. Such collective acts of leadership are critical and must not fall by the wayside. Apart from the moral case for climate action, the economic case is undeniable. A recent OECD report highlights in no uncertain terms that any delay in climate action is bad for the economy. Growing numbers of decision-makers at all levels see this. Real world climate action is accelerating and exceeding national targets.  Who could have predicted only a few years ago that renewable energy would increasingly be the cheapest option? Climate action simply makes sense at every level. This realisation is resulting in new countries emerging as climate champions, including India and China.  We are also seeing countries coming together to find new ways to push the boundaries of climate ambition. The High Ambition Coalition, which my country established with the European Union and others, was key to reaching the deal in Paris. That Coalition, which bridges traditional economic and geo-political divides is now working towards the full implementation of the Paris Agreement and the creation of the political space needed for deeper and faster climate action. In September next year my country will take over leadership of the Climate Vulnerable Forum – a group of 48 developing countries that has pledged to go 100% renewable by 2050. If we can do that, so can you! At the sub-national level we are seeing an unstoppable groundswell of collective commitment to climate action. Initiatives include the Under2 Coalition, the 2050 Platform, Mission 2020, the C40 Group of Cities and the We Mean Business Coalition. Statements of commitment from US states, cities and businesses in the last week is to be welcomed and so is the direct engagement of European nations with them.  As the UN Secretary-General recently said, the climate action train has truly left the station. But for a country like mine, there is an urgent time imperative. A cost effective path to achieving the 1.5°C limit requires peaking global emissions before 2020 and a rapid acceleration of climate action before 2020 so as to set the world towards net-zero emissions in the second half of this century. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has confirmed this rapid decarbonisation is possible but requires unprecedented levels of leadership. So once again the world is looking to Europe. Thankfully you have a good track record. From the Kyoto Protocol and delivering on its implementation to securing the Durban mandate that led to the Paris Agreement, and ensuring the success of Paris itself, including bringing it into force in record time, Europe has been at the centre of it all. Indeed, in Paris, it was the Marshall Islands and the European Union that marched arm-in-arm with others into the historic or final plenary. With that in mind, I pay tribute to President Juncker, Commissioner Arias Cañete and other European leaders and ministers over the years for their commitment. They are true climate warriors, as are many of you who grace this Chamber and others around the world. Domestically, Europe is demonstrating that economic growth and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases are both possible and mutually reinforcing. Your ground-breaking legislation and policies are being emulated by others around the world. Leadership must increasingly be about implementation. You are turning rhetoric into reality and beginning to put in place what is needed to deliver on your Paris promises. The EU and its Member States together provide about 40% of all global public climate finance. The EU is also the biggest provider of technical climate assistance to developing countries. An important example is the MPC partnership. In my country EU support has on its own helped solarise more than 90% of our outer islands. Every penny is being put to good use. For all of this, I say thank you for your leadership and for your example. Going forwards, what must climate leadership from Europe look like? First, Europe must urgently communicate a 2050 strategy to reduce emissions, consistent with the 1.5°C limit and net-zero emissions in the second half of this century. I have already committed my country to doing so. Second, in 2018 the world will come together to consider progress and inform countries in coming forward with new or revised Nationally Determined Contributions in 2020. The EU must approach this dialogue open to the possibility of raising its ambition as a result. We will not stay within 1.5°C unless Europe and others move before 2020 to raise ambition. So I am pleased to see President Macron has already committed France to doing even more and I welcome similar statements by Prime Minister Modi of India and others. This is exactly the race to the top we need. The 2018 dialogue, together with the climate action summit which California plans to host next September and the UN Secretary-General’s climate summit of world leaders in 2019 are the three biggest political moments we have before the end of this decade to push the cause of increased climate ambition. Europe must be at the centre of these, working with countries and others around the world to ensure further and faster climate action by all. Third, I urge you to move to five-year international targets. Ten-year targets risk lacking in low ambition and are less responsive to the latest science and technological developments.  Fourth, the European Union must continue to push ambitious climate action in all relevant fora and sectors, including on shipping emissions and ensuring environmental integrity in reducing aviation emissions. It will also be important to push for the Kigali amendment on HFCs to enter into force as soon as possible. My country has already ratified the amendment. I acknowledge the sustained leadership of the Federative States of Micronesia to this important cause. The EU must also lead the world in mainstreaming climate action to deliver the sustainable development goals including in relation to oceans. I pay tribute to our Pacific cousins from Fiji, as well as to Sweden for their leadership. All Pacific islands are also extremely proud that Fiji will represent us when it leads the world at COP 23, the first island climate summit. Finally, ongoing leadership of the EU on climate finance, in particular for the most vulnerable countries, will be critical. Support for implementation by developing countries is a crucial part of the Paris Agreement. Sadly, the US decision to stop Green Climate Fund (GCF) funding presents a problem and one we hope the EU and its allies can address.  Bilateral assistance will also continue to be viable for countries like mine. An even greater focus by the EU on the Pacific region is urgently needed.  In concluding, I note that some people, maybe even some in this room, think that it is impossible to achieve the goals we agreed in Paris; that is to say that my country cannot be saved. It is impossible to explain how it feels as the leader of my people to see reports or commentaries that apparently forecasts the oblivion of our home land, our ‘jolet jen Anij’.  I have seen and experienced the forced relocation and migration of my fellow citizens to other parts of the Marshall Islands and beyond as a consequence of the testing of nuclear weapons. So, the responsibility my generation has to leave to our children, and to their children and grandchildren, the Marshall Islands as a secure place to call home weighs heavily. Failure is not an option. As our young climate warriors eloquently put it ‘we are not drowning, we are fighting’. I think I speak for all of my Pacific sisters and brothers when I say that. By working together, the Marshall Islands, the European Union and many others have achieved the impossible before and we will achieve it again because we must. For your leadership, past, present and future, I say ‘Kommooltata’ – thank you very much!

The announcement is in line with previous actions on environmental regulation by the new US Administration, such as the rolling-back of existing climate programmes and the weakening of international climate commitments. The decision to withdraw has been taken in the face of many convincing arguments in support of the new international framework and its architecture that have been voiced by the international community, businesses and other stakeholders. Unfortunately, at this point the details of the US approach are still unclear.  However, what has become evident now is the fact that the US withdrawal adds to the global responsibility held by the European Union as the key supporter of a rules-based multilateral system. Let me stress here that the EU is committed to leading with ambitious climate policies and through our committed support for the poor and the vulnerable. The Paris Agreement is fit for purpose. It is ambitious, yet not prescriptive. With its flexible architecture it constitutes an international framework which encourages countries to widen the array of options contributing to the goals of preventing climate change, which threatens global development, peace and stability. Therefore the Council is committed to ensuring that the EU significantly contributes to the optimalisation of the Paris Agreement and to the design of all the elements of the Paris outcome. Our goal should be to minimise the consequences of the US decision on the effectiveness and credibility of the climate framework. The EU will also continue to support the convergence between intergovernmental negotiations and the implementation agenda. This includes conversion of countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions goals into concrete policies and actions.  The Council is continuing its work on the completion of the internal legislative and regulatory framework of the Union, which is necessary to deliver our Paris target of reducing economy—wide emissions by at least 40% by 2030. On 19 June the Environmental Council will hold an exchange of views on the effort-sharing and the land-use change and forestry emissions proposals. We hope to swiftly finalise the Council’s position and to start our interinstitutional negotiations as soon as possible. The EU position following President Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the COP 21 climate agreement will also be discussed during the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 19 June.

Thanks to the negotiations, and in particular to the chief negotiator of the European Union, my good friend Miguel Cañete, a historic deal was made. The world agreed to save its one and only home. Doing justice to its traditional name, ‘gifts from God’, the Marshall Islands took action, becoming one of the first to ratify the Paris Agreement. The testimony of President Heine is a reminder of the need for action. It is a matter of survival. Here is a fact: every morning, international datelines set that the day begins at the Marshall Islands. President Heine, we will work to help your country continue to mark the beginning of our days. We will not allow the denial of the very few to be the end of the days of the Marshall Islands.  Unfortunately, not everyone in the world sees the truth of the facts. The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is more than a sad event; it is a sign of abdication from common action in dealing with the fate of our planet. We are disappointed and we regret that decision, but the abandonment of Paris by the US Administration will not mean the end of the Agreement. I am convinced that it will make the rest of the world more united and determined to work towards the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. The European Union will not renegotiate the Paris Agreement.  (Applause) The 29 articles of the Agreement must be implemented and not renegotiated. Climate action does not need more distractions. We have spent 20 years negotiating; now is the time for action and now is the time for implementation.  I see a strengthened resolve from all those who care about the future of the planet and who see the opportunities of a modern economy. This includes partners within the United States, such as the states of California, Washington, New York, which, taken together, would be the world’s fourth economy. As the European Union, we will step up our climate diplomacy and collaboration with other partners. For example, climate action was a key topic of the EU-China Summit on 2 June. In September, Miguel Cañete will co-host a major gathering with his Chinese and Canadian counterparts to implement the Paris Agreement and accelerate the clean energy transition. We are also reaching out to our partners in the African Union and the ACP countries. We adopted joint statements expressing our common resolve and we will work hard to have a clear message coming out of the G20 Summit, or at least from 19 of its members, in July. In Paris, the world committed to helping vulnerable countries adapt to the consequences of climate change. The decision of the US to go back on its pledge to the Green Climate Fund leaves a major void. From our side, we stand firm to our commitments and we will work with third countries to mobilise the right public and private investments.  You can count on the efforts of the Commission to keep the momentum going on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In return, we hope to count on your support to make the European Union’s commitments a reality and make swift progress on all Commission proposals related to that goal. When we ratified the Paris Agreement in record time, this House showed its commitment to climate action. We need to keep the same spirit, more than ever.

For us it is just as clear: Change is coming, it will be great, it will be dramatic, and the only question that remains is how much we can limit it with joint efforts. As Europeans, we can be proud that we were the driving force with others, that we went ahead and made the Paris Treaty possible in the first place. The Europeans will therefore not accept America's exit and will not follow it. The emotional question that arises is: How do you react to it? At first, of course, with a little frustration with developments in the United States. But then, if you think about it for a few seconds, all the more decisiveness that emerges - because of the responsibility for the following generations and also because of the knowledge that the issue of climate change will also trigger a modernization boost for our economy. Even American corporations like Exxon are in favor of not giving up the climate targets, because they recognize that there is also a great opportunity in them if we tackle the economy to initiate this change. Donald Trump negates the facts, Donald Trump decides against the will of his own US citizens, Donald Trump will not create any new jobs with these developments, with this decision. And that's why Donald Trump commits with this decision a big, historical mistake.America First is selfishness.America First is related to breaking relationships.Perhaps we should counter this with a “Europe First”.\"Europe First\" is the approach of partnership, of togetherness, of wanting to solve problems together.In this respect, Europe needs less “America First” and more “Europe First”.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 52, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Heine, thank you first of all.

It is myopic and it is totally irresponsible.  It is made even more contemptible by the fact that we now know that he has decided that climate change is real. He has stopped his denying of it. He says it is real and indeed his ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has confirmed that for us. So that makes his decision even more contemptible. He is not even pretending any more that he does not believe in climate change.  We can also see that he has a complete misunderstanding of the Paris Agreement and what the US’s obligations are under that Agreement. He seems to think that it will be giving US industry an extremely unfair position and totally ignoring the fact that actually it gives the US a huge amount of flexibility in how they deal with making sure that they stand up for their obligations.  And given the modest commitments that the US is being asked to make – let us face it, for many people what the US is being asked under Paris is actually still way underperforming Europe and many of the Member States in Europe – it seems even more the case that ‘the Donald’ should be asked exactly where he gets his information and his advice from, because with higher per capita emissions than the world average, the US has a moral duty to significantly reduce its emissions and ensure that global average temperatures remain below 2 degrees C.

Climate change sceptics in the UK also threaten European global protection. The British elections delivered a disastrous result for our Prime Minister, and Ms May battles on – she has appointed a new Environment Secretary, Mr Michael Gove. Gove has a shocking record. When he was Education Secretary, Gove wanted to get climate change off the school curriculums. He voted to sell off all of England’s publicly-owned and protected forests and woodlands. He has voted 12 times against measures to prevent climate change, including opposing limits on greenhouse gas emissions. He supports fracking and he supports drilling in national parks. He has opposed refitting homes to stop carbon loss. To quote a past colleague of this House, Caroline Lucas, who is now an MP: ‘Michael Gove is an environmental disaster waiting to happen’. During the Brexit referendum campaign, Gove stated that he had enough of experts. Well, frankly, the experts and the public have had enough of him, too, just as they have had of President Trump. Colleagues, please be tough during the Brexit negotiations when it comes to the environment, as you will be with Mr Trump. Climate deniers like Gove need to know they have international treaty commitments that they cannot evade. He will try to slip and slide on environmental agreements. So, given the election results last week, it remains to be seen whether the UK will actually leave the EU. But if we do, the UK, just like the US, must fulfil its international environmental obligations. Environmental challenges do not stop at borders.

I can only assure you that we Greens will continue to work to ensure that we do more to combat climate change, and I am delighted that many colleagues who have already spoken today have also said: Yes, they support the Parisian Deal, and they find Trump's decision wrong. But it is not enough to criticize Trump and then see ourselves on the moral high ground and say: We are better off. No! The objectives that we have set so far and that the Commission have adopted here are based on an optimistic scenario. They won't guarantee us that we won't even be two degrees. But that's not enough for islands like President Heine's. We have to stay below two degrees. We should aim for a maximum of 1.5 degrees - only then will these many islands have a chance to survive.

Then we cannot say: Yes, Trump did not want to more.But we have to increase our own share - we here in Parliament, but also the governments.When I see how, for example, the federal government in Germany always poses for a family picture in front of the glacier, but at the same time accommodates the biggest polluters by issuing CO2 certificates or stands in the way of the tough CO2 standards for cars, then gojust not together.That doesn't fit with Europe's leadership role, and that doesn't fit with the fight against climate change.We really have a chance to create good new jobs with real prospects for the future with the fight, with energy efficiency and with renewable energies.It's all down to political courage - we have to muster that.The planet does not wait for us, it can also without us - but we not without it and we not without a tolerable climate.We can do it - we just have to want it, I think of that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  The President of the Marshall Islands and I are leaving the plenary.

The best answer we can give is, first of all, to confirm that we will not renegotiate the Paris Agreement and that we will make all the efforts needed to provide the political momentum behind the Paris implementation. The implementation of the Paris Agreement domestically requires that this House gives full support in moving ahead on making the European Union’s commitment a reality.  The European Union is showing the world the way with our cutting-edge climate policy and there is no stronger statement we can make than swift progress on the ETS, the effort-sharing regulation, the land-use legislation as well as on the Clean Energy for all European Package. When we ratified the Paris Agreement in record time this House showed its commitment to climate action and we need to provide the same spirit now, more than ever. Internationally we will have to implement the Paris Agreement by working closely with all our allies with ambition and determination. And as Ms Van Brempt and some others clearly stated, we have to keep working with the United States, which is much more than the Federal Government. In the United States the decision to withdraw also strengthened the resolve of those who care for the future of the planet and who understand the economic opportunities of a low-carbon transition. Hundreds of United States mayors, governors, state attorneys-general, CEOs and others pledged to the United Nations to achieve and eventually exceed America’s commitment to the Paris Agreement in a declaration entitled ‘We Are Still In’ and they will submit a Societal Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations, aggregating action by different stakeholders and building upon the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.  The states of California, Washington and New York founded the United States Climate Alliance, now joined by nine other states. So it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the United States even if the Federal Government decides to stay on the side of the road. We will also step up our climate diplomacy. Climate action was a key topic of the European Union-China Summit on 2 June and our cooperation on the ground with China is stepping up a gear. In September the European Union will host a major ministerial gathering with ministers here from China and Minister McKenna from Canada to advance in the implementation of Paris and accelerate their transition. Finally, my last remark to his House is that the world’s reaction to President Trump’s action proved that the European Union is on the right side of history. Our task ahead is clear.

It is an honor and a pleasure for me to receive you today in Strasbourg. A month ago, dear President, we received Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, the Chairman of the African Union Commission. Your visit is therefore part of the rapprochement and strengthening of our partnership with, on the one hand, the African Union and, on the other, the Member States that make it up. I would like to salute the extraordinary work you have done in your country: coming out of a civil war, strengthening institutions and the rule of law, straightening, energizing and diversifying the economy by creating an industrial base, and improving indicators social. The Ivory Coast ranks among the fastest growing economies in the world, with an estimate of 8% this year. It can and should serve as an example for other countries on the African continent, particularly in West Africa. However, many things remain to be done: the fight against poverty, infrastructure, education, health, access to drinking water and even electricity. Please know that we do not forget that the Ivory Coast, like Europe, has been hit by terrorist attacks, especially in Grand-Bassam. This is a scourge we cannot solve on our own. We must cooperate in this area, with the help of regional organizations, such as ECOWAS or the African Union. Europe and Africa also share the same challenge on the management of migratory flows. We must act at the root of the problem by investing more and better in the framework of real economic diplomacy to create growth and jobs. The arrival this morning of the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands reminds us of the importance of taking action for sustainable development and the climate. Ivory Coast is also suffering the effects of climate change, with drought, floods and even coastal erosion.In addition, youth and employment, peace, security, human rights and even crisis management are concrete areas that we will no doubt be dealing with at the end of November in your country, in Abidjan., during the Africa-European Union summit.Mr. President, your presence here is very important and we look forward to having you with us today.Know, Mr. President, that we want to look at Africa with African glasses and not European ones.That is why our cooperation is and will be crucial for peace, for stability, for the commitment against terrorism, against illegal immigration and against climate change.Mr. Speaker, once again, thank you very much.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "President of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire. - Mr President of the European Parliament, dear Antonio Tajani, Ladies and Gentlemen of the European Parliament, first of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity you have given me to speak this morning in front of the European Parliament meeting in session plenary. It is an honor and a privilege for me, for my country, to be here because, you who are the elected representatives of more than 500 million European citizens, you constitute, because of your cultural diversity, your political commitments as well as your great experience, an exceptional and prestigious audience. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to discuss with you the major challenges that Africa must meet in the coming decades. I will then tell you about my country, Côte d'Ivoire, which is on the path to emergence, as you know. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, on March 25, 2017, the European Union celebrated, in the Eternal City, the sixtieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome. These treaties established the furrows of active solidarity between nations once at war. The founding fathers of the Treaty of Rome had the ingenious idea of ​​pooling resources and intelligence in the service of building an area of ​​shared peace, security and prosperity. Europe is in this a source of inspiration for the world, and more particularly for the African continent. At a time when, unfortunately, a withdrawal of identity is observed in several regions of the world, I am convinced that here, in this noble assembly, you will be able to draw from yourselves the energy necessary to pursue the spirit of solidarity, openness and peace advocated by your predecessors. This conviction is based on the fact that since its creation, the European Union has not ceased to communicate to humanity its unshakeable faith in a world of peace, stability and progress. The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to you in 2012, is of course a remarkable illustration of this. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the future of humanity will depend on the policies, actions and programs that we define together, in our countries, our continents and on a global scale. In other words, the world will become what we want it to be. In this regard, I would like to address today three major challenges which will have a significant impact on the future of our planet and on relations between Europe and Africa. I know that the President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, raised the issue of peace and security with you, so I would not want to repeat it. The three challenges I would like to talk about relate to global warming, migratory flows and population expansion. I will start with global warming. On December 12, 2015, world leaders gathered in Paris to adopt a landmark climate accord. This agreement, which has been ratified by the vast majority of States, including Côte d'Ivoire (which has already deposited the instruments of ratification at the UN), constitutes for our planet a unique opportunity to contain the global warming within reasonable limits. Now more than ever, it is urgent to implement this agreement, so that the harmful effects of global warming on people and the ecosystem are contained. In this regard, Europe, as it has always been in the face of major global challenges, can show the way. Europe must, in particular, continue to mobilize the opinions, funding and technologies essential for the energy transition so that the Paris Agreement is irreversible. Yes, the Paris Agreement gave us a historic opportunity, now we have to make it happen. Today, as I speak to you, torrential rains, which are the consequences climatic disturbances are causing significant damage in several regions of my country. Likewise, many regions in Africa are facing waves of drought of unprecedented magnitude, which are causing death and desolation in several communities and causing massive displacement of populations. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would therefore like to encourage you to continue to make the climate a priority, so that the tragedies we are seeing around the world stop. There are indeed several possibilities to continue to chart paths towards green growth that uses little CO2. These possibilities include sound management of natural resources and ecosystems while harnessing their value for economic development. Together, we need to foster resilience within communities by reducing all forms of discrimination, especially against women. We must all work to put in place policies for the more efficient and fairer redistribution of wealth. Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the second challenge that I would like to address and which our planet is facing is that of unregulated migratory flows and the employment of young people. At the Valletta Migration Summit in November 2015, I told the participating Heads of State that the dramatic events which are causing the deaths of thousands of people in the waters of the Mediterranean and in the Sahel require more solidarity and consultation between Europe and Africa. To do this, we must act over time and on all of the factors causing this situation. In this regard, it is urgent to restore peace and security in the Sahel-Saharan strip and to encourage a consensual political solution to the conflict in Libya. However, it must be recognized that conflicts and organized crime alone do not explain the movements migration to Europe observed in recent years. To these factors must be added poverty, I would even say misery, unemployment and the lack of democracy in many countries. This is why, on Monday June 12, 2017, during the G20 conference in Berlin on a partnership with Africa, we suggested the establishment of a plan that would aim to facilitate massive investments in Africa by with a view to creating jobs, especially for young people. This will help reduce illegal migration flows to Europe. Given the German Chancellor's commitment to this noble cause and the importance of this prospect, many of us have suggested that this plan could be called the \"Merkel Plan.\" We have noted, however, that intra-African migratory movements are significantly higher in number than those observed between Africa and Europe. For example, the Ivory Coast hosts nearly 5.5 million foreign nationals on its territory, representing a proportion of 26% of its total population of around 24 million. Transfers from this African diaspora to its countries of origin represent nearly 1% of Côte d'Ivoire's GDP each year. This is to say how much Ivorian hospitality and generosity make a good contribution to the development of neighboring countries. (Applause) My country will continue to show solidarity with all these populations. It is therefore important that it be supported so that it continues to create jobs that allow it to remain a land of welcome and hospitality. Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, this African youth who are tempted by the European adventure is often the victim of mafia networks and terrorist organizations which feed on their vulnerability and their frustrations. We must therefore act towards these young people by educating them, by informing them and making them realize that they are better off in Africa than elsewhere. They must also be treated with respect for their dignity. We must keep in mind article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948 in Paris, at the Palais de Chaillot, I quote: “All human beings are born. free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and must act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. ” It is in this spirit of openness to cooperation on many issues of global interest that Côte d'Ivoire will exercise its mandate within the United Nations Security Council for the period 2018-2019. In this regard, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all your countries for the massive support you have given us on the occasion of our election to the United Nations Security Council. This mandate, which will begin on January 1, will be placed under the sign of peace, which Ivorians have established as a second religion. Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the last challenge I would like to mention is that of population expansion. According to projections by the United Nations Population Division, the world population, which is approximately 7.4 billion people today, including 1.2 billion Africans, will exceed 10 billion by 2056. In this whole Africa will experience the strongest growth, which will account for 50% of global population growth by 2050. This will allow Africa to catch up with the populations of more developed regions, such as North America and Africa. Europe. Nigeria will become, in 2050, the fifth most populous country, ahead of Brazil, the United States, Indonesia and Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia will replace Russia and Mexico in the list of ten countries most populous in the world. In other words, what will be the place of these three great countries at the global level in a few decades. This strong growth will be even more pronounced for working-age populations. Indeed, the active population in sub-Saharan Africa will increase from 518 million people today to 1.3 billion in 2050. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Africa, cradle of humanity, will continue, paradoxically, to be the youngest region in the world until the end of this century. This observation challenges all African leaders, but also leaders around the world. Indeed, the stability of Africa, but also that of the rest of the world, will depend on how the issue of youth is dealt with in the coming decades. Taking demographic expansion into account in development programs will require special emphasis on human capital, including education, health and vocational training. Massive investments will also need to be made in infrastructure, including major sub-regional projects, transport, electricity, education and health. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to tell you about the progress made by my country, Côte d'Ivoire, which, after more than a decade of crisis, is at peace today. It has also returned to economic growth. This progress is first and foremost the result of the mobilization and determination of Ivorians. They have also been made possible by the significant technical and financial contribution of our partners in the European Union, notably in the areas of governance, agriculture and energy. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to greet and warmly thank the European Union for its accompaniment and support. Partnership with the international community, and particularly the European Union, enabled Côte d'Ivoire to achieve exceptional performances. Over the past six years, the economy's average growth rate has been 9% per year. Projections for the period 2017-2020 are around 7-8% per year. The inflation rate was contained below 2% thanks to the peg to the euro, and the budget deficit was brought under control at around 3% of GDP. This year, of course, the situation is a little different, due to the drastic drop, almost 40% since the beginning of the year, in the price of cocoa, of which we are the world's largest producer. Nevertheless, we will continue to make efforts to master the macroeconomic framework. Côte d'Ivoire remains the world's largest producer of cocoa and cashew nuts. We are also the largest African producer of palm oil and rubber. Côte d'Ivoire is one of the top reformers in the World Bank's Doing Business ranking. In the energy sector, Côte d'Ivoire is on its way to becoming an energy hub in West Africa, with a capacity of 2,000 MW in 2016, which will increase to 4,000 MW in 2020. Today , Côte d'Ivoire has one of the most dense and diversified infrastructure networks in Africa, thanks to its roads, ports and airports. Finally, Côte d'Ivoire has made significant progress in the area of ​​security reform, including disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants, a program to which the European Union has successfully contributed. Recent events do not call into question this good development because, today, the safety index is at the same level as in Geneva or New York. These reforms will continue and intensify in order to provide the Ivory Coast with defense and security forces that can contribute to peacekeeping operations. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen MEPs, a few years away from the expiry, in 2020, of the Cotonou partnership agreement and at a time when we have to reflect on a new agreement between Africa and Europe, I would like to suggest some ideas that are inspire exemplary relations that Côte d'Ivoire has maintained with the European Union. These relations must be frank, based on mutual trust and, of course, on national ownership. They should use flexible financing instruments and take into account national management and control mechanisms, which could be strengthened if necessary. Of course, we will have the opportunity to discuss these issues of great importance to my country in more depth. In conclusion, I would like to invite all the countries that you represent to take part in the next European Union-Africa summit, which will be held next November in Abidjan. This important meeting, which will take place in the pure tradition of Ivorian hospitality, will be an opportunity to discuss the international cooperation necessary to respond to the new challenges facing humanity, particularly issues related to youth and development. Mr President, I would like to thank you again. Ladies and Gentlemen, I say a big thank you, and I thank President Antonio Tajani for his invitation. I am impressed by your warm welcome and by your important participation, which gave me the opportunity to present to you the challenges we face, not only in Côte d'Ivoire, but also throughout the African continent, and of you talk about the evolution of Côte d'Ivoire. Thank you. Thank you to each and every one of you.

Secondly, Serbia wants to have two mothers: one the EU, and the other – stepmother – Russia.

The problem is, of course, that if Serbian foreign policy can be blackmailed by Russia through energy, the EU would be blackmailed as well.  I believe the enlargement is needed.

Instead, we see the first signs of a European spring, not summer yet, but after years marked by tensions and discontent there is a breeze of optimism, expectation and hope in the air. Who did not feel the excitement when President Macron met with Trump and Putin and represented a self-confident and proud Europe? And colleagues, who did not feel proud when we voted today on our commitment to the Paris climate agreement, making Europe the world leader where others withdraw?  Values are the key to the refoundation of the European Union. Election campaigns in recent years focused not just on traditional material issues of jobs and social security, but very much on values, culture and identity. The world order is changing at a breath-taking speed, and people are worried and anxious about loss of identity and loss of community. Nationalist parties have responded by sowing distrust, hatred and fear, or by promising to go back to an imaginary past. We reject that, but we have to recognise that our own response to the clear questions on values, identity and culture have not been adequate. The European Union is a deeply political union, but most politicians are wary of explaining this to their voters. They prefer to present the European Union as a technocratic entity that can be summed up in terms of economic benefits or costs.  If people are worried about loss of identity, abolishing roaming charges will not reassure them. If they are afraid their culture is threatened, cutting red tape will not allay their fears. If they are unsure about the shared values of our community, they will not find comfort in trade agreements, but we should not leave the monopoly of defining our shared values and our identity to the nationalists. In these current times of great uncertainty, insecurity and societal turbulence, it is not easy to defend our shared values; but we have not defined our shared values for fair-weather conditions only. It is when conditions are rough that our convictions are put to test. The European Union is not only an economic powerhouse, but it has great moral authority in the world. We can be proud. Our values have inspired many around the world, and many people dream of living in the kind of free, fair, stable and democratic society we have in Europe, so much so that others see our values as a threat, something they seek to destroy.  Populist parties worldwide have an agenda based on nationalism, xenophobia, homophobia and sexism. They agitate against secularism and parliamentary democracy and above all they reject pluralism. They claim there is one people, one voice, one truth only, but clearly recent elections have proved them wrong. Europeans will not be reduced to a one-dimensional caricature. If we wish to make Europe strong we must therefore promote the opposite and embrace European integration, diversity, equality, pluralism.  And against that backdrop, I think the tweet last week by Manfred Weber, who unfortunately is not here, was a bit misguided when he wrote that: ‘Europe’s identity is above all Christian. Anyone who denies this is denying reality’. But, dear colleague Weber, the reality is that the true soul of Europe lies in its diversity and the freedom to choose what to believe, and who you are.  Democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are not just ideals: they are essential for the functioning of the European Union in all policy areas. Social justice is a precondition for a stable climate for investment and development. Respect for fundamental rights is vital for common migration policies and police cooperation, and the rule of law is absolutely essential for the internal market and investor confidence. In short, values are the key to a strong European Union, and that is why the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe puts values first.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Sophia IN 'T VELD", "mepid": "28266", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak today in this timely topical debate. This is indeed a time of deep reflection for all of us on the future of the EU. I am happy to be here today to listen to your views.  The title of this debate paints the picture of an EU which appeals to us all, one in which our values are placed at centre stage. One with effective and democratic institutions, one in which we pursue our genuine goal of improving the life and prosperity of our citizens, not just for the lucky few but across all of our society. This description is not such a far cry from the EU we have today and it certainly is in line with the EU’s clear ambitions. However, until only a few months ago, the EU’s efforts in this regard were largely ignored or discredited, either because the EU was perceived as doing too little or because it was seen as doing too much. But in recent months there seems to have been a shift in perception of the EU: rather than being considered as the source of many of our woes, the EU is seen as part of the solution.  We are seeing some positive signs of renewed trust and more support for the EU. This may be because as the world around us changes, the alternative options to the EU are slowly losing their shine. We may start realising that populist rhetoric oversimplifies very complex issues and is beginning to show its limitations. We may also be recognising that working together on global challenges like trade, climate and terrorism is preferable to going it alone.  Perhaps most importantly, the more we feel our values come under attack, the stronger our wish to uphold them. This should serve to fuel our prospects and indeed give us an impetus to work even more eagerly towards our goals.  However, only with a common vision of the EU’s future can we collectively pursue these common goals. In examining what future path to take, the EU cannot impose its vision on its citizens. It cannot come up with revolutionary designs if it does not have their support and backing. The EU needs to involve them in this debate. They need to feel that they are being heard and that their views matter.  That is why the Council very much welcomes the Commission’s White Paper process. It is a remarkable effort to steer an honest reflection and prompt a broad debate. I also commend you, the European Parliament, for your constant efforts to ensure that the views of citizens are safeguarded and upheld. I understand that, along with the Commission, you will be hosting a series of Future of Europe debates across Europe. As for the Council and the European Council, as you know, leaders already began an honest reflection exercise after the UK referendum vote to leave the EU. At their informal meeting in Bratislava last September, leaders set out a concrete roadmap with specific measures to address the most pressing concerns for citizens. This included tackling as a matter of urgency issues relating to migration, terrorism and economic and social insecurity. As work progressed on that front, the 60th anniversary of the Rome Treaties in March this year was another occasion to reflect on our common future. The Rome Agenda that resulted from this is a clear pledge to pursue our most important objectives over the next ten years. The European Council has since then framed its work across these main priorities. It has focused largely on delivering tangible results and delivering on its promises. Looking forward in relation to the White Paper process, the Council is taking careful note of the Commission’s follow-up papers and is ensuring that they provide a valuable contribution to our discussions. So for instance the white paper on globalisation provides perspectives for a debate on trade or on globalisation at the next European Council.  I would just like to say one word on the concrete result of this process. Reflecting on the future of Europe is a drawn-out process. It requires time and building trust, neither of which can be rapidly glossed over. We do not want to run the risk of having to offer results prematurely and thus falling short of expectations. The Council and the European Council will continue to focus on achieving concrete results, demonstrating that added value of the EU in very practical terms. In that spirit, the Future of Europe debates will provide further impetus for the Council to deliver on various key policies, rather than develop a new theoretical frame.

She also dismissed the solutions offered by nationalists, extremists and xenophobes, but then the question remains: why do so many Europeans still feel attracted to these political movements? I maintain that these political movements have assured quite strong support in the European Union and will probably continue to get quite strong support unless we address the reasons why they feel attracted to these movements. I believe many of our citizens are worried because they fear a loss of position. This is the first generation that fears that their children might be in a worse position than they are. They are worried because of the threat of Jihadist terrorism and see that some people want to attack our freedoms and take away our identities. They are worried because they see global developments in terms of peace and security, where they do not feel empowered enough to stand up for their values and their way of life.  So I think that, if we want to rekindle the feeling for our fundamental values, we need to do something about these fears, and the Commission’s starting point is that we can only do something about these fears if we stand together as Europeans. So rekindling our values starts with advocating European approaches to European problems, European approaches to global problems, and with making clear to our citizens that we can only do this if we stick together. This is difficult at a time where identity politics roam across Europe. This is difficult at a time when the other is presented as an adversary, and as somebody who is out there to take away what you have. If we redefine the European Union only in terms of an internal market or a common currency and present these, or the cutting of red tape or whatever you want, as the goals of our cooperation – these are important instruments, but they only have meaning if they are based on our common values, and we do not talk enough about these values.  The interesting thing is that the people who Mrs in 't Veld was, rightly, attacking because of their lack of solutions and the, to say the least, wobbly morality of their propositions, do have a moral approach to it. They start from their values. We should mirror that by starting from our values, the values that have made Europe great: democracy, the rule of law and full respect for human rights. This is the tripod upon which our European cooperation is built, and modernising that in the fourth industrial revolution to show that we can create a society where diversity creates more ambition with people, creates more opportunity for people, and recreates the economy in the fourth industrial revolution, is the way forward for Europe. But it will only happen if it is done on the basis of our values.  That is the basis for the White Paper the Commission has written. That is the basis for all the analyses we have written, and we put them on the table as a starting point for debate with Parliament, but also with the Member States in the hope that the members of the Council will use the paper to have a debate in their Member States about where Europe needs to go in the future.  Let me end on this. We have seen a sort of moment of awakening of a new generation in Europe. We saw it in the British election the other day, we have seen it in the French election in many ways, and we see it in the women’s marches in the United States and across Europe. Why? Because we understand now that, although our values are clear and eternal and cannot be questioned, they can be destroyed. The fact that we have now discovered is that, although our values are clear and are the basis of our cooperation, we now see that across the world these values are not unbreakable but need maintenance and that, if you want these values to survive, you need to stand up for them. You need to speak out for them. That is what I saw in recent elections. This is no longer about left or right.

It has undoubtedly been the stage of greatest peace, prosperity and stability by eliminating all the divisions and violence of the past. The words of Robert Schuman still remain and are in force, when he said that Europe would not be made in one go or with a joint work, but that it would be done little by little, with small achievements that would cultivate the value of solidarity . At that time, the founding fathers were clear about the objective: they did not have plans to build Europe, but they had a very powerful rear view mirror with which they showed us who the horsemen of the European apocalypse were: nationalism, genocide, racism, xenophobia, wars, totalitarianism. Today, Europe has changed; has aged. We received more people, but we also fired others. The labor market has the face of unemployment, which is very worrying. There are challenges such as immigration, security, energy, the economy, defense ... It is a complex Europe and a Europe full of contrasts; we face the challenge of what the richness of diversity entails at the same time as the challenge of social integration. And today the challenge is to be united and the challenge is that we endow the values ​​of democracy, freedom and progress with true content, that content with which the fathers of Europe endowed them.

And so our spiritual building blocks are falling apart, and that means that the Union is doing very well in the event of non-compliance with the refugee distribution quota. The decisions we take at European Union level are simply not respected by some countries. That is why I also strongly welcome today's decision by the Commission to initiate legal proceedings against Member States that do not want to participate in the distribution of refugees. Yesterday we discussed the report on Serbia and Kosovo, countries in the EU waiting room. We strictly control what is happening there, we criticize compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. If the two countries do not meet, they will never be members. And that will probably be a fair punishment. However, is it still right and fair for the European Union to be judged on this, in which there are countries that no longer meet many of these criteria? And what will be their punishment? These and similar anomalies, which some calmly and even proudly indulge in, are neither democracy nor respect nor solidarity nor responsibility nor freedom but also order and justice and even less discipline.

First of all, the term \"refoundation\" is used, and it is clear that when a refoundation is requested it means that something has been destroyed. Here Europe has been destroyed by the policies imposed by the European Union. We use the term Europe and not the European Union, and it is time to make citizens understand that these are two different concepts: Europe is one thing, the European Union is another. Let's stop with this rhetoric and dismantle this \"there is no alternative\" rhetoric of those who want us to believe that the future of Europe can only be the European Union. Then three fundamental points are listed where the European Union has failed today: in values, because the treaties are based on completely wrong values; in guaranteeing democratic institutions, given that today most of the Union's institutions are not democratic, and the European Central Bank is an example of this; and finally in proposing a prosperous economy. It is clear that the European Union has failed in economic progress. The only way to refound Europe, in my opinion, is to abandon these treaties, which have failed, and refound Europe on egalitarian cooperation between sovereign states. This is the only way, because sooner or later the enormous conflict that exists between the social model proposed by the treaties and the social model proposed by the national constitutions will emerge. The treaties speak of competition, of the market, of profit, of commodity labor - a typical concept of the social model of the treaties which is gross German mercantilist liberalism. The Italian Constitution, for example, in the first articles, where its social model is expounded, speaks of work and job protection as a fundamental element of production. This is not happening in the European Union today.

But the crisis of the European project is essentially a crisis of values, which begins with the value of solidarity. If the value of solidarity does not hit the heart of the European ideal again, then there will be no solution to any of our problems.

As a teenager, I went to Spain. It was coming out of dictatorship, and as a young man coming from the Netherlands I was shocked to see the abject poverty in Spanish rural areas. Not just the poverty in economic terms; also the poverty in moral terms. Domestic violence was endemic. Children did not go to school, or very badly to school. Girls especially were not even encouraged to go to school. Then look at Spain today. Look at what has been achieved. Surely I am not claiming this for the European Union – it was the Spanish people who did that. But they could not have done that, I believe, in this measure without becoming members of the family of free European nations in the European Union. As a soldier, I was trained to fight the Eastern bloc. In 1989 the Wall came down, which is without any doubt the most important political event in my lifetime. At that time, Poland was in worse economic shape than Ukraine. Look at Poland today where it is. I think the economy is five or six times bigger than the Ukrainian economy. Surely I do not claim that as a result of the European Union – it is the Polish people who did that. But I am sure the European Union helped in achieving that, especially in terms of the rule of law. It is not just about the economy: it is about the independence of courts. It is about the predictability of jurisdiction, it is about the fight against corruption. So if people today say the European Union is just a big shambles and a mess, they must have been blind over the last 40 years. Let us not lose track of our historic achievements; that would be my first point. And if you know what we can achieve coming out of this crisis, where the number of jobs in Europe now is higher than ever before – I know we still have many things to overcome – but let us have a bit more self-confidence that we can overcome this. Look at what our parents and grandparents overcame. We can do so much better and so much more. We should not talk ourselves down in this. And let me stress this one thing. The values the European Union is based upon, enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty, have been signed and ratified by every single nation member of the EU, and yes, there are cultural differences and all sorts of differences. But Article 2 is binding on every single Member State and every single actor in that Member State, and you cannot get rid of that responsibility simply by arguing along cultural lines. I believe the reason why we talk about re-foundation today is because we have understood that our Union is not unbreakable. As long as you think it cannot be broken anyway, you do not care so much about fundamental values – they will be all right. But now that we see that our fundamental values are under threat, under fire, we know that we have to stand up for them and speak up for them more than ever before. I just want to say one thing about the Christian foundations of Europe, and I say this as a Christian. Yes, of course, Christianity has a huge role in how we developed our values, but I would feel very uncomfortable as a Christian, if another Christian claimed the copyrights on European values as exclusively Christian. We would not be here without the humanists, we would not be here without the Enlightenment. It was my own church that needed to be enlightened. The Spanish Inquisition was not invented by atheists, so let us all take responsibility for what we contributed. But let us respect the diversity and the fact that the sources of our values are manifold and cannot be claimed only by one denomination or one political vision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their valuable comments, of which obviously I have taken good note, and you can rest assured that reflection on the future of Europe will continue to be one of our top priorities.

Today, when stability or growth are lacking or threatened, in order to reacquire competitivity and growth under existing structures of European integration, the only way out is to restrain social conditions.

As you know, the fight against tax evasion, fraud and avoidance is a common EU goal that has been constantly highlighted by the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council and the Commission. Our Presidency has placed this issue amongst our top priorities for the Council’s agenda. To summarise our achievements in a nutshell, let me mention the following: the Council has completed work on Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2, as well as on defining criteria to establish a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. Agreement has also been reached on double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms. All these lost years represent important cornerstones of EU action in the area of fighting tax evasion, fraud and avoidance. Going into more detail as regards the particular pieces of legislation, let me stress that Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives 1 and 2 provide for a comprehensive framework of anti-abuse measures aimed at ensuring that taxation will occur where value is created. As a result, the anti-base erosion and profit-shifting measures which have also been given an impulse by the G20 and the OECD are now translated in the EU into a binding instrument. In several aspects the Council went even further than the basic OECD recommendations. Furthermore, the work of the Code of Conduct Group on business taxation is continuing at considerable pace. One of its current main tasks is to finalise the process of establishing the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. We also reached an agreement last month on the directive on double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms, which will considerably enhanced tax certainty by making alternative dispute resolution mechanisms binding, faster and more efficient. Finally, transparency and exchange of information have also been considerably improved. Within just one year the Council revised the Directive on Administrative Cooperation twice. These revisions are aimed to ensure the obligation for multinational companies to report key tax information on the amount of revenue, on profit before income tax and on income tax paid in each country where they do business. They also now allow tax authorities to access the information in relation to money laundering.

Thank you for being so kind to invite me over to this debate. I will structure my intervention two-fold: I will start by, at the start of this debate, making some points on the progress on the rule of law which has been achieved in Malta over the past few years, then I will be looking forward into devoting most of the time later on into answering questions that colleagues will be putting over. Let me refer to a few points on the rule of law at the beginning of this debate. To brief you on the improvements that have been made in my country over the past few years, one of the first bills which we presented as a government was that which removed the time-barring that existed on acts of corruption by politicians and those holding public office. We were the first government in Malta that introduced such legislation, which will hold all politicians and public officers to account, not only today but throughout our whole life-time, should any shred of evidence crop up linking any politician – past, present or future – to acts of corruption. As such, no politician will be able to escape the long arm of justice throughout their life-time. I believe that is a unique piece of legislation at EU level. Another piece of legislation we put forward and enacted was the Whistleblowers Protection Act. This has been deemed by a number of Members of this House, like Benedek Jávor and Julia Reda – champions in the fight to protect whistleblowers – as a benchmark for other European Union Member States and a good basis for a future European whistleblowers directive. Since the law came into force in 2013, we had no less than 29 reports that have been lodged under the protection of the Maltese Whistleblowers Act. Also, after years of damning reports by the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (Greco) putting Malta on the blacklist of political party financing, we introduced an act regulating party financing, which was not only important but necessary and in our national interest. Our law was introduced in 2015 and led Greco to certify that Malta shifted from a country contravening the institution’s recommendations on fighting corruption to one of those in line with its main recommendations. In 2016 we also change the method of appointment of members of the judiciary, becoming the first government to forgo such powers. The executive is now bound to make appointments to the bench from a pool of lawyers that have been previously approved by a judicial appointments committee, rather than having government appoint magistrates and judges directly, without the need of any prior consultation. The judicial appointments committee is made of eminent persons, including the Chief Justice, the Attorney General and the President of the Chamber of Advocates, amongst others. Mr President, we did all this in just four years, but we intend to do even more. In fact, one of our pledges over the next five years is that of discussing the removal of any parliamentary immunity in Malta, introducing a transparency register at national level – following our work as presidency – to introduce a European Transparency Register, and the introduction of a new code of conduct for all those holding public office. As I said in the beginning, I am not going to make a long introductory speech; I am interested in listening to the criticism and the points raised by the Members of this House – my former colleagues – and then I will answer accordingly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 187, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "member of the Commission. - Mr President, Madam President of the Council, Mr Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of Parliament, a year ago, the \"Panama Papers\" were added to the previous scandals and confirmed the existence of a system of global offshore tax evasion. These revelations have rightly aroused public outrage and political condemnation. At the time, the Commission and I made a promise to you, which was to use the momentum created by these revelations to curb tax evasion. I kept my word, the Commission kept my word, the Council accompanied us. President Juncker pointed out to you two weeks ago that we have made unprecedented progress on this front in record time. We did it with your constant, demanding support, and so these successes are also yours. Recent revelations concerning tax systems in several Member States only confirm the absolute necessity of the action that we have taken and that we continue to take so that taxation in the European Union and in the world be more transparent, fairer, more efficient. The landscape that emerges today after two years of tax activism is fundamentally reshaped. Automatic cooperation between Member States on tax rulings and on multinational companies' tax information is now the rule. Banking secrecy has disappeared in Europe, including among our neighbors outside the European Union. We have created a safety net against tax evasion with the adoption of directives on the fight against tax evasion (ATAD 1 and ATAD 2). We now have binding measures to tackle the most common forms of aggressive tax planning and optimization, as well as a new external strategy to ensure that good tax governance is also respected beyond our single market. The road traveled, you see, is absolutely considerable. In the space of just one year, we have proposed strengthening the rules on the fight against money laundering, relaunched the project for a common consolidated corporate tax base, obtained the Council's agreement on tax dispute settlement procedures - thanks to the Maltese Presidency -, and launched the process to create a European list of tax havens - we have also worked well with Finance Minister Edward Scicluna on this. The transparency of information on beneficial owners is a crucial priority in the fight against money laundering, corruption and tax evasion. We have proposed to improve access to information on beneficial owners in Europe and we are pushing this priority internationally. With your indispensable support, Europe should also soon have a mechanism for publishing information country by country, with the idea that multinationals would make public their activities, their earnings and the taxes paid country by country, in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen, Madam President of the Council, Prime Minister, this progress must now be consolidated and deepened. It's time to take the next step: what is it? First, I will propose to strengthen our means of defense against tax abuses: this will be the subject of my proposal on intermediaries, which I know is eagerly awaited by this assembly. Some of these intermediaries, banks, lawyers, counsels, consultants - it is not a question of accusing these professions -, in part of their activities, encourage abuses, profit from them or facilitate them. . The “Panama Papers” highlighted the central role of tax optimization. The PANA committee, which works here in the European Parliament in a remarkable, also emphasizes this point. Reducing tax evasion means shedding light on this sector. My proposal will be based on simple principles - transparency, cooperation, exchange of information - which we have mobilized in our previous proposals. You know them well now. With this initiative, cross-border tax optimization arrangements will need to be made known to member states well before they can affect their tax revenues, and thus tax administrations will be in a position to detect or block any possible abuse. On the other hand, although this is not the case for Malta, many recent scandals in tax evasion and other areas have been exposed thanks to the courage of whistleblowers. They endangered their careers, their way of life, their freedom sometimes. They must be protected. The Commission is studying possible courses of action for an initiative in this area. I know the European Parliament wants it. The second initiative I will take will tackle VAT fraud: it is a major issue. This fraud represents, for cross-border VAT, 50 billion euros of losses per year for our public treasuries. The task is not over, we have made efforts over the past two years. This Parliament is fully aware of this. A recent study by the PANA commission reveals that Europol has identified 388 files in the \"Panama Papers\" which are linked to VAT fraud operations. We are talking here about massive fraud, carried moreover by criminal networks and perhaps used to finance terrorism. Today, VAT fraud, so to speak, is a piece of cake, it's called carousel fraud. The flaws in the VAT system combined with the disconcerting ease of draining funds diverted to bank accounts outside the European Union make this tax resource extremely vulnerable to fraud, and this is particularly the case, as I have said, for cross-border transactions. The solution that we are going to propose is to move towards a definitive VAT regime, leaving intra-European Union transactions to be treated exactly like national transactions in the Member State of destination through a one-stop shop, which will drastically reduce cross-border fraud but also simplify VAT obligations for companies, because, of course, it is a simplification measure that allows companies to work more efficiently. In this context, I would also like to inform you that important actions are in preparation to fight against VAT fraud, therefore in the field of European criminal justice, after the finalization of the new directive on offenses against financial interests of the European Union, which also criminalizes VAT fraud. On June 8, we reached a political agreement in the Council on the creation - and this is a major one - of the European Public Prosecutor's Office in enhanced cooperation, supported by 20 Member States and which others may join later. I hope that I can once again count on the full support of the European Parliament for this initiative. I used to say that we are really on the same camp in this fight, which I know to be very broadly cross-partisan and shared on all the benches of this assembly. Indeed, these initiatives complement the instruments that we have put in place together over the past two years to curb tax fraud and tax evasion, which remains a shared objective. This will help ensure that the Union and its Member States continue to be at the forefront of this battle for fairer taxation, which is a global battle fought within the framework of the G20 and the OECD. Finally - and I will end there - it is important that the justice can do its work with confidence and independence, and you will therefore understand that I cannot comment on the investigations in progress, which are the responsibility of the justice system.This, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members, Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, Madam President of the Council, is what I wanted to tell you about our ever renewed fight against abuses of all kinds in tax matters.I thank Parliament once again for its support, which is essential to us at all times in this very difficult, but very important dossier.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 188, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I welcome you, Prime Minister Muscat, and first of all as a democrat I want to congratulate you on your re-election. There was strong, tough, democratic competition in Malta, you won, and I wish you all the best in the interest of the country and in the interest of our European Union. In the interest of the European Union you showed that you are from time to time ready for change, ready to rethink your own position. I bring to our mind again that you were not previously in favour of Malta becoming a member of the European Union. Today you know that membership is important for Malta and contributes to the interests of Malta. Malta is benefiting from this and today it is obvious that this is a success story. This example shows that you are ready to rethink your position from time to time. But in today’s debate, whose subject is the Panama papers linked to Malta, the question is not so much what we are doing against fraud and what we are doing for the rule of law; the most important question is: why is there still a minister in your cabinet, the only minister in the European Union, who is named on the Panama list? That is the substance of the debate today. That is what we want to ask you, because we have a lot of discussion points where can really work together for the future of Europe, but that is the substance of the debate. You won the election, but the questions are still on the table and what we ask from you, in your capacity as today’s President of the European Council, as the presidency of the Council of the European Union, is clarification of this open question.  You said a lot about what you did on paper on legislation to guarantee the rule of law in Malta. I was hoping that you would come back today to Strasbourg to the European Parliament and could show us what the result of this legislation is, what are you doing to create really strong and independent structures, and what the outcome of this is. Legislation, what is on paper, is one thing, but implementation is something else. What does this mean in reality? What is the outcome of these activities? I did not think that you showed a real readiness to give us an opening, an inside look into what is happening in your party, in your government. I would ask you to do so. I think that is a chance for you, in your second approach here in the Parliament, to clarify these points. Democracy means that people must have full trust in their institutions.

The Panama Papers have given rise to a number of scandals in EU countries. Some are open-and-shut cases, while others are merely hearsay and conjecture. In a democratic society built on the rule of law there is only one response to such allegations: where there are allegations, there must be investigation and, where there is investigation, there must be a conclusion, a judgement and a ruling. In the specific case of Malta, so far only two of these are present: the accusations and the formal investigation, which is well underway.  This being the case, the plenary chamber of the European Parliament is not the proper forum to deal with these accusations. I ask my honourable colleagues whether they really question the very foundation of democracy in Malta, a Member State that has recently achieved a 92% voter turnout and is a sound democracy. As a co-rapporteur of the PANA Committee, I am perhaps the keenest to get to the bottom of all cases linked to the Panama Papers and I will insist on having facts, not merely accusations. I refuse to be drawn in to questioning a fundamental societal pillar, the rule of law in Malta, even before the ongoing formal investigation is completed. However, I do seriously question if the EU as a whole is capable of responding effectively to the revelations of the Panama Papers. Vital EU anti—tax evasion measures continue to be held up in the Council. If we are to make any positive difference at all in the fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax havens, we must channel all of our efforts into building European solutions. As such, I ask the Members of this Parliament who take the floor whether they are ready to reform the Code of Conduct Group to ensure public scrutiny. Can you help to bring your own governments to responsibility for the actions taken by this group? I think this is very important. We also need to do more at a European level. Together with my former co—rapporteur, Michael Theurer, in the TAXE 2 report, I ask for the Union Tax Policy Coherence and Coordination Centre to strengthen our fight against tax evasion and tax fraud in the EU. We also want to see a Tax Europol that can bridge the gap between national authorities in these highly complex international tax cases.

The government of Malta, and with it the current EU presidency, is regrettably associated with criminal energy. Cabinet members appear in the Panama Papers, EU visas are being hawked to Chinese business people, and the discount system allows companies to lower tax rates to five percent of profits. In my hometown of Hamburg, cruise ships even use the Maltese flag and German tax law to reduce taxes to zero. Malta is a paradise for money laundering by the Italian Mafia. Without diplomatic clichés: there is blood on the money that protects Malta. Nevertheless, the Maltese have confirmed the social democratic government. Not surprising; there was no realistic alternative - the conservatives in Malta also have their register of sins.

The EU must deliver now, also against Malta. The Council and the Commission must work with us to close loopholes in the money laundering directive, for example for bogus directors of letterbox companies. The black list of tax havens must also be expanded to include EU countries such as Malta. We need withholding taxes for uncooperative states. Europe needs credibility, not bad deals with the tax mafia. And I would like to ask you, Mr Muscat: will you work to ensure that we come to the majority principle in the code-of-conduct group? And will you appear before the Panama Paper Committee of Inquiry, of which I am vice-chair? You received an invitation from the chairman.

We have found that the Financial Intelligence Unit has investigated several cases of serious wrong-doing in the field of money laundering, as well as in the field of bank licensing and doubtful procedures in banks. These have unfortunately not led to the opening of prosecution processes. These three known reports of the Financial Intelligence Unit have leaked to the media, but still prosecution processes seem not to be on the way and therefore, we call on the Police Commissioner to immediately open respective prosecution procedures. Secondly, for the financial institutions involved, there should be consequences. There is a financial supervisor and there is something peculiar in Malta because the head of the financial supervisor MFSA, Joseph Bannister, is at the same time the Vice President of Malta Finance. There is a strong conflict of interest between the role of supervisor and that of the Development Authority which brings financial investment to Malta. We think the supervisor should take action against Pilatus bank and next year BT, to look at their licenses after the findings in the Panama Papers as well as in the reports of the FIU.  Furthermore, we believe that the key persons who were involved in the Panama Papers, including Mr Schembri as well as Brian Tonna and Kazimi as well as Mr Zammit who was found in the Swiss Leagues, should appear before the Panama Papers committee; so far they have failed to do so. Reuters and Der Spiegel have revealed lax supervision in the online gaming sector. Lastly, it is imperative that a thorough investigation be started. We have written today to the Commission to start investigations regarding Treaty violation procedures concerning money laundering legislation and bank licensing practices. It is high time for Malta to defend its reputation. Your island needs to be based on the thorough rule of law; and you can do it, you have in your hands to really reveal to the public the truth about all these things and have fair and tough investigations.

I would like to say to the Prime Minister that this was mostly in the context of very worrying information about high officials from his country being involved in various activities that raise suspicion of being linked to money laundering and corruption. Given this information, we decided to organise a fact—finding mission to Malta, during which we met with representatives of intermediaries as well as with journalists and some government officials. Prime Minister, unfortunately, your Chief of Staff, Mr Schembri, whose name appeared in the Panama Papers, refused to meet with us, while another member of your Cabinet, whose name was also exposed in the Panama Papers, Minister Konrad Mizzi, failed to convince us of his innocence. We find it absolutely unacceptable that a high government official from an EU Member State refuses to appear before the parliamentary committee of inquiry to testify. Moreover, we also find it very worrying that you, as Prime Minister, have not suspended both Mr Schembri and Minister Mizzi from their government duties until the legal investigation in their cases is completed.  The failure to do so, Prime Minister, has seriously undermined the credibility of your country and yourself personally at the crucial time when Malta holds the Presidency of the European Union. It has also sent a bad signal to European public opinion. I am sure you agree with me that winning elections does not allow you or your government to sweep such problems under the rug.

Firstly, Commissioner, you wrote me a letter saying that there are no tax havens in the European Union. This letter has been given a place of honor in my office, and I always enjoy looking at it because the daily work in the committee of inquiry shows that the opposite is the case. And, Prime Minister, it is interesting that a country like yours can really bring the Who's Who of the European economy to its home without large-scale production taking place there. These are also interesting things that we have processed in TAXE-1 and TAXE-2. Panama is about how individual taxpayers keep their assets safe from taxation. And the fact that even Maltese citizens are very responsible and fear the Maltese tax rates is an eloquent example of what is happening there. The whole thing is crowned by the fact that cooperation with the Council - sorry - is under all cannon. We have now learned the possibilities of blackening documents when we wanted to look at the documents. Some blacken entire pages, some blacken paragraphs, some blacken words. But we don't get any information, we only get black pages. Dear Prime Minister, there is a lot you could have done to create more credibility in Europe.

I think the European Parliament, before entering this debate should get the facts, and take itself seriously by gathering facts and not just have opinions and accusations – that is not enough.  Let me talk about one topic. This is the opportunity where we do have facts and a lot of evidence – the evidence for tax competition. We now see for example that small firms pay 30% more taxes than large corporations: that is a fact. Malta has, to put it in a neutral way, a very different tax system, with the ultimate tax burden of about 5% in many cases. There is nothing wrong with being different and having a different tax system, but I would implore the Prime Minister to join the investigation into loopholes that are unintended and join international cooperation to close these loopholes. I expect that from Malta. I would also implore the Prime Minister, especially as he is from the social democratic family, that he join efforts to introduce the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, because that is the European response for making the tax system efficient and fair and I also count on Malta on this.  As I said, there is nothing wrong with being different, but I hope the Maltese Prime Minister will join with the European Parliament and fight for fair and efficient taxation in Europe.

The Commission is of course aware of the links established between the Panama Papers and Malta, which are the subject of judicial inquiries in Malta. The reason we have not spoken is very simple, and that is that the Commission cannot comment on ongoing investigations. There is a principle that exists in all our democracies: that of the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, which we obviously cannot question. Mr Giegold said a letter was sent to the Commission today. The latter will take note of it and respond to it. I just want to emphasize three points. The first is that many of you have explained to us that we have a restrictive view of tax havens when we consider that there are no tax havens in the European Union. This does not mean that we are unaware that there may be problems and harmful practices in the European Union, which are the subject of investigations, but a tax haven is something else, if we want to reason in all rigor. Why? A tax haven is a country that does not respect international standards and, beyond that, the rules on transparency and the fight against tax evasion which are now enshrined in European law. I spoke of European leadership because, thanks to our determined action, European law goes far beyond international standards. All European countries have adopted these rules of law. They implement them all and they show that they have the necessity and willingness to meet these commitments. There have also been several mechanisms, which I will call soft law, such as the establishment of a code of conduct on harmful tax practices. It is therefore absolutely necessary to take strong action to combat unfair tax practices in the Union. However, qualifying a particular Member State as a tax haven in itself is not, in my opinion, an intellectually satisfactory or rigorous process. Therefore, the Commission will not propose it. As regards action against money laundering, the Commission considers that transparency and access to information on beneficial owners are very important points in the fight against money laundering and against evasion. and tax evasion. The Commission defends its proposal, because we consider it to be proportionate and balanced between, on the one hand, the need to provide the authorities with the necessary instruments to combat tax fraud and money laundering and, on the other hand , efficiency, which is also essential. Finally, I respond in particular to Mr. Ferber, who posts the letters that we can address to him. I will send more to him which I hope will also be displayable and which will also be acted upon. On requests for access to documents, the Commission, through its various Directorates-General, notably DG TAXUD, DG JUST and DG FISMA, is working hard - I also say this to President Langen - to accede to the legitimate requests of the PANA commission ( commission of inquiry responsible for examining allegations of infringements and maladministration in the application of Union law on money laundering, tax evasion and tax evasion) concerning access to documents. Mr. President, you can testify that we have already submitted hundreds of documents to this committee, with which I am delighted to be able to work under the best conditions. In particular, I will cite two things. At this stage, more than 850 documents have been uploaded to the open internet platform within the framework of the PANA commission. In addition, no less than 697 other confidential documents (including 375 for DG TAXUD, for which I am responsible) were provided to the PANA committee in a secure reading room. It will be understood that we must also respect a certain amount of personal information about taxpayers. In any case, it is not for us to make them public. But I want this transparency action to be carried out to the end, and you know very well - I am addressing the Members of the European Parliament here - that if there are gaps here or there, it is not the fact of the Commission, but more that of the Member States, which must also cooperate. This is what I wanted to say in this debate, which I appreciate the importance of. This debate must not avoid any situation. At the same time, it must respect the separation of powers and must do justice to the Member States and their efforts to integrate new European regulations into their own national law. It must also continue an ardent, unwavering fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. We have achieved extremely important results in recent years. Indeed, many of the cases we are talking about are cases that stem from flaws or loopholes in previous legislation. They could not happen again in the future. This is no reason not to consider that the investigations should be completed to the end, but it is a reason for the Commission to pursue its legislative action in this area to the end and to ask the Member States not to falter, not to fail and to be by our side in these advances that your Parliament, I know, supports and promotes with us, and even more ardently than us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 233, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Joseph MUSCAT", "mepid": "28121", "text": "   Prime Minister of Malta. – Mr President, I expect some of you would be expecting me to be angry after this debate. Actually I am not: I am very happy to be here; I consider this as a natural second home for me, and I do understand the spirit of this debate. I do understand the political narrative of it all. So allow me to reply in kind and to be tongue and cheek in my replies and very candid and very open in the way I try to address the concerns that you have put forward. I do understand, as a politician, the timing of the debate, and I do appreciate that a majority in this House did not agree to the fact that such a debate takes place during an electoral campaign. This is a much more serene setting for such a debate. I welcome, first of all, Mr Weber’s wishes. I thank him for his contribution to our campaign back in Malta. He said that the only politicians mentioned in the Panama Papers were Maltese – I am sorry, it is not true. We have a Commissioner from the EPP family who is mentioned in those papers – his own family. No one is saying anything about that. (Mr Langen, I have not interrupted you: please listen to me, hear me out.) No one said anything about that, so I do believe that that was the first incorrect fact. But, really and truly, there are three ways in which this debate has gone: there is the debate on the Panama Papers, there is the debate on the issue of taxation, and there is then an outright lie that has been said. Let’s start with the debate on the Panama papers, with many Members asking why there is not an investigation. I think Ms Metsola said quite clearly: there are four investigations taking place in court by independent judges, and they will decide whether there is room for prosecution. There already has been a commitment that, if there is such room for prosecution, resignations would be in order. I am amazed that this basic fact was not taken into consideration. There are four independent judicial investigations taking place. That is the most basic fact that, I am sorry, quite a number of Members got wrong. I do believe the problem is that most of the time, Members and colleagues are sourcing their facts simply from the social media and not trying to dig little bit deeper to try to ascertain the veracity of fact. Secondly, I do believe, and I do bring to your attention, the fact that some of the conclusions that you were referring to were really and truly denied by the same independent institutions that are being quoted, including the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit. I must say that I will keep on mentioning a number of facts that I think need to be ascertained. Let me start with our tax system. Malta’s imputation tax system is quite unique in Europe, that’s true. It has not been invented or put in during the past 4 or 10 years. It has been there since World War II. It has been scrutinised by the Commission prior to our joining the European Union more than 11 years ago. It is OECD-compliant. Some might not like it; some might say it is competitive. The fact is that it has undergone all levels of scrutiny by all organisations. I also believe that there are two ways in which we can go on the taxation element. On one I agree with this House, and I will show how, in practice, we as a government and also as a presidency have gone to lengths not only not to obstruct the advancement of dossiers in this area but actually to conclude dossiers that are quite thorny: ATAD II – the anti-tax avoidance directive, the second recast; BEPS – the erosion of profits, profit shifting. These are all issues that have been concluded or where progress has been achieved under the Maltese Presidency. I think that is a fact that should be taken into consideration. I must also stress the fact that our government and also as a whole, we are part of the OECD exchange of information. Some mentioned the ‘Malta files’. There is nothing secret. The people who have companies back at home are publicly available on the internet. The only exercise that was made was a consolidation of elements where, instead of searching a company, one searches a name. I invite you to take a look at the Tax Justice Network’s Financial Secrecy Index. You will find at least five Member States – and not necessarily the usual suspects – who are ranked lower than Malta when it comes to secrecy and transparency. We have done away with banking secrecy more than a decade and a half ago. We are not the last people to come to join this fight against avoidance and evasion. The point where we disagree is where Member States should not be let and left to decide their own tax levels. That is something that I totally disagree with the majority of this House about. I might remain in a minority on this, but that is something that I believe is fundamental and is also fundamental for a number of other Member States, irrespective of the composition of our economy. It is not true that our economy is dependent on financial services: that shows a lack of knowledge about the structure of the smallest Member State’s economy. Maybe it is not too much important for some of you over here, but if you look at the basic numbers, our main exports are microchips. In almost all your mobile phones, you will find a microchip proudly made in Malta. We are not a mailbox economy; we are an economy that produces value added. Trying to put a caricature of all this – I can accept it in a tabloid, but really and truly, I expect a more informed debate in such a House. Let me move on to some other issues. I said the independence of institutions, but also the way in which we source our information and the way in which we direct debates. Yes, quite a number of you relied on reports that were on media. None of you – I am surprised – referred to the Moneyval reports. I believe that we all trust Moneyval. It is an institution that is not political. It is an institution that sees each and every jurisdiction, makes recommendations and is very tough. Moneyval has a positive report about our country. FSAP – let’s refer to the facts. It is not about who tweets and who posts on the internet. It is about experts telling us what to do in the same way that Greco, the Council of Europe, told us: ‘you guys don’t have a system of party financing, we don’t know who is financing your political parties’. Guess what? We introduced the system. Guess what? We are now totally compliant with the system and we are implementing it. It is not a law just there for the sake of being there. Unfortunately the opposition does not like it, but fortunately enough we are all compliant with it. Which brings me to some other points which I would like to make, which is really the third point, which some of you have referred to. I am really sorry that Mr Langen is no longer here, or at least I do not see him. Some people in this House have referred to a story – a totally outright lie – that has been directed against me, my wife and my family, namely that I have some sort of structure – account, funds – that I took from some contract: this is an outright lie. Whenever I ask someone to tell me the source of all this, everyone points at the same blog and report, which is unsubstantiated. And you know what? We respect so much the rule of law that, as Prime Minister, I went to court and I asked the court – an independent institution, where I have already as Prime Minister divested myself of the right enjoyed by my predecessors to nominate people to the bench (but now people come to the bench after being vetted by independent lawyers and prosecutors) – to appoint a magistrate to investigate these allegations. I said more than that; I said that, not only if there is some evidence that is put forward but if there is a shred of truth, I will immediately resign. I put myself on the line, for the simple reason I know it is totally untrue. Those who made the allegations, I asked them: ‘would you want to pledge your political career if what you are saying is false?’ No, they did not take up the challenge. Maltese people judged also based on this fact. What politician would pledge his whole career totally on one statement, on one assertion? I do not even bat an eyelid doing that, because I know I am saying the truth. I marvel at the idea that some extremely knowledgeable Members of this House have taken this thing, this fake news, and repeated it here just like that. So my point to Mr Langen and to some colleagues is: why aren’t you coming to the PANA Committee?’ I said about a month, a month and a half ago, I am coming to the PANA Committee. If you do not get this basic fact right, I am sorry, please check your press reviews or fire the people who are making them for you. I said I would be coming. I said I would be coming once the judge comes out with the independent investigation – one of the four independent investigations – to be able to present to the PANA Committee not what the Prime Minister of Malta is saying, but facts ascertained by the judiciary. And I am amazed that such a basic fact has been overlooked when there is such – what I deem to be – a serious debate, or which should have been a serious debate. I will conclude, Mr President. The second part of the topic for discussion is the rule of law. Let me take some time to say what we do back at home about the rule of law. May I remind you, The Economist classifies Malta as one of the few countries which is a full democracy. Some other Member States are not full democracies, but I will not judge them. What have we done? First of all, we have a totally independent National Audit Office that criticises government whenever it deems needs to criticise the government; a government that, when it has reports, takes corrective action. We have an ombudsman, who is critical of all institutions and of all governments, irrespective of which party forms that government; a Public Service Commission that is made up of representatives from all sides of the House. We have an independent judiciary which, even during the last legislature, decided that the opposition should have two extra seats; we disagreed with that ruling, but we said: yes, we will implement that ruling, because we observe the rule of law. We have an Attorney General, who was not changed after the election. We kept the same Attorney General who was nominated by the previous government, and now this person of high integrity gets attacked because some people in the opposition do not like the way in which he is giving advice. We have the Chair of our Financial Services Regulatory Authority, who was appointed by the previous administration. We kept him in office. We have removed time-barring on issues of corruption. I mentioned a number of other facts, such as the removal of parliamentary immunity, and very soon the implementation of a commissioner for public standards. We will be having, for the first time, hearings in our Parliament for appointing regulators. We have enacted a Freedom of Information Act. We have relaxed media laws in a way that now they are one of the most, if not the most, liberal in Europe. Not only did we not put constraints on journalists, we have even relaxed the way in which journalists are required to put forward issues related to sources. And we have removed criminal libels in order to prevent journalists from being put in prison – laws that have been there even after we joined the European Union, and we managed to remove them. In doing all this, then, we managed to achieve success, and I do believe that there might be some people who are not too keen on our economic success and social success. We not only have the best-performing economy in the Eurozone – and that is not because of financial services and gaming alone, it is about tourism, manufacturing, the services industry; it is about the honest, busy people that go to work each and every day. We have increased our pensions; we have increased the minimum wage; we have introduced universal free childcare; we have put Malta from number 20-whatever on the ILGA list for LGBTIQ rights to number one in Europe. This is prosperity with a purpose; this is the sort of debate I would love to have in this House. I do not have a problem in having the debate that we just had. I do hope that, when I appear in front of the PANA Committee with the facts – and I assure Mr Langen that I will appear in front of the Committee; I am not a Volkswagen that says one thing but does another – I keep my word.

It is in line with the plan outlined in the window of small and medium-sized companies. It even goes there with the best predictions. The proof is that over € 190,000,000 has already been mobilized in the European Union and over 420,000 small and medium-sized enterprises have been supported. It is in this way, by promoting investment, that we get more jobs, that, at the same time, we also get more competitiveness for our economy, without ever forgetting social, economic and territorial cohesion. However, the European Fund for Strategic Investments does not have the visibility it deserved in view of the results it has produced. It is necessary to improve communication, it is also necessary to improve the visibility of this Fund. The proof of success is that, today, we are already negotiating the extension of the European Strategic Investment Fund to 500 million euros and its extension until 2020. This does not mean that this fund, its execution and, in particular, the execution by an essential actor, the European Investment Bank, cannot and should not be improved. First of all, knowing the projects that are not pre-selected, and here there is an attitude that can be discriminatory in law, but an attitude that is in the power of the European Investment Bank. It is important to be aware, at a minimum, of projects that have not been introduced in the system, of projects that have not been pre-selected. It is also important and essential to have a better geographical distribution, a better geographical balance, with regard to projects. It is also important that there is sectorial diversification. Small projects cannot be excluded from this fund, which requires pro-active territories and the implementation of investment platforms. it is essential for this purpose, to be able to encompass small projects. The need for platforms for cross-border projects is also something that needs to be addressed. The digital union is important, the union of energy is essential and also in this way, in addition to promoting the internal market, in addition to promoting interconnectivity and efficiency, we would be contributing to objectives across the European Union. This fund is an additional fund, it is also a complementary fund, but it is important and platforms are a means where this can be achieved, so that it can be better used, together with the Structural Funds, the funds, namely, of policy of cohesion. It is important that the additional aspect is reinforced and respected. It is also essential that less developed regions and regions that are, for example, in difficulty can take their economic situation into account when selecting projects. Finally, the advisory hub is essential to promote better projects to help structure investment platforms. I would like to end by thanking all political groups, all shadow rapporteurs for the work that has been done and, in a special way, the correlator Udo Bullmann. We have done work to promote growth, to promote and improve the competitiveness of the European Union and to give citizens a better quality of life.

I can return this thanks to José Manuel Fernandes, my co-rapporteur, to all shadow rapporteurs, as well as to the many hardworking hands and minds in the staff who are involved in our work. We passed the EFSI legislation very quickly. We are now engaged in legislative deliberations on the Commission's new proposal - we will do that too efficiently and quickly. But of course we also have to take this opportunity to deal with a résumé, with a conclusion: What have we achieved? What is still to be achieved? First of all, why this fund for strategic investments at all? The Commission tells us: € 200 to 300 billion a year is missing from European investment policy. We have an investment gap especially in transportation, especially in broadband networks and renewable energies. We, the European Parliament, the political groups that are behind this decision, which we have taken, do not want to come to terms with it. We believe in the future of the European economy. We want to give the young people, who are unemployed far too often and far too often in many countries, a chance. There has to be sustainable growth. We want to create the conversion into the future of the economy. That is why we have to close these investment gaps. Yes, we stand by this program. Yes, we support the program. But let's see: Where are deficits still to be eliminated? Where can improvements be made? We have to ask ourselves: what has been achieved? Yes, the volumes are flowing, the numbers are good. But are we really funding the projects we want to fund? Or is there not too often a situation in which projects are financed that receive capital anyway - be it private or public financiers behind it? Why are there still too few partnerships - partnerships that support small and medium-sized projects, partnerships with regional promotional banks, with national promotional banks that have the know-how that we urgently need? Does the money really get to the regions where we need it most? Or are those regions not preferred that already have an intact infrastructure - an infrastructure for consulting, an infrastructure for project planning - and are therefore perhaps less dependent on our money? Is the positive dynamic we want in the modernization sectors already emerging? Or do we give priority to spending money so that money is spent? These are critical questions that we must not ignore, and that is why our report highlights the merits, what has been achieved. But it also makes it clear where the deficits are. We want to get a clearer definition of additionality. We want the instruments for selecting projects to be sharpened and, if you please, also to be used as they are anchored in the first legislative act. We want more transparency. We want more cooperation. And we feel that the weight of the European Parliament is necessary in order to better achieve these goals. We are counting on cooperation, of course in particular with the Commission, which we support, but also with our preferred partner, the European Investment Bank - here too we want to make cooperation even better.

In the case of transport, we have encountered a rather cruel paradox, since 2.2 billion were taken from the Connecting Europe Facility - that is, more than 25% of what EFSI 1 was - and yet in Of the projects that have been achieved, we have only found 13% of projects for transport. And what is worse: in the EFSI 2 proposal it turns out that the Commission - and it is not you, Mr Moscovici, I know - arrives with a 'no roads at all'.

It’s a perfect hit in small and medium sized businesses for the European Investment Fund (EIF). It is also a quantitative success, but we have a few remarks and, under the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN), as my colleague has just said, some disappointments. In fact, transport was considered, for the infrastructure part, as an essential element, with a minimum percentage. Then, we considered that qualitatively, these projects should have added European value. However, we can see that both the quantity and the quality are not there and that as such, the transport is all the more frustrated that it has been the subject of a puncture, that comes to be told, on a fund mechanism which itself works perfectly, which is moreover already exhausted by its success, namely the mechanism for interconnection in Europe. I don't want to believe that we will go so far as to puncture him a second time. I want to conclude by saying that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is not a bank. The EIB is first and foremost an institution of the Union, and as such, additionality, the guarantee of first losses and support for European policies must be reconsidered; this will be - I think - the subject of the EFSI 2 regulation, which carries our hopes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 246, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "member of the Commission. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, dear rapporteurs, exactly one year ago the Commission was here to discuss with you the mid-term review of the European Investment Plan, the Juncker Plan, and for also announce its intention to extend this European Fund for Strategic Investments. At that time, we found that we had around 65 projects: infrastructure projects and industrial investment projects that had already secured funding from EFSI. In addition to these, and even more importantly, 185 agreements have been concluded between the European Investment Fund and intermediary banks, between this Fund and private banks, all to finance small and medium-sized enterprises. Today, we can say that we are going much further, with 224 projects and 275 agreements with intermediaries. Also, I am proud to say, on behalf of Jyrki Katainen, that the EFSI is now well on track to fulfill its investment promises, because it is about closing the investment gap in Europe. There is, I believe, a very broad consensus on the success and usefulness of EFSI. Over the past two years, it has shown itself to be a powerful instrument to support investment in the European Union. 194 billion euros have already been mobilized in total investment in the Member States, which benefits 420,000 small and medium-sized enterprises or start-ups. The EIB Group, which I want to salute, has supported projects and small businesses in many sectors and many regions in, of course, all the countries of the Union; all for the benefit of growth and jobs in Europe. I am also pleased to inform you that some of the shortcomings or imbalances rightly singled out in your report have in the meantime been reduced. EFSI now covers - that was of course of high importance - all EU 28 Member States. Compared to GDP, the investment mobilized currently is highest in Estonia, Spain, Bulgaria, Portugal and Finland, which balances the initial geographic concentration. Investment platforms are developing, even if in the beginning slower than we would have hoped for. But of course, more needs to be done, and we are determined to make EFSI a success for everyone and everywhere. In your report you point to a potential contradiction between the quantitative and the qualitative goals of EFSI. Here, let me again refer to the statement the Commission made in this Chamber last year that demonstrates how much we are in the same logic and how much we share the same concerns. The main issue in this is to focus on addressing market failure. The main issue is not to make it larger. One thing on which we have to be very careful is to provide financing for new innovations which will strengthen sustainable development of our economies in social and environmental terms, for instance financing through investments which will promote the circular economy. Here I quote the speech of last year: ‘Honorable Members, dear colleagues, three main issues are identified as falling short of expectations in your implementing report: additionality, transparency and geographical diversification’. These are precisely the items we decided to address through the EFSI 2.0 Regulation. I am therefore pleased to perceive a large convergence of views between the Commission and the European Parliament on the areas for improvement. Though divergences appear in the means put forward to overcome EFSI's initial weaknesses or defects, most of them relate to the level of ambition for EFSI 2.0. The Commission does not believe that this is the time for a complete overhaul, because it would cost time and also damage investor confidence - but we are not looking for a quick fix either. You can be assured that the Commission does not put quantity over quality - I insist on that - and is as vigilant regarding the appropriate use of the EU guarantee as the European Parliament. We share the same view. It is precisely because we consider the improvements in terms of additionality and transparency so important that we want them to be implemented as quickly as possible. While we might disagree on some proposals for the immediate way forward, let me underline that the Commission looks with great interest at some of the medium-term reflections you formulate for a potential EFSI 3.0. The Commission welcomes Parliament’s call for further proposals to see how we can permanently support investment in Europe, relaunch, boost and strengthen it. All this shows that the European Parliament has an ambition, a commitment for this investment plan, the Juncker plan. I want to assure you all that your reflections, your reports will be a source of reflections, a source of actions, a source of thoughts within the framework of our own thoughts and reflections on the future multiannual financial framework, which will be our very important task. In my opinion and in the opinion of the Commission, it is absolutely crucial that the next budget of the European Union be above all an investment-focused budget, because investment is the key to innovation and innovation is also the key to our common future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 247, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Emmanuel MAUREL", "mepid": "24505", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Madam President, Commissioner Moscovici has just said, there may be disagreements between us, differences of appreciation, but I think that at this stage, everyone agrees first to recognize the merits a major investment plan in a European Union which continues to suffer from a chronic deficit of public and private investment.

One of the key issues he has highlighted for Ireland is this investment gap, which is so evident across many Member States but especially in Member States that have gone through a financial crisis – a gap of about 20% in Ireland. I want to agree with Commissioner Moscovici when he said very clearly that EFSI must be a success for every Member State in every part of our European Union, and we must do much more to promote the opportunities that EFSI can advance in economies right the way across the European Union. In Ireland, because of this investment gap, we need to do much more in drawing down funds and lending opportunities from EFSI. Last year about EUR 800 million was lent by the EIB to Ireland, but only a small percentage of that was in EFSI. I believe the Irish government should set a very clear target of being able to get lending opportunities of over EUR 5 billion over the course of the EFSI plan for new lending opportunities in Ireland, and I also think we should look again at how we use the pillar banks to obtain lending opportunities to small businesses, especially in Ireland. The key aspect of EFSI, its genius, is the idea that we can underscore and underwrite the risk factor that frequently does not allow investment to go into new business and to new lending opportunities.

Complementarity with other funds must also be improved and we also have to clearly define the objectives so that there is no competition or duplication with other items such as Horizon 2020 or COSME. We also need greater transparency in the evaluation of projects, because sometimes we do not know why or why a project has not been financed. And this transparency would also allow us to assess the true additionality of the projects.

The common European cultural treasure includes the collection of stories known as A Thousand and One Nights, and it is available in all conceivable European languages. In that collection of fairy tales, we also find the magic formula \"sesame open you\". It was probably the intention that the EFSI Fund would appear as a \"sesame open you\" to remedy the investment deficit that has hit Europe. Now we do not really know; we see that the economy is going up, but we do not really know how it is connected, if it was EFSI that opened here or if it was something else. Here we would really need a more decent assessment. What bothers us a bit in this context is also the decision-making process. If you have a decision-making process that requires unanimity, you run the risk that the dumbest, most ignorant or laziest in the management team dictates the decisions. Therefore, I do not think that the decision-making process as it was designed was good. The second issue we have encountered is about risk assessment. Here, I think that part of the management team also ended up on bad roads. We know that German motorways can be very risky, but the riskiness does not depend on the investments but on how you drive there. But once again back to the story of A Thousand and One Nights.

Until this deficit is covered, the views of the International Monetary Fund will prevail, according to which the Greek economy is almost doomed and the European partners will never get back the money they lent to the Greek State.

Now we are looking forward to address and fix this problem with the trialogues of EFSI 2, but the ambitious elements that could incentivise the creation of demand are still not enough: 91% of VS 9, 15 Member States VS 13. It doesn’t seem that it will change dramatically. I do believe that there is urgent need for economic relevance in the EU and EFSIs are potentially headed toward the correct direction.

There we have to support these countries so they have a better capacity to take it up, quality to make projects and investment banks, as my colleague has said.  Third, as the coordinator of the regional committee in the PPE Group, I think we should move much more to combining the funds from the regional funds, the structural investment funds, and the EFSI.

EFSI might not be perfect. It certainly is not a magical weapon that can, on its own, close the investment gap we suffer from: create growth and jobs and put our economy on a sustainable and inclusive track. But our debate and the reports prove that it is a valuable instrument in pursuit of this aim. I hear all the expectations in terms of job creation, ambition as regards macroeconomic impact, vigilance in the face of potential crowding out of other investors and fears of cannibalisations of other EU instruments. I understand them all and I share this impatience. But let us discuss on the basis of actual results, and focus on positive messages. EFSI delivers, and we are in the midst of negotiations to extend it and also to make it better. In this regard, I would like to answer a few questions or remarks. I was asked if EFSI was supposed to replace cohesion funds. The answer is no. We attach great importance to cohesion policy. EFSI and Cohesion Policy can coexist and can be mutually reinforcing. Both share a goal, which is to increase the level of investment for the benefit of growth and jobs. It is about developing synergies between EFSI and the cohesion funds, in no way opposing or excluding them. Several remarks were made on this or that country and on the way in which they are served by the cohesion funds. In this regard, of course, we have statistics. I will simply mention two countries. First, Cyprus. It is true that for a long time there were no projects, but an agreement was signed in December 2016 on the SME component between the European Investment Fund and the RCB bank. With regard to Greece, there were several interventions. For a long time, it is true that there was no project in Greece. A hub team has been sent to assist in structuring projects and today Greece, listen up, is the eighth country to benefit from EFSI funds. Therefore, there has been more than a catch-up in this matter. I take this opportunity to say how much I hope that, tomorrow, at the Eurogroup to be held in Luxembourg, an agreement will be found for Greece which will make it possible to disburse the funds provided for under the third program and to draw up the parameters for measuring medium-term debts, all of this against the backdrop of a policy that should favor growth and employment in this country. Because after the crisis, after the efforts, it is time for the Greek people to see the result of everything they have agreed to. My colleague from the Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, made this presentation alongside me yesterday at the College, and the Commission knows that it has already done a lot for growth and jobs in Greece. We also want to do more through EFSI. More must be done. This is fundamental. My colleague Katainen and I are ready to come back to this Parliament in perhaps a month, before the summer break, to discuss the outcome of the trilogues. President Juncker introduced EFSI 2 in his State of the Union address in September 2016. You can be sure that in one year we have already delivered results in this direction for the benefit of our European citizens. Therefore, my message is simple: the EFSI is an instrument which can be improved, criticized, like any instrument, but which is also remarkable. So let's perfect it together.

The original intention was that it should help mainly projects with great innovation potential, which, however, are still relatively risky for investment. It was also to focus in particular on small and medium-sized enterprises as a driving force in the European economy. The result was to be a restoration of confidence in the market and a consequent multiplication of the funds thus invested. After a year and a half of operation, it turns out that there is considerable interest in this money. However, they do not always focus on strictly innovation-oriented projects that respond to the future development needs of the European economy. In addition, the distribution of these resources within the European Union is relatively uneven. The vast majority of them have so far headed to the so-called old Member States. In the future, these Member States will have to be much more active in order to obtain the funding in question.

Only about 10% of the investments mobilized under the fund are in Central and Eastern Europe. This is particularly worrying, given that most less developed regions are located in this part of the EU. It is therefore crucial that, in the continuation of the EFSI, measures are taken to geographically diversify projects so as to ensure complementarity with traditional cohesion policy instruments.

Consequently, there is no Council position. Indeed, there is not even a Commission proposal on the table. That being said, I would like to underline that Europe is open for business and that foreign investment remains a key principle for the EU. We need investment as an engine for growth and job creation. We encourage others to invest in the European Union and our investors are very successful abroad. But clearly in the last year some reasons for concern have emerged and these are related to the sharp increase in foreign acquisitions of significant value in key EU economic sectors. I am thinking of industrial machinery and equipment, ICT, utilities, infrastructure or energy. The surge in foreign investment appears less as a result of market forces and more as a consequence of strategic industrial policies by other states. This could compromise fair competitive conditions across the EU and put into question our access to technological know—how. As such, these acquisitions could be deemed not to be in the EU’s long-term interest. In this regard, we welcome the debate launched in February by the Economic Ministers of Germany, France and Italy, who in their joint letter to EU Commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmström, outlined their concern that partner countries do not match the EU level of market openness when it comes to investment and public procurement. They pointed out that the EU was losing its advantage in technological expertise due to mass acquisitions from non-EU investors. The three countries asked for more scope to investigate individual takeovers and, where applicable, to block them. We have also noted with interest the proposal for a Union act on the screening of foreign investment in strategic sectors, which was tabled by Mr Weber, Mr Caspary and eight other EPP Members in March this year, calling for intervention at EU level when direct investments by third countries do not comply with market rules or are facilitated by state subsidies, resulting in a likely market disturbance.  Finally, the Commission, in its reflection paper on harnessing globalisation, also noted the concerns recently voiced about foreign investors, notably state-owned enterprises, taking over European companies with key technologies for strategic reasons. In its reflection paper the Commission further underscored that EU investors often do not enjoy the same rights to invest in the country from which the investment originated. It is very clear that the way we address investments in strategic sectors will require necessary attention in the future. In the Council we will follow the developments on this subject with interest and remain ready to carefully examine any proposal the Commission puts on the table.

We have always welcomed foreign direct investment and openness to investment has always been a key principle of our trade policy. As a consequence, the US is the most favourable framework for investment in the world and is a major promoter of open, transparent and predictable conditions for investment worldwide. This policy has positioned the EU as the biggest source destination of foreign direct investment in the world.  The Commission however, is also well aware of the growing concerns regarding the perceived rapid increase of acquisitions of European strategic and high-tech companies by companies originating from countries that do not share the same open framework for investments as we do, which maintain important restrictions on foreign investment. The Commission in its recent reflection paper that you mentioned, Madam President, on harnessing globalisation, noted that concerns have recently been voiced about foreign investors, notably state-owned enterprises, taking over European companies with key technologies for strategic reasons. EU investors often do not enjoy the same rights to invest in the country from which the investment originates. These concerns need careful analysis and appropriate action.  We are therefore assessing the real scope of this phenomenon, and trying to be clear about what the real issues are. This may represent a new challenge to EU policy and we need to assess whether we have the appropriate tools to respond to it. This may be particularly relevant at a time when the Commission is proposing a reflection on foreign investment in sensitive defence-related technologies and the opportunity to introduce some control.  The Commission is convinced that an important part of the solution to some of the concerns related to the lack of a level playing field for EU investments abroad should come from our trade agenda, which aims at securing the best possible market access and transparent and non-discriminatory conditions for new investors operating in third countries; but the nature of the concerns requires also to look wider and deeper. Therefore, we are currently analysing the effectiveness of EU policies on foreign direct investment in close coordination with Member States, which are maintaining their own foreign investments screening measures to see if the current framework provides sufficient flexibility to respond to the challenges we are facing. In taking this word forward, we should avoid as much as possible to introduce unnecessary barriers to trade and investment, bearing in mind that the EU economy continues to need more investment, both domestic—that’s the previous debate—and foreign. The Commission is ready to engage in further discussions with Parliament on these important issues.

And China is investing more and more in the European Union - last year 35 billion euros, almost half of which in our key technologies. And they are mercilessly implementing their “China manufacturing 2025” strategy. On the other hand, there are many problems for European investors in China: Restricted, to name just a few examples, is the question of the production of automobiles and motorcycles, valuable metals, banks, insurance companies, telecommunications; Investments in rare earths, in publishing, etc. are prohibited. We want to change that, and we have to play harder there. We are convinced that open markets are needed, but they also need clear rules.

I think I first have to point out that the topic goes far beyond China. It is a fundamental question how we succeed in the long term in actually bringing our companies in the European internal market into a uniform situation that investments in this internal market must follow the same rules as we are already doing today within the European Union via European state aid law, about European competition law and many other rules. We are currently creating an unequal competitive situation for companies from Europe who want to buy companies from Europe in relation to companies from outside. That cannot be in our interest. We want to ensure that the internal market grows together, that companies in Europe unite in order to be competitive with one another on a global level, and that third parties from outside do not make difficult decisions against our interests. The question remains, however: can the Commission in the near future come up with a definition of what we so commonly define as the “European crown jewels” without knowing exactly what is meant by that? Because it is often the case that one country defines a crown jewel very differently than another. That will not work if we want a uniform European approach. And that's what we need.

It is a very wide-ranging issue that must remain on our European agenda. The challenges are common to all Member States. However, their extent, dimension and context differ from one Member State to another. This is why the actions to be taken at national and local level vary accordingly. The most recent Eurostat data from 2015 speaks for itself. Children are most disproportionately affected by poverty. They are the age group at the highest risk of poverty or social exclusion. An estimated 27% of children in the EU 28 are concerned, as compared to about 25% of adults and around 17% of the elderly. The causes of child poverty are diverse and often multiple. The five main factors are: type of household, monetary poverty, the level of education, a migrant background, and living conditions.  But, despite Member States’ commitment to the Europe 2020 poverty reduction target and despite steps being taken to fulfil this target, two further drivers have triggered a general increase in poverty and social exclusion. I am referring to the economic crisis and the phenomenon of inherited poverty. Therefore the fight against child poverty needs to be tackled in its largest possible scope. This means combating exclusion and fighting inequalities in the spirit of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  What measures have been, and should be, taken? Let me first state what is self—evident: no child deserves to be left behind. In our actions we should be led by the overarching concept of investing in children. Our responses need to be multidimensional. In December 2015, this House adopted the written declaration on investing in children and, in February 2016, you followed up on this initiative with a stocktaking exercise. In this context, the Council adopted a set of conclusions on an integrated approach for combating poverty and social exclusion including child poverty. Furthermore, the new Commission initiative on the European Pillar of Social Rights encourages us to further reflect on the provision which sets out a right for children to be protected from poverty.  These issues are very much on the agenda in the Council and will be discussed tomorrow in the Council’s Youth Working Party. The Council is also looking forward to the launch and implementation of a preparatory action on a child guarantee as announced in the Social Pillar framework. In this context, I would like to thank Parliament for its continuous commitment to maintaining the issue of child poverty on the agenda.

However these figures remain worrying, I would say, unacceptable.  That means that more than a quarter of all children in the EU, around 25 million, are growing up in a household which either earns less than 60% of the median income, suffers from material deprivation or is a quasi-jobless household. Child poverty is a multi-faceted issue that demands an integrated and, to the extent possible, preventive approach looking at both the employment situation of the household and the rights of the child. As you know, fighting child poverty is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Commission and my colleague Marianne Thyssen support their efforts through all the instruments that are at our disposal. First, policy guidance, including through the European Semester’s country-specific recommendations, and second, our EU financial instruments; the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). Of the latter, the funding possibilities for children in the existing EU financial instruments have been significantly strengthened. For the current programming period, approximately EUR 21.2 billion of the total ESF allocation was earmarked for social inclusion measures, of which EUR 3.9 billion has been set aside for access to services, including childcare and EUR 8 billion was earmarked for measures to prevent early school leaving.  Moreover, around EUR 11 billion of ERDF funding is planned for measures promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, while around EUR 6 billion are planned for investment in educational infrastructure. The EU funds are also supporting healthy nutrition for children with the EU School Fruit Scheme: EUR 150 million to ensure the distribution of fruits and vegetables in schools in 2015 and 2016.  All these financial interventions are extremely important for preventing and breaking inter-generational transmission of poverty and social inclusion, which is of course the major factor. Moreover, the newly adopted European Pillar of Social Rights puts children at the forefront of social Europe. It acknowledges the need to improve children’s life chances and to enhance children’s rights in the European Union. Principle 11 of the Pillar recalls that children have the right to protection from poverty and that children from disadvantaged backgrounds have the right to specific measures to enhance equal opportunities. It also recognises that children have the right to affordable early childhood education and care of good quality. The Commission trusts that Parliament will join together with the Council in the proclamation of the Pillar by the end of this year. This builds upon many of the policy instruments’ elements contained in the 2013 ‘Recommendation on investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage’, in particular those on parents’ access to adequate resources, activation and quality services On 26 April the Commission published a Staff Working Document to take stock of the progress achieved by Member States in implementing this Recommendation. The experiences collected throughout the last four years show the areas in which good progress has been made and those where there is still room for improvement. Therefore, it should provide a useful guidance for further action at local, national and EU level in the field.  Moreover, underpinning the relevant principles of the Pillar, the Commission has adopted an initiative on work-life balance, which should contribute to a larger and fairer participation of women in the labour market, which is also a key factor since, ultimately, the employment status of parents is one of the key determinants of child poverty. This initiative will continue to reduce the number of children who live in households at risk of poverty.  One last word about the preparatory action for a child guarantee proposed by this Parliament. We will launch a study that should initially analyse the possibilities of such an action to improve the situation of particularly vulnerable children in the European Union, i.e. children in institutions, children left behind by parents working in another EU country, disabled children and children of migrants and refugees.  Let me once again assure you in conclusion that this Commission is committed to addressing child poverty across the EU by restoring economic growth and upward social convergence, fostering job creation and ensuring social fairness. For the 40% of children in some of our Member States that live in households at risk of poverty, we need to come with effective solutions to foster employment of their parents and to ensure their full participation in society. Child poverty and social exclusion not only have a negative imprint on a child’s future but are also a huge waste of potential that our ageing societies cannot afford. We must on the contrary build on our children.

And, in that sense, I do believe that an extra effort must be made for the tragedy of child poverty. And that overexertion is justified all the more as it must be admitted that it is a European problem and in need of European impulse and in need of European solidarity.

Yet it moves, grows, transforms our society, our ways of living and working. It builds extraordinary opportunities and, at the same time, risks undermining established legal and social categories. Thanks to the digital revolution and online platforms, with one click we can rent a room anywhere in the world, share a car trip with someone, buy a meal from a neighbor, find a gardener to cut the hedge. Opportunities that consumers increasingly appreciate and use. The collaborative economy arises, on the one hand, from technological innovation, but, on the other, from the increasingly widespread need for a better use of resources, with the effect of stimulating the biodiversity of the economic forms of society. A mosaic of different experiences that see large platforms as protagonists, now real multinationals, and small start-ups strongly rooted in the territory and in the reference communities. In recent years, the collaborative economy has developed in Europe more with the judgments of the courts and with national and regional regulations, often contradictory, than on the basis of a shared strategy, giving us a fragmented market and provisions that are difficult to interpret by operators. . For this reason, the Commission's attempt to define a common approach with its communication is to be welcomed. Our report has the ambition to go further, considering a European strategy to be indispensable. First of all, we invite the Commission to examine the existing legal framework, evaluating the advisability of introducing general principles and specific rules that can favor harmonious development. The goal must be to avoid that different rules apply to similar services between traditional and collaborative economy, both for how much it concerns access to the market as well as with regard to taxation, thus ensuring fair competition between online and offline operators as well as between these and the so-called prosumers. The distinction between professional and non-professional is an essential point for defining fair and balanced rules. Evaluating the market access criteria can represent an extraordinary opportunity to simplify the rules even for operators of traditional services. Furthermore, we believe that a common legal framework can foster the growth of European platforms, which today see uncertainty and fragmentation of rules and the unavailability of risk capital as the main obstacles to growth on a global scale. This is demonstrated by the fact that among the top ten platforms producing economic value in Europe only one is European. Online platforms, the engine of the collaborative economy, cannot ignore the assumption of greater responsibility towards consumers, through clear information, towards service providers, guaranteeing the reliability of ratings, and towards public authorities through fair tax cooperation. Finally, the collaborative economy can represent a stimulus towards new employment, in particular for the population groups with a lower rate of employability. However, it is not conceivable that in this sector workers, whether they are employed or self-employed, have fewer rights and protections than everyone else.

The most important thing now is to create a region of Europe that encourages companies to innovate and invest in Europe and to grow and develop their business here. We had a very broad consensus with the shadow rapporteurs and the various groups that we need to create fair competition and a fair, encouraging market environment throughout Europe. We know that the platform economy has benefited a great deal, both consumers and businesses. It has brought a whole new marketplace for goods, services and digital content. The role of platforms today is also very central in the distribution of news, advertising and cultural content, and of course in social interaction between people. For small businesses and startups, online platforms have brought a whole new marketplace where they can offer their own products and services around the world. They have brought a lot of new business models to us as well. In the same way, they have brought new jobs and thus been able to promote the formation of new businesses. For consumers, the digital platform economy has brought more choice, price competition and comparability. We have a great many positive opportunities ahead of us. But on the other hand, we also have big challenges in how to develop Europe precisely as a place where it is worth growing its own business and where thriving online platforms also emerge. The key here is now to be able to create a more level playing field across Europe, increase fair competition and transparency, and an innovation-friendly environment that encourages brainstorming. Of course, our decision-makers need to make sure we have a good digital infrastructure that takes this into account now future requirements and how much demand for online services is constantly growing. The big challenge is to remove barriers to the internal market, both in technical and economic terms, that still limit pan-European activity. We know that there are still big differences between Member States. The current challenges and difficult issues that we discussed very much with various representatives and groups during the preparation of the report relate precisely to the need for separate regulation of platforms or whether sectoral legislation is sufficient and a better option, and whether the e-commerce directive and competition law are sufficiently appropriate. also in today’s digital world and what is the responsibility of intermediaries for the content and services that are shared on these platforms. Personally, in terms of regulation, I think it is important that we do not succumb to over-regulation in Europe. It is better to approach online platforms on a sector-by-sector basis and to go in the same way here in the online world as in the offline world, specifically by sector, to look at legislation and operating conditions. A great deal of legislation is currently being examined to see how well the law fits into today's digital world. This must now be encouraged by all the Member States and also by the Commission. We often know that we already have legislation, but it has not been implemented well enough. Here we have efficiency across Europe. As far as the liability of intermediaries is concerned, we have the e-commerce directive and the intermediary limited liability systems for illegal content, and they work very well when it comes to trade in goods. But we also have a lot of new challenging phenomena, such as hate speech and false news, that have brought new challenges. Here, new guidance is now needed from the Commission to make platforms more aware of how notification and removal procedures should apply.They also need to learn more about voluntary means of tackling illegal and inappropriate content.It is clear that the platforms cannot and do not want to take on the role of the Truth Commission, but the right balance must be struck between how we prevent lawlessness and at the same time safeguard freedom of expression.Here, it is important that the platforms work closely with legislators so that we find a good balance.I believe that consumer confidence is even the cornerstone of a thriving platform economy.I would like to warmly thank all my colleagues and all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation in this very challenging cooperation between the two committees, and I would also like to thank the Commission for its good cooperation and the proposals you have already made and are preparing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 355, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Philippe JUVIN", "mepid": "96884", "text": "protractor. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there has been a lot of talk so far in this debate about platforms and the digital economy. I obviously share all the elements that have been said. The question regarding platforms is both simple and complicated. Platforms are the key to the modern economy. They have huge benefits for consumers who can compare, who can buy, and who have a freedom that they did not have before. They are an extraordinary opportunity for education and access to knowledge. We remember when we were students, when we didn't have these platforms and we had to spend hours in the library. All of that is over. Our whole society is evolving thanks to platforms. They are a positive and wonderful tool. At the same time, the question we are asking both Parliament and the European Commission is whether these platforms should be the subject of a certain number of common rules in all the States of the European Union. . The first question is that of the homogenization of European rules. It is obvious that if we want a digital single market, we will have to have common rules and definitions in all the States of the Union. We have to talk about the same thing everywhere. If we do not make this effort to homogenize European law, including on definitions, we either submit to a fragmentation of the law and therefore to a weakening of platforms and the European economy, or we submit to the right will of the judge who, through case law, will make the law evolve, which we do not want. The second point, which is a key point, is the question of the responsibility of the platforms. You know that today, platforms see their responsibility engaged according to rules that were enacted more than fifteen years ago. The world has changed in fifteen years. Back in the day, we used to talk about an active host and an inactive host. Very clearly, this distinction no longer reflects reality. There are now many platforms that no longer just store data but select it, recommend it, reference it and monetize it. Our old rules are no longer appropriate, we must change the platform liability rules. The third point is the question of the protection of the users of these online platforms. It is essential to gain the trust of these users, that is to say, there must be transparency, a level playing field and a high level of data protection. We remember the case of the blacklisting, by a large host, of a British company, which could no longer be visible on the market because this large host, which is a platform, had decided to promote their own business, which had the same economic activity. There must be transparency and the rules must be fair and shared. The fourth point concerns the issue of platform taxation. It’s something fundamental. To move quickly into a complex subject, we want it to be simple - and Parliament, I hope, will support this proposal tomorrow through its vote on our report. Platforms have to pay taxes in Europe, where they have their customers or users. Then, of course, the question of VAT arises. VAT is a very smart old tax, except that it is totally unsuited to the digital economy, and in particular to the platform economy. We need to invent a new tax system that will boost this new economy. Finally, there is the issue of B2B relationships. We can clearly see that everything must be done to prevent the platforms that dominate very often concentrated markets from imposing unfair to entering companies.We want to avoid this.The market cannot regulate everything and we are waiting for the Commission to make proposals to us.As you have understood, my dear colleagues, the real question we are asking ourselves, with Henna Virkkunen, is whether we want a digital single market, if we want real European digital sovereignty, if we want to see the emergence ofEuropean champions, if we simply want to participate in the development of a new economy through new definitions and new rules for platforms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 356, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Joachim SCHUSTER", "mepid": "124837", "text": "Draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, dear Commissioner!

We must ensure that the minimum wage and collective bargaining agreements also apply here and that online workers are included in the social security systems. Clarifications at European level are necessary for this. All work in the platform economy is carried out either by employees or by the self-employed. And whether they are dependent employees must be determined on the basis of facts. On this basis, the same social and labor rights must then apply as in the traditional economy.

Almost every part of our lives has been transformed by these new technologies: the way we communicate, access information and media, the way we book a hotel, navigate around a city or order our dinner. Almost exactly one year ago, the Commission set out its thoughts on online platforms in general and on the collaborative economy more specifically. I welcome the opportunity given today to respond to Parliament’s report by MEPs Mr Danti, Mr Juvin and Ms Virkkunen in response to our communications shaping the debate at EU level.  First on a collaborative economy: the Commission welcomes MEP Danti’s report. It provides a balanced view on current developments in the collaborative economy. We agree with Mr Danti that to facilitate the development of the collaborative economy, we need legal clarity and we should avoid regulatory fermentation in the single market. We need to ensure that the collaborative economy is not unduly restricted. I would like also to recall that the Commission adopted a Communication in June 2016 providing legal guidance and policy recommendations on how to ensure the balanced development of the collaborative economy. The Commission will continue working with Member States and stakeholders on this matter. We also agree with you that peers offering services on a private and occasional basis are different from professional services providers’ thresholds, although precisely defining them is difficult. Identifying peers can contribute to establishing a clear and proportionate regulatory framework. The Commission takes note of your call for a level playing field. We think that it is for consumers, not regulators, to choose which service they prefer. EU law requires that national regulation is justified and proportionate. This means taking into consideration the specificities of the collaborative economy whilst not favouring one business model over another. I want to acknowledge the need to ensure social protection for the self-employed, as you do, under the European pillar of social rights. This topic will be subject to consultation with social partners. Finally, I wish to call upon Parliament, Member States and stakeholders to work together to enable users and consumers to choose the service they want and to seize the opportunities that the collaborative economy offers. Secondly, on platforms. The platform economy is now a major feature of the digital transformation across the entire world. More than two billion people are using social networks, a number expected to reach three billion by 2020. The report by MEPs Mr Juvin and Ms Virkkunen rightly acknowledges the positive impact of online platforms and reaffirms the need to further promote the emergence of new online platforms in Europe. The report supports the Commission approach – that is how I read it – of first looking at better enforcement of existing instruments before resorting to designing new rules, which should be targeted to specific problems.  As part of the digital single market strategy, the Commission undertook to carry out an in-depth assessment of the role of online platforms. The Commission’s Communication on the digital single market mid-term review, adopted recently on 10 May, announces a number of actions that will tackle some of the main issues raised in your report. We need to safeguard a fair, predictable, trusted business environment in the online economy. Sellers should benefit fully from platforms and at the same time, platform businesses should be able to start up and grow in Europe. This is why I warmly welcome your strong support for the Commission’s ongoing work on platform-to-business (‘PtoB’) trading practices, impact assessment for action still to be proposed in 2017 and intermediary liability. The Commission will make sure that any possible policy intervention is first targeted, i.e. specific to online platform ecosystems; secondly, problem—driven, that means addressing clearly identified problems; and thirdly, with a light touch i.e. without laying down detailed sector-specific rules in EU legislation. Finally, the Commission can echo your conclusion that the intermediary liability regime is a crucial pillar for the EU’s digital economy. The Commission remains committed to keeping a balanced and predictable liability regime and it is currently working on guidance to eliminate certain flaws in its enforcement, including to allow online platforms to comply with their responsibilities, and the rules on liability enhance legal certainty and increase user confidence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 359, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Tania GONZÁLEZ PEÑAS", "mepid": "127330", "text": "Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Madam President, to understand the transformations in the world of work in the 21st century we have to distinguish between the collaborative economy, which includes solidarity and altruistic forms, and online service platforms, which is a business sector like any other. I think this distinction is not clear enough in the report and we run the risk of camouflaging one thing as the other. From the European Union we have to influence the need for a regulatory framework with guarantees that puts an end to violations within a sector that, with great growth prospects, what it is doing is camouflaging precarious employment and unprotected employment in a kind of opportunities youth work or entrepreneurship. Offering low-cost services, saving labor costs and promoting precariousness and unfair competition, is not a good strategy, nor does it offer guarantees to the consumer or whoever works.

But we have to regulate precisely to avoid a double legal reality in the digital world with respect to the traditional world. Those who seek a parallel job market, protected by the digital economy, are deeply mistaken: digitization cannot come hand in hand with a greater precariousness of employment. And, for that, we have to ensure that people who work through online platforms have the same wages, the same social protection, the same social security and the same coverage as workers in traditional media.

We also have to guarantee consumer protection, data security protection, and also clarify the responsibility of the platforms, which are not mere intermediaries, but are active agents in the economy and in society.

For that, there cannot be a one—size—fits—all approach to the sharing economy – especially for platforms. No two platforms are the same. You would not regulate banks and gardening centres in the same way, so why are we doing that with platforms?  Platforms are disruptive, but that is good. They offer new flexible employment options and better choice for consumers. The sharing economy matches unmet demand with unused resources; it is an economist’s dream. We want European platforms, but consumers do not care where the platform comes from. They want a good service, and the sharing economy empowers consumers in a way that has never been seen before. It also empowers workers. If platforms lose trust, they lose business and they lose their workers, so we need to be very careful in how we go forward with this.

The time has come to embrace the digital revolution.

Well, let's start working on a specific issue, on an important issue, that of the definition and clear distinction between professional and non-professional operators. It is a first issue on which we could immediately work and find guidelines that serve to orient the debate, to juridically orient the European framework. I think we must avoid a debate between who is over-regulated and who thinks that the free market can just guarantee. I think we must instead work on a European framework because, if the rules we have today had been sufficient, we would not have found ourselves today with 28 national legislations, with 100 regional legislations, with each city deciding as it sees fit with respect to the issues and challenges that the collaborative economy, in some sectors in particular, highlights. So I think we should think about this, about how we can help the collaborative economy to be a strength of the European Union's development. We have peculiarities in our collaborative economy, we have small platforms very rooted in the territory. Let's make this a strength, give it the strength to be able to develop. This certainly passes from a more homogeneous regulatory framework and also passes from resources and risk capital that we will have to put in place. This is the challenge we have. It is a difficult challenge. European platforms lack neither intelligence, nor creativity, nor innovation, nor technological capabilities.

Here, quite a few people in their speeches called for and demanded new legislation. It is quite clear that the digital economy brings us new types of challenges, but it may not always be the right solution to increase legislation, but it is important to evaluate our existing legislation and ensure that it is properly implemented in the various Member States. For example, competition law is a very important tool when it comes to large online platforms, but its implementation needs to be speeded up and the resolution of these cases needs to be speeded up in the digital world. Here the Commission has gone in the right direction. Another very important directive for us is the e-commerce directive, which already makes it clear that if content is illegal, platforms must remove it. It must now be borne in mind that, in different Member States, slightly different things have been defined as illegal. For example, at the moment, the big challenge we have is hate speech. Its definition in the various Member States has proved to be very different, and even platforms have a very demanding task within a few hours of deciding what is hate speech and what is not. Here we need to find the right balance so that we do not jeopardize freedom of expression, but nevertheless ensure reliable and correct content. Here, too, platforms can take on a lot of responsibility and evaluate their own practices. It is clear that consumers need to be properly protected, but I believe that, above all, we need to invest in ensuring that citizens are also well placed to act in the digital world. It means that our education must be of a good standard, so that people have the ability to appreciate the products and services that are offered to them in the digital world and beyond, and that they have the opportunity to make a real choice and make solutions.Of course, the own transparency of online platforms also plays an important role here.It is important that we find a good balance between where legislation is needed and what can be resolved through good cooperation with online platforms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 391, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Philippe JUVIN", "mepid": "96884", "text": "protractor. - Madam President, Commissioner, in 1911, in Paris, there was a cab driver strike.

The cab drivers were wrong.

Although I see a rapid growth and increasing importance of the collaborative economy, I am not convinced our legislation entirely responds to the challenges of this sector. Therefore I call for further optimisation of the legislation, in order to maintain the high level of protection of all stakeholders involved. Moreover, we need a clear system of rules that would prevent risks of tax avoidance and unfair competition towards traditional sectors and incumbent actors.  On the other hand, in order to fully benefit from the potential of the collaborative economy, the EU should promote a culture of sharing and assist providers of collaborative platforms to gain the trust of mass markets.

At the same time, however, so-called co-consumption has challenged well-established economic models in many sectors such as transport, accommodation, catering, services, retail and finance. Accordingly, there have been demands for detailed regulation of the collaborative economy to be developed as soon as possible.

The result is a blurring of the traditional boundaries between the consumer and supplier, employee and self-employed person, as well as professional and unprofessional service provision. This presents a challenge to EU legislation in many respects. One of the positive effects of the collaborative economy is environmentally and socially sustainable economic development. To maintain such development, it is necessary to ensure consumer protection independent of the level of professionalisation of the service provider. It is equally important to protect employees of enterprises who, due to the atypical legal nature of their activity, may not yet be subject to appropriate labor laws.

State aid rules facilitate this process more than they oppose it. First of all, I want to clarify an important point, which is that the rules on state aid apply to aid which distorts competition. Therefore, the control exercised by the Commission is limited to the economic activity of the ports. The Commission has neither the power nor the intention to prevent Member States from compensating ports for the cost of tasks falling under the prerogatives of the public authorities. This applies for example to security or - this is in the sense of my portfolio - to activities related to customs controls or the police. Such compensation is simply not state aid. However, even when the aid relates to economic activities, the rules on state aid help to facilitate investment. Recently, the Commission defined clear criteria in the General Block Exemption Regulation which allow Member States to support the realization of certain investments in ports without requesting prior authorization from the Commission. The new regulations apply equally to all ports, whether they are under the control of private or public shareholders. It is based on the well-established decision-making practice of the Commission on aid for investment in ports. In all of the cases it has dealt with to date, the Commission has approved state aid, after verifying that it was limited to what is strictly necessary to generate the investment. The new regulation now gives Member States more clarity and also more flexibility when granting aid to ports. Member States may carry out public investment of up to 150 million euros in seaports and up to 50 million euros in inland ports, with full legal certainty now. Public authorities can also finance dredging costs, as well as access waterways. The regulation on port services, which entered into force on March 24, introduced, moreover, a requirement of financial transparency, which facilitated the inclusion of port investments in the general block exemption regulation that I mentioned. . As you can see, the Commission has therefore recently made it a lot easier to invest in ports under state aid rules, but, you know, it is in its role when it ensures a level playing field. fair, fair competition, in this economic sector which is quite significant. This is why the Commission is taking a closer look at corporate tax exemptions for public and private ports. These exemptions are very different from the investment aid that the Commission facilitates. Indeed, they are not targeted on the financing of certain investments, certain costs. They are not transparent, nor do they pursue an objective of general interest, such as the promotion of mobility or multimodal transport. In fact, tax savings - and that's the point - can be used for any type of business. These exemptions, in our view, are also not fit for purpose, as they are not limited to what is necessary to make the investment which, again, is the virtuous aspect of port economy. On the contrary, corporate tax exemptions are proportional to profits. This has a completely paradoxical effect, which is that the small loss-making ports, those ports which have arguably the most in need of support, are deprived of any benefit, while the larger ports, which are the most profitable, derive the greatest benefit. It's a bit of the world upside down, and it doesn't seem justified or fair. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission must precisely guarantee a level playing field in the internal market. That’s why we’re looking at the corporate tax exemptions for ports in more detail. Of course, the Commission treats all Member States on an equal footing when applying state aid rules. The surveys, which started in 2013, showed that most Member States subject the economic activities of their ports to the normal corporate tax regime. The Commission is currently studying the tax regime in several Member States where this is not the case. These investigations are not all at the same stage. The reason is that the Commission was not informed at the same time about the tax measures in the different Member States. For example, she became aware of the tax provisions in the Netherlands during a larger investigation into the tax exemption for public enterprises, a few years before she learned of similar measures taking place. applying to ports in other Member States. The Commission has also focused its action on Member States where competition concerns warranted swift action. It has made good progress in its investigations into French and Belgian ports. It has also made progress in examining possible tax advantages for ports in other Member States. No final decision has yet been adopted in these cases. I am fully aware, as well as my colleague Margrethe Vestager, whom I represent here, of the demands of this Parliament calling on the Commission to disclose Member States' responses to our questions on ports and taxation. I would like to stress that the information Member States provide to the Commission during state aid investigations is protected and confidential, in particular as long as the Commission has not brought such investigations to an end. Of course, the Commission remains committed to explaining its approach to ports to this Parliament, as I am doing today. It will inform the European Parliament as soon as it has completed the additional inquiries into tax exemptions for ports. She also stands ready to explain to you how she facilitates investments in ports, as she has done in the General Block Exemption Regulation, as well as in many state aid cases. That is why I thank you for raising this question, which, I think, allows to bring all the useful clarifications, in any case all those that are possible at this stage, and I wait of course with a lot of interest the debate which will follow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 399, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - The day is coming to an end, but we still have to deal with a tough bit of food at the moment.

As the EPP Group, we are pleased that the general exception has been increased, so that there is less of a question of state aid, but I do have a great need for a comprehensive overview and therefore again my question: why have already started three procedures, while the research in its entirety is not yet finished?

You have ports in the hands of the public, so of the government, private ports, and everything in between, and also many different tax systems.

Commissioner, thank you very much for your introduction. It really is like this: What takes a long time will finally be good. We talked for a long time, for several years about the service package for the ports in Europe and about the so-called port package 3, which we recently concluded. Indeed, it was a condition of Parliament that we said: the block exemption regulation must please come. The ports must be released - anything else would be bad for our competitiveness. Incidentally, this concerns all European ports, not just Dutch ones. After the first three speakers, all of whom come from the Netherlands, you could almost think that this is only about the Netherlands, which of course has many ports - but we have in Germany too. I think that what has happened now has turned out very well - I am deliberately not talking about taxes now, but about the block exemption regulation, which we are really striving for. I think it's good that we now know exactly what the public sector can invest in infrastructure and how much without having to obtain any concessions, and that is fixed: that can be 150 million euros per year in seaports and 50 million euros in inland ports - they are also recorded, that makes things a lot easier and is really a piece of bureaucracy reduction. I also think it's good that there was no longer any distinction between initial dredging and maintenance dredging. Of course, it also plays a major role - or is important and welcomed - that there is no longer any punishment and that it is cleared when waterways are dredged into or from the ports, as well as investments in the beginning of the port-hinterland connection, namely for example rails and highways that lead directly out of the ports. I also think so too It is welcomed that in this case the infrastructure for alternative fuels and investments that one wants to make there for ships, for shore power for example or also for LNG, is also covered by the exemption.What I think is a shame is that in this case there has still not been any distinction made between public and general infrastructure in terms of aid.That is still unclear, it would make things even easier.But overall, the competitiveness of our ports has been significantly strengthened.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 403, "date": "2017-06-14.json", "name": "João PIMENTA LOPES", "mepid": "136236", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, it is in the name of the miraculous competition and the liberalization of the single market that the Commission takes an interventionist role in decisions that only the States are responsible for, in defining what their sovereign development policies should be.

I think we should do everything in our power to make our European ports - large and small, also in the Netherlands and France and also in Belgium - even stronger. In the meantime, I think, if I may just mention that, that we should also be aware of other developments in the port domain that are currently underway. Look, Commissioner, what is happening in Greece with the port of Piraeus: more than half of it was recently taken over by a Chinese public company. It would therefore be a good thing for the Commission to tackle such issues as well, and to concentrate on such situations where vital public infrastructure in Europe, in European transport companies, falls into the hands of non-European governments. In the recent European Commission policy paper on globalization, the Commission announces measures to this effect.

Basically, it is clear that we agree that ports are of crucial importance in the European Union. The Commission will continue to do what is necessary to facilitate investment and to ensure fair and transparent competition in this sector. As I said earlier, the Commission is committed to informing Parliament as soon as it has completed the ongoing investigations into the area of ​​corporate tax exemptions for ports. She also pledged to explain to Parliament how she facilitates investment in ports, as she has done in the general block exemption regulation in many state aid cases. I think you will recognize that there is substantial progress there. I have heard your various comments, of course. I want to assure you that the Commission is not in the pay of anyone and that it does its job with complete independence. Regarding transparency, you can request information from states. It turns out that the interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission covers the situation, but there is a question of trust between the States and the Commission. Therefore, I think you can address them directly. There is a second question that has been asked, it is the hiatus between, on the one hand, France and Belgium and, on the other hand, the Netherlands, which is due to the fact, as I tried to explain, that the information was not available at the same time. They were available well in advance in the Netherlands, namely from the 2000s. Finally, the question of sovereign missions was raised. I want there to be no ambiguity on this point. In this regard, states do what they want: sovereign missions are not subject to state aid.

As we underlined then, the 2014 regulation makes use of important innovations, in particular reinforced guarantees aimed at ensuring respect for fundamental European values ​​by all parties registered in the system.

The Commission has taken due note of the suggestions for new modifications which could be made to the rules, formulated by some of the existing parties, by certain foundations and by this assembly.

Let me make it clear that, in many ways, this political system is quite different from what is to be found in a Member State. Then there is the question of European—level political parties and their role in the system, and, in this connection, how these parties should be financed. This financing raises a number of issues. First of all, do they exist, these parties? Well, obviously, the answer is yes, they do. Secondly, should they exist? Well, if we have European—level elections for the European Parliament – as we do – then logic dictates the answer: yes. Thirdly, if these European political parties exist, then can they function in any way that makes sense without adequate finance? Again, logic says that they need financing.  At the same time, the system as it exists – and others have referred to this – can be gamed. Virtual parties, cross—party memberships, ad—hoc groups, etc., have been known to gain access to financing. The regulation should ensure that this practice comes to an end. Both these issues should be resolved in the regulation, and resolved speedily.

In my opinion, it is too late for drastic changes, but I will be happy to be wrong. I would like to draw attention to two aspects which, in my opinion, are very important. Mrs Bresso said here what I really like, that European democracy needs democrats. Sometimes it is not enough to stare a little over what militant speeches are made here against the EU, against women. Of course, full value sharing cannot be prescribed, but I find it completely absurd that EU money is used to pay for parties that aim to break up the EU. I really can't understand that or explain it to my constituents. The second thing when it comes to funding national political parties. There is the greatest darkness under the candlestick, and it is quite clear to many, perhaps dozens of parties, that they are being paid from Russian sources, and we are ignoring this matter, the funding of the national political parties that send their representatives here.
