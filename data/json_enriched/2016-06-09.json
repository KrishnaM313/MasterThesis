[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Martina WERNER", "mepid": "124826", "text": "  Author. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Please allow me to make a brief comment in advance. I would have liked to have welcomed the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Bie-kowska, or Vice-President Katainen. Nevertheless, I hope that they will take our demand very seriously for an industry on which several hundred thousand jobs in Europe depend. And now to the actual topic. China is practicing thought games to develop a train link under the Bering Strait to the US, While Google is sending self-driving cars through the desert. And it takes Europe two years to organise the Shift to Rail research programme. I know that I am provosting a little. Nevertheless, a structural problem for the European railway industry is becoming clear here. On the one hand, Asian companies – primarily the Chinese rail technology giant CRRC – are benefiting from huge economies of scale and a tough industrial policy strategy in China that is geared toward expansion. On the other hand, other areas of mobility, such as aviation and the automotive sector, are pushing ahead and innovating much faster than the railways. It is against this background that this initiative, which we are discussing today, must be seen. Please do not misunderstand me: the European rail industry is strong – the world market share is 46%, the sector employs 400 000 people across Europe, and it is looking forward to market growth of an average of 2.8% by 2019. However, a strong and innovative railway industry is not only in the interests of European employees and companies – COP21 demands and requires an ambitious climate policy. For this purpose, the change to the rail is essential. Low-emission e-mobility has long been a reality there. And for this change, it is fundamentally irrelevant whether the technology comes from Europe or not. The first tram with fuel cell drive may not come from Salzgitter, but from Changchun. Many rail operators are quite unemotional about this. I can't do that. Railway technology has been developed in my constituency in north and east Hesse for 150 years. In the West Midlands in the UK, Valenciennes in France, Olomouc in the Czech Republic, Pistoia in Italy and many other locations, this sector is similarly developed. During factory visits, I spoke to many employees who drive fantastic innovations. For them, we need to ensure that the industry thrives from the big system integrators to the numerous suppliers. That is why it is my position to set the right course from the position of strength in order to be able to carry out the shift to rail with a strong European rail industry behind us. In the steel industry, the right framework conditions were not set in good time. It is now in an existential crisis. It is essential that we avoid this mistake in the rail industry. It must not become steel industry 2.0. The resolution specifically looks at improving the market environment for the railway industry in order to enable industrial growth and new jobs. The content now in a nutshell: First, we want the rapid implementation of Shift to Rail. At the same time, it would also be important to allow research funding explicitly for railway technology outside the joint venture. Secondly, SMEs often depend on a dominant provider. They need more support to internationalise. Thirdly, for small businesses in particular, the fragmentation of the European rail market is an obstacle. The completion of the Gotthard Base Tunnel last week is of great symbolic importance. Rail transport must be thought of across borders. Fourthly, a hugely important point is that, unfortunately, investment is not available in many places. Projects to purchase trains in Italy and build infrastructure in Spain have proven that the EFSI can be helpful – more of them! In addition, the Member States must finally make full use of all the resources available for railway projects through the CEF and the Structural Funds. Fifthly, we want the EU procurement pact to be implemented quickly, with a focus on life-cycle costs. One final demand, ladies and gentlemen, is particularly close to my heart, and I would ask you, Commissioner: please pass this on to Mrs Bie kowska: present an EU industrial strategy! The horizontal approach that you are promoting makes sense, but we still need a communication that sets out coherently how you intend to achieve the 20% target and what role strategically important sectors such as the railway industry play in this. Love Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I hope you will support the railway industry!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am here today on behalf of my dear colleague Commissioner Bieńkowska to talk about one of the industries that best represents the pioneering spirit of the Europeans: the railway sector, and in particular the manufacturers of trains. The improvement of EU industrial competitiveness is a major objective of our policy. This applies in particular to the rail supply industry, where the European Union is a world leader. Let me address your specific questions.  Firstly, on the Shift 2 Rail (S2R) joint technology initiative, the set-up of the Shift 2 Rail joint undertaking has been rather fast compared to previous joint undertakings. It launched its first call for proposals in December 2015. Fifty-six project proposals were received. The grants for the selected projects will be signed this autumn at the latest. The Commission is particularly attentive to SME participation. We are satisfied that one quarter of the more than 450 applicants to the first call for proposals are SMEs. The Commission will ensure the internal coordination of the different EU funding instruments. We will investigate in particular the possible use of European Structural and Investment funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investments for future Shift 2 Rail deployment activities.  Secondly, on SMEs, the areas identified as most important in the consultation on the Small Business Act in 2014 are in fact covered by the Commission’s main initiatives. For this reason, rather than presenting a separate SME policy initiative, we concentrate on ensuring that the SME policy is mainstreamed in all relevant Commission policies, notably the Better Regulation Agenda, the Capital Market Union, the Trade for All strategy and the Single Market Strategy.  Several actions have been taken by the Commission in the priority initiatives mentioned above: the Start-up Initiative, reduction of administrative burden, access to finance and access to the markets. Through the European Semester the Commission pushes for structural reforms in Member States to improve the business environment. Last but not least, the Commission promotes entrepreneurship through the COSME programme and through the European Structural and Investment Funds.  Thirdly, on rail equipment, the efficient and quick implementation of the Fourth Railway Package will be of great value for the rail industry. The package will help European rail manufacturers thrive globally by improving the authorisation process in the EU and by removing the remaining barriers that hamper market access. These will help bring new investments and innovation into the sector and thus contribute to its competitiveness.  The ambitious public-private partnership Shift 2 Rail will be the suitable instrument to provide the rail sector with better attractiveness and competitiveness. Among others, Shift 2 Rail will contribute to: cutting the life-cycle cost of railway transport by as much as 50%; doubling railway capacity; increasing reliability and punctuality by as much as 50%.  Fourthly, on the international dimension of the industry, China has become an exporter of railway equipment in particular to the developing world. The Commission is in continuous dialogue with the Chinese authorities. We are requesting the inclusion of state-owned enterprises operating in the utilities sector in China’s offer in the context of the WTO negotiations. The accession of China to the Agreement on Government Procurement will be an important step to ensure the application of transparent and non-discriminatory rules in procurement procedures. China is reluctant to include important state-owned enterprises, as it claims that its internal reform has first to be accomplished.  Progress in the area of rail procurement is one of the Commission’s key priorities in the Free Trade Agreement negotiations with Japan. Public procurement discussions with the United States continue without clear progress. Strategic partnership and alliances to improve competitiveness, as promoted in the question, are not as such prohibited under EU competition law. The Commission has published extensive guidance documents for companies to set up cooperation agreements that are in full compliance with competition rules.  Fifthly, on industrial policy – the Connecting Europe Facility, maintaining the technological advanced position of Europe is key to retaining its huge competitive position, production and jobs in Europe. In addition to the already mentioned programmes, through the Trans-European Networks (Transport) and the Connecting Europe Facility funding mechanisms we inject EUR 24 billion in EU transport infrastructure. The vast majority of Connecting Europe Facility funding will be for major cross-border projects and projects addressing main bottlenecks on the 9 TEN-T multimodal Core Network Corridors. It will also be a key funding instrument to help deploy the European Railway Traffic Management System throughout Europe. 75% of the Connecting Europe Facility funding goes to rail projects. We want the European rail supply industry to remain an important contributor to EU employment and the economy. European companies have the know-how and the competitiveness capabilities to remain leaders in the world market. On our side we will continue to provide the framework conditions to preserve and improve their competitive position.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Nadine MORANO", "mepid": "72779", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, first of all, let me be offended to see that the Commissioner for Industry is not on the bench of the European Commissioners this morning, for a debate which is absolutely essential because it deals with the strategic area for the European Union that constitutes the railway industry. Nearly 400,000 jobs are affected, 1,200,000 jobs indirectly, in this absolutely strategic industry and the Commissioner is not there... She had already indicated her absence on 22 April in Warsaw, where she was also not present, despite the fact that it was her country, at a strategic meeting also, which brought together the friends of the industry in Warsaw in the presence of the ministers in charge of this sector. Commissioner, I have obviously listened very carefully to you. The groups here , and I welcome the work done by Martina Werner as rapporteur on this subject, have worked together a lot and reached compromise agreements. We are asking you an oral question, and I thought you were extremely light on the unfair competition our rail industry faces with respect to China. Today, in China, the railway industry is totally infused with public money. When China manufactures 200 TGVs annually, in France, at Alstom, we manufacture 13. Therefore, it is clear that china is now easily entering the European market, but we are having a hard time having the same competition, and unfair competition today is a big issue for the Railway industry in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Patrizia TOIA", "mepid": "28340", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Werner has explained very well the key points of our question and also the reasons why we sounded the alarm to the Commission. So I say to you quite frankly, Commissioner, that over and above the individual answers, all of which are valid, what we are asking for and what is lacking – but the interlocutor would be another Commissioner or a Vice-President – is an industrial strategy, a strategy of mobility, a strategy of environmental sustainability that, around all the manufacture of the railway sector, hypocrites what vision Europe has and what it wants to do. It is a sector that reaches almost 50 % of the world's railway industry today, it is also a leader in some places for innovation – Martina pointed them out – but if Europe does not implement a strategy, we will see either the gradual decline of this important sector or the presence of other international operators from outside Europe who will certainly see our European record lost. So, when I say a strategy, I mean an action that brings all these aspects together, because the sector is the mechanical engineering sector, there is a lot of engineering, there is telecommunications, there are all the possible digital applications. There is a whole aspect of connection with SMEs, as well as with large companies. And if this sector is not strategic, I wonder which others, for the European industry that we would like to relaunch.

If our industry is to remain competitive, we need to improve the environment, make better use of the financial instruments at our disposal. We have an important Shift2Rail programme from Horizon 2020 and I am glad that great emphasis is placed on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. Finally, we have taken the first step towards stimulating demand directly in Europe: mainly thanks to the trans-European networks and the CEF programme, but of course our rail network needs further investment.

Madam President, Commissioner, with 46% of the innovation market at the forefront, it has been said, Europe is still the world leader at the moment, but for how long? The challenges we face are known: - stagnation or even recoil of rail in the face of other modes of transport - and I think that unfortunately the political pillar of the fourth rail package is not going to make things better; - weak public order;  - difficulties in accessing research funding for SMEs; - the rise of third countries - Mrs Morano reiterated how much China was in a situation of concern.  It is therefore necessary, in this context, to make every effort to revitalise this sector through investment, for example - but not exclusively - through the Juncker plan. It is also desirable to create a regulatory environment favourable to these investments: defragmentation of the internal market, concrete implementation of the agreement reached at COP 21 and, perhaps also, revision of the rules governing the procurement of public contracts. There is also a need to boost the participation of SMEs in the European research programme; my colleagues have previously mentioned the difficulties of Shift 2 Rail. Commissioner, I congratulate you on the start-up of Shift 2 Rail. It took a year to make the first call for projects, which is purely outrageous, and we are now, in fact, more than eighteen months behind schedule. Finally, the principle of reciprocity with respect to third countries must be ensured to be absolutely respected. Of course, Japan, China, Korea and the United States are still in a situation where their markets are closed to us, while they are making great efforts to penetrate ours. Together, the companies involved must take their full part in this global struggle.

Today there is talk of the railway equipment industry. But there is one thing that always seems forgotten by some of the speakers in this debate: it is that if we are talking about reindustrialising today, it is because there has been a deindustrialisation before.  And let's start here! This deindustrialization had causes and had responsible. It would be, at the very least, unintelligent to try so-called reindustrialisation with the same policies and guidelines that led to deindustrialisation. In fact, it is the liberalisation and privatisation strategies that are at the root of the sector's decline in several Member States that have led to the dismantling of many production units in europe outside, which have promoted monopolistic concentration and led to the dismissal of thousands of workers.  Remember this when you regret the lack of skilled workers in the sector. It's just that they already existed. Now they want a European policy tailored to the major European groups in the sector, to colonise what remains of national markets, to which successive railway packages and European public procurement rules contribute and making life easier for these European colossi in international competition to colonise other markets around the world.  This is not our way and we have made it clear in the amendments we have tabled to this resolution. The defence of the European railway industry requires a strong public role and investment.

Why does it not take the opportunity to make it clear that the Commission is taking the matter seriously? The previous Commission was already further ahead in industrial policy than the Juncker Commission is. The industrial strategy must become a priority. But industrial policy does not mean \"more and more access to more and more public pots.\" Industrial policy means changing competition law, correcting merger control in Europe that is too narrow, but also making greater eye-catching the world market.

Madam President, Mr Werner's report deals with a key sector of industry in our countries, France and Europe, namely rail.   This sector, which is particularly essential for employment, is in difficulty because of the destruction of a public monopoly present in our countries. You want to open up our public sectors to all the winds of globalization in free and undistorted competition. However, Canada, South Korea and tomorrow China, which have kept their public service, will win contracts on our continent in the name of that competition. Competition distorted by these sovereign countries which already use all the weapons in their possession to deny us access to their market.  Moreover, your policy of unilateral sanctions against Russia calls into question rail projects that could benefit European companies.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her The controversial law regulating non-governmental organisations in Cambodia, LANGO, has long been at the centre of human rights criticism. It was foreseeable that the use of LANGO would invite unjustified action against human rights defenders in their own country. It shows a kind of pattern to complicate public protest and criticism of government action. There are increasing sums of statements by official bodies criminalising the work of human rights NGOs and independent trade unions and even trying to portray them as attempts at overthrow. On 2 May, four senior staff members of the established and respected human rights organisation ADHOC were arrested: Ny Sokha, Nay Vanda, Yi Soksan and Lim Mony, as well as Ny Chakrya of the National Election Committee. Peaceful demonstrations for their release were crushed by the police, and there were again arrests of activists.

These events, of course, can also be seen in the context of the 2017 and 2018 elections.

Now again, as described in detail by previous speakers, actions against members of the opposition and civil society are cause for serious concern. Specifically, we have seen what appears to be a continuing campaign of harassment against opposition leader Kem Sokha, regardless of his parliamentary immunity. This has also led to the arrest of four officials and one former official of the human rights NGO ADHOC. These actions are particularly worrying in the context of preparations for commune council elections in 2017 and national elections in 2018. They leave us with the perception of new restrictions on civil society.  The European Union has not been silent during this tense period. The visit of a delegation of the Subcommittee on Human Rights in early April was very timely. A few weeks later, at the beginning of May, the EU-Cambodia Joint Committee meeting was held in Phnom Penh. This is a biannual 3-day event which includes meetings on cooperation, on trade and on governance and human rights. In the margins, the EU also held bilateral meetings with the Minister of the Interior, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with civil society organisations and, of course, with the opposition. Throughout all these meetings, the EU very clearly spelled out its serious concerns about the arrests and about the decreasing space for civil society and for the opposition. It explicitly called for the release of the NGO officials. This call was reflected in the joint statement and in the press afterwards.  Following the Joint Committee, the EU Ambassador continued to approach the government in Phnom Penh, together with like-minded and EU Ambassadors. In Brussels the Cambodian Ambassador was called in. Last week the EU Heads of Missions in Phnom Penh issued a local statement calling on the authorities to stop the judicial harassment and urging them to resume a constructive dialogue with the opposition. They stressed that this is a condition for the legitimacy of the forthcoming elections.  It is our strong view that the Government of Cambodia has a duty to create and sustain an environment in which all political parties can go about their work without fear of violence or harassment. An environment in which robust and frank policy discussion is encouraged, and in which the law is applied impartially.  Also, the European Union has earmarked EUR 10 million to support the electoral reform, and works closely with the bi-partisan National Election Committee on the best ways to provide assistance for the preparation of the next elections. It is indeed important that we support an election reform process with solid guarantees for a real democratic electoral competition.  The elections are still some way away: commune level in June 2017 and parliamentary in July 2018. We are monitoring and assessing the situation on a regular basis. We will consider in due course whether it would be appropriate to observe one of the upcoming elections.

While there have been some positive developments during the past year – for instance, we welcome the activities of the Human Rights Ombudsman – we continue to have very serious concerns with regard to a number of issues. Our most prominent concerns are about political participation and political prisoners. On 29 September 2015, the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) was outlawed as a terrorist organisation and its leadership arrested. At the time, the European Union issued a statement calling for restraint. We also reminded the Tajik Government of the importance of upholding fundamental rights, including the right to a fair trial, even in the pursuit of security operations. Last week, the Tajik Supreme Court issued harsh prison sentences for the 13 leaders of the IRPT arrested, in two cases life imprisonment unfortunately. Again, we made a critical public statement saying that the court proceedings were not transparent and violated the rights of the accused to a fair trial, which is not in line with Tajikistan’s commitments under international law. We also reminded the Tajik Government that clear evidence must be presented justifying the criminal charges brought against the defendants in connection with all the sentences issued.  An open and inclusive law-making process is most likely to prevent radicalisation and political extremism. We stressed these points in several high-level meetings recently: when President Rahmon visited Brussels in December 2015; in Astana at a ministerial meeting also in late 2015; and on numerous occasions – most recently, today on the occasion of the EU-Tajikistan human rights dialogue held in Dushanbe.  In my view, the actions of the Tajik Government clearly have the potential to damage the overall legitimacy of the Tajik political system. This is emphatically not in our interests. Our policy seeks political stability and economic prosperity. As the European Union, we remain a key provider of development cooperation assistance to both Tajikistan and to Central Asia, and we will continue to put human rights and the rights of prisoners of conscience firmly on our agenda.

This debate is definitely timely and highly relevant. When we discuss the situation in Vietnam today, we must take account of where the country came from. Then we see clear evidence of progress, notably in the socio-economic domain. However, governance structures, and in particular respect for human rights, remain areas of concern. The frequent use of controversial national security provisions in the penal code to repress dissent is very worrying. This does not mean that we do not recognise important positive developments. I would highlight the ratification of the UN Convention Against Torture and other Degrading or Inhumane Treatment (UNCAT) in 2015. Vietnam is also a frontrunner in the region regarding LGTBI rights. We also see increasing – and often critical – public debate in social media. In other key areas, however, Vietnam is found wanting: freedom of expression and assembly, of religion or belief, and application of the death penalty. We note frequent cases of harassment and arrest of human rights activists. We also note the conviction of independent journalists, bloggers and victims of land confiscation to harsh prison sentences for peacefully expressing their opinions. We systematically discuss these issues with the authorities, including at the highest level, calling on the Government to end persecution and harassment and to release all peaceful human-rights advocates in the country. These issues are also addressed through our annual enhanced Human Rights Dialogue. Beyond that, we provide specific support to promote and strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law. As stated in the joint press statement of last December, the EU offers support to Vietnam’s institutional reforms, bringing them into line with the recommendations it accepted in the United Nations Universal Periodic Review. We also stand ready to support the drafting of the Law on Belief and Religion, to ensure its compliance with international commitments, and to support the implementation of UNCAT. The EU wants a strong and prosperous Vietnam: a Vietnam that respects the rule of law and human rights, and honours its international commitments. Let me be clear: the European Union and Vietnam enjoy a close and deepening mutually beneficial partnership, which is based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement. But – as in any relationship – we have our differences, and first and foremost in the critical area of human rights. We are addressing those differences with all the instruments at our disposal.

It provides for the abolition of the verification requirement and measures to facilitate the acceptance of copies of certified documents and certified translations.

Parliament also sought to include similar regulations on school diplomas and certificates, as well as other documents relevant to the employer, m.in. confirming qualifications.

Staying in another Member State, whether shorter or longer, is still hampered by a number of administrative obstacles. Proof of marital status, a certificate of civil status or even a certificate of morality may be required abroad when working, starting studies or even using services. It is therefore a milestone that the EU institutions have managed to reach an agreement and Parliament supports the text in the Council on the simplified adoption of certain authentic documents. By simplifying administrative formalities, the Regulation will soon facilitate the cross-border adoption of public documents and other evidence of marital status, in particular.  The essential achievement of the Regulation is the establishment of multilingual forms. Multilingualism is an additional burden in administrative matters, and forms that can be issued in all EU official languages will change the situation.

At present, the length of legal proceedings before the General Court is disproportionately long. That is why solutions have been sought over the last few years to speed up management. The simplest solution is to increase the number of Judges of the General Court. However, for political reasons, it was impossible to increase the number of judges by judges only from certain States, so that some states were more represented in the General Court than others. Therefore, in the end, a solution was adopted under which the number of judges would be doubled, i.e. to 56, so that each Member State would be represented by two judges before the General Court. However, as this will increase the number of judges more than necessary, the Civil Service Tribunal, which currently has seven judges, will also be abolished. This will stabilise the number of judges to the necessary level when the General Court also takes over the public service tribunal's agenda. Judicial reform is already underway, but it was necessary to give the European Parliament's consent to the transfer of the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Tribunal to the General Court. At the same time as this proposal, the European Parliament has also promoted the gender balance of the Judges of the General Court.

However, it has been found that the number of cases submitted to this fore instance is relatively small, so this proposal for a Regulation resolves this resource inefficiency by allocating human resources, in particular judges, from the specialised court to the General Court. Although the existence of a basis for that amendment has been called into question, the truth is that the legal basis results from the contrary interpretation of that treatise provision.

Citizens do not understand the rights that the European institutions and agencies give them, and this is partly the result of the current wave of Eurosceptics. That is why I supported the resolution on open, effective and independent governance of the European Union. I believe that such legislation, although the European Commission does not seem entirely in favour of it, can help to reduce the distance that citizens feel towards the institutions of the European Union. It is in the public interest for the European administration to operate effectively and to avoid both unnecessary production and a lack of rules. Both cases can become very dangerous. More specifically, this proposal is designed to ensure that any decision to start a new administrative procedure is accompanied by the provision of sufficient information to the relevant parties.

The favourable economic situation is based in particular on a high level of investment in railway infrastructure, effectively supported by European funds. However, there are already serious risks on the horizon to the sustainability of production and, consequently, to the level of employment in this sector. The pressure on European producers by Asian companies, which receive significant public support and are gaining further foothold in the EU public procurement market thanks to low prices, is a huge challenge. An important challenge will be to change the financing model for investments in the next budgetary perspective, which will undoubtedly lead to a reduction in the amount of funds available to Member States.

Article 218 of the Lisbon Treaty strengthened Parliament’s role in the conclusion of international agreements, generalising the application of the consent procedure and providing that Parliament is to receive enhanced information in the process leading to the conclusion of an agreement. The Framework Agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission details these provisions in paragraph 23 and 24 and, in particular, in Annex 3, as further confirmed by the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union, for example in case C-658/2011, Parliament v. Council. This case law has made clear that Parliament’s right to be informed is not limited to requests for information made just by Parliament, but obliges the other institutions to take the initiative. In September 2014, in the written answers to the questionnaire in the preparation of the hearing on the selection process for Commissioners, Commissioner Avramopoulos referred to his intention to keep the LIBE Committee fully informed on the negotiations on international agreements, according to the Treaty provisions and in line with the Framework Agreement.  The LIBE Committee welcomes the information it has received from the Commission services further to its request. However, we understand that the practical implementation of these Treaty provisions could be further improved, and this on the basis of Article 218(10). So under this framework, in this regard, the LIBE Committee asks the Commission to kindly reply to the following questions.  First, what measures does the Commission intend to take to fully live up to the Treaty provisions and the case law in order to improve the current system of informing Parliament on the negotiations of international agreements, thereby guaranteeing that the required information is automatically transmitted to Parliament in an exhaustive manner and this at all stages of the procedure?  Second, how does the Commission aim to ensure that the regular transmission of all relevant information on negotiations contains, at the minimum, indications as to the third country in question, the type of agreement, the stage of procedure and the relevant documents, such as those mentioned in point 5 of Annex 3 of the Framework Agreement? Is the Commission preparing to set up a permanent mechanism in order to strengthen Parliament’s role in this very crucial and sensitive area?

As you know, in the context of the new Inter-Institutional Agreement for Better Law-Making, Parliament, the Commission and the Council have made a commitment to meet within six months of the entry into force of the inter-institutional agreement, in order to negotiate improved practical arrangements for cooperation and information sharing. This trilateral approach reflects the fact that the obligation to inform Parliament fully and immediately falls on both the Commission and the Council, in accordance with their institutional roles. For example, it does not fall on the Commission to inform Parliament about decisions taken or texts adopted by Council. But let me reiterate the importance that we, in the Commission, attach to our obligations under the Treaty and to our existing commitment under the framework agreement: we are committed to providing Parliament with full and immediate information at all stages of negotiations for international agreements. The Commission stands by this commitment and monitors its implementation closely. The framework agreement established the practice that information concerning international agreements should, as a general rule, be provided to Parliament through the responsible Parliamentary committee. In line with this sector-specific approach, the Commission has instructed its services to arrange directly with the relevant Parliamentary committees the modalities for the provision of information and documents, to allow for optimal solutions in this area. The Commission believes that our obligations are, generally speaking, well respected and that Commissioners and their services are doing their part to ensure that Parliament is well informed. This includes the provision of confidential information and documents and the specific arrangements set out in the framework agreement. As regards specifically the work of the Civil Liberties Committee, Commission services have established a practice of providing regular updates to the committee on pending international agreement. Commission representatives have always been willing to come and give an update on ongoing international negotiations, either in camera or in a public meeting, as appropriate. Likewise, practical arrangements for informing Parliament about re-admission agreements have so far included regular presentations by senior Commission officials to the Civil Liberties Committee in ordinary meetings.

The point of retelling these public and well-known facts was simply to point out one rather simple matter: even though over the last decades all of the Union’s institutions have evolved and gained new powers and responsibilities, Parliament has undoubtedly evolved the most. Today it is by right amongst the top four EU institutions in terms of power, the others being the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Council. In fact, in a majority of cases when important decisions are concerned, Parliament has to agree to their implementation, not to mention that quite a few of them may get amended in the process as well. In this instance, it specifically applies to the conclusion of international agreements, something that the Lisbon Treaty has brought to the table. Moreover, not only does the Parliament in this respect possess the power of the consent procedure, it also has to be provided with comprehensive information on the process leading to the conclusion of an agreement in question, meaning that, even though Parliament can ask for specific information when such a need arises, it should be given to it of the other involved institutions’ own accord. In other words, I fully support the implementation of additional and the reinforcement of the currently existing measures aimed at a fully functional operation of the system, whose goal is to inform Parliament on the negotiation process of international agreements. It is, of course, fully understandable that, depending on each and every particular case, information may not be fully available for various reasons. However, the points mentioned in the debated oral question should indeed be a bare minimum. The third country in question, for example, the type of agreement discussed, the stage of the procedure and the relevant documents pertaining to the negotiations.  Parliament does not legally have the power of legislative initiative, something that sets it far apart from the national parliaments in our Member States. But then again, the European Union itself is not a federation or a single state, and Parliament is essentially still a consultative assembly. However, it is a consultative assembly with some very advanced powers unlike those of any other similar institutional body around the world, including the ability to ask the Commission to draft the necessary legislation. So, in this respect, Parliament even has a de facto power of legislative initiative. Committee and delegation hearings and non-binding resolutions have an indirect, albeit quite powerful, influence on the Union’s foreign policy. For example: approval of overseas development grants, EU enlargement etc., not to mention the non-binding quotes on new EU treaties, even without possessing the respective veto powers. All of this makes the Parliament an actor to be taken into utmost consideration. To put the overall idea a bit more simply, thanks to the enormous legitimacy gained through European elections directly from the EU citizens themselves, and due to the long-term constant expansions of various powers through the EU treaties, Parliament has the right to be constantly kept in the loop of essentially every EU-level and international development that concerns the European Union , which undoubtedly also includes information provision concerning negotiations on international agreements involving the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 719, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – I congratulate the rapporteur first on the initiative and would like to discuss his proposed topics for debate. Thus, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens Parliament's role in concluding international agreements, ensuring a more general application of Parliament's approval procedures and improved awareness during the process leading to an agreement. This is pursuant to Article 218(10) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union clearly shows that Parliament's right to be informed is not limited to requests for information made by Parliament, but obliges the institutions to take the initiative. Quite often, however, in practice Parliament's opinion is not taken when concluding international agreements, and this, in our view, by the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists is an outrageous disregard for the rights of the directly elected body, namely Parliament.  The last such case is the agreement with Turkey on migration, with all conditionality of the word \"agreement\". I am sure that all the colleagues present here today, however numerous, are aware of the facts surrounding this agreement, but I would nevertheless like to reiterate that, according to the official statements on 18 March this year, the members of the European Council and the Republic of Turkey, still the Republic of Turkey, signed a joint declaration on migration cooperation, which is formally a non-binding document , which provides, however, for precise mutual commitments of the parties from a political and budgetary point of view.  Here, the so-called \" agreement is that this is a hidden international agreement which, according to Article 218(6) of the Treaty on European Union, should have been concluded only after express approval by the European Parliament. This, honourable Members, means that the draft agreement with Turkey had to be discussed here in this Chamber, to be presented to debates. First, for European representatives to decide whether to have such an agreement and then to discuss the specific texts of this agreement and not to be placed purely and simply as a witness, to a PR action that the European Commission, the Council of Europe and people who are not elected but purport to be European leaders. We are all aware that no such approval for the agreement in question has been granted. None of us have declared, delegated rights to the European Commission and the Council to conclude such PR-ski agreements.  The topic was raised for discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs by colleagues from another political group, and representatives of the Legal Service of the European Parliament took part in the discussion. They expressed opinions that the agreement concluded, the so-called binding value, but they refuse to express in writing. That's very strange. They say there's an agreement, but it has no legal value, it's some KIND of PR message.  In itself, this claim is outrageous. It is outrageous because it recognises something that for a long time all of us European representatives suspected, namely that the self-proclaimed but unelected leaders of the European Union are doing, to put it mildly, shameful and outrageous deals behind the backs of European taxpayers. They agreed to pay a racketeering ransom of billions of euros - money out of the pocket of every European - to an outspoken dictator, such as Turkish President Erdogan, to save them from what they had done to themselves, namely the huge crisis caused by the immigrant wave invited by German Chancellor Merkel. This shameful and non-European deal with an aggressive, arrogant and dangerous dictator, as the current Turkish President Erdogan is no doubt, is trampling on all the so-called \"no-go zones.\" european values. For us, there is nothing more shameful than talking about freedom of speech and aligning yourself with a dictator, as Erdogan is no doubt, who proves every day in practice, on TV, live, how freedom of speech is crushed, how edits are taken, how media are shut down, how journalists are judged, how to shoot journalists in a courtroom when they, these journalists, reveal a disgusting truth.  In order not to be nude, I will give an example of the attack on the editor of the newspaper \"Jumhuriet\" – this is a Turkish newspaper, and its editor is the man who revealed the simple, clear and expected of all the fact that the financing, arming, healing, training of Islamic State fighters is on the part of the Republic of Turkey. And that's why he was asked for a life sentence, and then shot at him in the courtroom. Another example – the takeover of the editorial board of Turkey's largest opposition newspaper, \"Seman\".  I believe that the examples I have set out are an illustrated example of the need for information on such agreements. As a co-legislator, Parliament must be informed of the all details and all stages of the procedures. I call on the Commission to honour its commitments.

In my 12 years of working on international trade, I have never seen such active interest. We, the European Parliament, represent the people of Europe, and if we want to serve our citizens well we must be fully informed. Commissioner, the Treaties are very clear in this regard. The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed at all stages of international agreements. There are no conditional clauses in that sentence. As the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission must fulfil this requirement. Moreover, the framework agreement sets out clearly how this is to be done: Parliament must be informed by the Commission at the same time as the Council, before a mandate is given, during the negotiation and once an agreement is initialled or signed. Again, the wording in the framework agreement on this point is unconditional. It is a requirement. Yet, to this day, we seem to be treated as a second-class institution vis-à-vis the Council. Commissioner, Parliament must be treated on an equal footing with the Council. There can be no transparency if we learn of items only after the Council has voiced its opinions. The Commission’s agenda must not be set in accordance with the Council’s agenda alone. All that said, Commissioner, my Group also understands that this must be a two-way street: with greater transparency comes greater responsibility. Leaks, lies and mis-information can destroy the work of years in a single day. The European Parliament has rights but also obligations – and that too is clear in the framework agreement. We, as a Parliament, must respect the rules of secrecy of documents in order to preserve our mutual trust with the Commission, and respect their decisions on the level of secrecy attached to negotiation documents. My Group knows that rights come with responsibilities: responsible transparency means respecting the rules of the game. In particular, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Malmström on the excellent job she has done so far to push for, and lead, this transparency initiative in the area of trade. The reason I mention the transparency initiative in the trade sector is because I believe that this model could serve as an inspiration in other domains in which the EU negotiates with third countries. Let me give you another example: the recent deal that the Commission concluded with Turkey on the migration crisis. We all knew that it happened, when it happened and what the key points of it were. But the information was not complete: we were left with a lot of question marks, with information coming instead from the media. So I hope you will treat us as an equal partner in the coming years.

That is why this Parliament has had to battle every document, every note it has drawn from the Commission. For this reason, it has been necessary to use the courts to obtain what the Treaties have: Parliament's automatic and comprehensive access to all relevant information for the negotiations of the International Treaties of the European Union. It is not surprising that this judicialization is necessary: we have become tired in committees of inquiry as in LuxLeaks' of receiving papers with censored content, not to mention the resistance to us being able to know the ATCI documents. Even today, partially, biased and secretly, as if we do not have to answer to the European people what the European Union negotiates on their behalf. We need to learn from leaks and press releases of the European Union's collaboration with Morocco and the colonial exploitation of Western Sahara, the violation of refugee rights in Turkey, the delivery of our data to American agencies and the sale of our agriculture, industry and even labour standards through ACS, AECG or ATCI. The situation is particularly serious because Parliament is the only democratically elected European institution. It is obvious that the Treaties must be opened so that, in the affairs of European foreign policy, which combines neocolonial adventurism, subordination to NATO and service to economic oligopolies, it is Parliament that thinks and decides. But in those respects, such as trade agreements, where the right of consultation and decision is already recognised, how can the Commission justify that its current practices are transparent, if the information is fragmented and collects only the minutes of a party, preventing an overview of what is being negotiated, if it excludes certain committees of Members or uses confidentiality as subterfuge so that access is made only in secret rooms where most of the documents, when they are legible, bear the mark of 'confidential' to prevent the debate from moving to those we represent, which is nothing more than the European people? For us, therefore, the debate on transparency is not a purely technical debate. It is a debate about how the European Union has moved so far from democratic principles that its political activity does not withstand light and stenographers. While denied information, Parliament is turned to the means to ensure that, if there were negotiations, it would be to secure democracy, our social rights, our security, always respecting the popular will. If so, why don't we stay informed? How are we going to believe that geopolitical counterparties are not discussed when it is addressed to the revision of visas and tariffs? How are we going to believe that human rights are not the last of the considerations when discussing migrant and refugee agreements? How do you decide where to send our ships and our weapons to protect multinational interests and not global peace? Who is pushing to make the most of each and every trade agreement born in Brussels, the spearhead of the dismantling of Europe's own social model? Who has the most voice? The employer, her experts? Don't experts have ideology? Or is it that the interests of large countries, including the United States, have more voice than the 751 MEPs in this House in preparing meetings and external lines of action?

The question asks whether the Commission will provide, at the very least, indications as to the third country in question, the type of agreement, the stage of the procedure and the relevant documents to Parliament – to this Chamber! It should be of immediate concern to European Union citizens that this is not already the case.  Let me cite the example of my colleague Stuart Agnew who happens also to be an agricultural spokesperson. On Monday 12 October 2015 he viewed the recently published, restricted, agricultural chapter of the trade TTIP document. He had to sign a document stating that he would not disclose what he read, he had to hand over electronic gadgets and cameras, he was only allowed a pen, no paper, he was in a windowless cell and he was issued with special blank paper which could not be photocopied. He was even told that if he disclosed what he had read he would be punished, penalised with a fine and also at the mercy of punishment from Mr Schulz, the President of this Chamber.  If that is what defines the European Union’s definition of transparency and openness on this critical issue of negotiations on international agreements, then quite frankly not only is that a farce, it is unacceptable.  Then we have the case of another MEP, Mr Ming Flanagan. He also visited the TTIP chamber. He also highlighted what was wrong, and he got an email back from Mr Bernd Lange, a fellow MEP, who seem to think ‘that these confidential documents can be consulted on the premises of the European Parliament has been a great achievement for this institution’ and enabled us MEPs to better exert our role of parliamentary scrutiny in negotiations.  Well I do not agree with what Mr. Lange says, and quite frankly for him to even state that when it is quite patently the opposite is just bizarre. Now it is absolutely farcical what we are faced with, but let’s be serious just for a moment. All too often the European Union raises the red flag and condemns secrecy, breaches of openness and transparency elsewhere in the world. Yet here is the European Union saying one thing but adopting the complete opposite in its own backyard, and actually keeping or restricting any information to MEPs. Quite clearly the messages should be from us to the Commission to the Council: Put your own house in order, abide by the transparency that you expect, demand and even dictate from others, but finally restore democracy within this organisation and stop the secrecy and withholding of vital information to which we are entitled, which we are entitled to communicate to our voters , and to which our European Union citizens should be entitled.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 729, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Jean-Luc SCHAFFHAUSER", "mepid": "124755", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are and I am very concerned about Parliament's information rights by the Commission. The veracity of the information, the cross-checking of the sources are the conditions for an informed judgment. Cross-referencing of sources is absolutely necessary for parliamentary work. In fact, as early as 1986, I had supported the plan of our intelligence officials to set up a school of economic warfare, because war today is often economic and it involves the manipulation of information, and this, when I was in the office of the President of the National Assembly. I also think that the work of parliamentary inquiry is fundamental, because we are constantly trying to manipulate us, to manipulate the representatives of sovereignty. I must tell you, however, that the experience of two years in this Parliament makes me doubt our sincerity in the search for the truth. I am not talking about the Commission, it is under the influence, as the work of our investigative journalists in their book Circus politicus, which has also received the international press prize, has shown. This Commission manipulates us with false information from the propaganda of States, commissioners linked to hidden circles of interest that are not European. This propaganda is shameless, scandalous, conducted by disinformation agencies presented as emanations of civil society or by these secret societies working for foreign lobbies. There is sufficient precision in the investigative work done by journalists. I am talking about our Parliament, how we accept the information given, and also have an intelligence eye on the information that is provided to us. We are quantitatively more than well informed but, qualitatively, are we really informed? I'm asking you the question. Our external services, for example, do not work with sources, do not overlap with the intelligence work done by our states. On the other hand, in France, for example, there is a real work that irrigates the national parliament. There is no such work here. Parliament is the place of amplification of propaganda, of the false voice, so-called official. We write reports, we organize meetings, often in all directions, but in the same tone and with the same people, in the same ideological approach. It is not a scientific approach. Our experts, so-called independents, are chosen from the same mainstream of single thinking formatted in the world of fiction versus reality. In doing so, we distill, under the guise of analysis, propaganda and ideology which, once transformed into decisions, explain the harmfulness of Parliament's action which continues the path of lies.  Let us go back to the Commission, it has always been on the side of the policy of chaos propagated by the United States, and this without acknowledging its mistakes which, even today, the American executive acknowledges.  During the war in Iraq, the Commission, and especially its leader, was the faithful relay, the worst amplifier of the United States, and the saboteur of the peace policy initiated by France and Germany. And on the Parliament side, it was no better. I had met President Brok at the time, at the request of France; he was in favour of this Paris-Berlin-Moscow axis, but American policy was followed by Parliament.  In Libya, the Commission and Parliament applauded the fall of a critical but stable regime. Here too, a dictator, and peace, education, health, exemplary for an African country. Today, 50 dictators, war and chaos... In Syria, the same.  In the Middle East, the Commission and Parliament succeed in the feat of being both hostile to the only democracy in the area - I am talking about Israel - while making sweet eyes at the Gulf States which infuse the poison of radical Islam into our cities. In the Balkans, in Ukraine, in the post-Soviet space, the Commission and this Parliament are still pursuing this same policy and are NATO's faithful allies against the interests of the Member States.  This widening without contours or borders raises walls everywhere instead of building bridges between western and eastern Europe, making our continent, not the tip of Eurasia, but an advanced, instrumentalized and vassalized bridge of America.  The Commission has a policy that is harmful, by its information, to our strategic interests. Its choices have always sought to promote free trade and finance at the expense of long-term development in independent and sovereign strategic investment.  I could cite many more examples, but I will not have the time. I just want to tell you an essential point. Europe political arose during the Muslim invasion. This is the first time in history that we have talked about political Europe.  So, gentlemen, you are in favour today of this Muslim invasion programmed by foreign lobbies, as I have shown by the study that was provided to all parliamentarians, presented this week and which was done by the School of Economic Warfare.  If a political Europe is to survive, it will happen without the Commission, and this Parliament will have to be the emanation of national parliaments.

Last June, my PPE colleague Mariya Gabriel initiated a question to the Commission concerning the negotiations on the abolition of the visa requirement for short stays for third states. First of all, I would like to thank Maria Gabriel for this question, because I fully support her and consider her to be very important. After all, in 2014 only 19 of the third countries applied to be added to the list of countries exempt from visa requirements vis-à-vis the European Union. And that number could rise in the future. However, the European Commission, which is responsible for negotiating these agreements, is not alone in monitoring and ultimately approving this process. It is also Parliament that has the power under the Treaty of Lisbon to approve international agreements. And there are several reasons. The main one is the importance of these bilateral agreements and their benefits – strengthening the international market and facilitating investment for both partners. However, we are constantly fighting two procedural problems throughout the process of approving international agreements.  The first is the fact that we Members of the European Parliament have a lack of information on their very content, course and timetable. This is the case for the European Commission, which, however, does not adequately inform the European Parliament. While the European Parliament has the right to obtain information when it requests it. At the same time, however, all other institutions, including the European Commission, have a duty to transmit any information on their own initiative. This is, after all, why Mr Avramopoulos made a commitment to this during public hearings. Unfortunately, after almost two years, I have to say that mutual information does not work. I consider it essential that the European Commission establish a mechanism to ensure the regular transmission of information on ongoing or planned negotiations. We often lack basic information, such as country indication, type of agreement, course of procedure or relevant documents. There is no doubt that, without such data, the European Parliament is unable to strengthen its role in the conclusion of international agreements.  The second problem, Commissioner, which I want to mention here, is the cases of the conclusion of European Union readmission agreements. To this day, there is no system in practice for the European Commission to inform the LIBE Committee of which I am a member of of these agreements in a timely and proper manner. This is despite the fact that this exchange should take place at least twice a year. In my opinion, as in the opinion of my colleagues, the European Commission must address these shortcomings as soon as possible.  Commissioner, it is only through the systematic and more consistent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament that you committed to in your introductory speech that it is possible to reap the benefits that international agreements undoubtedly bring. This is not only because cooperation with third countries is strengthened, but also through benefits for members and citizens of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 733, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Jude KIRTON-DARLING", "mepid": "124953", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and its chair, Labour MEP, Claude Moraes, for taking the initiative to raise this important question. But this question goes beyond the concerns of the LIBE Committee, particularly about readmission agreements. As a member of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), I know how crucial access information is. This is a fundamental prerequisite for us to be able to carry out parliamentary scrutiny, which in turn is our main tool to ensure the legitimacy of the EU’s external action and, in particular, its trade policy.  Ultimately, we need to regain the public’s trust, and this starts with upholding the highest level of transparency, not just towards the general public, but also, crucially, towards us as their representatives in the European Parliament. Certainly, as a former trade unionist, I can see – and I think the vast majority of the public would understand – that some discretion is needed in any negotiation, and that it would be detrimental to disclose certain documents when it is clear that such a disclosure could seriously weaken the EU’s negotiating position. But most people would also assume that discretion should not prevent proper parliamentary scrutiny and that MEPs should have access to all confidential information even when the general public does not.  Sadly, this is not the reality today. The frequent complaints raised by MEPs  – and we have heard them today – and national and regional parliamentarians, that they are being kept in the dark when it comes to negotiations on TTIP, TISA or CETA, are not helping to shift the public perception over what is seen as a series of secretive negotiations. This is why we still have a problem with transparency on TTIP, even though in reality the TTIP negotiations are arguably among the most transparent trade negotiations ever conducted, certainly in the case of my Member State and definitely in the case of the EU. Stories in the media about how limited the access granted to MEPs in reading rooms is certainly does not help and I strongly believe that it would be in the interests of everyone to improve the situation. For instance, as the spokesperson on TTIP for my national delegation, I do not have access to consolidated documents or other restricted documents, even in the reading room. The group of MEPs allowed to see these documents, which include our partner countries’ positions, is extremely limited: less than 5% of all MEPs.  This is just one example of how narrowly the Treaty provisions aiming at ensuring the transparency of international agreements have been implemented by the Commission. This minimalistic approach by the Commission stands in stark contrast with European case law, which has always taken a much broader view of what this obligation to inform entails. It is therefore absolutely justified for Parliament to ask the Commission how it intends to fully comply with the Treaty and guarantee a regular and comprehensive flow of information on international agreements in all areas.  This is not to say that the Commission is the only culprit, and I think it is worth mentioning that we have many problems with the Council, and many problems in terms of transparency around the Council. Parliament could also do things better. For instance, MEPs are not allowed to take notes when consulting confidential documents in the reading room as a result of a decision in this House by Parliament’s Bureau. I very much hope that the Commission will seize this initiative as an opportunity to push its transparency agenda further. Transparency is at the heart of Commissioner Malmström’s ambition for EU trade policy in the 21st century, but it is now time to turn those words into concrete action so that we are able to fully fulfil our role, in terms of parliamentary scrutiny, towards the general public and our constituents.

Mr President, Mr Avraboule, the initiative of our Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties to put this question highlights the problems of opacity and lack of information that exist during the process of negotiating international treaties on behalf of the Commission and on behalf of the Union. Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is clear and there are no misunderstandings, since it explicitly states that the European Parliament is immediately and fully informed at all stages of the negotiation process. Unfortunately, the Commission is not meeting this obligation, culminating in the negotiation process of the famous TT IP.  In the case of TTIR, the Commission followed forms of classical secret diplomacy and it was only after the general outcry of public opinion and the reactions of the European Parliament that information on TTI began, but with the eyedropper. It took the intervention of the European Ombudsman, who launched an investigation into the Commission, to commit Mrs. Malmström for transparency and information on TTP. Finally, following the leak of secret documents from the European Union-United States TTIR negotiations, the Commission was forced to change course and Mrs. Malmström made public statements. However, in relation to TTIR, the unacceptable and disparaging procedures for MEPs exist and continue to apply, as they are obliged to read the TTIR negotiating documents in an isolated area without a mobile phone, so as not to photograph the documents, without even paper, without a pencil, so as not to even take notes. In fact, I would like to inform you, Mr. Avramopoule, that the same is not true of the senators of the United States, who have full and unconditional access. At the same time, the assistants of the United States senators and 700 US experts have access to the TTIR documents. They informed us when we visited Washington as an ECR, and I have mentioned them here before, in the European Parliament.  We therefore call for full transparency for TTIR, because, as the leaked documents have shown, this agreement dissolves European agriculture, poses risks to public health by filling the European Union with mutants and supports the action of multinationals against states and small and medium-sized enterprises. Secret Diplomacy of the Metternich type, since the time of the Holy Alliance, is not accepted by the citizens, it is not accepted by the peoples.

This is probably the main message to the Commission, which is represented here by the Commissioner, that the European Parliament really wants to be a full-fledged player in the preparation of international agreements with third countries. And it is, in my opinion, right in view of how the legitimacy of the European Parliament has been strengthened since 1979, when Members are elected directly and when we, the MePs, represent 500 million European citizens. The Treaty on the Functioning of the EU has been cited here several times today as a fundamental document of primary law, which clearly states in Article 218 that the European Parliament is immediately and fully informed at all stages of this procedure, i.e. in the preparation of the adoption of Union agreements with third countries. I think, Commissioner, that it is clear from this that this information cannot be done solely on the initiative of Parliament, as you indicated a little in your contribution, because Parliament cannot always know at what stage the Commission's negotiations with a third country are at. It is difficult for us to see the experts and the Commission progressing through the various stages of the negotiations. I think, and in line with the procedure and the view of the European Court of Justice, that you should create some kind of permanent mechanism, after all, you have also already talked here about a permanent information mechanism that would ensure that the European Parliament, namely its competent committee and the members of this committee, is automatically informed and able to comment on this when we get to the next stage of negotiating an international agreement. Of course, the relationship is based on the right to be informed, on the other hand, we should stress here that the European Parliament subsequently gives its consent to the international agreement in question, and if the consent is not to be formal, but to be fully-fledged, if we are talking about the European Parliament as a key institution of the European Union with its legitimacy direct choice, then I think that in the course of the negotiations you should no longer just inform us , but you should also be interested to know what the view of MEPs – at least in the committee – is on the issue, if we agree on which direction the negotiations are going, if we agree at all with a certain type of international agreement. I think that this can prevent a blaming in the European Parliament one day, when there will simply be no agreement on a negotiated agreement, and that is because a majority of Members will not agree with it. So I am very appealing to you to really create a mechanism by which you will not only formally trigger Article 218, but which will really make the European Parliament a partner with the Commission and the Council in negotiating such agreements.  The subject of Turkey has been mentioned several times, and I will not speculate here and debate the degree of bindingness of this political proclamation, but I will be very up to date. Commissioner, there was debate in plenary on Wednesday about the European Commission's efforts to conclude agreements with the nine countries of Africa and the Middle East. I welcome the initiative, but since then I have had many questions in the mail from my constituents in the Czech Republic about what such agreements will look like. Will there also be visa-free travel, which is troubling us in the Czech Republic towards Turkey, or will it not? So, as an MP myself, I feel that citizens are interested in what will be in these agreements. I therefore ask the power, in the interests of the legitimacy of the European Parliament, to give us information in time so that we can vote in good conscience for possible agreements.

In fact, many European citizens have come to follow and take an interest in the negotiations of these agreements, seeking to inform themselves and know the arguments resolved, the advantages and disadvantages that may be involved. This is especially true for free trade agreements negotiated with third countries. These treaties have polarised the debate among citizens and have fuelled passionate disputes, many of them ideologically very motivated, which is natural and should even merit a positive appreciation. This makes the issue of access to information about the business process in its various stages particularly sensitive. Not by chance, one of the most controversial aspects, as we have seen here today in this debate, on the subject of international agreements, is that of transparency, which is much mentioned, for example, in the case of the discussion on the Transatlantic Treaty, which we are currently negotiating with the United States. In this context, the role of monitoring and scrutinising such agreements by the European Parliament is of great importance. However, the Treaty of Lisbon has not only strengthened these powers of monitoring and supervision, but has established that, in order to be able to perform this function well, Parliament must be duly informed of the progress of negotiations of such agreements. More than that, the Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the European Parliament's right to information on negotiations is not limited to requests for information submitted by Parliament itself, but must also result from the initiative of other European institutions. That is why the question of institutional mechanisms for transmitting this information is of the utmost importance. And while it has been formalised by LIBE, it also concerns the AFET committee, which focuses on international agreements on the more general dimension of European foreign policy, and the Human Rights Commission, which focuses these agreements on safeguarding and promoting human rights. As president of the Delegation for relations with Mercosur, I have followed and have in mind the need for some degree of confidentiality in the negotiation of trade agreements. Nevertheless, the political action and even some diplomatic action that the European Parliament can take do not commend itself with sporadic information and excessively remote in time. It would therefore be very beneficial for the work, for example, of delegations, this delegation or others, for relations with third countries, in this case with the Mercosur countries, for the negotiators responsible to systematically and in a timely manner provide up-to-date information on the progress of the negotiations on the agreement between the EU and Mercosur, in order to give this concrete example. That's not what's currently going on. Contrary to what is stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon and the regulated in the framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission, access to information remains dependent on an initiative of the delegation. I believe that the fundamental thing in this case is to ensure that, within the limits of common sense, of course, a regular information flow between the Commission and Parliament on such agreements, whether this is done by establishing a permanent mechanism or on the basis of institutional loyalty and respect for the provisions of the treaties and in the existing interinstitutional agreements.

This subject is, I think, quite important, but unfortunately it did not attract the attention of even some political factions in this House on Thursday afternoon, which I find rather unfortunate. After all, even Mr Schaffhauser, as I can very well see, did not wait for the Commissioner's reply after his fiery speech, which I do not consider to be respectful or sufficiently respectful of the Commission's position.  However, on the subject itself. I, of course, fully agree with my colleagues that the Treaty of Lisbon constitutions Parliament's position in negotiating international agreements very clearly. I do not think that there is any condition for fulfilling the European Commission's own-initiative obligation, many colleagues have said so here, I will not repeat it.  On the other hand, I must admit that, in the course of negotiating certain international agreements, it is not possible to fully provide all the data, as my colleague Assis has also said, and I agree with his speech. I had the opportunity to speak to an American diplomat, and he smiled very much when he gave his opinion on the Commission's mandate – there is nothing better, he said, than knowing exactly how far the other side can go. Therefore, my position on informing the public about the progress of the negotiations is somewhat reserved, here I would not want to do too much wrong to the Commission. But what's certainly not acceptable is the lack of information about the outcome of the negotiations. There should be absolutely unequivocal full transparency. And I think that the Commission should also add a little in this regard, it should also accept the wording of the Court's judgments, which say ' you must proceed on your own initiative, you cannot wait only for Parliament's requests'.  In this respect, I would like to conclude my speech by asking: How does the Commission wish to respond to these complaints from the Court of Justice?

It is about how we, the elected representatives and the Commission – called bureaucrats – communicate so that Europe can be better for all its citizens. When this Parliament was first established, I believe it was called a Mickey Mouse parliament, and that is why we have the Mickey Mouse star outside. I am not sure whether that is true or not, but definitely this Parliament initially had no powers, but they have evolved over a period of time. The Lisbon Treaty was very important in that regard – the Lisbon Treaty that took probably 10 years to negotiate and, of course, in my own country, took two referendums to pass. If it was not passed in our country, it could not come into being because it required unanimity.  As a result, there is an onus on us, as legislators because of the powers of codecision, to ensure that the Commission, in particular, is held to account. Over the years, that unfortunately does not seem to have been the position and as a result, sometimes incorrectly, impressions were given, right across Europe through the media, that everything bad was emanating from Brussels. Now you have a potential Brexit which, in many respects, is based on that erroneous assumption, but it was allowed to go unchallenged for years. There was nobody there to put the other side, and Parliament, because it lacked power and lacked information, was not in a position to actually put the other side. Thankfully, that is now beginning to change, hopefully not too late where the United Kingdom is concerned. I particularly welcome the new Commission, under President Juncker, who have made it very clear that they want to be more responsive, they want to cooperate more and they want to work with Parliament. Saying it is one thing, doing it is another and, as people have pointed out, especially I think in relation to Mercosur – Mr Assis referred to it and he was right in that regard – it actually took a debate and a vote here in Parliament to put a halt to some of the unsavoury aspects of that discussion. I think that is a great example of the need, in the interests of the European Union and everybody, for the Commission to constantly inform and to constantly consult Parliament regarding any international agreements. Hopefully that can work out well. TTIP has been mentioned, and actually today was probably the first time I heard a balanced account of the need for publicity, but also disclosure and transparency. Both sides of the House, especially on the left, did acknowledge that you cannot have negotiations in public. After all, you are negotiating with a third country. You can only disclose what they wish to disclose and of course also – and this is very important – what you might start out with as a negotiating position might finish up entirely different when you actually finish the discussions. What would happen in that regard, if every negotiating position was made public, is that the naysayers would have a field day because they would present that as a de facto position, so you could not really have a discussion at all. You would have no discussions and you would have no negotiations, because nobody would want to negotiate with you if you were going to be publishing everything. So I think we are gradually getting the balance right, and hopefully the Commission will do everything they can for more disclosure to inform Parliament constantly so that we can work together so that our citizens are informed that we are here for their good, both the Commission and Parliament.

In particular we should anticipate matters by actually feeding people with correct information before others actually give them the wrong information, which does huge damage, both to TTIP and many other aspects of the work of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 749, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Commissioner, I thank you for your openness to improving cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament. We have repeatedly heard today the demand that the European Parliament be fully and immediately informed of the negotiated agreements, as actually envisaged by the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, and this information is to be provided by the European Commission proactively, not on request. I would agree with the rationale for this request, as presented today by my colleague Jiří Pospisil, who fully captured the situation.  The main point is that the European Parliament has a great responsibility, we vote on some treaties and in some we have the power to consult. And citizens who elect us directly see us as those who have and must fulfill that responsibility. And if we do not want to disappoint them, if we want citizens to respect the decisions of the European Union as a whole, then that decision must be transparent. Commissioner, I would like to tell you that this is not only our request, but you can also see that the European Parliament is also taking more responsibility, and that should be an encouragement for you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 750, "date": "2016-06-09.json", "name": "Jozo RADOŠ", "mepid": "112753", "text": "   – Mr. President, international agreements are a very important instrument of the overall policy of the European Union, because they strengthen economic cooperation, but also strengthen the role of the European Union in the world, in terms of strengthening democracy in the world and affecting crises, especially those that are particularly concerning the European Union. The Impact of the European Union on crises is much less than its economic and financial contribution in various countries, including various international organisations.  On the other hand, the role of the European Parliament is important, as it brings about a stronger democratic process and a stronger involvement of citizens and an understanding of citizens in what the European Parliament and the European institutions are doing, and this certainly increases the quality of international treaties. That is why, I fully support the LIBE Committee's initiative and, in particular, the creation of a permanent mechanism for the involvement of the European Parliament, not only in the adoption, in information, but in the involvement in the whole process, of more active participation in the conclusion of an international treaty.

I feel very lonely tonight. But this issue is very important and I would like to remind all our colleagues here that at the hearing, a year and a half ago, I committed myself to work in order to enhance and deepen inter-institutional cooperation. I never forget that I am a parliamentarian myself, and the fact that I am from the other side does not mean that I do not share all these views expressed here today. This debate allows the Commission to understand better where Members of this House see the need for improving the information about negotiations for international agreements. First Vice-President Timmermans, as the Commissioner in charge of that, will represent the Commission in order to engage, together with the European Parliament and the Council, in a reflection on how to better implement Parliament’s rights, under the Treaty of course: the right to be fully and immediately informed at all stages of international negotiations.  But let me also remind you that the obligation to inform Parliament on international negotiations falls on both the Commission and the Council. Moreover, we cannot disregard or circumvent the need to protect confidential or classified information related to international obligations or interinstitutional agreements. I would like once again to thank you for your contribution to this debate, and for your attention, and to wish you a nice weekend.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
