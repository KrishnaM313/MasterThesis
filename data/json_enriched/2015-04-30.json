The Bank – in our view – is destined to play a much more important role in the future of the European Union because of the need to urgently abandon recession and austerity and to move towards investment and higher welfare quotas. That is why the role of the EI will be essential and this is especially the report this year, also because we are on the doorstep of the start of the so-called Juncker Plan. I will divide my intervention into four blocks, which are basically the blocks covered by the report, the first being investment. The fact that this report was drafted in parallel , as I said - to the Juncker Plan has made this obviously our attention. As you know, my group and I are skeptical of private equity leverage of such a proportion as proposed, from 1 to 15, because, from what we have seen, we have no precedent with such a high factor. In the report, we stress that, moreover, the guarantees for EFSI do not correspond to new funds, but to allocated resources, and we would like an assessment of the reallocation of these resources to see if, in fact, that is better than being earmarked for other use. We also note that the project selection process should be intended to avoid the effects of expelling private capital from projects that are already being done or would have been done the same. We also look forward to the plenary's support for our reference to the fight against unemployment to become a central activity of the European Investment Bank and we also support – because I think it is necessary – that the European Central Bank can go to the purchase of bonds to be issued by the EI UNDER EFSI. The second block of issues covered in the report is the evaluation of the Project Bond Initiative, which has been a good part of our work. I would like to begin, of course, by the first pilot project, which was, of course, the Beaver project. On 26 January you yourself, Mr Hoyer, said in the European Parliament that the Beaver project became a tragedy and I share your assessment. Today we are also joined here by representatives of the Platform in Defense of les Terres del Sénia, whom I would like to pay tribute to for their tireless struggle for the paralysis of the project and compensation. This, of course, was not a project that responded to the common interest. It was paralyzed by more than a thousand earthquakes and a lousy environmental assessment that ignored the expert reports and ended with the intention of compensating a private company with 1.3 billion for paralyzing the work, compensation that the Spanish government now intends to be paid by Spanish citizens in its gas bill for 30 years. We believe – and that is one of the issues covered in the report – that the European Commission and the European Investment Bank must act to avoid this waste. I would also like to transfer to you, Mr Hoyer, a certain unease of the citizens who are joining us here today because of the lack of response to the complaints mechanism office of the Bank. The third block I would like to point out is the energy policy bloc. In this section we recognize the steps taken by the EI in its new policy, with the gradual abolition of aid for coal projects, and insist in this regard on the need to present a plan to end such projects. Finally, the climate assessment that you are going to initiate also seems to us to be a good initiative. And the fourth and final bloc is transparency and accountability. We welcome efforts to improve transparency, but we have been a little disappointed by the results of the transparency policy review. We believe that the European Investment Bank's old culture of secrecy should be left behind – and this is usually pointed out – and that it should be published on the basis of the principle of publication, that is, that confidential should be the exception and not the norm. Finally, I would like to point out that we would like the issue of the use of tax havens in financial intermediations and also the new tax policy to be an important element of the work of the European Investment Bank, and we call on the Bank to refrain from cooperating with financial intermediaries with a negative track record of transparency , tax evasion or tax planning practices fraud, corruption or environmental and social impact. That is why, Mr Hoyer, I would like to end by thanking you for the bank's cooperation and waiting for you to follow the recommendations that the European Parliament will give you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Ernest URTASUN", "mepid": "124972", "text": "   President of the European Investment Bank. – Madam President, let me first of all say that I am very grateful to have been invited to contribute to this debate here today and to comment on the report of the rapporteur and his colleagues on the EIB’s Annual Report for 2013. It is always a little bit awkward to be in 2015 and then discuss the report of 2013, because many issues that are very current in the minds of people and the issues that also the rapporteur has just mentioned go beyond 2013. They are going into last year, this year and then into the future. This is why I will not limit myself only to 2013, if you agree. The Treaty does not provide for this exchange of views, but I think it is only proper that the Bank, given its size and relevance in the global financial landscape and its role within the EU institutional framework, comes to the European Parliament to explain what it is doing, especially with EU budgetary funds, where that is applicable.  First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and his colleagues for the 2013 Annual Report. I appreciate the support you give us – and have given us – to ensure that the EIB, the EU Bank, will continue to deliver benefits for the EU economy and for EU citizens as well as contribute to economic development in our external activities.  Notably, I appreciate your explicit support in the report: on the EIB as a catalyst for financing sound public and private long-term investments; on continuing to implement best prudential banking practices; on maintaining the very strong EIB capital position, and on selection of EIB projects based on their viability, added value and impact on economic recovery. These factors you mention and support in the report are of fundamental importance for the Bank.  Let me start by recapping on what we have achieved since 2013 – the year under review – and look forward into the future, even if that is always a risky exercise. 2013 was very important for the Bank: the first full year of operations following the EUR 10 billion capital increase in paid-in capital approved by the shareholders in 2012. Thanks to this capital injection, the EIB promised to increase its volume of loan signatures every year, over three years, by EUR 20 billion, or nearly 40% in comparison to the year before. I am pleased to be able to report that last year, in 2014, EIB signatures increased further to EUR 77 billion – EUR 27 billion more than would have been achieved without the extra capital and substantially higher than the figure in the report for 2013.  We are now only a third of the way through 2015, but I can already announce that we have completed the additional EUR 60 billion of lending we promised to deliver at the June 2012 European Council. That means, to be clear, when we asked the shareholders to agree to the capital increase that we needed, made in this very Parliament, we said that we would be able to trigger additional investment to the volume of EUR 180 billion for over three years out of a capital increase of EUR 10 billion. The deadline for achieving this is December 2015. We have already achieved it today, and this shows the multiplier which has been there – the multiplier was 18. If we continue to the end of the year, the achieved multiplier will be far beyond 20. We are now in a situation where we have discussed the assumed multiplier for the Juncker Plan and, since we know that we are going to go into more risky business, it is obvious that we have to be a little bit more careful and cautious. Therefore, we have calculated on a very sound basis: 15. We have to be on the safe side, but we are extremely confident that we will be able to deliver, and better. More importantly, because we rarely support more than a third of a project’s total cost, this extra lending has helped mobilise at least EUR 180 billion of additional investments, and that is important. The EU Bank crowds in the private sector in two ways: number one, on the basis of the capital increase, we were able to borrow more from the markets. We go to the markets to borrow EUR 60 to 80 billion every year by selling EIB bonds. The capital increase has enabled us to do much more on this. The second part of the multiplier is the fact that we never finance roughly more than a third of a project, so two-thirds come from other sources. That brings about the multiplier, which we calculated cautiously at 18 for the capital increase and at 15 for the Juncker Plan.  Thus the EIB has delivered the capital increase faster than expected, which enables us to further support the economic recovery in Europe going forward. I do expect EIB lending volumes to be above EUR 70 billion annually for this year and the two next years, thanks to the guarantee in the context of EFSI, if it comes about. This decision lies in your hands, or now in the hands of the trilogue.   Let me turn to some important broader issues mentioned in the report. As the EU bank, we know that the finance we provide is a means to an end. We provide for viable and sound projects where it makes a difference. Unlike a commercial bank, our objective is not profit, but economic and societal outcomes. This is why our lending, anchored within the priorities of Europe 2020, has gone in particular to infrastructure – that is, to strategic infrastructure – climate action, innovation and skills and, above all, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which, as your report rightly points out, are the backbone of Europe’s economy. In 2013 and 2014, the EIB Group – that is the EIB and the European Investment Fund together – provided some EUR 50 billion of new finance for SMEs, supporting over EUR 100 billion of financial investment by more than 500 000 companies that together employ more than six million people. We are conscious that many firms still struggle to get loans at reasonable conditions, and therefore we will continue to expand our offering.  New, targeted initiatives taken recently include the ‘SME Initiative’ signed with Spain, which will combine EIB/EIF finance with EU budgetary funds to support more than EUR five billion of lending by local financial intermediaries. Let me also mention the ‘Jobs for Youth’ pillar, one of the two strands of our ‘Skills and Jobs’ programme, which aims at stimulating job creation for young people by SMEs, with a specific focus on European regions most impacted by high youth unemployment. As a matter of fact, at the informal European Summit in Paris in July 2013 we promised to make available an additional EUR six billion for the fight against youth unemployment within the year 2013, and by December 2013 we had delivered EUR 9.3 billion. It has therefore been a big success story, not only in terms of volumes, but also in terms of the impact it has had on the real employment of young people.  Support to SMEs will continue at a sustained pace in 2015 through our normal business, but also under the Investment Plan for Europe. And this is not only via EIF, but also by EIB. Let me remind you that at least one in every four euro of capacity of EFSI will be dedicated to SMEs and midcaps.  At the end of 2013, the EIB published an evaluation of its SME lending over the period 2005-2011, and we of course stand ready to provide you with further information.  The EIB is committed to supporting the EU’s ambitious energy and climate policy goals. For the last six years, more than 25% of our annual lending has contributed to climate action. Since 2013, we have set stringent energy performance standards that effectively close the door on financing unabated coal power plants. With the encouragement of this House, we were able, in 2011, to launch the European Energy Efficiency Fund, which has already helped mobilise more than EUR 400 million of final investment for a technical assistance budget of just under EUR 20 million. I would also like to highlight the European Local Energy Assistance facility ELENA. With EU grants of EUR 69 million over the past five years, ELENA is well on the way to mobilising EUR 3.7 billion in final investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy schemes in cities across Europe – including this year’s Green Capital, which is Bristol. Together with the Commission, we have recently launched a number of additional products to encourage more private-sector lending for energy efficiency and small renewable investments, and a new natural capital facility to support biodiversity projects.  As a follow-up to our energy policy review last year, the Bank has also this year concluded a public consultation on its approach to climate action. We aim to have reached and published the conclusions before the Paris negotiations – underlining Europe’s strong commitment.  Lending to education is a key pillar of the EIB’s Innovation and Skills programme and is crucial to address the competitiveness gap in the EU. Between 2000 and 2014, the EIB’s lending to education represented around EUR 30.6 billion, corresponding to more than EUR 2 billion on a yearly basis. Our support for education has been strengthened with the launch, in July 2013, of the ‘Skills and Jobs – Investing for Youth’ programme which I already mentioned. The Bank will continue to assess, throughout 2015-2017, how it can best contribute to increasing the availability of state-of-the-art training opportunities for young people, and increase the competitiveness of SMEs and Midcaps which provide employment or training opportunities to young people. In doing so, it strives to complement national measures and the Youth Employment Guarantee programme of the Commission. The EIB is committed to working even more closely with national promotional institutions (NPIs), banks and similar institutions and banks in all EU Member States, benefiting from the NPIs’ local presence and local market knowledge to contribute to EIB lending. Following the European Council request, the cooperation with National Promotional Banks has further intensified. The EIB, together with the Commission, has initiated and enhanced cooperation in four working groups. These working groups are expected to deliver concrete proposals in time for the June Ecofin Council.  In your 2013 report, you stressed that the EIB must continue to be a financial institution of good practice. I can assure you that we do put a very strong emphasis on being a leading financial institution, no – the leading financial institution – when it comes to issues such as due diligence, compliance, good governance and accountability. We are continuously in contact with other international financial institutions, international organisations and relevant authorities to ensure that we apply best banking practices. It is particularly true for the Global Forum initiatives. We cannot afford to slip behind. We need to make sure that our financing is contributing to its aims in the best possible way. We need to lead by example, and we are able and ready to learn. Every year we finance approximately 500 operations, and some of them have many different projects underneath. In a few isolated cases, projects go wrong – sometimes for reasons beyond our control. However, I am very proud that these few cases of failure rarely result in any losses for European taxpayers. Europe also has global responsibilities. This year we will see the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This was a focus of our discussions in Washington this month with other multilateral development banks. We are very much looking forward to the financing for development conference in July. Ahead of the Paris UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) talks in December, climate action will also remain a cross-cutting concern in our activity, both inside and outside the EU. The EIB is already the world’s leading public financier of climate action projects and has pioneered the market in Green Bonds. The EIB is willing to do more in its external action and will engage with the European External Action Service, the Commission, Member States and other financial institutions on ways to maximise our impact. Maybe the limiting of our activities outside the European Union to 10% of the business volume will not be the last word. At least, I personally hope so. The successful implementation of the EIB capital increase has put the EIB in the position to contribute strongly to the Investment Plan for Europe, and notably EFSI. We are now committed to mobilise EUR 315 billion in EU investment over the next three years. Providing EFSI with an EU guarantee will allow the Bank to conduct more operations with a higher risk profile than it does currently, but we will maintain our high standards of due diligence.  Let me assure you that we are willing to live up fully to our institutional responsibilities in setting up the European Fund for Strategic Investments and reporting back to you regularly on the impact it has had for Europe and its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Ernest URTASUN", "mepid": "124972", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s report on the European Investment Bank and shares its recognition of the important role the European Investment Bank (EIB) plays in supporting Europe’s recovery from the financial and economic crisis. The Commission is glad to see that the EIB delivered and indeed exceeded the objectives of the Growth and Employment Facility and that the EIB commits to continue its important catalytic role to resolve the current investment and competitiveness challenges in the European Union. The Commission understands that EIB financing is geographically distributed according to demand from respective Member States and the EIB’s business development considerations. Today I want to highlight the EIB’s efforts to support programme countries, which increased by 24.7 % in 2014 compared to 2013. I would also like to mention the innovative instruments such as the Trade Finance Facility and the SME Guarantee Fund.  The Investment Plan for Europe confirms the EIB’s central role in helping the EU deliver on the EUR 315 billion objective, in combination with EU budget resources and national promotional banks. The European Union Investment Plan and the European Fund for Strategic Investments lie at the core of these efforts to catalyse new investments for the EU economy.  Last week, I was pleased to hear that the European Investment Bank announced that it has approved up to EUR 300 million in financing for the first four projects as part of the Investment Plan for Europe, in which the EIB is the Commission’s strategic partner. These projects are in different sectors – research and development, healthcare, industrial innovation, and transport – and in different countries: Spain, Italy, Ireland and Croatia. They serve as examples of investments that the new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) may support in the near future. This means that until the EFSI is fully operational, the EIB is already pre-financing projects.  We look forward to finalising the legislative process for the EFSI together with Parliament and the Council and to realising its full potential in close cooperation with the EIB. The EFSI – at the heart of the Investment Plan – should be up and running by September this year. The EFSI is also a crucial opportunity to support infrastructure investments in line with EU policy priorities such as the Europe 2020 Strategy and the 2030 climate and energy package. The Investment Plan has highlighted a broad range of priorities, including renewables and energy efficiency retrofits, water and wastewater, improved rail connections, greening projects in the area of maritime transport, alternative fuel infrastructure and third generation bio-refineries.  Furthermore, the European Union has increased the level of ambition on climate actions, in particular with the adoption in October 2014 by the EU Council of the 2030 climate and energy targets. The Commission welcomes the EIB objective to publish its new strategy by the Paris Conference.  Access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains a pressing problem in several Member States. In 2014, the Commission welcomed the launch of the EIB group Risk Enhancement Mandate (EREM). We also welcome the EIB’s contribution to revitalising the European securitisation market and new product developments to promote financial inclusion under the Risk Capital Resources (RCR) mandate.  At the start of the new Multiannual Financial Framework running until 2020, the European Investment Bank and the Commission launched a new generation of financial instruments in favour of SMEs and midcaps such as InnovFin – EU Finance for Innovators – and risk-sharing products under competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs. On transparency policy, openness and accountability are key EU concepts. The Commission supports the EIB in being one of the frontrunners among other international financial intermediaries in access to information and transparency rules. In this respect, we value the EIB’s commitment to complying with EU policy initiatives and legislative framework on transparency and public disclosure of information and to following international best practice. We welcome the recent approval of the revised EIB group transparency policy, after a public consultation of civil society organisations.  On external actions, Parliament calls for a thorough assessment and a report on risks and control systems associated with EU blending facilities. The EU Platform for Blending in External Cooperation (EUBEC) has reviewed and compared the performance of different EU blending mechanisms.  As regards the alignment of EIB external lending activities with EU policies before the mid-term review, practical measures for linking the general objectives of the EU guarantee and their implementation will be set out in the updated regional technical operational guidelines. The Commission is currently reviewing these guidelines together with the EIB and in consultation with the EEAS, and the updated guidelines will be transmitted to Parliament and the Council in the coming weeks.  Your report calls for cooperation between the EIB and the EBRD to be enhanced and the Commission actively supports this approach, amongst others, under the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Commission, the EIB and the EBRD on activities outside the European Union. This Memorandum fosters a culture of regular exchange of information and the joint identification of co-financing opportunities based on each partner’s comparative advantage.

It helps us reach sustainable growth, improve our economy and make it more competitive, more crisis-resilient, knowledge-driven, and of course it is a tool for improving infrastructure in Europe. First, the capital increase and now, in the future, through the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), these instruments have enhanced the Bank’s role in ensuring investments in Europe. The EIB lending, coupled with structural reforms and fiscal consolidation in Member States, will be an essential tool for restoring growth in Europe. The Bank will see its role and its responsibility increase in the near future through the entry into force of the EFSI. We on the Parliament side want to see the EFSI become a success and are ready to play our role in that sense, but for the Fund to reach its goals, the EIB would definitely need additional human resources in order not to affect the existing operations of the Bank. Nevertheless, I must also draw attention to the fact that the current distribution of EIB lending still indicates important discrepancies between Member States. I agree that the best and economically most viable projects have to be supported but, on the other hand, I think the EIB should also focus on investments, especially as regards infrastructure, in areas and regions that lag behind from this point of view. Another point which I would like to raise is the external mandate of the EIB. Taking into account the recent developments in the Eastern Neighbourhood, I think countries in this region should benefit from extra lending within the current mandate of the Bank, which is of course of geo-strategic importance for the Union. That is why I support the activation of the additional EUR 3 billion under the EU Guarantee, following the mid-term review in 2016. Thank you for your attention and your cooperation.

The report stresses, as you have seen, the need to change the European Investment Bank. While we can welcome a series of elements in the work and operation of the EIB, we also know that with the Juncker plan, the institution will occupy an even more important place in the European economy in the coming months. I therefore think that it is really necessary to discuss its role and how it should exercise it.  That is why the text calls , if I may mention a few things - to put priority on sustainable investments and those that are fully involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I think we are three-way winners: we are preserving the planet while reducing our energy bill, and that is obviously a good thing for jobs. Public institutions must lead by example and the way forward. I therefore hope that the EIB will be able to support all the public-private projects that will be tabled in this framework.  The second priority for our group is, of course, the links between the EIB and certain intermediaries that are based in tax havens. We know that the EIB does not invest directly in products, that it relies on financial intermediaries. We do not have a problem with that, but what is not acceptable to our group is obviously that these intermediaries are based in tax havens. We therefore call on the EIB to do all it can to avoid such situations in the future. Finally, we know that the EIB has a huge investment capacity, especially since its recapitalisation in 2010 and 2012, but we also know that it is not using its full lending potential. Now is the time for the European economy to get back on track! We therefore hope that the EIB will mobilise this wool stocking even more to further support our European economies. It is still tens of billions of euros that could be available very quickly for the European economy and this seems to us to be more effective than a possible miracle leverage, even if we all join Mr Hoyer in hoping that this scheme works at its best.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Stanisław OŻÓG", "mepid": "124897", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab In this year's EIB report, the European Parliament has focused on several important areas.

Secondly, the report draws attention to the EFSI proposal and stresses that the process of managing and monitoring the Fund, as well as the selection procedure and criteria used to identify projects suitable for inclusion in the list, should be as transparent and objective as possible. What makes me particularly happy? It was underlined that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and should be the main objective of investment.

After all, we all know that the financial and economic crisis that has plagued our continent for years is still not consumed. We can only move forward if we find a good balance between sustainable growth, strengthening competitiveness and attracting additional financial investment. The European Investment Bank is, of course, of strategic importance as the largest public investor in the European economy. We therefore believe that it is crucial that the EIB's investment policy is in line with this European growth strategy. The ecosystem of which the EIB is a part is subject to constant change and innovation. The question is therefore whether the EIB and the EIF are able to adapt to that changing world by becoming less bureaucratic, by simplifying and adapting barriers and procedures, and perhaps by daring to take more risks to achieve additional growth. This requires the EIB to be flexible so that it can truly respond to the needs of the market, and that it has sufficient skills and competences to select projects with a lead time that is acceptable, including to the market, so that companies do not miss opportunities to invest and stay active here in Europe. In our view, the report has a number of very strong aspects: the focus on SMEs, the emphasis on transparency, accountability and the use of financial intermediaries. The emphasis on climate and sustainable energy policy also seem to be a good point for us. But the real big test case has yet to come with the Juncker Plan, the EFSI, in which the EIB and the EIF will play a very important role and where it will also be necessary to mobilise genuine private investment. It won't just come from the public side. Private investors will also have to join in to encourage basic infrastructure in Europe, innovative companies and research and development.

You seemed very satisfied with yourselves, but the figures say more needs to be done, investment in Europe is 15% lower than it was in 2009. Unemployment has risen, poverty has risen, youth unemployment has risen too much. Youth unemployment has risen enormously. There are countries where the reduction in investment, such as in my country Greece, is multiple, 50% of the disinvestment has risen in recent years. So it is necessary, instead of rest, to do more and to give more money for public intervention that will boost investment, and private capital, and we need to change the criteria so as to strengthen regions and countries such as Greece that are suffering from higher unemployment and greater disinvestment and, of course, more needs to be done for young people as well.

That's why the emphasis on smart investing is so important. Smart means with a definite goal, focused and productive. But smart also means that these investments cannot always stand on their own. On the contrary, smart investments are embedded in a well-thought-out multi-track policy. The European Investment Plan is an inseparable part of this multi-track policy and the European Investment Bank plays a crucial role in this, through its immense expertise. I therefore welcome the EIB's recent proactive approval of a first set of projects that would be eligible for the EFSI guarantee. A rapid start-up of this investment offensive is essential to ensure its success. In particular, I look forward to the EUR 5 billion earmarked in the investment plan for SME and mid-cap financing. These companies are the economic DNA of Europe.

But it is important to make it clear that if Parliament accepts, as expected, that the European budget gives a guarantee of EUR 16 billion to EFSI, this Parliament, we will want to have a very serious say in both governance and the definition of investment policies. We will not give up that right. I must regret in the meantime that, in the week when Parliament and the Council were starting negotiations on EFSI, the EIB announced the first EUR 300 million in project funding, using the EFSI seal in advance. Are we negotiating something that already exists? Of course, the EIB can take the risk of these projects, but my perplexity increases with the announcement made by the President of the EIB that the projects now approved will go ahead anyway, even if the EFSI guarantee is not approved. But if these are projects for which the EIB can take the risk alone, why spend efsi support on them? So I ask, what guarantee does this Parliament have that EFSI will meet and implement according to the strategic objectives we are setting? Will you fulfill your mission of additionality? Or will you use EFSI just to enhance your ability to maintain the maximum triple A rating as it has been doing so far? The EIB, it is important to recognise it, is a key partner for strengthening investment, particularly during the crisis. However, it fell far short of what could be done, without any clear anti-cyclical role against the brutal fall in investment in Europe, particularly in the most fragile countries.

Your focus on midcaps, through your Midcap Initiative and Growth Finance Initiative, is important, as many SMEs of course want to grow to be midcaps. But I also want to mention one particular EIB instrument, and that is the Microfinance Facility. Recently, I took the opportunity to visit the microfinance offices in Dublin, in Ireland, and I was really pleased to see that Microfinance Ireland had already supported 1 000 jobs in its second year in operation, and they have targeted a further 1 000 jobs by the end of this year. Over 430 microenterprises with fewer than ten employees have benefited from loans, and what is really important is that these enterprises were unable to secure funding elsewhere. So that clearly shows the added value of the Microfinance Facility. One other positive aspect was that 75% of the investment was within the regions.

At the same time, the bank meets all prudential and capital requirements and is thus an institution with the highest level of credibility and trust. By strengthening its capital base in 2013, the EIB has significantly increased its investment commitment. Loans increased by €15 billion.

It is crucially important, as countries move from being a programme country back into the international lending market having completed structural reform and having got their deficits down, that they obtain the support of the European Investment Bank. I was really delighted to hear from the Commission today that there is an increase in lending to programme countries from 2013-2014 in the order of 27 %. In the case of Ireland, which has gone through an enormous shock, in 2010 the EIB lending to Ireland was EUR 210 million; last year, 2014, it was EUR 850 million. Here is an example showing that we can invest more and lend more to countries who have improved their own position as a result of structural reform and as a result of getting an appalling deficit down. That is where measures to address the gap in investment need to be encouraged and supported – especially in the case of former programme countries, or those countries currently in the midst of a programme. Finally, can I make this point: the European Investment Bank needs to be given, in my view, a much more structured dialogue in this House, especially through the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). While our engagement here is very useful, I do think on a quarterly basis, at the very least, that the EIB – and I know they welcome this and would encourage this – should be before this House to ensure that these issues are gone through in a more detailed way.

It would take a lot of courage and endurance on your side if, in view of the diversity and variety of the questions and comments raised, I were to go into each and every detail, but I promise that I will come back to each and every one of you on the questions you have raised. Let me concentrate on a few points. Let me begin with the notion that maybe we are a little bit too satisfied with what we have done and that we might even be complacent. We are satisfied but we are definitely not complacent because, in view of the challenges in Europe, the situation of the labour markets and the lack of growth, in view of the investment gap and the innovation gap, there is no reason for complacency in the European Union for anybody and certainly not for the EIB.  On the other hand, in 2012 the EIB turned anti—cyclical. Until then it was clear that, according to all decisions taken, the Bank would have to reduce lending volume after the huge positive impact it had had on the mastering of the first wave of the crisis, but then we had to go down again. This is the reason why I then turned to the European Council and said that we needed either capital increase or we would behave procyclically, out of necessity.  So the European Council, with your support, decided in favour of the capital increase and we delivered on that. That turned the Bank anti-cyclical and we are proud of that achievement. The analysis last year was clear. The investment gap has been there since 2007, but in addition – and this should not be overlooked – we have had an innovation gap and an education expenditure gap in Europe for almost 18 years. These together are leading to a dangerous reduction in the competitiveness of European industry in the globalising economy. Sometimes we should look a little more outside Europe to see what is happening in this world. We have been in crisis mode for seven years and we are now finding out that, during those seven years, others around the world have done their homework and have advanced considerably.  Therefore we need to address the questions of competitiveness and this is the basic idea of the Juncker Plan. The Juncker Plan certainly does not only mean The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). It also means regulation, continuation of sound fiscal policies and cutting red tape. We addressed that issue in detail at the European Finance Ministers meeting last week in Riga.  On EFSI, there is the continuous question of additionality and I want to address it very clearly. EFSI, the shift of budgetary means from subsidies to guarantees, if you so decide – it is your decision – means that we will be able to address risk dimensions which until now the Bank would not have been able to address in that volume. It is not true that we do not do very risky things. We have, under ‘special activities’, a window of between EUR 4 and 5 billion per year for these activities and we do them. With the Juncker Plan we will be able to do business in this field of far more than EUR 20 billion per year.  So it is a qualitative and quantitative change and that is what is meant by additionality. Additionality does not mean that each individual project is necessarily higher in risk than the portfolio will be. The portfolio will certainly be considerably higher in that respect so there is no reason to believe that this is going to be business as usual.  The second point in this context is that we have to make sure that the huge investment and innovation gap in Europe is addressed by attracting private funds. Otherwise it is never going to work. We conducted a study last year to identify the differences between the targets set by the European Council, and discussed in this very Parliament, and the means provided, privately and in public budgets, in order to achieve these goals. These differences are so huge it would never be possible to level them out with public money.  So we need to crowd in private money. The EIB is the crowding-in bank and there are the huge volumes that we get from the capital markets every year and the quality stamp that we put on projects which then leads to confidence among private investors that it makes sense to invest in these projects as well. We have been addressing the differences in economic development in the Member States. Look at the per capita figures we had in recent years for the Bankʼs activities. Cyprus per capita showed EUR 306 per person for activities of the Bank in Cyprus. In Spain it was EUR 258. These are the strongest countries. In Germany it is well over EUR 100 and that is quite justified because the economic situation in Spain is one thing and in Germany it is another. So we have to address the differences and I believe that we are doing this. In conclusion, you can be sure that we will use the funds provided by the European Union and the Member States with care and diligence and that we will try to preserve our strong position in the market. Of course triple A is not a fetish; triple A is a business necessity in order to be able to crowd in huge amounts of private capital at reasonable rates.  We are trying to do this in an effective way and also in an efficient way because the EIB is the leanest bank of its size in the world. Not only are we by far the biggest one – two and a half times the size of the World Bank – but we are also the leanest one. If you compare the employment figures of the EIB and, let us say, the EBRD or the World Bank, it is dramatic. From that point of view, you can be sure that we are trying not only to be effective and have an impact on improving the situation in Europe, but we are also trying to be efficient.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Ernest URTASUN", "mepid": "124972", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Madam President; Mr Hoyer, first of all I would like to thank you for the contributions made to the debate, especially the contributions of the shadow rapporteurs. Four very fast points, Mr. Hoyer. The first, about EFSI. I would like to stress an issue mentioned by my colleague, which is that we respect the procedures. We did not think it was right for the Bank to announce projects when we have not yet completed the trilogs and, therefore, it would be important for the institutional dynamics to keep up with the rhythms. Secondly, we are very concerned in this Parliament , I think many of my colleagues have mentioned this - the question of transparency. I have not been able to mention the Glencore case before, but it is an important case, even a case in which the European Ombudsman showed interest. The conclusions of the review of the transparency policy already know how they have come out. We would therefore like you to pay more attention to this issue. Thirdly, I would like to say that, in your two speeches, you have never mentioned the issue of projects bonds and the first two have not gone well. My Italian colleague also quoted the Passante di Mestre, the motorway, which I have not been able to refer to at the outset for lack of time, but I stress once again the question of the Castor project. I do not think that you can let the question of the Castor project end as the Spanish Government intends, by doing a dance out and making Spanish citizens pay that. The Bank must have a greater involvement in these types of projects which it finances and it seems to me – and we hope – that from this Parliament you can intervene so that this does not end like this. And finally, I would like to tell you that I think it would be a good exercise if, once Parliament's report was adopted, we could develop a dialogue to see how the recommendations we will adopt this morning can be implemented at the Bank.

The decision on the capital increase, taken in 2013, enabled the EIB to play a key countercyclical role during the crisis. It would therefore be appropriate for the Member States to put in place a new capital increase, so that growth, the creation of quality jobs can be revived and private investment should be encouraged to a greater extent than in the past.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, just tomorrow in Milan the 2015 World's Fair officially opens, the theme of which is 'Feeding the planet, energy for life'. The same title as our resolution, which we are about to vote on today. The European Parliament is the first to give its opinion on the Expo, setting out the framework of the policies needed at European and global level to effectively address the challenge of food security. The initiative for this resolution was born in the Committee on Agriculture, following a series of hearings and reflections on this subject, but then expanded to the contribution of many colleagues from many committees who wanted to integrate our work in a fruitful and effective way.  Food security is an issue that must concern us all, and we cannot shirk this global challenge that questions our agricultural and environmental policy, research, policies for international trade and development. The growing demand for food is due both to a continuous increase in the world's population and to a change in eating habits in developing countries.  We also note the paradoxical coexistence of hunger in the world – not forgetting that too many people still live below the poverty line in Europe too – and unbalanced food regimes that cause obesity even in poverty; at the same time, huge quantities of food are wasted in Europe and throughout the world – the European Commission itself estimates that 89 million tonnes of food are wasted in Europe alone. I would remind you that this Parliament, during the last parliamentary term, has already spoken out strongly in a resolution against food waste and in favour of mandatory targets to reduce it.  There are many things that we are asking of the Council, the Commission and the States participating in the Expo with the aim of being able to make real contributions to the global challenge of food security from the Milan event. We call for an effort to encourage the search for innovative agronomic practices that improve yields while reducing the environmental impact. We are calling for more information for citizens, accompanied by education in balanced food regimes and consumption that prevent obesity and erase malnutrition.  We must set ambitious and binding targets to combat food waste at every level of the food chain, from the field to the table. We must increase transparency and fairness within the agri-food chain, so that it can become truly sustainable and able to guarantee food security.  At international level, we must do more as the European Union to promote sustainable agriculture in developing countries and to combat land-grabbing, that is, land grabbing, particularly in Africa, without any rules. The European Union will also participate in the Expo with its own pavilion, and a steering committee set up ad hoc and chaired by former Commissioner Franz Fischler has produced an interesting document on the role of research in global food security.  But today we are asking for something more, a more ambitious commitment. We need a strong and sustainable agricultural sector within the Union, we need a development policy that is attentive to world agriculture, we need to combat food waste and do more research and innovation, but above all, we want the European Union to be the protagonist and leader of a global food policy. The challenge of food security in the world questions the conscience of all of us, we cannot back down: the European Union can and must do more.

We wish to reiterate our commitment to implementing EU policies and legislation to support sustainable food systems in close cooperation with the stakeholders, Member States and the European Parliament. The common agricultural policy has a great potential to make a real contribution to feeding the forecast 9 billion people by 2050, while taking care of natural resources. The principles of sustainability and producing more from less are well embedded in the long-term objectives of the common agricultural policy. Concerning the point of the scarcity of natural resources in the 7th Environment Action Programme to 2020, the European Union is committed to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital. EU environment policy, and in particular the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020, the EU soil thematic strategy and EU legislation for the protection of water, air and natural habitats and species, aim at protecting, conserving and enhancing those natural resources to secure the provision of sustainable and healthy food production in the European Union. In addition, sustainable food security is one of the major cross-cutting focus areas identified for research under the Horizon 2020 Work Programme to continue until 2017. The Commission is currently preparing an ambitious work programme and call for proposals on sustainable food security that aim to build more resilient and resource-efficient production and value chains. By promoting international collaboration, notably with China and Africa, Horizon 2020 research funding is expected to contribute to global food security. The European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability is supported by the common agricultural policy and aims at closing the gap between research and practice. Since 2012, the European Commission has worked actively to identify the best possible action to take at EU level to fight food waste without compromising on food safety. The Commission is committed to supporting the Member States and stakeholders in their efforts to reduce food waste by helping to lift any obstacles and by promoting the sharing of best practice and transfer of knowledge and experience. At Expo 2015, the Commission will organise a conference dedicated to food waste prevention, focusing in particular on the importance of an effective intersectoral cooperation. The Commission is committed to supporting the Member States and stakeholders in strengthening resource efficiency in the food chain to prevent and reduce food waste from farm to fork. The Commission is currently reflecting on the scope of the new, more ambitious circular economy package to be published by the end of this year, and will consider possible opportunities for action in the food sector as for all other sectors. Any initiative taken at pan-European level has to have genuine EU added value. We will only take action where this can facilitate and augment ongoing action in the Member States. While the promotion of healthy diets and lifestyles is a matter of national competence, the Commission’s strategy on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues and related implementing tools provide a framework and support to coordinate actions in the European Union. It also promotes organic production with clear labelling rules, enabling customers to make an informed choice when making their purchases.

Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life is indeed a very central challenge of our time. Providing people with adequate and healthy food and, at the same time, sustainable agriculture are one of the major fundamental challenges we have in our day. This requires several tools: a successful agricultural policy is needed. We in the European Union also serve as role models worldwide. We have had an agricultural policy for decades which has been based on maintaining family farms. We are very successful. Today, we are a Union that can provide food to its people, 500 million people. But we are also the largest exporter of food out into the world and thus also make a significant contribution to feeding the world. But we also need research and development. I am convinced that research and development must be stepped up, particularly in the field of agriculture, and that it can or must operate free of political guidelines. That is why my group will certainly not support the amendments on which we are also going to vote today, which are aimed at setting guidelines for science as to what it is allowed to do and what it cannot do. Then there is the issue of eating habits and the distribution of food. It is sad that we are living at a time when overeating is increasingly claiming more victims and, fortunately, people's malnutrition is decreasing and fewer and fewer victims are claiming, which is a great achievement of our time. It needs functioning supply chains. I think it is a great challenge to present these things at the Expo on behalf of the European Union.

We must give a voice to small producers, to small and medium-sized enterprises, because they are the real bearers of virtuous progress. Small and medium producers in Expo seem to have been forgotten.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a phytosanitary emergency which is affecting the olive trees of a part of the Puglia region and which is worrying the whole of Europe.  The spread of the quarantine pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, pauca subspecies, puts Apulian olive growing at risk and has dramatic economic, environmental and social consequences. The European Parliament, through the Committee on Agriculture, therefore immediately took the initiative of wanting to discuss this issue in this House, to express its concerns and ask the Commission for clarification. Meanwhile, just this week, the European Commission's Plant Health Committee voted for a decision that clarifies some of the issues we have raised.  Firstly, this shows that the Xylella problem is a European problem and must be tackled by European decisions and not by national decisions. The first decision, which we welcome, is the ban on the import of ornamental coffee plants from Costa Rica and Honduras. This shows how it is now established that the source of access of the Xylella subspecies Pauca in Europe was precisely that type of plant coming from those countries, as also confirmed by the discovery of these infected plants also in France. The real vulnus on which we must reflect is precisely the need for closer control of imports of plant material from third countries, including for other types of disease. That is why we are asking the Commission to give its opinion on this matter. In addition, the Commission's decision takes strict measures which, while avoiding total eradication in the already infected area, which would have been not only useless but above all dramatic for an entire territory, its landscape, its economy and the rural environment, on the other, in order to block new outbreaks, calls, in accordance with international standards on quarantine pathogens. , the eradication of some healthy plants outside the aforementioned infected area (i.e. outside the province of Lecce to understand us).  The two problems which the Commission's decision does not solve and on which we would like to hear more commitments today are those of research and compensation for farmers. First of all, we need to continue studying this bacterium, of which not much is yet known and the possibility that we have of eradicating it. We need more public funds for this, and above all, Mr President and Commissioner, we need it quickly, how quickly this bacterium can spread. Farmers, for their part, have no responsibility for the spread of this pathogen, but suffer both direct and cost damage from the costs of implementing the measures necessary to contain the disease. That is why we are here today to ask the Commission what compensatory measures it intends to give to the farmers who are the real victims of this annoying Xylella.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Paolo DE CASTRO", "mepid": "96891", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you the outbreak of a new plant disease which poses a very serious threat to the whole of our agricultural sector. Xylella fastidiosa is a bacterial disease which, following its first introduction into the European Union, is now heavily affecting olive oil production in southern Italy. The Commission is very concerned about this situation because there is no effective treatment to cure the plants once they become infected. It is the first time such a bacterium has been found in the EU and it affects a very large number of plant species, with devastating effects. The occurrence of this disease, regulated as a quarantine organism, was notified by the Italian authorities on 21 October 2013. The area affected is almost the entire province of Lecce, in the Apulia region. Emergency measures were first taken in February 2014 and further strengthened in July 2014. These measures lay down strict requirements for import and movement of host plants in the EU, timely identification and control in the affected areas in Italy and the removal of all infected host plants. The Commission’s Food and Veterinary Office carried out two audits in 2014. The second audit, conducted in November 2014, concluded that the situation had dramatically deteriorated since the first one conducted in February of the same year. A new outbreak has been confirmed recently in the province of Brindisi. This shows that the disease has already moved outside the originally affected area. Clearly, there is a high risk of a further spread if decisive measures are not taken as a matter of immediate urgency.  In addition, the European Food Safety Authority published in January this year a pest risk assessment with a list of potential host plants, including main agricultural crops such as citrus and grapevine. This list contains approximately 200 species – a much larger number than that covered by the previous EU emergency measures. Although not yet found in citrus and grapevine plants, the range of host plants affected by the bacterium found in Apulia is gradually increasing as investigations continue to unfold. Italy has, in the meantime, declared a state of emergency, nominated a Special Commissioner in charge of this file and announced a series of measures to be taken, including significant financial funding. In parallel, the Commission has reviewed the current EU emergency measures with great care in line with the precautionary principle. I can assure the honourable Members that the list of potential host plants to be covered, including citrus and grapevine, as well as restrictions on movements outside the infected zone and from infected third countries, has been considered from a strong precautionary perspective.  The new measures proposed by the Commission and endorsed by the Member States on 28 April this year foresee the following: for the heavily infected province of Lecce, it was finally agreed to restrict the measures to the felling of infected trees and intensive testing of the surrounding trees. For any outbreaks outside Lecce, including the one in the province of Brindisi, a more precautionary approach is being taken by preventable felling, not only of the infected trees but also other host plants within 100 metres. This is essential to prevent the further spread of this bacterium in the European Union. I want to be clear on one thing: the strict conditions applied on movements out of the demarcated areas in Italy are also applied to imports from affected third countries. Furthermore, given that recently coffee plants imported from Costa Rica and Honduras were intercepted in the European Union with Xylella fastidiosa, the Commission is now banning such imports. Lastly, let me reassure you that the Commission is in permanent contact with the Italian authorities to explore all possible tools available to support financially implementation of the eradication measures foreseen in our legislation. Compensation can be granted for eradication measures such as removal and destruction of plants, phytosanitary treatments, including for sampling and testing, on condition that all proposed eradication measures are fully implemented. At the same time, we are exploring any possibility of further support with the rural development programmes and Horizon 2020. Let me conclude by saying that maximum vigilance is essential now to preserve the agricultural economy in the area concerned and to prevent further spread in the rest of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 3, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Esther HERRANZ GARCÍA", "mepid": "22418", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, I see you well informed and that is why I will be very direct. I ask the European Commission to facilitate the financing of a research project in Xylella fastidiosa under Horizon 2020 and therefore to promote means of prevention and early detection of bacteria and ways to mitigate the problem once it arises. Because the conclusions of last Monday's expert meeting are in the right direction, but they can be improved with effective measures and, above all, with research, development and innovation in this area. I believe that the closure of imports into countries where the bacteria is present is essential and I also believe in the positive lists of countries from which products can be imported, leaving out those where there is already infection. Because, between 2000 and 2007, the European Union has imported 150 million plants from recognized species from countries where the bacteria is present and diseases must be prevented from entering. That is why I tell you that this is not only the case with Xylella, but with all kinds of diseases, because this case demonstrates the great weakness of the European Union's import control system. In the Plant Health Regulation for the fight against pests – in process now – we are missing a very valuable opportunity to introduce more stringent import control, similar to that imposed by third countries on European exports.

Now, I ask why all this is being ignored, it has been ignored by the Silletti plan, it has also been ignored by yesterday's decision, that is to say, a solution is being produced that will certainly have damage and very little will certainly be the solution.  I wonder whether we should not defend our olive trees not only from the scourge of Xylella or other causes, but also from the scourge of this Decision of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "José BOVÉ", "mepid": "96744", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are facing today is not just a disease: it is a plant pest that is coming to Europe! At present, no treatment is possible, either against insects or to care for trees. We are in an absolutely dramatic situation. Today, in Europe, we are dealing with only one strain: Xylella pauca. There are three others that, if they arrive on our continent, will cause an even greater catastrophe. They will affect citrus fruits, vines and many other species: more than 309 in all will be affected. The first step is to extend entry bans to products from all areas where Xylella strains are present. I am thinking not only of Central America, but also of Florida, California and Mexico. All products from these regions must be quarantined. Secondly: in the measures adopted today, there is no provision for support for small producers. In Puglia, for example, the average area is 1.5 hectares. I call for the immediate mobilization of the crisis reserve to help small producers. We also call for a total ban, without the possibility of circumvention, on all exports of at-risk plants from the infested area. The territories - be it Spain, Greece or France and islands such as Corsica, Sicily and Sardinia - must be protected. If they are not protected, it is over. Morocco has already banned imports of all plants from Italy into its territory. Finally, we must foresee the future today, i.e. allow the construction of double-closing greenhouses, so that the plants are raised indoors, without the possibility of insect attacks. These measures are not in the text. We have to go further.

Congratulations on the timing! In the meantime, however, half of Puglia will be deserted or poisoned. Yes, because, in addition to the eradication measures that have been reduced in theory, there is still a massive use of pesticides, which we denounced in an oral question circulated among Members, which took into account the appeals of the WHO and UNEP. EFSA itself has a clear position in its second report against the use of pesticides on a large scale.  I call on the Commission to reconsider its opinion and to consider Directive 128/2009/EC in this regard, which provides for the priority development of organic farming and the use of all alternative means to regularly registered chemical pesticides, in accordance with the precautionary principle of the right to health.

When France wanted to apply protection measures by banning plants from infested areas, it was accused of violating the rules of the free movement of goods.  This crisis therefore highlights the contradictions of European policy and, of course, proves the need for strict protection rules. It also brings water to the mill of criticisms against our industrial model, which tends to homogenize crops.

We fully agree with the Commission's measures, although they have been taken too slowly, and we would like to add that vigilance is required from the authorities of the Member States and information to the rural world. In the United States where california vines were affected, there was a combined effort by producers, researchers and state actors that limited the spread. However, no overall treatment has yet been developed. European research on the species of insects carrying the bacterium and on how to protect plants from them should therefore be intensified.

From record harvests to droughts, floods and various other slears.

The European Commission says it is working with state and local authorities, but it is unclear what preventive and anti-disease measures have been taken to ensure that olive growers know how to handle the disease properly in time. I ask that the European Commission and the Council find a way to adequately indemnce olive producers. Only in this way will we be sure that everyone will take all necessary measures to prevent further spread of the disease. Fortunately, there is no occurrence of this disease in Croatia. Croatian olive groves, and some more than 1000 years old, are a historical and cultural heritage, a world heritage site.

So far, no effective drug has been found that would be able to help infected plants, and the removal of infected organisms does not stop the development of the disease. The potential damage that Xylella fastidiosa can do will have a very serious impact on our continent's economy and environment.

Faced with Xylella fastidiosa there is currently no treatment and its rapid spread via other species worries the agricultural world.

Unfortunately, scientific research is lagging behind both in terms of the analysis of triggers and in terms of possible solutions or remedies to the emergency. The eradication plan ordered by the European Commission, as a preventive measure, has imposed the destruction of millions of olive trees, in the hope of blocking the spread of bacteria to other regions or crops. In support of this painful decision, we have EFSA's view that the destruction of trees is a valid choice once the disease has been detected as present in a particular, precisely circumscribed area.

In Ireland, alcohol measures cost an estimated EUR 3.7 billion a year, working out at over EUR 3 000 per tax payer. Unsurprisingly, allowing alcohol companies to self-regulate has failed to tackle the serious public health and public disturbance costs alcohol has for our society. One of the world’s largest drink companies, Diageo, has recently stepped down from a so-called ‘responsible drinking’ campaign in Ireland, where its attempts to tamper with, and dampen, the public health message were clear. It is unfortunate that alcohol sponsorship in sporting events was not included by the Irish government in its alcohol bill earlier this year. Well-funded positive images of alcohol use from companies such as Diageo outweigh those of public health campaigns and have a powerful influence on young people. It is the role of Member States to counter this influence. Information and education campaigns can play a key role here, whilst the European Commission should help to share best practice. I welcome the reference in the report to a nutritional labelling regulation, because the Commission is dragging its feet. It was meant to come forward in December with a report on the possibility of including alcohol in nutritional labelling with a view to proposing legislation.

It is therefore very important that the alcohol strategy, which expired in 2012, be replaced. The main tools for the prevention of alcohol abuse should be information campaigns, in particular aimed at young people and pregnant women, and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. In addition, investments will be made in education in order to understand the behaviours of those affected and cultural differences in alcohol consumption and to be able to intervene more specifically.

It cannot be denied that the harmful use of alcohol is still a cause of preventable death and a risk factor for many chronic diseases. However, an alcohol strategy in Europe cannot overlook the excellence of many alcoholic beverages that envy us all over the world and which make up a large part of European exports to third countries.

However, a meaningful enlightenment must not be allowed to pass into blind actionism. The EU must not give people the impression that they want to constantly regulate all areas of life. The calls for a general ban on alcohol under 18 and measures against cheap alcoholic beverages are inappropriate and do not solve the problem. Experience shows that tax increases fuel the black market and often have the opposite effects. In Germany, we were able to see this with the example of alcopops. Since the introduction of the special tax, young people have avoided alcopops, but they mix their drinks themselves again. Ultimately, this leads to higher alcohol consumption. The raising of the minimum age of consumption to 18 also goes too far. Studies show that enjoying a glass of beer or wine in the evening can be beneficial to your health.

On the other hand, I share the arguments put forward during the debate by colleagues who point to the positive cultural dimension of moderate alcohol consumption.  However, one issue is clear: excessive alcohol consumption is particularly harmful to children and adolescents. Unfortunately, statistics in many countries show that alcohol consumption among young people is increasing and the age of alcohol initiation is devalued. I believe that education is the key to this problem, and I am pleased that this has been highlighted in the motion for a resolution. However, I believe that not only young people, but society as a whole, should be educated in this respect. Still, too often, adults allow adolescents to consume alcohol.

The situation is particularly disingeful in the Czech Republic, which is one of the absolute world leaders in alcohol consumption at all ages. Excessive consumption of alcohol then causes not only health problems, but above all social problems, for this reason this phenomenon must be seriously combated. Alcohol is more dangerous in some aspects than smoking. Smokers usually do not attack their surroundings under the influence of nicotine, and smoking does not destroy entire families. Excessive alcohol consumption is logically associated with obesity. The European Parliament's report in this report therefore rightly recommends that Member States force producers and importers of spirit drinks to give information on the caloric value of the drink sold and a warning that it is not suitable for drivers and pregnant women.

However, its consumption requires attention and self-control. Alcohol consumption has a culture, history and tradition, but the health, public safety and social risks are not low.

The fact that the labelling of alcoholic beverages does not mention the nutritional value and therefore the number of calories is the result of strong lobbying by the industry.

In my view, the resolution is not intended to make the sector impossible, as this would also mean job losses, for example, for local products. Moreover, with this aspect in mind, the resolution also takes into account local cultural traditions. In addition, the draft takes significant steps to protect consumers, for example by introducing the labelling procedure proposed in the resolution to provide consumers with more information. The strategy is also of the utmost importance because it will allow Member States to edit the monitoring and data collection practices of their work on alcohol consumption, to encourage prevention, health promotion, early diagnosis and better access to treatment.

At the same time, however, through my support for the joint resolution, I strongly disapprove of the policies that lead a number of global brands and chains in the textile sector, which have been ignoring the working conditions in which their products are made for years.  The European Commission should, instead of discussing mechanisms such as the now-notorious ISDS system, place binding CSR clauses before its partners in the international agreements it negotiates.  This requirement must also apply to all European companies. I consider it unacceptable that European chains with annual profits of more than 1 billion euro have decided to contribute a minimum amount to the donor fund for bangladeshi victims and victims. Europe must stop maintaining this policy of following only economic interests by exporting production to countries with minimal production costs.

I therefore stress the absolute need for future monitoring of the implementation of the ongoing measures (the Sustainability Pact, the 'Agreement', the 'Alliance' and the 'Best Work' programme) by the International Community (notably the ILO, EU, US, business and trade union community) and support to the Government of Bangladesh so that these measures (and others announced, such as the amendment of Labour Legislation) are effectively implemented 'on the ground' , densified (e.g. increase in the number of inspections, improvement of labour rights in export free zones \\u2012 ZFE) and in-depth (e.g. by hiring more Labour Inspectors).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 427, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Tokia SAÏFI", "mepid": "4345", "text": "  In writing.

The estimated amount to cover those costs is $30 million, but by February 2015 they had managed to collect only $21 million. However, this shortfall is mainly at risk of the treatment of persons in need of long-term medical assistance. It is certainly unacceptable that there is a shortfall in funds in this fund.

The deaths of refugees, the dramas and wrongs taking place in their countries are shocking and unacceptable. We cannot be indifferent to these wrongs. However, it is clear that Europe, an island of peace and prosperity against a backdrop of war-torn worlds, has limited financial and territorial resources. Our solidarity with the people of other parts of the world must be matched to our capabilities. Let us develop our migration and asylum policies, education systems and the organisation of social life towards multiculturalism and multi-religion, but with caution, without losing our own identity and religion. Instead of moving the world to Europe, Europe is crucial to move Europe, in terms of institutions, organisations and ideas, to other continents, to provide aid in situ, to reduce illegal human smuggling.

First of all, I would like to highlight my regret over the new great tragedy – the sinking of the ship on April 19th, 50 nautical miles off the Libyan coast, with hundreds of people looking for a better future in Europe.  It is a significant problem that is not new, but is becoming more serious both in intensity and scale. For example, the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimate that 2014 was the year of the 20th century. 219,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean, almost four times more than the previous year and as many as ten times more than in 2012.  Therefore, I welcome the agreed measures at the extraordinary session of the European Council. Significantly increasing funding and strengthening triton personnel and technical capacity and stepping up efforts to seize and destroy smuggler vessels should contribute to reducing the volume of irregular migratory flows.  Despite some changes, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Agency for The Management of Operational Cooperation at external borders (Frontex) must also be further financially and operationally strengthened.

The EU is very much in favour of opening up markets with BiH, as it wants to help the country and steer it on a more optimistic path. BiH needs this, especially after last year's catastrophic floods that destroyed much of the basic infrastructure. I support this path, as many unemployed young people in BiH need to be given a brighter future. Unlike the one that's showing up today.

Moreover, ISIS uses the smuggling of objects as a financing tool, so that artistic and cultural objects become \"weapons of war.\" UNESCO points out that \"cultural heritage is an important part of the cultural identity of communities, groups and individuals, as well as part of social cohesion, implying that its deliberate destruction may have adverse consequences for human dignity and human rights\". That is why I therefore support the #Unite4Heritage campaign launched by UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokov in March this year, which aims to gain worldwide support for the protection of cultural heritage through the influence of social networks, and other international civil society projects aimed at protecting and reporting on endangered cultural sites. I hope that, like the conflict in Syria and Iraq, the illegal trade in cultural goods, the destruction of cultural, archaeological and religious sites will soon be stopped and the protection of the global cultural heritage will be strengthened in order to preserve human rights and human dignity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 900, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Giovanni LA VIA", "mepid": "96816", "text": "   in writing.

However, I believe that provocative statements, such as That of Mr. Rama since the beginning of April, are a hindrance along this path. The peace process in the Balkans is a long and complex process and requires many compromises. Such statements constitute only greater obstacles to laying the foundations for the full integration of the whole region into European structures. At the same time, however, I would like to express my disapproval of paragraph 29 and, in particular, of the promotion of sanctions against Russia.

As Europeans, we cannot, as it were, push for the expansion of renewables and a reduction in energy imports if, at the same time, we call for a halt to sustainable projects, despite compliance with the strictest EU environmental requirements. The European Commission is therefore urged to ensure the compatibility of energy and environmental objectives in practice.

I come now to my explanation of vote. Eni, an Italian company, has been accused of land grabbing and exploitation for years. From research carried out by ActionAid, FAO and Grain, he appeared among the Italian companies involved in large projects to rent agricultural land, 180 000 hectares in the Democratic Republic of congo intended for the cultivation of oil palms to be used for biofuel. These plantations cause the forest to shrink and local farmers see their land destroyed.

Firstly, the report calls for measures to be implemented to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, secondly, highlights the right to healthy eating, housing, property and education and highlights the need to safeguard these rights; thirdly, recognises that investment and trade agreements have a devastating effect on food security when the long-term rental or sale of arable land to private investors results in the removal from local populations of access to productive resources and, finally, states that the eradication of hunger in a sustainable way will not only take place by providing enough food for all but only when small-scale farmers are allowed to maintain and cultivate their land.

I consider this subject to be of particular importance, as one of my main objectives in my work is to make as much useful progress as possible on food here in the European Union.

Addressing the scarcity of natural resources set out in the motion, promoting sustainable forms of healthy food, research and agriculture, reducing food waste and reducing malnutrition all improve the security of food production and supply. This event also provides an opportunity to discuss other topics, such as food taxation or the suppression of food fraud. In my opinion, the practice of high tax content fully depletes the concept of overtrawing, against which I am also calling for an EU-wide solution in the TAXE Special Committee.

The execution of the eight prisoners in Indonesia has disappointed and saddened us, as well as the wider international community. I am sure honourable Members will join in expressing our profound disappointment. The EU holds a strong and principled position against the death penalty, in all cases and in all circumstances, and works towards the abolition of the death penalty worldwide. This is a top EU foreign policy objective and priority in our external human rights policy. It is also evidenced by the commitments in the EU Guidelines on the death penalty, the first ever human rights guidelines adopted by the Council in 1998 and subsequently revised, most recently in 2013.  The European Union believes that the death penalty is cruel and inhuman and has not been shown in any way to act as a deterrent to crime. The European Union regards the abolition of the death penalty as essential for the protection of human dignity, as well as for the progressive development of human rights. Any miscarriage of justice – which is inevitable in any legal system – is irreversible. These latest executions are particularly outrageous, since, according to the United Nations, drug offences do not meet the definition of serious crimes. Through its foreign policy, the European Union contributes to worldwide efforts towards abolition. Between 1993 and 2012, the number of countries that abolished the death penalty by law for all crimes grew from 55 to 97. As of December 2012, 140 countries – more than two-thirds of the countries of the world – were abolitionist in law or practice. Unfortunately, the picture is mixed in Asia. Pakistan is the most recent worrying example: since the breach of the longstanding moratorium and the resumption of executions on terrorism perpetrators, executions have already reached 100 this year. The wider region comprises countries like China, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia – ranking among the highest worldwide in terms of executions – whilst a large majority of Asian countries legally retain the death penalty. Five Asian countries have abolished the death penalty: Bhutan, Cambodia, Nepal, Mongolia and the Philippines. This contrasting regional picture is marked by movements both towards restricting the use of death penalty – in China, Singapore and Thailand – and towards resuming executions – in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Vietnam – or re—strengthening the legal base for the death penalty – in Brunei and the Maldives.  Indonesia, as a successful example of transition to democracy, has a particularly important role in South East Asia. Indonesia is the key player and ‘swing state’ in ASEAN, representing some 40% of its GDP and population. It is an emerging global player and a member of the G20 with one of the fastest growing middle classes in the world, as well as the world’s largest Muslim population. Indonesia has the world’s fourth largest population (250 million people), is the third largest democracy and one which shares most, but unfortunately not all, of our values.  The irony is that these executions have been carried out in the full democratic glare of a country that is arguably one of the freest and most democratic countries in South East Asia with a powerful and active parliament and a vibrant and dynamic civil society. It has been agonising for the prisoners and their families as the events unfolded in slow motion.  Turning now to what concrete activities we have undertaken, the High Representative has made three statements deeply regretting the use of the death penalty in Indonesia, and the European Union has worked closely together with the Member States which have nationals on death row. The High Representative/Vice-President has called on the Indonesian authorities to stop all pending executions and move towards a definitive moratorium. The EU authorities have also used all our different diplomatic channels to raise the issue of the death penalty with their Indonesian counterparts. We also intend to launch shortly a regional awareness campaign entitled ‘moving away from the death penalty in South East Asia’ which will be led by local civil society organisations and individuals. I also know that honourable Members of this House have been active in trying to persuade the Indonesian Government of the need to abolish the death penalty and in efforts to prevent further executions.  We have been clear in all our interventions that we fully respect Indonesia’s sovereignty. We have also offered political support and practical assistance in combating the trade in narcotics and other criminal activities, which pose challenges to Indonesian society and beyond. Let me assure you that we will continue to engage with the Indonesian authorities on the use of the death penalty. I very much look forward to hearing the views of the honourable Members.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are not magistrates, judges or lawyers here, so it is not up to us to decide the guilt or innocence of the defendants who are tried by the Indonesian justice system. But we are public officials, elected in our nations by citizens to represent values, who today command us to demand that the Indonesian authorities, like all litigants, have the right to fair trials, respecting the law and procedures of the defence, all things that have not been granted to a French national now threatened with execution in Indonesia. We are elected public officials who have a duty to condemn the death penalty, as you have just done. The death penalty is banned by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. We are also elected officials and human beings who have a duty to be outraged at the macabre scenes that are now accompanying the execution of convicts in Indonesia, as in other countries you have quoted, Commissioner. We're running out of time. The European Union is a partner of Indonesia. Last November, we held a dialogue on human rights between the European Union and Indonesia in Jakarta. We have an agreement on cooperation and partnership with Indonesia. We provide Indonesia, through regional funds, with funds for its higher education, for its good governance. We cannot fail to be heard by the Indonesian authorities.

This issue is absolutely essential today for European nationals who ask for our help. I count on you to convey to the Indonesian authorities a message of firmness, which does not in any way violate their sovereignty or their right to fight narcotics and drugs.

Yes, Mr. President Widodo, you can be great, your generosity can burst in the face of the world, if your power serves life. You wanted to send a strong message to Indonesian citizens and the rest of the world? It's done. No one can doubt your fierce desire to eradicate drugs and its trafficking.

Do you know the level of suffering and intense psychological torture suffered by death row inmates and their families?

Serge has been experiencing this unbearable psychological suffering for ten years. His jailers have already killed him a little psychically to the point that he feels guilty about being still alive. No, Serge, you are not guilty, not guilty of wanting to live, not guilty of wanting justice, not guilty of wanting to see your four children again, not guilty of the suffering you and yours are suffering. It is to you, Serge, that I think of, your wife, your children and your family, who are waiting for you. Hold on, Serge, France is with you, Europe must be with you. This is the message I want to send you.  Jean Jaurès said: the death penalty is contrary to what humanity, for two thousand years, has thought of higher and dreamed of the noblest.

Such proposals are entirely inappropriate. As Mr Orbán knows very well, the death penalty is banned in Europe. I think we should be proud of that, as well as of our international efforts to end the death penalty, to limit its application and to seek countries putting a moratorium on this cruel and inhumane punishment.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the political groups for agreeing to put this debate requested by the GUE/NGL group on our agenda. Many of us here are committed to the fight against the death penalty. We would have failed in our responsibility by not reacting immediately. On Tuesday night, eight people were actually executed, one Indonesian and seven foreigners. Fourteen executions have taken place since the beginning of the year, up from the number of executions in 2014 and only five in 2013, after a five-year moratorium. In Indonesia, as in other countries, the death penalty is again used, mainly for drug trafficking. According to Indonesia's Attorney General, the country is waging a war against horrific crimes that threaten the nation's survival. However, there is no justification for the use of this barbaric punishment, especially since lampists, small smugglers who are often poor and vulnerable, often foreign and deprived of basic rights of consular assistance and translation, are being attacked. There are few drug lords on death row. Worse, Indonesia's Constitutional Court agreed to consider the appeal of the two Australians executed on Tuesday on 12 May. 125 death row inmates are languishing in Indonesian prisons today. 57 for drug trafficking. Among them, 27 foreigners, including 4 Europeans, all convicted of drug trafficking. The case of Serge Atlaoui is emblematic. A 51-year-old welder employed in an Indonesian laboratory, he denies knowing that the laboratory was making ecstasy. His Indonesian bosses requested a review of their trial and obtained it. They are therefore not threatened with execution, at least in the short term. The same goes for the five Chinese, who were also sentenced to death in the same case. Several testimonies, including police officers, tend to exonerate Mr. Atlaoui, but these testimonies were not taken into account. The Indonesian president is an intransigent nationalist, who wants to give the image of someone who refuses to give in to international pressure. However, he did so, in extremis, for a Filipino national. In Indonesia, the case of Serge Atlaoui has reignited the debate on the death penalty in the press, particularly in the Jakarta Globe, Indonesia's leading newspaper, which questions the price Indonesia will have to pay in terms of image as a result of these executions. Yes, this fight is universal: in Indonesia, the United States and also in Europe, where Viktor Orban now says he is in favour of the reinstatement of the death penalty.

Unfortunately, 14 people have already been executed this year after Indonesia failed to execute in 2014. All those executed had been convicted of drug offences, although the death penalty – where it exists – can only be carried out for the most serious crimes, according to international standards. Recent cases of executions in Indonesia also show serious violations of internationally recognised standards for the implementation of the death penalty. For example, some of the detainees had insufficient access to lawyers or translators during their detention. One of the executed, Rodrigo Gularte, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and the execution took place, although international law prohibits the execution of people with intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses. The Indonesian government sees the executions as a deterrent to drug traffickers. However, there is no evidence that the death penalty contributes to preventing crime. A UN study also shows that the death penalty has no greater deterrent effect than, for example, a life sentence. We therefore call on the Indonesian Government to suspend all further planned executions, and we call for a moratorium to be reintroduced as an essential step towards the abolition of the death penalty.

This is the third time our political group has proposed this topic for emergency resolutions. Twice, the Socialists blocked the discussion of the Savchenko case in the European Parliament, perhaps to avoid strong and well-founded criticism of Moscow and its relationship with the war in Ukraine. Indeed, the Savchenko case shows us Russia's duplicity in the war that is going on in the vicinity of the European Union. Russia is holding in prison, investigating and recently filed charges against Nadia Savchenko, captured in eastern Ukraine, when fighting pro-Russian separatists. Although Savchenko is in Moscow's prisons, Russia does not consider itself part of this war. Moreover, the Minsk agreements in February, which Russia signed, provide for the release of all prisoners captured in the war that has been going on for more than a year in Ukraine. Despite Russia promising the liberation of Nadia Savchenko, this did not happen. Last week, on April 24, the investigative committee finalised a list of allegations against Nadia Savchenko. Russia therefore has duplicitous behavior: it is part of the war in Ukraine, without assuming it, claims to support the Minsk agreements, but does the opposite of what these agreements provide, and Nadiya Savchenko is caught up in this duplicitous game of Moscow. We call on Vladimir Putin to release both Savchenko and the other prisoners of the Ukrainian conflict, which he is illegally holding in Russian prisons.

Let us recall that, similarly to Nadiya Savchenko’s case, Russia is ignoring our protests against the kidnapping and detention of Estonian security officer, Eston Kohver, and also many other cases. At the same time, Russia is strengthening its military pressure on the eastern border of the European Union, threatening and provoking the Baltic and Nordic countries. The Russian leadership is obviously hoping that, overwhelmed by the tragedies in the Mediterranean, Europe will not take seriously the hybrid threat that is emerging on its eastern borders.  Let us prove together – not competing with each other but together – that this is not the case. Russia must respect peace and security and human rights in order to be recognised as a respected member of the international community. The unconditional release of Nadiya Savchenko would be a step in this direction but hopefully there will also be other steps.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1613, "date": "2015-04-30.json", "name": "Jean-Luc SCHAFFHAUSER", "mepid": "124755", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, human rights are one.

Let me be very clear from the outset and convey once again, in front of this House, the message that we have repeatedly delivered to Russian interlocutors: Russia should immediately release Ms Savchenko.  Firstly, let us recall that Ms Savchenko was captured in Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists. She was subsequently formally charged last Friday by the Russian Investigative Committee of being complicit in the deaths of two Russian journalists. The material evidence pointing to her innocence was never allowed to be produced in court. It is absurd to charge her with illegally crossing the border when she was already captive before being transferred to Russia.  Secondly, the ongoing investigation and possible trial of Ms Savchenko in Russia are surrounded by irregularities, as well as raising the issue of the competence of Russian courts to judge a Ukrainian Member of the Rada, and furthermore a Member the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The EU Delegation in Moscow is in frequent contact with Ms Savchenko’s lawyers and is regularly present in the Court to follow her proceedings.  Thirdly, the intention of the Russian authorities to put her on trial in Russia is not in keeping with the Minsk Agreements and the commitment to release all hostages and detained persons related to the conflict in Ukraine.  Finally, the situation of Ms Savchenko, at such an advanced stage of her hunger strike, is a humanitarian issue. Russia bears responsibility for her fragile health. The situation is unbearably difficult for her family, as many of you will also have heard from meetings with her sister, Vira.  The situation of Nadiya Savchenko raises two key issues: firstly, it sheds light on the situation regarding the rule of law and human rights in Russia, which this House has repeatedly discussed. On this, our message is clear: Russia should live up to its international obligations in the field of human rights. We will stand behind those who protect human rights in Russia.  Secondly, the case of Ms Savchenko, who was initially kidnapped in Donbass, is a reminder of the situation in eastern Ukraine. Freedom for Nadiya Savchenko and for all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens held in Russia, such as Oleg Sentsov, would be a step towards the resolution of the conflict. This is once again why I, on behalf of the Commission and the High Representative, join this House in calling for their immediate and unconditional release.

Mr President, Yarmouk is a symbol: first of all, that of the Palestinian resistance. Built to accommodate some of the 800,000 Palestinian refugees deported following the Nakba in 1948 and the vote on UN Resolution 194 on the right of return of Palestinian refugees, this camp has become a veritable city, with a population of up to 180,000, with schools, hospitals, public buildings and commercial arteries, and with UNRWA's support in health and education. Particular. Yarmouk had also become a symbol of social diversity, as many poor Syrians benefited from the camp's social facilities. It is also a symbol of the damage and international cost of non-settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Symbol still of the damage of the Syrian conflict and its consequences on Palestinian refugees: as early as 2011, the majority of Yarmouk refugees fled elsewhere, the camp being very close to Damascus. Symbol of the situation of half a million Palestinian refugees in Syria, half of whom have been displaced and 80,000 have taken refuge in neighbouring countries, which now host nearly 4 million refugees from Syria. Symbol also of the imbroglios between the forces present in Syria, because the fighters of the group \"Islamic State\" could not enter this camp without the complicity of the forces of Al-Nusra and probably also without that of the Syrian army. Yes, today the situation of the Palestinians in Yarmouk is dramatic, since they are deprived of any humanitarian aid. UNRWA, whose funds have been significantly reduced, no longer has access to the camp. The shortage of water, food and medicine adds to the devastation of the fighting. Today, at least 170 people have died of starvation in Yarmouk.

I think there is a great deal to be recommended within it.  I very much support our previous speaker who set out the background to the Yarmouk refugee camp. Even the way it is described is slightly misleading; this is a long-established Palestinian settlement on the outskirts of Damascus, more of a suburb of a city rather than a camp in its own right. It has been in existence since 1957. It was supposed, of course, to be temporary, but until Palestinian refugees can go home they remain particularly vulnerable. That is where this resolution is important. The Palestinian people are particularly vulnerable within Syria, with upwards of 480 000 Palestinian refugees scattered across 60 camps throughout the wider region. Ninety-five percent of these people rely on UNRWA for their daily needs. The camp was besieged by the Assad regime forces, creating a humanitarian disaster, and then became a battleground for various other factions, and remains so now. The chaos is a humanitarian crisis unfolding on the very outskirts of the Syrian capital. We must see, as we have expressed in paragraph 9, humanitarian pauses in the fighting as proposed by UN Special Envoy De Mistura. We must also see the EU, as we state in paragraph 10, play a much greater role in brokering a political solution within Syria, and I would also add Palestine to give the refugees a home to go to.  We welcome, of course, Commissioner, the humanitarian aid the EU has given, but in this case the criticism of the EU as a payer rather than a player has never been more just. We must, for the people in the region and indeed ourselves, do better to foster a political solution.

But I'm afraid he's more likely to stay with words. What is important and what I consider to be concrete support and assistance is that the European Union, namely the European Commission, is releasing EUR 2.5 million and that this money will be used to support people suffering from the civil war in Syria and specifically in Camp Yarmouk.

The European Union is seriously concerned at the continued deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in Syria. The conditions in the Palestinian refugee camp in Yarmouk in particular have become critical and need to be addressed with utmost urgency. After three years of besiegement by the Syrian regime, the recent escalation of violence by different fighting sides is putting the camp’s population at serious risk. The continued denial of humanitarian access by the Syrian regime and armed opposition groups to the refugees living in Yarmouk is unacceptable. The High Representative made this clear in her statement on behalf of the European Union of 18 April as well as in her Joint Statement with Commissioner Stylianides. The UN Security Council issued a Presidential Statement along the same lines on 20 April. All sides should cease hostilities to ensure immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need inside the camp and to provide safe passage for all civilians who wish to leave the camp, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 2139, 2165 and 2191. We urge all parties to use their influence over the fighting groups to ensure that these fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians inside the camps, are fully respected. We commend the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) for the important work it is doing and we will continue to work together with UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl, and all other partners to help alleviate the suffering of the people in greatest need. The Commission released immediate emergency funding of EUR 2.5 million to UNRWA’s operation to deliver lifesaving assistance to Palestinian refugees in Syria through cash and emergency relief items, and it stands ready to scale it up if needed. This emergency decision came in addition to a EUR 10 million contribution to UNRWA in December last year.  More generally, as part of the European Union’s 2015 humanitarian funding for Syria, the European Union’s support will continue to reinforce the capacity of partner organisations on the ground in order to enable them to provide a rapid humanitarian response in the case of a sudden deterioration of the situation. This funding extends to all parts of Syria affected by the conflict, with specific focus on the recent violence in Yarmouk, Idlib, Dara’a and Aleppo. This emergency funding also goes together with the EUR 33 million contribution to UNRWA provided since 2011 from the European Neighbourhood Instrument to sustain assistance to Palestinian refugees in Syria in cash assistance, education and health. We also called on the UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, to work with all parties towards the comprehensive implementation of the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 leading to a genuine political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and enables them independently and democratically to determine their own future. We will continue to fully support the victims of the Syria crisis.

The fact that in this Parliament and in the European Union we value the strategic cooperation maintained with the Algerian authorities in various areas and in particular in regional security and the fight against terrorism cannot silence us in the face of pressure from peaceful public protests, as well as arbitrary arrests and judicial pressure snags against those who exercise the right to meet, of expression , of protest, duly recognised by Algerian law.  Repression, in fact, makes the game of extremists. What can distinguish us most in the European Union and Algeria from terrorists is precisely respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the rules of democracy.

Our peoples have similar aspirations to welfare, human rights, democracy and prosperity. We ought to face those challenges and meet those aspirations through cooperation.  Our discussions with Algeria on human rights have allowed us to identify areas of concern, notably freedom of association, the right to peaceful assembly and the right to establish independent trade unions. We have conveyed those concerns to our Algerian partners in our Political Dialogue Subcommittee, our Social Affairs Subcommittee and our Association Committee. We will continue to do so in the future.  We are conscious of Algeria’s interest in social dialogue. That is why we are concerned by the severity of the sentence given by an Algerian court against several labour activists. Even if it is not a governmental decision, such a ruling could only undermine Algeria’s reputation and elicit criticism from human rights defenders, associations and other stakeholders.  In this context, the EU and Algeria have agreed to work on the reform of the justice system. The aim is to improve access to justice, reinforce the independence of the courts and further professionalise the actors in this sector. Similarly, the EU could support Algeria in its implementation of the International Labour Organisation’s Convention 87.
