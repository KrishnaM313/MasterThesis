Once again, we were able to measure the narrowness of our room for maneuver in a particularly constrained budgetary framework, but, my dear colleagues, we have reasons for satisfaction that I would like to share with you. First, the mid-term review is not a bible. Each annual budget discussion authorizes us to hand over the book on the trade. In other words, the European Parliament retains its prerogatives to discuss the budget each year. Secondly, we have managed to erase the cuts made by the Council, by restoring the majority of the appropriations which it had planed in order to preserve margins for alleged unforeseen expenditure, in particular, the extension of the budgetary facility for Turkey allowing this country to provide accommodation for Syrian refugees. If we have reached an agreement, it is because our priority was to overhaul the programs in section 1a, those which work best, the programs which prepare our future and protect Europeans: research via Horizon 2020, youth mobility via Erasmus, Erasmus + and Erasmus Pro - two programs which, unfortunately, cause frustrations, because we do not have the means to respond to all the good research projects, nor to all the requests made by young people for their mobility - also the interconnection mechanism, via the mechanism for interconnection in Europe, and aid to SMEs via the COSME program. These reinforcements are all the more appreciable as they benefit, my dear colleagues, from new money. We were also able to supplement the resources allocated to security, police and judicial cooperation as well as the rise of asylum and neighborhood policy. Our duty is to ensure the relevance of expenses, their added value. We have a duty to appease our spending urges. We therefore considered it necessary to save money by reducing the appropriations devoted to Turkey's pre-accession. I understand that some of our colleagues would have liked to support the youth employment initiative. Let it be clear, ladies and gentlemen, that we all share this desire to fight against youth unemployment, this scandal which is a cancer for our society. But I would remind you that an amendment of 116 million at the initiative of the European Parliament made it possible to increase the credit line by 50% and that the Commission undertook, if necessary if the appropriations were exhausted, to present a draft amending budget in the course of 2018. Personally, if you allow it, I would like to tell you that I would like us to be able to implement concrete measures, structural measures to fight effectively youth unemployment and promote apprenticeship and the mobility of apprentices, but also that we mobilize in their favor. The few European countries that have this practice in their culture, namely Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark, have in common a particularly low youth unemployment rate. All in all, I believe that Parliament can be satisfied with the 2018 draft budget. I thank the architects of the agreement we reached in the Conciliation Committee: the Estonian Presidency, which has spared no efforts to achieve an agreement, Commissioner Oettinger and his teams who have also been extremely diligent, presenting us with several versions of what could be an agreement in the Conciliation Committee. Then, allow me to greet our rapporteurs: Siegfried Mureşan has been an admirable general rapporteur, as have Richard Ashworth and Jens Geier.I thank them for the quality of their work.My dear colleagues, I hope and hope that many of us will vote tomorrow on the draft budget of the European Union for 2018.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Siegfried MUREŞAN", "mepid": "124802", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, on 18 November, after 16 hours of final negotiations, we managed to agree on the budget of the Union for 2018. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have managed to agree on the budget of the Union for next year, and the good news is that the European Union is capable of acting. We have a budget for next year and, more than that, it is a good budget. I say this with full conviction because we are allocating the limited resources we have available for exactly those areas which, at the beginning of the year, we defined together as being our priorities. Firstly, growth and jobs; and secondly, citizens’ safety and security. We have allocated EUR 11.2 billion for research and innovation because this makes Europe’s economy more competitive, more future oriented and more capable of attracting investments. We are allocating EUR 2.7 billion for infrastructure. We are allocating EUR 354 million for small and medium-sized enterprises and EUR 2.3 billion for Erasmus scholarships so that the young people of Europe can travel, can become more competitive, can gain more skills and can be successful on the labour markets tomorrow. We are allocating a total of EUR 350 million to combat youth unemployment and we stay ready to evaluate this programme next year: if more is needed we are ready to allocate more resources. For the time being, we are allocating sufficient resources to give some prospect to those young people who are still looking for a job. In order to bring more safety and more security to the people of Europe we are strengthening the agencies of the Union which have responsibilities in justice and home affairs and in combating terrorism. To Europol we are allocating EUR 120 million and increasing its staff from 550 to 576 people. For the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the agency which manages refugees in Italy and in Greece, we are standing by the side of Italy and of Greece through this budget and putting enough resources into the EASO to manage the refugee crisis in those frontline states.  We are doing more on defence. We are financing EUR 40 million for a preparatory action on defence research to do more on defence at European level – because Member States want to do this, because it makes sense and because it will enable Member States to save money in their national budgets.  We are also supporting our immediate neighbourhood – the southern neighbourhood, the Eastern neighbourhood and the Western Balkans, those countries that are neighbouring the European Union – where it is in our fundamental interest that stability is being achieved and, of course, we are also giving some important political signals. The reality in Turkey does not go unnoticed by the three institutions, and this is why we are cutting pre-accession funds to Turkey by EUR 105 million because Turkey is currently not respecting European standards when it comes to freedom of expression, the rule of law, and NGOs’ and human rights. We are putting EUR 70 million more in reserve money that will be made available subject to an improvement of the situation there. We are also allocating EUR 4.9 million to tackle disinformation, propaganda and fake news. A preparatory action of EUR 1.1 million will be launched in order to instruct and train EU personnel in Member States, in the eastern neighbourhood and in the Balkans with regard to the risks of propaganda. The remaining EUR 3.8 million will be added to the budget for Union communication in states outside of the Union in order to better communicate the benefits of Europe so that people are well informed and cannot easily fall victim to propaganda. All in all, it is a good budget. It is a budget which supports young people – young farmers, young entrepreneurs and researchers and young people looking for a job – and one which will provide more security to the people of Europe, and I kindly ask the Members of the House to vote in favour of it tomorrow. I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, our colleague Jean Arthuis, my co-rapporteur Richard Ashworth and Jens Geier, who was in charge of the budget for this year and with whom we have worked closely, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and, of course, Commissioner Öttinger for having identified the right priorities and for helping us to put EU funds into those areas where they are needed, where they are absorbed and where EU money is well spent.

Bearing in mind the exceptional additional costs involved in the security threats and also the effect of inflation, I thought this both reasonable and justified. I was therefore pleased to note that the Council was prepared to match Parliament’s restraint. They too proposed a budget increase of 2.3%. Having taken that as a benchmark, I am therefore happy to announce to the House that the overall increase for the other sections in 2018 has been agreed at 2.4%. I am satisfied that this budget enables us to meet three objectives. First, it ensures the institutions have the capacity to meet challenges that lie ahead. Second, that it observes fiscal discipline and, third, that it delivers value for money to European taxpayers. This is a budget of EUR 160 billion, and clearly there has to be a spirit of compromise between the two budget authorities: Parliament and the Council. I was particularly pleased to report that we have been able to provide funding for strategic communications. This I know has been a major concern to a number of parliamentary committees.

All the previous speakers, who have worked very hard on the budget, used the word satisfaction, and I am as well, on behalf of the Council, very satisfied with the agreement reached by the Conciliation Committee in the early hours of 18 November. The discussions were long and at times difficult, not only between but also within the delegations of our institutions.  We have been able to establish a realistic budget providing on the one hand the necessary appropriations to cover the needs expected in 2018, but leaving on the other hand adequate margins to cope with the contingencies in the course of next year.  The Presidency appreciated the constructive atmosphere during these negotiations. The agreement on the 2018 budget was reached thanks to the readiness for compromise on both sides of the table. During our various meetings in the course of this year, be it in trilogue or in conciliation format, as well as during many informal contacts, it became clear that Parliament and the Council share the same two main priorities for the financial year 2018: to tackle challenges related to migration and security and to boost innovation, growth and employment in Europe. In the Union budget for 2018 we have been able to translate these priorities into concrete figures.  I would like to underline that, in addition to funding our shared objectives, the Council had two other guiding principles. Firstly, we considered it important to respect the agreements of the past. This means that agreements on the financing of the European Fund for Strategic Investments and the mid-term revision of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) were considered as the cornerstones for our discussions.  Secondly, 2018 could become a difficult year. One of the issues that thus needed to be addressed was how to deal with the continuous challenges in migration, where it is clear that Europe will have to spend more. The package agreed by the Conciliation Committee includes two joint statements: the first one on the Youth Employment Initiative and the second one on the management of payments in 2018. The Council has also issued a statement recalling the importance of limiting the administrative burden by fully implementing our joint agreement on reducing over the 5-year period the number of staff in all institutions, bodies and agencies by 5%.  After the successful outcome reached by the Conciliation Committee on 18 November the Competitiveness Council tomorrow will formally approve the joint text on behalf of the Council. I am looking forward to Parliament approving the joint text tomorrow as well. The general budget for the financial year 2018 will then be adopted within the deadline foreseen by the Treaty. This would mean that, for the first time since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, three consecutive annual budgetary procedures will then have been completed successfully in conciliation without having recourse to a new draft budget to be submitted by the Commission and, consequently, a second round of negotiations.  Just like Mr Mureşan and Mr Ashworth, I would like, as an Estonian, to express my satisfaction about the fact that we have now the strategic communication capacity on steady European funding. So far, it has been funded by the Member States individually, including my own. I would like to thank, not only on my behalf but on behalf of Minister Kivine, who could not be here due to sudden illness, the Chair of Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, Mr Jean Arthuis and the rapporteurs Mr Siegfried Mureşan, Mr Richard Ashworth and Mr Jens Geier for their constructive approach during the whole annual budgetary procedure, for their openness to compromise and for the positive atmosphere persisting among our institutions during the last weeks and months. I would also like to thank all other colleagues from Parliament who, during long and stressful hours on the Council’s premises, showed patience and a spirit of compromise.  Finally, a huge word of thanks to Commissioner Günther Oettinger for facilitating our negotiations. Without your support, Commissioner, it would have been far more difficult to reach a balanced and timely agreement.

The fourth financial year in the seven-year budget framework. We have traditional tasks that we fulfill year after year: cohesion policy, infrastructure funding or the two pillars of agricultural policy. And next year we have tasks ahead of us that are ascending tasks that were not entirely predictable in 2013: migration, the refugee crisis, urgently needed aid for refugees, also outside of European territory, border protection, border control and the fight against terrorism . I am grateful to Parliament and the Council that the mid-term review has enabled us to readjust the budgetary framework here and has also given us more flexibility, flexibility between the financial years and between the chapters within a financial year itself Parliament, the political groups in Parliament's Committee on Budgets reached agreement. Only in this way could we re-allocate priorities and finance and implement them in the next year without damaging existing programs. In principle, we were in agreement: growth and employment, security, security, migration were big keywords for the European budget strategy. Nonetheless, it was difficult because, on the one hand, not only was the request for restoring the Commission's proposals in Parliament, but money in addition to this was proposed and, on the other hand, a perfectly understandable priority in the Council was not just to keep the leeway as in the current year but to increase either unforeseen what could come in the next year - disasters, earthquakes, other accidents that the member states alone are calling for and in which solidarity is required - to be fulfilled financially, or also to financially reflect in the budget what is likely to be foreseeable but not yet ready for the budget, such as a second Turkey-EU package for the creation of human dignity for refugees who have to live temporarily on Turkish territory. In this complex situation, the Commission is also grateful for the constructive approach of the Council Presidents. Please, Mr Maasikas, greet Mr Kivine and his whole team, your team, with my personal thanks for this constructive leadership, and I would also like to thank all members, namely the rapporteurs and the chairmen of Parliament's Committee on Budgets . The fact that we made this decision on time at the first attempt without delay shows the European Union's ability to act, even in a difficult financial, economic and political environment. It has also been shown that the budget framework, which was decided in December 2013, is tightly knitted and is therefore hardly able to fulfill all meaningful tasks and expenditures within the upper limits year after year. I am grateful that in heading 1a the ability to act for research and innovation, for Erasmus and school and youth exchanges, for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises has been strengthened. I am grateful that we have increased the youth employment initiative - and increased it moderately - and I promise that if it turns out later in the year that the funds we have been used to finance projects, for jobs, for If the outflow of funds should be greater than foreseeable, then we will supplement the corresponding funds with amendments and propose an increase in funds to your two bodies. We don't all have agencies, but we have some Agencies strengthened along the workload that is to be expected.In short, I am now sure that the budget is in line with the tasks and expectations of our citizens for the next year, research, innovation, infrastructure, traditional tasks and quick response in order to tackle new challenges politically but also financially.That is why I am asking Parliament and the Council for approval.I believe that in the limited scope of our financial framework, a better budget structure for 2018 would hardly be affordable.That is why we fully support what has been worked out between the Council and Parliament for us today and for the Council in the next few days.Thank you for that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Paul RÜBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President!

I am also very grateful to colleague Mureşan that we did not get up after lunch and go home and say: “There is no budget possible”, but that we really came to an agreement in a very close and direct discussion to do something for the citizens of Europe.

I would like to acknowledge to them that, if during this conciliation we have overcome some principles, as was said by President Arthuis, and we have made some achievements including economic ones, as pointed out by the rapporteur Mureşan and Commissioner Oettinger, it is for their work, for the work they did during the conciliation phase. The fact remains that their hard work, their commitment, etc., cannot see me fully satisfied and cannot see fully satisfied the group that I have the honor to represent here. The problems exist, they are still in front of us all and they are of three orders. They are of a general order, Madam President, they are of a methodical order and they are of a merit order. Of a general order, because for years we have been having to follow a ritual that is essentially empty, in which we wait for the 21 days of conciliation, we wait for the last final hours to try to arrive at a result and an agreement that must be for force a take or leave, and this can no longer be like this. Of a methodical nature, because the discussion that took place, despite our rapporteur, the President and the Commissioner we tried to bring it back on track, was a discussion that the Council wanted - and not out of demerit of the Estonian Presidency, to which my thanks also go - and that it was all aimed solely at the financial aspects of the budget, while we needed to give political answers to the requests of European citizens. We have already entertained a lot about this and a lot has been said, but I think that not all the answers that had to be given have been given, which were not what the European Parliament was asking, Madam President, they were not what we as parliamentarians were asking for, but only what European citizens expected from this European Union. We had to do much more at work, on the issues of immigration and the reception of refugees, and we could have done much more. I believe that this debate, Madam President, has shown that if there is a weak link in this European Union, the weak link is in the Council, certainly not in Parliament and the Commission. In a Council that in the face of citizens' requests, instead of looking citizens in the face, turns its head the other way and tries to solve only the financial aspects. We need today and we will need in the future to respond to the political, economic and social aspects that citizens ask us.

With the 2018 budget, the EU has failed to send a sufficient signal for a real fresh start in the area of ​​budgetary policy. More than 70% of our budget still goes to agricultural policy and cohesion policy. Agricultural policy has been a challenge in the past. In cohesion policy, far too little attention is paid to what effects we actually achieve with the money we spend. The challenges of the future are to be found particularly in the area of ​​research, but also in the networking of science, then of course in securing our external borders and in a sensible migration policy. However, this must not lead us to simply and purposefully say: “We need more money.” Simply calling out for more money every year does not do our job, because we manage the taxpayers' money here, and with it we handle them carefully and sparingly. That is why we are also against long-term subsidies, rather we should switch to a type of subsidy that is being reduced year after year so that we can get out of the dilemma that once we pay subsidies, we always have to pay subsidies. We should also not forget that we had to give back ten billion euros in the 2017 budget because it was not properly spent. That shows that we didn't have the right focus. It shows that we had way too much bureaucracy and we need to work on that.

It is a tight - not to say skimpy - budget that is being put to our vote, especially with regard to commitment appropriations. Judging from this: with a total amount of commitments of 160 billion, the 2018 budget is only up by 282 million compared to 2017, significantly less than inflation. That said, the combined efforts of our President, Jean Arthuis, our two rapporteurs, Siegfried Mureşan and Richard Ashworth, and Commissioner Oettinger, to whom I extend my sincere congratulations, have enabled substantial improvements compared to the initial proposal of the Council, which will explain the favorable and unanimous vote of my group. Like my colleagues, I particularly welcome the additional resources allocated to research, young people and SMEs. I also welcome the modest but real increase in the resources allocated to the Youth Employment Initiative and the unilateral commitment of the Commission to table an amending budget in the event of increased needs. I welcome the additional resources obtained to achieve the objective of devoting 20% ​​of the expenditure of the current multiannual financial framework to the fight against global warming in accordance with the international commitments that have been made. I would also like to welcome the additional resources that have been obtained in the fight against terrorism, by strengthening the operational capacities of Europol and Eurojust. Likewise, by granting more resources to EASO, the 2018 budget strengthens one of the key instruments for the implementation of a real common policy on asylum and the management of migratory flows. I also welcome - like many of our colleagues - the increased appropriations for the Stratcom program, strategic communication from the European Union to third countries. At a time when free and democratic information is threatened by fake news and the propaganda of certain foreign powers, it is important and essential to react. Finally, there is a decrease in appropriations that I want to salute publicly. This concerns the reduction of 105 million and the placing in reserve of another 70 million of the appropriations allocated to Turkey for pre-accession. It is legitimate and urgent to make Mr. Erdoğan understand that the European Union does not subsidize authoritarian abuses or attacks on the rule of law and freedom of expression. Having said that, I also want to publicly express a few more personal reasons for dissatisfaction. I regret in particular that a proposal presented on my own initiative by Parliament's delegation was not accepted during conciliation. It was a joint declaration by the three institutions which called on the Commission to consider the possibility of proposing new legal and financial instruments to help victims of terrorist acts and their families. I also regret that no better account is taken of the real needs of certain institutions, for example the Court of Justice of the European Union. On a budget of 160 billion, I find it difficult to understand the refusal to approve the 1.5 million credits requested and justified by the Court, or 0.000009% of the total budget of the Union. In conclusion, Madam President, the experience of recent years leads me to believe that in its current system, the multiannual financial framework is a corset which freezes the distribution of resources in favor of existing policies and makes room for new policies more difficult. . It is therefore urgent and necessary that the future multiannual financial framework allow greater flexibility both within major headings and between headings, and to ease the conditions for mobilizing flexibility instruments. Such a change is needed, with new resources clean, to face the future.(The speaker agrees to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Bill ETHERIDGE", "mepid": "124951", "text": "  blue-card question. – There is an impressive list of amounts of spending, there are areas where you feel there should be more.

This rise is due to the need to make pending payments and the low budget execution of previous years. Basically, his recipes for austerity for people don't work. The budget of the European Union for 2018 - it must be said - will again be restrictive in real terms, since the increase of 1.4% is below the rise in the CPI of 1.7%. Therefore, what we are doing is sacrificing a budget based on the Union's own resources with a progressive tax system - which is what we have to aim for - in favor of public-private investment plans to socialize possible losses. We sacrifice migration and asylum funds in favor of investments in defense, security research and development funds conditional on externalizing our borders.

This is not something that Europe’s citizens expect us to do.

You, sir, are having a very good day. Christmas has come early – you must be delighted. The British Government is going to shell out a cool EUR 50 billion as part of our exit proceedings, which, when you think about it, is really rather odd, is it not, because 23 June 2016 wasn’t just significant politically, it was significant for the European Union budget. We have been a net contributor to the EU budget every single year since 1973. For most of those years we have been the second biggest contributor and we pay in 16% of the total European Union budget. But, of course, we are leaving. So logic says that if, for example, a family has an annual income and that income declines, they then have cheaper holidays, they cut their cloth according to their circumstances. And yet, when we look at the 2018 budget or the Commission projections for the next few years, we see that absolutely no account is being taken of the British leaving the European Union. You have decided simply to carry on regardless. And it would appear that in a very weak moment the British Prime Minister has decided to bail you out for it. Well, I would just say ‘Don’t bank on it’ because I think there is going to be a huge public reaction to this extraordinary sum of money. Honestly, I do! I think there is a real prospect of there being a big rebellion within the Conservative Party against their own leader. So don’t think this is absolutely guaranteed. Certainly, the line that I have always taken is that no deal is better than a bad deal, and in this case it’s worse than a bad deal because we don’t even know if we are going to get a trade deal in return. Even if there was a firm offer of tariff-free access to the EU single market, it would not be worth the EUR 50 billion payment.

Mureşan, Geier and Ashworth, for the work done and also thank the Commissioner and his team. At the end of the negotiations, I wanted to highlight some good news which constitutes real increases obtained by the Parliament: 110 million on the Horizon 2020 program to invest in the future, 54 million on Erasmus, 116 million on the youth guarantee . So, I am reassured. The mid-term review to which we had committed a lot was indeed a real review and not a sleight of hand. In addition, in concrete terms, these increases will be able to meet pressing needs. However, we have to admit that these few sparks are not enough to illuminate a darker toll: a cut of 230 million for farmers, nothing on humanitarian aid and only 3.5 million on culture. I must also regret the cavalier manner in which the negotiations unfolded. Parliament must no longer tolerate it. It is no longer acceptable for the Council to present its position to us just a few days before the deadline, thus putting the knife in Parliament's throat. It’s hard to admit ministers parading in Gothenburg but none deign to negotiate the budget. And how can we be satisfied that, after midnight, the ambassadors desert when the crucial points are still to be discussed? But above all, how to tolerate the insincerity of the Council, which reflects on this budget by imposing to keep extravagant margins in order to subsequently finance the facility for Turkey while showing, of course, a decrease in the pre-accession envelope. The list would be too long, but the conclusion is brief: the account is not there and the Group of Socialists and Democrats will not be able to support this budget. I propose that in the future Parliament refuses to enter into negotiation before the Council has a clear mandate.Above all, I hope that the Council and Parliament can define a budget based on real needs and not on national selfishness and hidden projects and with means mainly from own resources.(The speaker accepts to answer a 'blue card' question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Paul RÜBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  blue-card question. – Ms Thomas, I think it was at 4 o’clock in the morning – and I have to congratulate you – you insisted on the EUR 350 million for youth employment, for young people, and I think we made great progress in front of the Council and the Commission.

We are making significant investments in reducing youth unemployment and improving the opportunities for SMEs to operate. We are also taking steps to increase climate finance. However, it is unfortunate that we are still not fulfilling our commitment in the Paris Climate Agreement of a 20% budget share for climate finance. I hope that, when presenting the next annual budgets, the Commission will ensure that the budget is in line with the commitments we have made. We believe that we are making the right decision by cutting Turkey's pre-accession funding by EUR 105 million. Human rights and respect for the rule of law are at the heart of European values. I am pleased that now we will send a strong political message to the Turkish leadership not just in the sidelines of the recent worrying development.

The majority of the European Parliament constantly wants an ever-increasing budget. Many Member States disagree. A solution must be found to this. The European Union's priorities are changing and the new priorities must have the necessary funding. However, this cannot mean that priorities alone are increasing.Then we will no longer have any priorities, but everything will be just as equal.So we need to find savings and re-prioritize.In this work, as decision makers, we have a lot of room for improvement.Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mureşan, for his very meritorious and cooperative work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 41, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Jonathan ARNOTT", "mepid": "124958", "text": "   – Madam President, we are here today to debate the agreement on the European Union budget for 2018, but it would seem to me that the European Union budgets for 2019, 2020 and as far as is reasonably foreseeable into the future might just as well have also been agreed. The United Kingdom has been a net contributor to the European Union since we joined it in the 1970s and it was one of the richest countries in Europe.  As Members we have always paid in more than we got out and will continue to do so again in 2018 because those are the rules and because we are still Members, despite the fact that by the end of 2018 it will be two and a half years since the UK voted to leave the EU in that referendum. Of course, according to this budget, we will still be paying in over GBP 18 billion a year gross and then get back roughly half of that in rebate and EU funding.  Bizarrely though, it seems that the UK will still be paying into the European Union after leaving the EU, whether it is GBP 40 billion, or GBP 50 billion – EUR 45 or 55 billion. The UK has no legal liability whatsoever to pay any form of divorce bill. Of course if you have an agreement, then you expect something in return for your money. Yet Theresa May has surrendered that. She is expected to surrender too on the Northern Ireland border and to surrender too to allow European courts jurisdiction over the EU post-Brexit, which is what we voted to get out of in the first place.  The killer question though for the British Prime Minister is this: can you show us one single thing that you have actually obtained in return? Show us one concession that has been made on the EU side because all we see is you caving in whilst British ‘remain’ politicians egg you on. Of course you cannot, so in 2018 the British taxpayer will continue to foot the bill. And when it comes to that divorce bill, that is the equivalent of GBP 1 000 for every adult in the UK, without any guarantee of anything in return, that has been signed up to by Theresa May.

One is a general and political point referring to Turkey. Finally, even if with little courage in terms of figures, it was decided to cut the funds. A reflection on this: I have been asking for four years in the Committee on Budgets to intervene on the pre-accession funds for Turkey, and I was always told that it was a problem, because technically it could not be done, there were regulations, and so on. This approach and this cut show that, when there is political will, especially of large groups, there are no rules that prevent intervention with cuts, but it is done. When there is political will, expenses that are unfair are cut. I hope that on this issue, in the coming months and in the next budgets, it will be decided to act with more cuts on this type of funds. The last point, which shocks me, concerns Russian propaganda: one million euros to counter fake news and Russian propaganda.

Now, with the current budgetary method, involving the two budgetary authorities and the Commission, and with the current rules, such political reflection is either impossible or very difficult.

Therefore, the EUR 750 million cut which was originally introduced in the Council position, that now has been reversed, as well as the success of Parliament in mobilising an additional EUR 104.1 million to the global margin for commitments. I think this is very important because it will cover initiatives proposed by Parliament, especially on areas close to my heart – Horizon 2020, Erasmus, COSME and Interrail. These are largely new allocations, which I particularly welcome given the Council’s overarching focus on cuts and the only option in accordance with the political declaration signed in the context of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) midterm revision.  However, Horizon 2020 has brought significant technological progress, not least in clean energy technologies that will help us to meet our targets and this is the best return of all the commitments we have. Erasmus has massive uptake. My own country in particular has more and more students who gain experience that previous generations could not even have imagined by spending time in different Member States. COSME is supporting a significant number of the SMEs that are the lifeblood of our economy.

The agreement is an important one because it includes payment of EUR 46.5 billion for cohesion policy funding (Subchapter 1B), payments that will cover the volume of applications that will be sent for payment from the EU budget in 2018.

We have taken on board the large number of requests to speak and will, on the one hand, heed them for measures to implement the budget; I do not think that one can say: “The current budget framework is not working.” With flexibility and other instruments, we can deal with the most important tasks and expenses for all problems. Nonetheless, Mr Geier, we can learn from this for the next budget framework by trying to integrate external funds and instruments in order to strengthen Parliament's royal right and, secondly, to measure total income somewhat more in line with the known expenditure plus not yet Concretely foreseeable but more likely new challenges that will always arise over a seven-year period. Now, after four years, that shows all too well. There was mostly approval of the budget framework, but there was also harsh criticism. I regret that only one member of the tough critics remained in the room. The issue of the UK's withdrawal has been raised by some of those now absent. We don't have an agreement yet. But one thing is clear: we have a unanimously approved budget framework that will last until the end of 2020. That was also decided in December 2013 by the then British government; she agreed to him. It consists of income, commitments and payments, i.e. expenditure. And if we are now entering into commitments for major infrastructure projects in these budgetary years - railway measures, road measures or research projects - then we must expect that all 28 participants will give us the income for the entire budget, so that unanimously decided expenditures can be made without any disadvantage for any of the remaining Member States. That's what I call consistency and fairness - we expect nothing more and nothing less. Again: the budget framework requires unanimity in the Council. The UK government has approved the entire volume by the end of 2020. I think we can show a lot of added value in this budget; that is important to me. We invest and add value by investing at European level and not just at Member State level. First: research projects. In a dynamic research world, with knowledge of Silicon Valley, Pentagon, Beijing, Shanghai and Seoul, we must see that with such important research goals in the digital age, no member state - not even the large member states - and no company is able to achieve the speed, To go from research to development and production, to create alone. With European research teams - Delft, Oxford, Grenoble, Munich, Cambridge - and with the research industry, we manage to stay ahead in global competition where we are ahead and to keep up with where we are currently behind. Clear added value for every member state, for the European labor market, for European economic strength and competitiveness. A second example: cohesion. As a citizen of a net payer member state, I am proud that part of the money that taxpayers from Germany, among others, put into the European budget goes to Bulgaria for infrastructure projects. Because the per capita GDP is on the European average at 30,000 euros, in Luxembourg at 90,000 euros, in Bulgaria at 6,500 euros. This distance would tear Europe apart and create opposition and not partnership on the continent. That is why we do not have to bring Luxembourg down through sustained cohesion policy, but bring Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Romania up. That's a clear one Mission of a solidary continent, which thus also creates peace across language and territorial borders. I am proud that this is happening. I think we should all be proud of it - no matter where we come from, no matter how wealthy and competitive we are now. A third example: no Member State alone has the authority to make a difference when it comes to climate protection - no Member State! This was shown in Copenhagen in 2009. There was no European strategy, no mandate for the European Union. The opposite example: Paris 2015. We had common goals and were successful together. I believe that our British friends in particular, to whom climate protection is rightly very important, must understand that without the European Union, Europe would no longer be relevant in the global discourse when it comes to climate protection. Another example that I would like to address is the agricultural budget, which is often criticized. There are a few things that can be improved on the subject of greening and climate protection. But the fact that we try to organize healthy food, enough food and intact rural areas with 30 cents per citizen of Europe per day and largely manage it - for 30 cents per citizen and day - is an inexpensive use in the European household with great benefits for everyone who wants healthy foods, drinks and local fare in Europe. I could suffice to mention other examples. I come to the end. Of course we can also make savings in the European budget. But we always have to see: for every 100 euros that a European citizen earns through manual labor, brainwork or investments, 40 to 50 euros go to the public purse. One euro of these 40 to 50 euros goes to Europe. There are 39 to 49 euros in London, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Tallinn, in the regions, in the municipalities. That means we are basically only a fortieth to a fiftieth of what is being spent from public coffers, actually a very economical event.Anyone who argues so vehemently against European budget policy or even speaks of propaganda instead of information that defames the house of history as a house of horror - just done - lives, I believe, in a different, at least not in a correct world.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI", "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Krisztina MORVAI", "mepid": "96661", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members very much for this very interesting exchange of views.

I thank Minister Matti Maasikas for recalling that, over the past three years, we have achieved to an agreement. There was the idea in the European Parliament that we were failing every other year. We failed at the end of 2014 on the 2015 draft budget, but, my dear colleagues, it is not enough to fail to have a better budget. What I remember is that the version developed at the time by the Commission did not make any significant changes. When you're fighting a battle, you have to be prepared to go all the way, including refusing to vote on the budget, but I did not find, at the time, the support one could have imagined in this regard. Having said that, I would also like to convince my colleagues who have given us to understand that they could abstain tomorrow. I would like to be sure there is no misunderstanding. First, Mr Viotti could be grateful to us for making sure that the mid-term review is not an intangible bible, quite the contrary, and we have demonstrated this. Mr Viotti will be general rapporteur next year, and he will be grateful to us for demonstrating this. Mrs Thomas, I would like to try to convince her anyway. First of all on one point: you told us that there were not enough funds for humanitarian aid and, if I had one small complaint to make to our dear Commissioner, it would be that he could - to be able, on the occasion of the budgetary reconciliation, to tell us that he was preparing to carry out a transfer project of 62 million taken from the appropriations of the Turkish pre-accession, and this in favor of humanitarian aid. Do not take it in a bad light, Commissioner, I just want to say that this argument could allay the fears of Mrs Thomas and convince her to vote this draft budget. Second element, she tells us that, concerning the initiative for the employment of young people, basically, she fears the concentration of credits at the beginning of the period, and it is true that last year, there was a note of bottom of page, but this note disappeared. There were no comments, no restrictions on the part of the Commission, on the vote of the 116 million amendment that was passed, so there are no restrictions, Mrs Thomas. I wanted to allow myself these observations and tell you, dear colleagues, that our budget, as we have recalled, is 1% of European gross domestic product and that, in this budget, 80% is earmarked, i.e. common agricultural policy, either to the Cohesion Fund, country by country, to the nearest euro, as well as to the institutions - the Commission, the Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and a number of other European institutions. So I trust the Commission. Commitments have been made, in particular for the Court of Justice, and I have no doubt that they will be honored. I also heard commitments that were going to be made in relation to the wishes expressed by our colleague Deprez on the assistance that would be given to victims of attacks. I'm confident. So, for those of you, dear colleagues, who would have had a hesitation, I would recommend that you vote for this budget for 2018 tomorrow. It would be a way to calmly prepare the next multiannual financial framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "- The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 30 November 2017.

Without ambition, first of all, for young people, since, while an entire generation is going through an unprecedented crisis, the European Union is satisfied with a second best, from volunteering to jobs without prospects, intended to temporarily subtract unemployment figures some of the four million young people deprived of jobs. If the Erasmus + budget is slightly reinforced, it is in particular through cooperation funds that will allow its internationalization to the detriment of young Europeans. Without ambition for research either, since projects capable of ensuring the technological preeminence of Europe are seeing their envelopes cut. For it is, of course, immigration and enlargement that take the lion's share, flouting the disapproval of European public opinion.

Vice-President Šefčovič was scheduled to participate in this debate but he has unfortunately been detained by a medical emergency and he has asked me to present his apologies. We all wish him a speedy recovery. I am also informed that former President Busek is also in hospital and I want to send him my best wishes for a quick and full recovery. The immediate reason for this debate is the third State of the Union report, which the Commission adopted last week. The report gives us an opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved at both European Union and national level, and outlines what must still be done in the future to ensure a successful energy transition in which all of society can participate and engage with the European Union. A clear message stands out already: the energy transition is happening and Europe is moving at a fast pace from an energy system based on the 20th century to a low-carbon, more digital and consumer-centric system that is fit for the future. We can see that the share of renewables in the European Union energy mix continues to rise and we are on track to reach our 2020 target of 20%. The even-better news is that the cost of renewables is falling. Already today, the European Union has successfully decoupled its greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth. Between 1990 and 2016 our gross domestic product in Europe grew by 53%, while total greenhouse gas emissions declined by 23% over the same period. The Commission has delivered its part in implementing an Energy Union and the main legislative proposals provided for in the Energy Union strategy are now on the table. The European Parliament has also played its part. Two weeks ago we reached a milestone agreement on the Emissions Trading System, which, thanks notably to European Parliament efforts, will be considerably strengthened for the next trading period. Similarly, we welcome the process of negotiation on the revision of the Effort Sharing Regulation and the integration of land use, land-use change and forestry. Let me also take this opportunity to thank you for your efforts on reaching agreements on security of supply, an intergovernmental decision which came into force last May. This reflects a major political success enhancing the security of energy supply to the European Union. The negotiations on the Clean Energy for All Europeans package are advancing and it is now up to the co-legislators to finalise it. I am pleased to note that progress is being made on all eight of the legislative proposals in the package. The first trilogue has already taken place on the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which we hope can be finalised by the end of this year. Despite substantial progress further efforts will clearly be needed to meet the European Union’s energy efficiency targets, notably to prevent further increases in energy consumption as the cost of higher economic growth. The Energy Efficiency Progress Report accompanying the State of the Union closely monitors the progress towards a 20% target by 2020. This is a further reason why we must ensure that the revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive contains a high level of ambition. Let me underline, in this context, that it is essential to have a strong governance system and to have integrated national energy and climate plans for the post-2020 period.

The past year also brought important progress on a range of enabling measures that were put in place by the Commission aimed at overcoming the difficulties experienced by some regions or population groups. Regarding our tailor—made support and assistance to regions in transition, the Commission has always underlined the importance of a socially fair transition to clean energy, and it thanks Parliament for its support. It is an area where European action can add value to the ongoing efforts in Member States. In this context, in December the Commission will launch a platform on core regions in transition to support a valuable economic transformation of core regions in a socially fair way. With regard to the islands initiative, in May the Commission, together with 14 Member States, signed a political declaration in Malta to accelerate the clean energy transition on islands and the first forum took place in Crete in September. Energy poverty affects close to 50 million of our citizens. This is not acceptable and the Clean Energy for All Europeans package includes a range of measures to address this through energy efficiency measures, safeguards against disconnection and better definition and monitoring. I am certain that the co—legislator will have this in mind in the course of our negotiation. Let me turn now to some of the initiatives associated with the third State of the Energy Union report: a new communication on infrastructure, addressing in particular implementation of the 15% interconnection target and the third list of projects of common interest (PCIs). There will be no energy transition if the energy infrastructure is not adapted to the needs of the future energy system. Interconnectors are the physical component of our ongoing energy transition. The communication on infrastructure draws a picture of the progress made in the field of trans—European energy networks. While there is progress, missing infrastructure links identified through the PCI process and the High-Level Groups remain to be completed. Some 30 projects on the first PCI list will have been completed by early next year, 22 for gas and eight for electricity. More needs to be done regarding electricity interconnection projects, storage and smart grids to enable decarbonisation and allow the integration of an increasing amount of renewables. Therefore the third list of projects of common interest identifies 173 PCIs, among which there are 106 electricity projects, 53 gas projects, six oil projects, four smart-grid deployment projects and, for the first time, four CO2 infrastructure projects to address greenhouse gas emission challenges. We expect a further 45 to 50 PCIs to be completed in 2020. The others will take longer. For this reason, it is crucial that enough financing is reserved in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The Infrastructure Communication proposes a new approach to electricity interconnection targets for 2030. It is accompanied by the evaluation of the TEN—E framework, which shows that positive results are becoming visible. The 10% electricity interconnection target has provided political momentum to advance key cross—border projects. It is an important and useful policy tool that has helped by sending a strong political signal towards the development of the trans—European electricity infrastructure. The Commission had previously proposed a general headline target of 15% for 2020. As the reality of the electricity system is changing, we need to move forward to a better adapted interconnection framework. Already in 2030 we expect that more than half of our electricity will come from renewables and, based on the conclusions of the expert groups, three operational thresholds will be established. Finally, turning towards what still needs to be done, let me stress that the Energy Union has reached a critical juncture in order to make it a full success. The Commission will focus on several aims. Firstly: helping to deliver the final outcome of our proposals for the required legislative framework. Second: delivering the enabling framework with a focus on promoting investments at local level closer to the citizen, intensifying support for the transitioning of coal and carbon intensive regions, and ensuring that the efforts of industry are consistent with those of policymakers. The launch of the Clean Energy Industrial Competitiveness Forum will help us drive the process on. And finally, engaging all parts of society. The Commission will continue to secure the participation of all levels of society – young people in particular – and to create a stronger connection between European, national and local efforts. This is key for the success of the energy transition. On this point, I would also ask this House for your help. As Members of the European Parliament, you can encourage and stimulate your constituents and representatives of civil society in your regions to get involved and support the clean energy transition. This Parliament plays an important role in the success of these initiatives.

In Europe, we have a number of challenges, particularly in the field of energy. So, first of all, we have a lot of dependence on fossil sources: coal, oil, gas. This is problematic for both the climate - CO2 emissions - and it is also problematic for our energy independence, namely that we mostly import these sources. Our trends are growing with imports. Secondly, we still have a lot of barriers to cross-border trade. So these barriers are both regulatory and physical - sometimes there is simply a lack of interconnections. And thirdly, we have relatively high energy prices in Europe. This is because we often have limited competition and we also have very distortive subsidies, both for fossil fuels and for renewables. In response, this is the strategy of the European Energy Union, which is, in fact, now being implemented gradually; as the Commissioner said, the laws are going through the process. We need to understand that our climate goals of reducing CO2 emissions do not conflict with our competitive goals of reducing energy prices. We can achieve one and achieve the other. Namely, we need to reduce our dependence on imports, we need to remove barriers to trade, and we need to phase out these market-distorting subsidies, which are ultimately detrimental both to the investment climate and to our goals and, of course, Europe's overall competitiveness.

I think it is always interesting to take some time for that, and in my time today I just want to convey one message. I want you to pay a lot of attention to the strong message this Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy gave yesterday. We had a very important vote on two very important files. There was a clear majority, supported by nearly all Groups in the House, to raise the level of ambition on the deployment of renewable energy in our Union to a target of 35% by 2030 –that is 80% above the target in the Commission’s proposal.  Our high level of ambition on renewables takes fully into account the recent spectacular cost reduction in solar panels and offshore wind. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has calculated that the EU can double its renewables share from 17% to 35% in 2030 in a cost-neutral way. If we accelerate our energy efficiency policies renewables can even deliver a higher share of remaining energy demands. This was also voted for yesterday with a less broad majority, a smaller majority. We voted for a 40% target on energy efficiency.  I would like to ask the Commission to pick the side of Parliament because up until now the Commission has come up with too weak proposals because of the situation in the Council. Now we have the opportunity, dear Commissioner, to take up full responsibility and ambition and take the side of Parliament.

On 31 border directions, less than 51% of the benchmark capacity was offered to the market. Some borders even have zero percent, for instance between Germany and Poland, or no more than 12% between Germany and Denmark.  Many Member States, including my own, still do not take interconnections into account in their capacity assessment nor energy security.

Regional cooperation, looking at the capacity across borders, is crucial to improve the efficiency of our energy systems.

On November 8th, exactly three weeks ago, California Governor Jerry Brown was a guest in this house, and he received a great deal of applause from many of our colleagues for his active climate policy in California and for the diplomatic work he is trying to do globally to limit the damage caused by President Trump in international climate policy to some extent. Jerry Brown received the most applause for his self-criticism. When asked whether he was already satisfied with what he was achieving in California or what he was observing globally in terms of active climate protection policy, Jerry Brown said: To be honest: We are not on track - we are not on a good one Path. I actually expect just as much honesty from the European Commission, especially after the climate conference in Bonn. It sounds good, Mr Arias Cañete, when the Commission keeps saying that we are on the very best path to achieving our climate targets. If you measure that against the goals that you have set yourself for the energy transition in Europe, then you may be on the right track. But if you make the Paris Accords your benchmark, then we are not at all on the right track, because the goals that we have set and that we are working towards mean that complete decarbonisation must take place by 2050. If you start from the climate budgets, the CO2 budgets that remain with us, then if you manage the energy sector as you are planning to do now, we would have to completely decarbonise it from 2030 to 2040 in ten years. And the unreasonable demands that we do not dare to make today, where we are even going back in part to what we can do, you simply want to postpone for the next decade.

The continued imposition by the Commission of never-ending objectives for emissions reductions is forcing the investment of vast amounts of money for activity that will have little or no effect on the climate. Global CO2 emissions will probably keep rising unaffected by these measures. These policies are leading to a massive exit of industry and investment from EU countries to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards and could ultimately increase emissions of CO2.  So we are not so much cutting emissions in the EU as exporting them. Indeed, if you include emissions related to goods imported into the EU, emissions in the EU have actually gone up. Heavy industry, including the cement, steel, aluminium and chemical sectors, is moving factories and jobs out of the EU, leading to a leakage of CO2 emissions without environmental benefits.  This is a particular concern in Germany, which has the largest industrial base in Europe. In Poland electricity prices may double if coal—fired power stations close down. Cement producers have warned that about 80% of production will be offshored. In Britain, overdependence on expensive and intermittent renewables has forced up energy prices. Professor Dieter Helm from Oxford University recently carried out a study for the British Government and said that green taxes will cost the average household almost GBP 150 from next year.

The third report on the implementation status of the Energy Union makes it clear that an energy transition is not possible without adapting the infrastructure to the requirements of a modern energy system. The focus is on the expansion of transmission networks and pipelines, the decentralization of the line systems and the networking of energy, telecommunications and transport infrastructure. That costs money. 200 billion euros are earmarked for expanding the transmission networks and gas pipelines alone. The EU is supporting this within the framework of the TEN-E strategy with an extended list of BCIs, the EFSI, the “Connecting Europe” facility and the EIB. And in order to make the best possible use of the line infrastructure, connections are needed - interconnectivity - and here I welcome the Commission's proposal to increase the interconnectivity target from 10% to 15% by 2030. That will certainly guarantee security of supply. Another building block for a successful energy transition and the achievement of climate targets is the “Clean Energy” package.

That is why I think it is so important to have a focus on the market structures, allowing for cross-border trade, but also allowing for the new energy sources to develop under business competitiveness structures.  I say this because there is a risk that we are planning more than we are developing. When we are discussing the winter package we clearly see the risks. We have seen in history that planned economies are never successful regarding the environment or efficient energy production. That is why it is important that the legislation we are now entering will allow for better market solutions of different kinds.

That is what energy union means. It is a simple concept, but it has a hugely complex challenge in its delivery. We are on track to achieve the 20% renewable energy target in 2020. Okay, that is good, but we also have a situation where some Member States have vastly over-achieved their renewable energy targets but, if they are generating the rest of their power, including their baseload, from dirty coal, do they deserve a bouquet or a brickbat? I am very happy that GDP has started to rise without a parallel rise in emissions, a clear rebuttal to those who say that Europe is only achieving reductions because of economic downturn.  As a rapporteur for ETS Phase 4 and an active participant in many of the other files, I am only too aware that more needs to be done. I welcome the Commission’s third report on the state of the Union, but would ask them to do more. Europe must fight hard for a pre—eminent position in innovation, in battery technology, smart grids, interconnectors and so much more. So much of our ambition will only be delivered if we ensure that funding is available to bridge gaps in the commercialisation of new technology across energy generation, distribution and efficiency.  I agree with the Commissioner that a fair and socially just system is necessary, but I firmly believe that dealing with energy poverty should be part of a much broader Union strategy for jobs and growth.

When we look at how Europe's governments are acting at the moment, yes, there is a real risk that Paris was full of empty promises. And it must not happen! Trump is pulling the Americans out of the Paris Agreement, and therefore Europe must take on an even greater responsibility to lead the way in the green transition. It requires ambitious goals for renewable energy and energy efficiency. It requires a turbo on investments in more energy-efficient buildings and cleaner transportation. It also requires a genuine internal market for energy, which will provide savings for the climate and for Europeans.

Together with the Commission, we are delighted with the positive results achieved by the 2020 targets, and we also very much agree with the Commission's proposals for the future targets for 2030. It can be more ambitious with renewables, as we had in committee, and when it comes to savings, it can be more ambitious the Commission is an ambitious 30% proposal, but it can be achieved. The left side here in the House would like 40%, but that - and this is what all impact assessments say - would destroy the ETS system, and we have to consider whether we might not hinder the structural change towards renewable energies with a 40% saving obligation . Because this saving obligation also applies to renewables. Let's consider the topic of electric vehicles: Wind and sun are not yet as efficient as diesel or gasoline technology. That means that we will need more electricity, more electricity from renewable energies in front of the socket. That is why we cannot now say that we have to save 40% energy. In this way we are hindering the structural change towards renewable energies. It is very dangerous what the European Parliament has now proposed here in committee by a very small majority. Anyone who does not recognize these connections, who is now slowing down the development of renewables, is not concerned with efficiency - and I say that specifically to the left - it's about poker, it's about poker with the council and with the others.

I am going to concentrate on renewable energy because I am honoured to be the rapporteur for the Renewable Energy Directive for my Group – the European People’s Party (EPP) – and I must say, in this regard, that Europe is brimming with potential. I believe that the position the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) took on this directive yesterday can give the industry a needed boost and help us to fulfil President Juncker’s ambition for the EU to be the world leader in renewable energy.  It is now increasingly clear that the final energy targets for 2030 which we agree upon will see the ambition levels raised from those of the October 2014 Council conclusions. On renewables there is a lot of debate to be held in the coming months, especially as we move to the trilogues. For me, it is important that we give the right signal to drive investments, but we must also consider the impact on energy prices that large increases in support for renewables will bring. In many instances, something absent from Brussels’ discussions of renewable energy is the additional costs that a non-pragmatic approach can bring in terms of energy prices. Therefore, maintaining EU competitiveness must go hand-in-hand with the transition to renewables. We must consider those who are seeking to heat their homes, and the energy-intensive factories that employ thousands upon thousands of Europeans. If energy costs are made too high because of policy supports, and the blame is put on renewables, we will get nowhere. That is why I am pleased that we accepted a 35% ambition level in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy yesterday. It is attainable and it was a bottom-line for the rapporteur, Mr Blanco López. We will be looking at issues like competitive systems of tendering, incentivising renewable self-consumption and developing renewable energy communities, as well as simplifying and shortening the approval processes for renewable energy projects.

First of all, I would like to make a general remark. Mr Bendtsen made some comments on a general view about the lack of ambition that we see in the Council when we approach all these energy topics. I welcome the fact that, on the other side, Parliament is showing ambition. It would be impossible to have a reasonable outcome in the trilogues if Parliament had not shown the ambition it is showing now. The role of Commissioner is to be an honest broker, but without an ambitious position on the Parliament side, it would be very difficult to broker any substantive agreement. Sometimes people make speeches about raising the level of ambition and about more targets, but when it comes to taking decisions on the tools, on the Renewable Energy Directive or the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, then things are quite different in the Council. So I welcome the ambition that has been shown and I also welcome the report by Mr Blanco López, which will very clearly permit us to have an important and substantial debate on renewables, taking into account – and in answer to Ms Van Brempt’s point here – the significant fact that the new data on reduced clean technology costs lower the cost of achieving the renewable energy targets, and the achievement today of a 27% target – the one that the Commission is proposing – is cheaper by EUR 2.9 billion a year compared with the framework scenario we were given. So there is scope for having important discussions in the trilogue, and let us see what level of ambition the Council shows when it meets to decide on the general approach. I would like to devote a few minutes to energy poverty, because Mr Sylikiotis complained that the package is not ambitious on energy poverty. This is an important topic because one of the key objectives of the new package is to ensure that energy-poor and vulnerable consumers can benefit from modern energy services and are not left behind as consumers but become more engaged with the energy market. While fighting energy poverty is a Member State competence, the package presents a series of measures which support Member States in their efforts to reduce energy poverty. First of all, the package ensures that Member States give proper attention to the issue of energy poverty, that they monitor the number of households in energy poverty, and that all requisite measures are taken to address it. Second, the package gives Member States the tools and incentives to tackle energy poverty at the root, because to meet their energy savings obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive, Member States have to direct energy efficiency measures towards households affected by energy poverty or in social housing. Under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, Member States will have to consider energy poverty in their long-term renovation strategies. The Commission is currently working to set up an Energy Poverty Observatory to assist Member States in addressing energy poverty, and it will disseminate information and good practice. This observatory will be launched at the end of 2017. The package also provides consumers with the right to be informed about disconnection procedures, and alternatives to disconnection, sufficiently in advance and at no extra cost. Ms Harms also wanted to raise the level of ambition. It is very clear that we are now establishing 2030 targets. It is very clear that in 2018 we will have a facilitative dialogue under the framework of the Paris Agreement and that in 2023 there will be a stocktaking exercise in order to prepare new nationally determined contributions (NDCs). So we will be on a continuous pathway to raise the level of ambition and the stages designed under the Paris Agreement rules. In 2020 we will also have to submit decarbonisation strategies. We already have a roadmap, but we will have to improve on it. Mr Balczó was concerned about whether our legislation goes against the subsidiarity principle. We have been very respectful of the competences of Member States and when we establish regional operation centres we are not invading the competences of Member States or national regulatory authorities. We are only establishing the need to coordinate at regional level because we are no longer energy islands. Member States should now be better interconnected and energy will flow across the continent. We are driving towards a single market in the future, but first we have to integrate regional markets. To do that, we need regional operation centres, but we believe we have fully respected the subsidiarity principle. There was a contribution by Mr Howarth about competitiveness. Competitiveness is one of the five dimensions of the Energy Union and thus is a priority of the governance regulation because, with the national plans, Member States have to report on objectives for national funding targets for research and innovation to make sure that we stay the global leader in renewable energy. The governance regulation established a coherent legal framework aimed at providing long—term global stability and certainty for investors. That is fundamental. We are also putting in place an enabling framework that will be conducive to sustaining investment and growth driven by the deployment of low-carbon technologies. Ha habido una pregunta del señor Marcellesi, relativa a alguna decisión, a algún proyecto de Real Decreto del Gobierno español en torno a la prohibición del cierre de plantas de carbón. En este momento los servicios de la Comisión están analizando este proyecto de norma para ver su conformidad con la normativa europea en su conjunto. Lo que sí les voy decir en este momento —ya se han referido alguna de sus señorías— es que en Bonn hubo un evento, en el marco de la CP.23, en el que aproximadamente 25 países anunciaron su intención de abandonar definitivamente el carbón, entre ellos diez de la Unión Europea. Pero también le debo decir que en estos momentos en la Unión Europea hay 42 regiones —y ha habido algún diputado que lo ha puesto de manifiesto— y 11 Estados miembros que todavía siguen produciendo carbón, y además en 2016 había todavía 206 plantas de generación de carbón en 21 Estados miembros, con una capacidad de 100 gigawatios. Por lo tanto, teniendo en cuenta que el mix energético es competencia de los Estados miembros, la Comisión lo que va a exigir es que se cumpla el Derecho de la Unión y lo que va a hacer la Comisión es exigir que los Estados miembros cumplan sus objetivos de reducción de emisiones, establecidos en la Directiva en el marco de los mercados de carbono, por una parte, y de la Directiva sobre el reparto de esfuerzos, por otra parte. Ha habido una intervención del señor Benito Ziluaga relativa a los proyectos de interés común y la existencia de proyectos que apoyan el gas. Como sabe perfectamente el señor Benito Ziluaga, la selección de los proyectos es un proceso complejo. En primer lugar, los que presentan el proyecto son los promotores de los mismos. En segundo lugar, los grupos regionales, en los que están representantes de los Estados miembros, de los operadores de redes, de las autoridades reguladoras nacionales, de la Agencia de Cooperación de los Reguladores de la Energía, evalúan los proyectos de acuerdo con el valor añadido que tengan y las políticas europeas. Y se elabora una lista que la Comisión valida definitivamente. Sí le puedo decir que, si analiza la evolución de los proyectos en la lista que tenemos en este momento, verá que en 2015 los proyectos de electricidad eran el 55 % y ahora son el 61 %; los de gas eran el 39 % y ahora son el 30 %. Es decir, estamos en una evolución en que los PCI, los proyectos de interés común, cada vez más serán de electricidad y, por supuesto, serán menos de gas. Pero hay que tener en cuenta, no obstante, dos factores: que la demanda de gas en el año 2030 seguirá siendo de 350 000 millones de metros cúbicos y que, en segundo lugar, todavía se necesitan proyectos de gas en algunas regiones, como los países bálticos y los de Europa central y oriental, ya que son muy vulnerables porque dependen de un solo suministrador de gas. Es decir, hay zonas de la Unión Europea en que no hacen falta gasoductos adicionales y hay zonas que están totalmente aisladas y son dependientes de un suministrador único. Por lo tanto, todavía tenemos algunos proyectos que tendrán que realizarse, si bien la tendencia en el futuro será la financiación de proyectos en el sector de la electricidad. Quisiera decirle también al señor Blanco, en relación con su intervención, que la Comisión está en este momento analizando los detalles de su propuesta. Vamos a ver también cuál será la posición del Consejo el 18 de diciembre —la Posición Común—, pero entendemos que es una propuesta que puede ser francamente positiva a la hora de definir ambiciones futuras. Regarding Nord Stream: as you know, the Commission has a mandate to negotiate an international agreement so that we can apply the principles of European legislation. On the other side, we have proposed a reform, an amendment to the current Gas Regulation in order to make sure that the principles that preside in the functioning of the gas markets are also applied to all parts, to off-shore pipelines.  As a whole, I would like to thank all the Members for their interventions and say, to conclude, that the State of the Energy Union report highlights some progress that we have made during the last three years but it also illustrates that we still have a long way to go on the journey towards a carbon-neutral energy system. In the coming months, as we come to finalise the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, it will be vital in finalising the stable regulatory framework to facilitate this journey.  Based on the debate today, I am optimistic that you are aware of the responsibility and opportunities that lie ahead. This is what European citizens are expecting from all of us.

I immediately sent my condolences to the families and friends of the people who lost their lives. In the aftermath of the disaster the Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre was in close contact with the Greek authorities to monitor the situation via the European flood awareness system, and through the help of satellite maps of the affected areas. President Juncker met Prime Minister Tsipras in Gothenburg and he underlined the Commission’s willingness to assist Greece in every possible way. First and foremost, the Commission is open, upon request from the national authorities, to rapidly modifying cohesion policy programmes. This means redirecting some of the funding towards the reconstruction of public infrastructure and the regeneration of economic activity in the affected areas.  Secondly, the EU Solidarity Fund can be activated, provided that all the conditions are fulfilled, should the Greek authorities apply for solidarity assistance.  With climate change bringing more extreme weather events, we need to be able to protect human lives and valuable assets and to make our regions, our cities and our towns more resilient. The European structural and investment funds are there to do just that. They constitute a full package that supports climate-change adaptation, risk prevention and resilience building. Under the current programing period, EUR 1.3 billion is available to Greece for climate-change adaptation and risk-prevention measures.  The Commission is also ready to assist the Greek authorities with the compilation of flood-risk management plans and river management plans. These are essential tools to determine what areas are more prone to floods and how to be more prepared. Significant investment in water, waste water and anti-flooding infrastructure in Greece has been supported by the European Union over many years. Let me give you some figures. Between 2007 and 2013 cohesion policy programmes invested some EUR 1.2 billion to improve water supply across Europe, and that resulted in 1.5 million additional people having better access to water. Over 370 000 more people had access to new or upgraded waste-water treatment facilities. Also some EUR 400 million was invested in risk-prevention measures. This investment improves the daily life of Greek citizens and is helping to avoid disasters in many places. But there is more to it than a list of figures and visible results. Those investments also show the spirit of solidarity that is at the heart of the European project, and that is equally important. Thank you for your attention.

Twenty-one people have lost their lives. Families and friends are grieving for the victims of this latest disaster, and Greece really is one of the hotspots of the effect of climate change that we see all over Europe. We have also had floods in past years, and we have had heatwaves. So this is really where we need to help. We need to do whatever we can do as the European Union. The Commissioner has already outlined some of those issues. I think we should also engage in the long term to help rebuild. Apart from the lives that were lost, we also have severe damage to infrastructure and housing. People’s homes have been destroyed, their economic means of support have been destroyed, and we need to help in the long and medium term, too, so that those properties can be rebuilt, and so that EU regional money and funds can also be used on long-term measures such as anti-flood works and on prevention for the future. It is one thing is, of course, to respond to a disaster, but the second question is how to prevent it from happening again in the future – with smart urban planning, with making sure that we respect the environment, keeping green zones, and making sure that rivers can extend when there is heavy rainfall. All those prevention measures will become more and more important as we see climate change progressing. A joint effort is therefore needed, not just in Greece but also all over Europe, because we have also seen, as colleagues have mentioned, similar disasters happening all over Europe. So we need to get smart. We need to make sure that people are not harmed, that no damage is done by the catastrophe.

Last Thursday, the Commission unveiled its plans to build an immediate response force based on joint operational technical means, such as firefighting planes, joint hospitals, etc. But the most important thing is not the technical infrastructure; it is that the Member States will submit to the Commission their plans for dealing with natural disasters, in order to identify and correct any gaps. So this is the solidarity we demand from the European institutions. It is necessary to allocate funds from the Solidarity Fund, but it comes after the disaster. But prevention is needed.

Mr President, unfortunately, I am more and more present here and in the Member States in the face of such tragedies, in the face of such catastrophes, and I express my sincere condolences once again. You know very well, the European Commission has always been present. I went to the field in Italy, tomorrow I'm going to Portugal where, you know very well that this summer eighty people died in the tragic fires that took place four times over the summer. In Greece, as I said, from the first moment I was here in front of you to change the regulations and you know very well that in the period 2007-2013 we practically took this exceptional measure with your help as co-legislators, to help Greece with liquidity and , so it was practically the only country that did not have co-financing, it did not have to co-finance, so we can unlock all ongoing projects. So, once again, I want to assure you of the full compassion of the European Commission and myself. As I said, we are in constant contact with the Greek authorities to investigate all possibilities, to help Greece, to help the people of Greece. I have listened to you very carefully and I assure you that we in the Commission stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the Greek people and all the states that are suffering because of these issues related to natural disasters, which are more and more frequent, as I said. . We are at the disposal of the Greek authorities, of the national authorities to evaluate together and take immediate and long-term measures together, to help as much as we can, not only in words, as you said, but, you know well, that in deeds we want to do as much as possible. I proposed to Minister Charitsis to examine the Attica Operational Program and see if we can redirect part of the allocation, both for the reconstruction of infrastructure and for economic development. We try to respond as quickly as possible to urgent needs. So far we have not received an assessment from the Greek authorities, as it has been a difficult damage assessment process for Italy. So they cannot be evaluated overnight. In connection with the Solidarity Fund, I have listened to you very carefully and I largely share your point of view. I just want to remind you that this legislation has been adopted by you in the European Parliament and the European Council as co-legislative institutions. Attica, indeed, is the richest region in Greece, and therefore this threshold is higher and we do not yet know whether it can be reached to activate the Solidarity Fund. In any case, we are waiting for this evaluation, but I also want to remind you that this instrument is being re-evaluated every two and a half years and I think that with the negotiation of the new regulations after 2020, we should work together to see to what extent can we leave more room for maneuver in such cases. It is in your hands this decision to re-evaluate the regulations on the Solidarity Fund. In any case, I want to tell you that Greece has benefited from 114.3 million euros in the face of national disasters, both since 2006 for the fires in Evros, in August 2007 for the fires in the forests, in 2014 for the earthquake in Kefalonia, in February for a new earthquake, and we are now in the process of assessing the damage in Lefkada and Lesbos. You know very well that this summer I was right there in Chios when this earthquake occurred. So, 114.3 million euros from the Solidarity Fund, the second country after Italy in terms of these amounts, which reflects the solidarity of the European Union. We still need to assess more precisely, with the help of the Greek authorities, the total damage caused by the floods and see whether the region is eligible for assistance. I would also like to remind you that the European Union has been instrumental over the last year in establishing a preventive and adaptive framework for Greece. I am convinced that, without our ex ante conditionalities, we would have had many more natural disasters in Greece but with these ex ante conditionalities, we have avoided so many things. Following the launch of an EU adaptation strategy in 2013, Greece adopted this national adaptation strategy last year. I know that regions in Greece are working very hard. I know all the Presidents of the 13 regions and they are working very hard to develop and implement regional adaptation action plans. We are not naming and blaming here. It is our duty to do our utmost together so, coupled with the Commission’s recent proposal for a revised civil protection mechanism, this action will certainly allow disasters like the one that hit West Attica to be tackled in a more effective and coordinated way. Mr van Nistelrooij, I want to tell you again that, under the current programming period, Greece has EUR 1.3 billion which have not been spent and are available for climate change adaptation and risk prevention measures so we should have plans and projects to spend this money .

This dossier is just two individual articles of the extremely extensive Commission proposal to revise the Capital Adequacy Regulation CRR 2, more precisely transitional rules for the accounting provisions under the new IFRS 9 standard and for large exposure rules. So it is about certain limits for banks to invest in government bonds that are denominated in foreign currency. It is necessary to deal with these two articles in an accelerated procedure so that these transitional rules can come into force in time for January 1, 2018, in order to avoid a so-called cliff effect by softening the effects of the introduction of these new standards. In July we in the ECON committee already determined the position of the European Parliament with a very large majority and, after three trialogues, we were also able to come to a result with the Council that we believe was very good and supported by a very large majority of this House at committee level. I would therefore like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the representatives of the Commission and the Estonian Council Presidency for the good cooperation and the speedy conclusion of this dossier. What is it in detail? On the one hand, there are accounting standards. IFRS 9 replaces the old accounting standard IAS 39, but brings about significant changes in the accounting for the expected losses of a bank. As a result, there is a risk of a considerable additional burden on the banks due to a significant increase in regulatory capital with the introduction on January 1, 2018. This expected additional burden is intended to ease a transition phase of five years. However, these transitional provisions must then also come into force on January 1st, hence the accelerated procedure that we have chosen here. The European Commission has one to mitigate these consequences The dynamic approach is provided, which allows the expected losses to be added back to equity to a certain extent over a period of five years. We have clearly supported this dynamic approach in our positioning in the European Parliament, since with such an approach the relief can be adjusted annually and unexpected situations such as an economic crisis can be taken into account much better and more risk-sensitive. However, we have also made some important modifications to ensure that the additional burdens actually only caused by the introduction of IFRS 9 are relieved in this transition phase. The position of the Council, on the other hand, was significantly more complex than our position and, conversely, pursues a statistical approach which, however, has a dynamic component. According to this, banks would have to calculate the expected losses for the period of one year and for the entire remaining term in the transition phase using both the statistical approach and a dynamic approach. Only in the event that the result of the calculation according to an annual dynamic calculation method deviates by more than 20% from the calculations according to the original statistical approach at the beginning, for example due to a negative economic shock, can the amount exceed the 20% limit must be calculated back in addition to common equity tier 1 capital. The main concern for us in the trialogue was defending the dynamic components of our approach, and we succeeded in doing so. We have managed to walk the tightrope of reaching a compromise on the basis of the statistical approach of the Commission, but this provides for a strong and clear dynamic component, which says that from a threshold of 0% deviation - i.e. everything that is greater than 0% deviation of the dynamic calculation part from the original static calculation part - here again an addition to equity can take place.This ensures that we can proceed in a more risk-sensitive manner here, that we can make annual adjustments here, and basically that is all that we have pursued here in Parliament with the dynamic approach, with the approach that the Commission originally proposed.All in all, this is an important success for this House in the negotiations with the Council, and we think that we are putting forward something that will ensure, on the one hand, that the new accounting standards will put us in better waters here than in the pastbut also ensures for others that this takes place smoothly and without unnecessary cliff effects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 173, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Peter SIMON", "mepid": "96836", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, the vote in this House today on International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) can be considered an early harvest from the Commission’s November 2016 proposal to amend the prudential requirements for banks. This early harvest is important for at least two reasons. First, it will provide banks with the option to phase in the impact of enhanced expected credit-loss provision. It will also address a specific issue that some Member States have with regard to exposure to the public sector denominated in a currency other than their own under the large exposure rules. Second, it will provide these solutions on time. Subject to Parliament’s agreement, the proposed solution will become available to banks from 1 January 2018 onwards. That is when the IFRS 9 financial instruments become mandatorily applicable and when the existing transitional agreements under the large exposure rules are set to expire. At this point, the impact of IFRS 9 on capital raises may be relatively limited for the majority of banks. However, nobody will really know the impact until the standard is applied. More importantly, nobody knows what the effect of IFRS 9 would be should the economic situation suddenly deteriorate. It is from this ‘better safe than sorry’ perspective that the Commission included a five-year transitional regime in the proposal. This will work as a safeguard against unexpected sudden adverse impacts on bank capital raises, due to a new accounting approach on credit risk provision. The Commission, like Parliament, considers that the dynamic approach would be a more effective safeguard against unexpected deterioration of the economy than a static approach, whereby the amount of add-back would be determined as a point-in-time number. The final political agreement with the Council was on a static approach, but with the dynamic top-up that, thanks to the Parliament’s perseverance during the negotiations, is not subject to any threshold. So, overall I consider that the outcome of the agreed approach will constitute an effective safeguard for the next five years. The adoption of this transitional package is a temporary safeguard. It does not undermine the longer-term risk-reduction benefits of IFRS 9. Enhanced expected credit risk provisioning will lead to earlier and higher provisioning against credit-risk buybacks. IFRS 9 will help prevent the build-up of stock of new non-performing loans with insufficient provisioning. Unlike in the case of IFRS 9, we know what the potential impact would be of failing to put in place a suitable solution for the treatment of public sector exposures denominated in a non-domestic currency under the large exposure rules. For Member States which are not part of the euro but which issue a lot of their public debt in euros, not finding a solution would mean that banks would either have to increase significantly their capital or sell a significant amount of their sovereign bond holdings. That would have the potential to distort the market for government bonds in those Member States. This is why the Commission proposed to provide for a specific arrangement to mitigate such an impact. I welcome the fact that the political agreement reached by this Parliament and the Council is very close to the Commission’s proposal. Parliament’s vote on this matter can demonstrate that the European legislative construct is capable of delivering important regulation within a short time frame. We have accomplished important work to agree on a final text. I want to take this opportunity to thank Parliament, and in particular Mr Roberto Gualtieri and the rapporteur, Mr Peter Simon and the shadow rapporteurs. Your work on this file can deliver an early harvest from the negotiations on the banking package. I hope this will also be a prelude to an agreement on the full banking package, for the sake of financial stability and economic growth in the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 174, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen!

The new accounting standard is more forward-looking in recognizing expected credit losses in order to ensure adequate risk provisioning by financial institutions and reduce excessive risk-taking.

We strike a good balance between the dynamic and the static approach in order to be more flexible and risk-sensitive in the face of economic changes, we anchor a freedom of choice for institutions to take into account different requirements, we ensure adequate disclosure and reporting requirements, and we set the duration of the regime in accordance with the Basel requirements for five years.

Mr. Karas has just recalled that this Parliament, in its resolution of December 6, 2016, had requested such a procedure for adapting the conditions for introducing IFRS 9 into the financial statements, since this accounting standard will come into force. to January 1 of next year. It was important to recognize that the transitional arrangements were necessary, as a sudden increase in provisions for expected credit losses would have led to a sharp weakening of regulatory capital ratios, just as we ask banks to consolidate them. But we must look beyond this, because if this regulation makes it possible to mitigate the negative impact on the regulatory capital of banks, the question of the impact of this standard on the financial stability of the Union remains unanswered, even then. that the IASB does not yet carry out impact studies. We will therefore have to take up a certain number of concerns that are already on the table regarding the risks of procyclical effects of this standard when a period of recession begins or regarding the question of the alteration of the distribution of credits between activities. , or the risk of shortening loan maturities. This leads us, as Parliament, as we said when adopting IFRS 9, to reiterate our request for a serious assessment of the impact of this standard, in- apart from the amendment which will already be proposed, as we know, next year.

Mr. President, I will not go back, at the beginning of this debate, to all the stages which led to our adopting, I hope, tomorrow this modification of the Instrument for Stability and Peace. I will simply recall that this is a process that started almost four years ago, since it was during the Council in December 2013 that the High Representative envisaged an instrument allowing the financing of equipment for armed forces with from which we have European Union missions that work on security and development. I would like to begin by thanking all of the coordinators and Members of Parliament who worked on this text. I would also like to thank our Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr McAllister, who led the trilogue negotiations, which were swift and successful. The Commission has, moreover, made very significant efforts to find funding that corresponds to Parliament's demands, and I really wanted to thank all the players in this very successful trialogue. To return to the substance of this instrument, I would recall that this is the missing link in European Union instruments in the field of security and development. Today we have missions with the armed forces in certain developing countries, missions which provide training, but which are not able, which do not have the legal, concrete, financial tools to provide equipment - which I would point out that they are non-lethal - civilian equipment that allows these armed forces to support development operations, because we are talking about countries in which no development is possible without the assistance of the armed forces: Mali, Somalia, Niger, the Central African Republic and many others unfortunately. I also wanted to recall that the The debates that we had were extremely rich and interesting, many points of view were expressed. For my part, I had a more ambitious vision for this instrument, it's no secret. We made a compromise, which I find well-made, and I wanted to thank the groups who participated. I also wanted to reiterate - because I always hear arguments - that we must not show bad faith. Firstly, this instrument is legally, financially and politically very framed. We cannot do whatever we want and do anything with this instrument. Second, this instrument is not used to finance arms purchases or deliveries. This is indeed equipment that is non-lethal. I still see and I still read in the press, in particular, arguments which are totally biased, which are totally incorrect. The European Union is not going to finance the purchase of weapons in developing countries, that is not what it is at all. We are talking about non-lethal equipment. I say this very solemnly, very firmly, because I do not want there to be the slightest doubt in this regard, and I would not have allowed the adoption of a text that would go in this direction. So we have a text which is balanced, which is strictly controlled, which is modest - it must be remembered: this is an important contribution in principle, but financially modest, we are talking about 100 million euros for three years. And we also have a contribution today which does not exhaust the debate to come, and I say this in particular for the groups which had reservations: yes, a more sustainable system will be needed in the future and that will be able to do subject to political debate in the coming deadlines. But for now, I think we can be satisfied with the tool that we have put in place and which will be very useful in concrete terms for the Union's missions European Union which are deployed in these sensitive countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Parliament, and notably the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, David McAllister, and of course the rapporteur, Arnaud Danjean, as well as the other Members involved from the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Development. Our cooperation and your engagement over the past months on this important file were truly excellent. I also thank the Council and, in particular, the Estonian Presidency, for their efforts to reach a swift agreement in interinstitutional negotiations. EU assistance under capacity building in support of security and development (CBSD) will be a vital part of our collective efforts to ensure peace, stability, human security and sustainable development in our partner countries. If we want our development policies to be effective and our humanitarian aid to reach the people most in need, it is crucial that our partner countries have professional and well-trained security forces.  This has nothing to do with militarising development cooperation. On the contrary; we want to make sure that our development assistance does not fall into the wrong hands and that all security actors in our partner countries are trained to respect the highest human rights standards. This is also what our partners are asking for. For them, this is a way to protect and enable their economic growth, and it is a matter of autonomy to prevent or manage crises by themselves and take full responsibility for their own destinies.  CBSD respects the spirit and the objectives of the United Nation 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular its Goal 16 on just, peaceful and inclusive societies. To be eligible for EU funding, potential CBSD projects must have development as their main focus and be embedded within a wider security sector reform strategy. Each situation will be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not CBSD activity would be appropriate.  EU financial support will cover the performance of development in human security-related tasks, including by the military in exceptional and well defined circumstances. This could entail training, advice and technical cooperation, including the provision of equipment and infrastructure improvements. In terms of equipment, this may cover, for example, IT systems, protective gear, training-related facilities or health facilities.  We have clearly defined the purposes for which the EU funding will not be used, such as recurrent military expenditure, the procurement of equipment designed to deliver lethal force, or training that contributes specifically to the fighting capacities of the armed forces.  Overall, the European Union objective is to assist partner governments in providing their citizens with effective, legitimate and accountable security and justice services which are consistent with democratic norms, good governance and respect for human rights.  We will monitor CBSD measures closely and evaluate their impact, effectiveness and coherence with SDG 16. This will be done in association with civil society organisations, local authorities and, where appropriate, with Member States. Our ambition now must be to commence rapid implementation of the CBSD project, so as to assist partner countries in need of such support.  We look forward to informing you about CBSD implementation over the coming years and would like to thank you, once again, for our excellent collaboration in reaching this landmark agreement.

Tomorrow we will vote in plenary on the long and initially controversial expansion of the Instrument for Stability and Peace. The text is the result of good collaboration. Because for the regulation as it is now drafted, we have managed to bring the External Action Service, the Commission, the Council and the political groups together here in this House. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Danjean for the committed, compromise-ready and, above all, reliable cooperation, not only because it is rhetorically just as usual, even when things have crumbled. By changing this instrument, the EU is to be put in a position to also work with military actors in the security sector in partner countries. So far that was only possible with the police. And for this purpose, the instrument will be increased by around 100 million euros. If we want our efforts to endure in many countries, then we must also be ready to protect these partner countries' projects and follow-up facilities. In some cases, the military on site must be supported so that it can even do justice to this task. The expansion includes, for example, the provision of - as you have already correctly said - non-lethal equipment: protective vests, transport capacities, first aid equipment. In spite of everything, it is important that the financing of weapons and ammunition is expressly excluded. The key point for us was that the security measures are not funded from funds that have been allocated to aid and development. The first goal of development cooperation is poverty reduction, and military support - even if it is right in this context - must not divert resources from that goal. We have achieved that together There are paragraphs on transparency.It is important to us that the Commission monitors and evaluates the measures taken by the instrument and that the MEPs are regularly informed.The fact that we only achieved these two points after some resistance from the Council and part of the Commission shows how seriously we should take these two commandments in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the instrument contributing to stability and peace is an important tool, as underlined by the European Commission, most recently in the form of the global strategy. Existing tools allow for direct financial support to be given by the EU to police forces, but there are gaps in its ability to make similar provision to other civilian security forces; forces that are often vital to ensuring peace and stability. It is these gaps that this revision hopes to plug. It is important to note that financing options will be limited to non-lethal weapons. So these changes are far removed from representing a move towards financing military hardware by the back door, as some critics have wrongly claimed. Indeed, one of the examples given as a potential use of this instrument would be for the EU mission in Mali for the purposes of financing a garrison of medical facilities. The emphasis is clearly very much based around the mantra of security as a precondition of successful development. And it is on this basis that I strongly support the excellent report by Mr Danjean.

So far, the idea has been that the efforts made via the instrument should be compatible with the DAC regulations and we believe that it should continue to be so. Especially since we are at a time when more and more policy areas are trying to benefit from funds intended for civilian operations in third countries and paid for by development aid. It is important that we ensure that development assistance funds are used in accordance with the regulations and are not diverted to anything else. The legal basis for the Instrument for Peace and Stability is Articles 2009 and 2012 on aid and technical cooperation. According to the Council's own legal statements of 29 July 2016, the proposed change has security as its main purpose and can therefore not be the basis for the proposal. Nothing has changed since then and we believe that the proposal is not compatible with the Treaty and should therefore not be adopted. The problem for us is not that EU countries assist with capacity-building efforts in third countries. The problem is that initiatives that, according to the regulations, burden the Member States' national budgets are instead proposed to receive EU funding taken from other important areas. According to the EU Treaty, EU funds cannot be used for military purposes. Nothing prevents Member States from investing in military capacity building in third countries, but then they must also be prepared to invest in it, instead of taking away the important civilian efforts. So even if the rapporteur has succeeded in getting a joint statement that funds should not be taken from an aid budget, and this will not happen in 2018, a number of other areas in need of increased budget cuts, such as the neighborhood policy, may have foreign police operations and the buffer for disasters.What the development assistance fund was intended to pay for must be taken from elsewhere and it is unclear where.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 196, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Mario BORGHEZIO", "mepid": "21817", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some perplexities, indeed considerable ones, arouse the consideration that this provision, in fact, objectively dismantles the instrument created in 2014 for stability aimed at combating drug trafficking, demining, support for displaced persons, crisis management , rehabilitation and reconstruction of war theaters.

Clearly, the proposal aims to allow the European Union to support the military forces of developing countries.

However, I believe that foreign affairs and national defense must continue to be the sovereignty of states. This is a question of principle, especially for France, which remains a great diplomatic and military power. But it is also wisdom, because the Union lacks realism. It has already failed to stop immigration from Libya, so much so that Italy had to take its place in order to resolve the problem through a bilateral agreement.

Moreover, when almost no country, except Greece, fulfills the commitment made by all within NATO to defense spending, how exactly do they expect to support security, stability and peace worldwide?

The war in Yemen must end. In times of dire humanitarian crisis world-wide, from Syria to Myanmar, Yemen still continues to be the worst of all. And the situation, unfortunately, is getting worse. The current escalation is undermining the prospects of a political settlement, which is the only sustainable solution. We immediately condemned the launch of a missile targeting Riyadh, and we understand Saudi Arabia’s security concerns. At the same time, the new measures taken by the coalition are having a severe impact on the delivery of life-saving assistance. Commercial goods cannot enter the areas beyond government control. Most Yemenis no longer have the means to get food or fuel. This escalation has worsened an already dire humanitarian situation. Today 19 million people are severely affected by the conflict – 19 million people! More than 7 million are on the verge of famine. Yemen is also facing the largest cholera outbreak in living memory. Almost one million suspected cases and more than 2 000 deaths from cholera have been recorded. The numbers are shocking. It has become almost impossible for aid agencies to provide the necessary assistance to the people in need. Despite international pressure and condemnation, international humanitarian law continues to be disregarded. Markets, hospitals, clinics, schools, factories and hundreds of private residences have been hit by air strikes. Densely populated cities continue to be under siege. This war is not only causing mass starvation in Yemen. It is also creating a war economy that benefits only the smugglers and traffickers. All kinds of illegal traffickers, including those involved in arms trafficking, find their way into the country via well-established irregular routes. And beyond the humanitarian tragedy, the security situation is also getting worse. The recent missile attack directed at Riyadh shows that three years of war have made Saudi Arabia, together with the whole region, less secure. Meanwhile, al-Qa’ida and Daesh have found fertile ground in the southeast of the country, precisely at the moment when they have been forced out of Iraq and Syria. This is all happening a few miles from one of the busiest maritime corridors in the world, on the route connecting the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. More than 10% of global trade transits through this corridor. At a time of rising tensions in the Middle East, we cannot afford the risk of a larger conflict. That would be an even greater tragedy, not only for the region but also for the world. It is a global threat. This is the situation we face, and we, the European Union, are on the front line of the world to address both the humanitarian and the political crisis. Firstly, we are doing everything we can to address humanitarian needs. We have privately and publicly called for access to be granted to humanitarian workers. I went myself to Riyadh last month, together with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), to discuss ways to improve humanitarian aid delivery in Yemen. Our humanitarian advocacy was intensified with the adoption of common humanitarian messages in 2017. Foreign Affairs Council conclusions on Yemen were adopted in April this year. Two diplomatic démarches, on access and delivery of humanitarian relief, were delivered to all the parties to the conflict, in March and in August. We are, again, among the top humanitarian donors. The UN Human Rights Council decided in September to establish an international group of experts to examine alleged violations of human rights and international law. We fully support this initiative to guarantee accountability and prevent new abuses. My second point is that humanitarian aid is crucial but it is not enough. As we have said many times, unfortunately, for humanitarian problems we need political solutions. The people of Yemen cannot wait to get sanitation or electricity. There are a number of early recovery projects that can be started right now, even before a final settlement is agreed upon. We are already working with our partners on health, nutrition and local development programmes. Such early recovery can also provide us with some extra leverage to push for peace and conciliation. Thirdly, and maybe the most important point, the European Union is working intensively to help find a political solution to the crisis. We are urging the whole international community to work towards a resumption of the political track. We are encouraging the parties to reach a political solution under UN auspices. We have engaged directly with all parties to build confidence through informal initiatives, particularly at local level. In coordination with the UN Special Envoy and his team, we have explored the possibility of local ceasefires based on mutual trust. This would also lay the groundwork for a resumption of peace talks. We urgently need to revive peace negotiations. Every day, the humanitarian situation gets worse, the security situation also gets worse and a political solution becomes more difficult to achieve. Along with Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, we are using all possible channels to restart the political track. We are sure that we can also count on Parliament’s support to bring this tragedy an end. And what we are talking about here is a tragedy, with many tragic aspects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Tunne KELAM", "mepid": "28424", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I can only agree with the Commissioner’s statement. Yemen has become a key battlefield for the Iranian-Saudi Arabian regional conflict. The country is now fragmented and is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today, but the immediate victims are the people of Yemen. Systematic destruction of infrastructure, civilian targets and the blocking of ports have resulted in a truly catastrophic situation where two thirds, or 28 million, of the population are suffering from dramatic shortages of food and water. In fact, starvation and diseases have become a much greater killer than the war itself. Just one fact: it is estimated that 130 children die each day from famine. I am glad that the Commission and Parliament are united in condemning indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians. We also condemned the launching by Houthi rebels of Iranian-provided missiles against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The situation has become really explosive, as the conflict is spilling over the borders of Yemen. The key priority today is to allow UN relief ships to enter the ports and provide immediate aid to those who are in need. Yes, two days ago, something happened; one port and Sanaa Airport were reopened, but it is far from being enough.  The EU and international actors must work together to bring the main opponents to negotiations. The EU needs an urgent and integrated strategy for Yemen, accompanied by a new push for a Yemen peace initiative under the auspices of the UN. Today, there can be no more excuses for delaying united international action to end this human and political disaster.

Civilians die under the bombs of one of the richest countries in the world – Saudi Arabia – a country to which we continue to sell arms and offer support. The other side of the story is that while we are turning a blind eye and while some are shamefully choosing sides, Saudi Arabia and Iran are turning Yemen into chaos and misery. This is a terrible man—made disaster and it is mostly the result of a wider conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia. I am therefore very worried about the rising tensions and the way this could further affect the whole Middle East region and beyond.  It is difficult to describe the human tragedy going on in Yemen, with famine, malnutrition, a cholera outbreak and death. It is, as many will say today, the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The Commissioner repeatedly mentioned that this is the worst humanitarian crisis known in the world. Yemen is highly dependent on food imports. The Saudi-led coalition has blocked much of the country’s air, sea and land ports, thus there is no access for the desperately-needed humanitarian aid, medicines, assistance and so on. I am adding my voice today to those calling for an immediate and total lift of the blockade and a return to the negotiating table.  Impunity cannot be accepted, neither in Yemen nor in any other place. The many war crimes perpetrated in this conflict have to be investigated and prosecuted. On Monday, a complaint was submitted to the International Criminal Court on this matter and I can only hope an investigation will be launched soon.  Finally, it is imperative to put an end to this conflict, but it is also imperative to realise that long-term aid alone cannot address the full needs of 28 million people. Yemenis need a sustainable solution for development in agriculture, to fund and address their existential needs and give them a chance to live in peace. This is the comprehensive answer they need and it is our duty to help, together with other international actors, find a solution to the worst tragedy known in the history of mankind.

Credible reports that the missile was supplied by Iran further illustrate the complications.  Meanwhile, the people of Yemen are suffering from the largest humanitarian crisis in recent times. The Saudi-led naval blockade is leading to unacceptable food and medical supply shortages. Poor sanitary conditions have also led to a tragic cholera outbreak of epidemic proportions as the number of cases is set to reach one million by the close of this year, only a few months after the first reported case.

Let there be no mistake; these problems and this suffering are man—made. The most respected international organisations are crystal clear.

There are 20.7 million Yemenis who require assistance and, as if that is not cruel enough and bad enough, the Saudi-led coalition, as well as rebels, are blocking land, air and sea borders and access for lifesaving deliveries to people in need. Even if some of these blockades are lifted now, this in no way compensates for the devastating choice of blocking in the first place. Aid should never become a weapon of war.  Conventional weapons of war, including cluster bombs, have been used and are causing civilian deaths on top of the indiscriminate airstrikes that continue to kill. We call for an urgent end to the violence and urge the High Representative to come up with an EU strategy towards Yemen. Key elements of such an EU strategy should be: to engage the Saudi and Iranian sides, to engage in ending the violence and to support the UN-led negotiations. Of course, airstrikes and the killing of civilians should stop, as well as all blockades, so that lifesaving aid can continue to reach people.  We also should have EU funding for accountability mechanisms that must hold violators of international law and those who commit crimes against humanity to account.

The situation has worsened sharply in recent weeks due to the sea and land blockade, which has only left the civilian population in disarray. Beyond the humanitarian situation, the prolongation of this war is synonymous with the collapse of all state institutions. The two small glimmers of hope we can hold on to are the partial lifting of the blockade, which has allowed part of the humanitarian aid to be delivered, and the organization of talks in London in the presence of the United Nations. What role can the European Union play? First of all, I would say that we must support a total lifting of the blockade, with the definitive reopening of ports and airports, to ensure access for humanitarian aid and trade and, indeed, to get the civilian population out. of isolation. This reopening must be done while ensuring that the security conditions are met because we cannot tolerate missiles being launched at neighboring countries. Second, the European Union can and should - in my opinion - play a diplomatic role. We can no longer afford to be just a humanitarian actor. The negotiations have stalled, while the European Union is a credible interlocutor in the eyes of all parties involved in the conflict.

Here, I would like to focus on another point, which you stressed, Commissioner, that of having highlighted the situation of human rights, respect for which must remain at the heart of our concerns. First of all, I express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the conflict which continues to sow death and desolation inside Yemen. The hold and role of Saudi Arabia on Yemen is well known, but we know that, due to this conflict, we have a Yemeni population with significant loss of life, as well as a situation of extreme suffering for those who remain alive, especially women and children. We have had the opportunity to denounce the fact that an important segment of the population cannot even access humanitarian aid, even if only to be able to use basic necessities. This situation has already deserved the attention of the European Union and in fact the Commissioner reminded us that the European Union is the first donor in terms of humanitarian aid and, above all, thank you for having supported the monitoring. violation of human rights. We have had the attention of the United Nations, the Arab League and also several international organizations. The United Nations has recommended that everything be done to bring about a resumption of negotiations, because only negotiations can guarantee a lasting resolution of the conflict and lead to peace. We need a dialogue between the various parties involved, leading to a political solution inclusive, involving all actors in the Middle East area, including Yemen itself.In addition to the Yemeni population, trapped in the internal war, I would also like to highlight the situation of the Yemeni refugees in Djibouti.There is talk of over 4 000 people in a small country like Djibouti, which already welcomes 20 000.

I am ashamed that my country contributes to the devastating situation of the Yemeni people by sharing intelligence with Trump’s criminal administration and helping them find locations for strikes.

We will reflect on how best to use the policy instruments at our disposal to continue to play a constructive role in ending this conflict and helping Yemen on its path to recovery and reconstruction.  There are just two points I would like to raise. Firstly, after a lot of efforts by the international community, and in particular by us as the European Union, regarding humanitarian access, just last week humanitarian flights to and from Sanaa were granted permission to operate. This is the only access for humanitarian assistance into the north of Yemen and must definitely be allowed to operate without interruption. But this is not enough of course, and this is why we have to continue to put pressure in order to sustain unrestricted humanitarian access. It is the only way to provide humanitarian assistance.  The second point I would like to clarify is that any decision to impose an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia would require unanimity within the Council.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! With a large majority in this House, Parliament supports the establishment of a multilateral tribunal as a consequence of the recognition that the old dispute settlement mechanism, the old ISDS system, has many weaknesses and should be thrown in the dustbin of history. We discussed for a long time about non-transparent procedures, about the lack of revision options, about the question that law firms do big business with them, and, and, and. That is not sensible investment protection, and in this respect it is correct - and we as Parliament have ensured that a different system in the Canada Agreement, a court system with judges, with a review body, with full transparency, and, and, and has been established and, as you know, both partners have committed themselves in the Canada Agreement to stand up for a multilateral investment court and also to win partners. We saw that there was a lot of interest in a presentation during the Unctad conference. We saw that many technical meetings were already there. In this respect, this is really a way to really dissolve the old ISDS contracts. We want to support this path, and that is why, Commissioner, we have put this question for an oral answer. There are three points in particular that are important to us. You know the questions that I don't need to read out. Maybe the three elements. First of all: If you want to support this process, it is of course also about knowing what difficulties there are, what counter-arguments and what restrictions there are. And that's why it would be very good if we could talk a little more intensively about where there are actually possible obstacles. For example, I could imagine that some countries on this earth would say: It's really nice if he is with you now His proposal for a multilateral investment court comes around the corner, but the Council of Ministers and some member states are not even able to sign the Uncitral Convention on more transparency. That is a certain contradiction, and I say: that could be an obstacle. So look again: what are the obstacles? Second, we are of course particularly interested in what this actually means for the European bilateral investment agreements and for the only investment agreement that the European Union has passed with ISDS, the Energy Charter. We have around 1,200 bilateral investment agreements. I think it is a miracle that we are arguing fiercely about future agreements and their dispute settlement, but the existing ones simply continue to exist and are also heavily used. For example, Spain is currently one of the countries that has been sued most frequently by other, including European countries, or by companies in European countries and sometimes also from countries that criticize this system particularly strongly. So what about the new approach to the existing agreements? I think you have to be clear about that. Thirdly, there is criticism from my home country from the German Association of Judges, a very serious association of judges, who say: This is not a good system because the national legal process is not exhausted to the full. We would like to have another answer, as you see it - a combination of the request to first exhaust the national legal process in order to then be able to appeal to an international, multilateral court. Three points - among others - that I think are necessary so that we can go on the offensive even more.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 249, "date": "2017-11-29.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you for this question and for the opportunity to discuss where we are in discussions on the Multilateral Investment Court. Mr Lange kindly added some extra questions to the written questions, so I will try to answer them and then we can come back to it in the debate. On the first question in the written questions – because I am eager to answer all of that otherwise I will be criticised – we have engaged, as you know, with Parliament and the stakeholders on the need to reform the existing investor-state dispute arbitration, particularly at meetings in the Committee on International Trade, in public consultation, the impact assessment process, and quite a lot of stakeholder meetings here in Brussels, as well as across Europe and in other countries as well.  From these discussions, it became even clearer that investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), the traditional way of resolving disputes between foreign investors and host states, has a number of shortcomings. We have discussed this numerous times. I think that even in the first hearing I had, before I became Commissioner for Trade, I promised to reform the system, and it was very clear then that many of you already had criticisms. One of the problems is that the disputing parties choose and pay what are perceived to be their adjudicators for each case. This raises important concerns and does not fit with the principle that justice should not only be done, but should also be seen to be done. Secondly, this ad hoc system inevitably creates fragmentation of the interpretation of core elements of investment protection standards, and that leads to uncertainty for governments and investors alike. Furthermore, the ISDS system as it is today is not transparent, it has no possibility for appeal and it does not provide for sufficient review opportunities, and this is a problem. In order to respond to these concerns, we have been working on the initiative to create a permanent Multilateral Investment Court. This would ensure a higher degree of legitimacy, consistency and reliability. It would also reinforce independence and impartiality, transparency and also effectiveness in investment dispute resolution at global level, because this discussion is not only taking place in Europe.  I have been discussing this matter with trade ministers across the globe, and in many countries it is a focus of debate. So they are also looking at how to reform the system. They get a lot of criticism from domestic stakeholders and this is, therefore, something on which there really is a case for global reform, instead of each country trying to reform in its own way. We have examined different options in our Impact Assessment, ranging from the reform of the existing rules or renegotiation of each investment treaty, to the establishment of an appeal body, but these alternatives do not really fully address the totality of the concerns identified by us, and also raised by this House and many others. This is why a Multilateral Investment Court could be the optimal reform of the system.  The Council and its Member States have broadly welcomed this and they have expressed political support. The Commission adopted a recommendation for a Council Decision on 13 September, authorising the opening of negotiations for a Convention establishing the Multilateral Court. That recommendation is public. You can see it, so you will know what we are talking about, and we are looking forward to the swift adoption by the Council of the authorisation and directives. But we still have no indication of when this will come. On the other question, the idea that the Multilateral Investment Court would replace any ISDS mechanism included in the investment treaties; yes, but there are internal bilateral investment treaties (BITs) between EU Member States. They will have to be outside this reform initiative. We consider them, from the Commission side, as contrary to EU law, and Member States have to deal with this issue. Therefore, we should not move them to the Multilateral Investment Court. Another question that was asked was about our current thinking on the relationship between the Multilateral Investment Court and the domestic courts, and how that will be governed in the investment treaties under the Multilateral Investment Court jurisdiction. Our approach, included in our EU Agreement, will be to encourage recourse to domestic courts prior to initiating international dispute settlement. This is the EU position. However, in different countries we are discussing with their different traditions, so we will have to see how we can find a way forward as part of the negotiations. On the fourth question, one of the priorities would be to facilitate access to the Court for SMEs, to ensure full transparency of proceedings, the intervention of affected third parties and an effective international enforcement regime. So these are our priorities for the international negotiations. On the final question, it is intended that discussions and future negotiations on the Court should focus only on procedural issues. Matters such as counter claims and compliance with other international obligations will, in principle, be addressed in the underlying investment treaties to be applied by the Multilateral Investment Court. If such treaties allow for the possibility of bringing counter claims, the new Court should also be able to hear those claims against investors. Finally, it is still too early to say whether the Multilateral Investment Court would be a stand-alone institution, which is one possibility, or docked into another. There are different views on this and options are on the table. It is a little too early to decide this yet, but I promise to keep you fully informed because, of course, we will continue to have the highest level of transparency in these discussions. I welcome the opportunity of discussing this with the House today, and hopefully we will continue these discussions within the International Trade Committee and elsewhere as well.

Thank you Cecilia Malmström! We are here tonight to discuss and debate the fact that the Commission wants to start negotiations on a multilateral court to deal with investment protection disputes. Let me be honest - I still wonder why. I have spent many years following this debate, and I must say that none of what the Commission, and now Cecilia, has declared in a single moment has made it more comprehensible. Actually, it's pretty simple why it's so difficult to understand. This is because there is already a multilateral tool for dealing with the disputes we are talking about. It is ICSID that you are aware of, which was created in 1965, which covers 161 countries and which is basically governed by the same commission, the UN Commission Uncitral, which governs all these types of issues. Now they have decided to reinvent the wheel in a European context and try to create a new, different or maybe even the same type of institution, and therefore I just wonder: Why? To find the answer to that question, I think you have to look in politics, because this is really a question of politics. Unfortunately, it is EU policy at its worst. The story behind this idea, we all know how it started. It actually began with the debate on ISDS, and the dispute resolution process began with a Swedish company, Vattenfall, suing Germany in connection with the decision to phase out nuclear power. My German colleagues nod. You know, that's how it went. Once upon a time, Sweden shut down nuclear power and it was a German company that operated the nuclear power plants, and Sweden paid compensation for it. In this case, no compensation was paid. I do not know whether Vattenfall is entitled or not to compensation. I do not know, but this became a major political problem in Germany. Especially among the German Social Democrats. This major German political problem became the problem of the German government, and what to do then? Then you make your own problem a European problem. All of a sudden ... (inaudible) ... on the EU trying to deal with the controversy over dispute resolution. What is Europe doing then? Let's make this problem a global problem. Can we not ensure that the whole world engages in some way creating a new institution, which we in fact already have, to deal with disputes between states and investors? But I still do not understand why. It is not the case that we have a great many of these disputes. Since the 60s, we have had just over 600. Globally! Then I wonder - is it that we have a lot of problems with the disputes that are being conducted today? So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange. I did a challenge on Twitter for a year or so when the waves of debate were at their height. Now there are not many who are interested anymore but then, when everyone was very interested, I asked: Can you give me an example of a case of such investment disputes that is unfair? I have not received a single proposal. But for every suggestion someone comes up with, I promise to give ten examples that are justified and important. Instead of being caught up in this political description and trying to fix a system that actually works, perhaps one should devote the corresponding commitment and corresponding time to reforming ICSID - the institution that has existed since the 60s, with 161 states, and trying to do so better instead of just duplicating.

Created in the fifties - long past - it does not respond to the democratic principles of our time, it is opaque, lacks predictability and legal consistency, puts at risk the decisions of governments when they regulate in defense of the general interest, does not have a mechanism for appeal and is inaccessible to SMEs. With good reason it generates a frontal rejection of the citizenship. Socialists and Democrats are totally opposed to this system. We already demonstrated this when we forced the reopening of the CETA negotiations to eliminate the resolution of disputes between investors and States. We need to create a new legal framework for investor protection, as we have been proposing in this Parliament and, sincerely, I believe that the multilateral court may be the best solution, because it will allow the same rules to be applied by the same judges to any company in any dispute with any State. Commissioner, I want to congratulate you and your team today because I think you are doing an excellent job of gathering international support for this proposal.

Now the multinationals do not want their cases to be tried in the countries in which they invest and we have seen this with the requirement of ISDS type regulations in CETA or TTIP. Things are simple: we have national jurisdictions and national courts. It is unlikely to say that there will be no protection of rights and investors in national jurisdictions. This is a position that really underestimates national courts. Why should we have this jurisdiction? In whose name will he make decisions? How will these decisions be issued?

Still I’m happy, Commissioner Malmström, that you are not retreating and that you are continuing to address the concerns that have been voiced by this House throughout the various debates on rules-based trade. Some key points that we have expressed concerns about are: the need for more transparency, the need for an appeals mechanism, and also the risk of conflicts of interest for adjudicators or arbitration judges. And it seems, from your presentation, that the multilateral investment court system would actually address these main concerns and could replace the controversial ISDS mechanism. So our Group is very encouraged by these proposed reforms, which are far-reaching. Besides the updates that you gave, it would be good to hear a little more about the specific needs of SMEs – which have always been a priority for our Group – and also what would happen to existing intra-EU bilateral investment treaties that are still in place. That has been perhaps a parallel concern, but it would be good to know a little bit more about where that is going. And I am sure we will hear more details of the proposed organisational nature, the set-up and operation, in order to have a better sense of how that would go.

The problems of the traditional ISDS system are many and well known. Already two years ago, the Commission stated that it would provide a full replacement of the old ISDS mechanism with a ‘modern, efficient, transparent and impartial system for international dispute resolution’. That is a quote. Again, the Commission has stated that it needs a court that is based on public trust. Therefore, the opening of negotiations to set up this system is very welcome. In order to gain public trust, however, the Commission must be able to answer the questions that this Parliament and European citizens have posed. The key question for public trust is: what improvements will this multilateral investment court bring in terms of access to dispute settlement for states, investors and, especially, affected third parties who are often completely denied access to justice? I see the multilateral investment court improving on the technical and procedural problems of the investment court system. But reforming only the institutional and procedural aspects of the system will not solve its fundamental flaws. It does not provide a full replacement of the old system, as was promised two years ago.

So I have more speaking time, right?  Why are we doing this? Mr Fjellner is right that much of the debate in Europe originated around the Vattenfall issue. There was discussion before that, and also in other parts of the world there has been discussion of this. But that was probably the triggering event. It showed that there were issues related to transparency, procedures that were brought into question, and there were certainly questions related to legitimacy. This is a debate that is ongoing around the world. That is why it takes a little time to get everything right, because we do not want to impose a system that is European: we want to listen to our colleagues from other regions as well. Canada and the EU are the leading ones on this, but many other countries are interested. We are looking at setting up a group of friends who could start the process, and start looking into more details of this. If I was unclear in my introduction: all the Member States support this, it is not a Commission-driven idea, it has the support of the Member States. And I believe, judging from various votes, that it has the support of the majority of this House as well. We do not have to re-invent the wheel. We could very well envisage incorporating this into an existing organisation. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) is now discussing it, they agreed that the system needs to be reviewed, so discussions are taking place there. The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is one possibility, although it handles only 60% of cases, so there is not full coverage, and unanimity is required to change the rules, so that could be a cumbersome process, but it is certainly not excluded. Issues related to tax evasion are important, Mr Marias, but they will not be discussed in the Multilateral Investment Court. The intra-EU bilateral investment treaties (BITs) are to be abolished. They cannot be transferred in. Coming back to another question, there is a process being discussed internally to review the Energy Charter as well, and we are looking into this. One of my colleague is responsible, and we could come back to report on how that is going. What would the new court look like? It will have to have independent judges and they will be appointed on a permanent basis; there will have to be two instances; and there will have to be some sort of secretariat – not a huge bureaucracy but a secretariat. There will be costs, depending on how many participate. For purposes of comparison, the appellate body in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) costs EUR 10 million a year, but that is just one figure we can use as a comparative. The aim would be for the least-developed countries to pay less, and then we will have to see how much everybody should contribute. That will also depend on whether we create something new, or plug into something existing – or, rather, something slightly reformed. Responsible business conduct is really important. There are laws that companies need to respect in the various countries, and European companies need to respect European laws even if they are operating abroad. Discussions on investors’ responsibilities are going on in various international forums. There is the human rights working group in the United Nations, and we are following that. It is a little too early to see how it is going. It was a bit dramatic at the start and the scope was unclear but we are participating and I have high hopes that this could lead to something, either as part of the discussion or in parallel. This is an important discussion and it is a firm objective of the Commission that affected communities should have the opportunity to make their views known in proceedings before the future Multilateral Investment Court, so they will have a voice there as well. They could be able to intervene with third-party submissions or amicus curiae. This should be allowed in the proceedings, but exactly how it should work is something we will have to come back to. Lots of work has yet to be done.

In addition to a centralized redress mechanism and the possibility of third party intervention, the proposal contains strict ethical and impartiality requirements, appointment of judges for one term only, full-time appointment of judges and independent appointment mechanisms. This proposal raises a number of practical and legal problems, such as the confidentiality and independence of the parties in the appointment of arbitrators, while raising questions about the cost, duration of procedures and the funding of the tribunal. Moreover, the pool of potential permanent judges of the tribunal with the necessary qualifications, with no conflict of interest, is rather small. Most likely, the tribunal will consist of the same arbitrators who are already arbitrators for investment agreements.

It is disappointing because all the UK candidate cities would have been excellent Capitals of Culture, but more disappointing because I believe this is a direct consequence of Brexit and also a consequence of the ineffective way that the UK Tory Government has acted since the referendum. It’s vital, in my view, that we know how many times the UK Government raised with the European Union representatives the specifics of the Capital of Culture rules and process before last week’s news. And it is ironic that we hear supposed anger about the news from those who campaigned for Brexit. However, Mr President, I appeal to the Commission this evening, on the basis of goodwill, to enter into discussions with those UK cities which aspired to be Capital of Culture in 2023, to see if there is any solution to the impasse in which we find ourselves today. I fear there may not be.

The SCM and more than 4,000 magistrates have shown that the changes will destroy the autonomy of the judiciary. The European Commission has asked the government to consult the Venice Commission, most of which have ignored all alarms. The heads of the two chambers have a direct interest in these changes, one of them being convicted and the other being under investigation for perjury. The two are the leaders of the parties that make up the ruling coalition, so the political stalemate is a major one. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets and are waiting for help from Brussels. I'm afraid that just a harsh reaction can solve something else.

It offers its territory a window on the world and a valuable dynamic for the regional economy, both industrially and in terms of fishing and tourism. However, the free trade agreements imposed by the European Union are now paying a heavy price: the brutal and sudden competition between a local industry and foreign production. Here, the reduction in tariffs enjoyed by Argentine biofuel has the direct effect of a drop in activity of more than 30%. One hundred employees are left behind and the living area today is directly affected.
