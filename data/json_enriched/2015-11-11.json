I am very pleased to be here to outline the main points which are new and to discuss with you the key ideas that we are considering. To engage with the European Parliament at a plenary debate even before the Annual Growth Survey is presented is one of the initiatives to increase democratic accountability that the Commission proposed in the Communication of 21 October on ‘Steps Towards Completing EMU’. As you will recall, the European Commission substantially streamlined the European Semester last year. To enable a more genuine dialogue with the Member States, the Commission published its Country Reports in February, three months before the country-specific recommendations were finalised. The recommendations have become fewer and more focused, and these changes have met with a mostly positive response. The Commission’s Communication on ‘Completing Economic and Monetary Union’ proposed some further changes, in line with the Five Presidents’ Report. The autumn package will therefore include recommendations for the euro area, and there will be increased focus on employment and social matters. This package has been prepared against a background of still moderate economic recovery. But the recovery is boosted by temporary factors and is subject to downside risk. Unemployment is still high in many Member States, with high numbers for long-term and youth unemployment. Macroeconomic imbalances are adjusting, but we need to continue to reduce high public and private debt. Divergence across countries is still large, and this shows in employment and poverty indicators. The 2015 Annual Growth Survey, the first under the new Commission, recommended pursuing an economic and social policy based on three main pillars: a boost to investment; a renewed commitment to structural reforms; and the pursuit of fiscal responsibility. Since then, important steps have been taken both at EU and national level. Member States continue to undergo fundamental and sometimes difficult structural reforms. The Commission has submitted initiatives aimed at restoring growth, improving convergence and promoting social fairness. The Investment Plan for Europe is operational. Parliament and Council adopted in record time the European Fund for Strategic Investment. The Commission has made ambitious proposals to strengthen economic governance. These cover the operation of the European Semester; the macroeconomic imbalances procedure; banking union; and strengthening the social dimension, while reinforcing transparency and democratic legitimacy. Moreover, the EU Internal Market is being strengthened through a new Internal Market Strategy, and Action Plans for a Digital Single Market and Energy Union. All these tools and instruments must now be fully deployed and deliver concrete results for our citizens. Given the economic and social situation in Europe, the three main priorities of the previous Annual Growth Survey remain valid. Of course they need to be updated to take account of the progress made, notably in the Investment Plan, as well as of the new challenges that have emerged, including the refugee crisis. Concerted action on reforms both at the EU and national level is needed to rekindle investment, foster economies that are both competitive and fair, and to run responsible public finances, and we hope that this year’s Annual Growth Survey and European Semester will contribute to these objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 20, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Burkhard BALZ", "mepid": "96997", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr Vice-President, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for his work As the European People's Party, we welcome today's debate on the European Semester. The European Parliament would like to send a few messages to the Commission before the new annual cycle of the semester begins next week. We welcome the fact that the Commission's ideas for fine-tuning the European Semester take into account the legal framework of the European Treaties. We also welcome the fact that the Commission has now made it clear that it will apply the existing budgetary rules and, above all, enforce them. But we will also be very careful to ensure that the Commission will keep this promise in the 2016 semester. We want to underline the focus of the semester on economic policy factors, because where the economic basis and labour market policy are right, employment and social indicators are also developing positively. We also see the positive economic development so far in programme countries such as Portugal, which have made great efforts and where the economy has steadily increased thanks to strict reforms under Christian Democrat government. We cannot fully share the Commission's proposal to introduce a view of the euro area. A view at the euro-zone level must not reduce or even weaken the national responsibility of the individual Member States. And in order to strengthen competitiveness in Europe as a whole, some countries currently have to do more than others. We therefore welcome the establishment of national competition councils. An independent Council of Experts can certainly be helpful if its mandate is geared towards following up precisely where, as we know, economic and reform policy is most urgently needed. We are therefore giving the Commission a mandate for this semester cycle: tackle the problems at the roots! Stay true to yourself as guardian of the Treaties!

Yes, there are some signs of recovery, but it is still a mild recovery. My question is about the strategy to foster growth in Europe. We can see that, so far, this strategy is mainly led by exports. We do, of course, need to have a competitive economy, but we believe that this is also the right moment to invest more in domestic demand. We need to foster European domestic demand. This means, first of all, pushing for more private and public investment. It also means encouraging consumption, particularly among the middle classes and those who are more impoverished. So we are calling for a new policy mix where investment is really at the top, where reforms are needed. But the reforms should focus mainly on growth potential, innovation, education and energy transition, making sure, too, that we can keep sustainable social welfare systems. To add to this policy mix, we should also focus on reducing social inequalities. This means a very active social policy. We think that fiscal consolidation should indeed be pursued, but in such a way that it is consistent with these previous goals. I would say that this new policy mix should be particularly rigorously applied in the euro area, and that is why we need to reduce the macroeconomic and macro-social imbalances which we have in the euro area and which are undermining its long-term sustainability. Parliament will be very active all through this cycle of the European Semester. We will come forward with a strong and clear position before the Spring European Council, but we are also concerned by the recent package presented by the Commission, because we think that Parliament should be more involved when designing the new instruments – competitiveness boards, the European Fiscal Board, the way for the euro area to manage its external representation and, finally, the way to conduct the European Semester with a proper interinstitutional agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Stanisław OŻÓG", "mepid": "124897", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Dear! The European Commission has already improved the European Semester in some way by changing the calendar of analyses and discussions on the economic situation in the euro area and the Union as a whole. The next steps are aimed at deeper economic and fiscal integration. The new European Semester is also expected to focus more on social aspects and employment, with the social partners playing a central role. I support the fact that the Commission therefore intends to focus regularly also on the social impact assessment of macroeconomic adjustment programmes. This will undoubtedly have a positive effect, but I would like to remind you that the European Semester is above all a process of enhanced coordination of member states' economic policies, the main objective of which is to better take into account the European dimension in the planning of national economic strategies, rather than making decisions strictly the responsibility of the Member States to debate and analyse at European level. I cannot get rid of the impression that any failures of the euro area and the problems resulting from differences in the various economies of the Union are given as an example of further deeper integration. The Commission gives an example of the United States, which speaks with one voice in international economic and financial for a. Turning to the Honourable Commission, comparing Europe with the United States is completely out of place. After all, the United States is one country and the European Union is twenty-eight sovereign states. While I support better coordination of economic policies, especially in euro area countries that share a single currency and depend on each other, I cannot support the Commission's plans to create more transnational beings, such as the European Fiscal Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 23, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   Mr Frunzulic has presented a 'blue card', but the following happens: those who have so far intervened – and so will mrs Kappel – have done so on behalf of their groups.

Of course, we look forward with some excitement to the proposals that we are expecting from the Commission. The tension is not least due to the fact that, during the last session in Strasbourg, we actually dealt with the corresponding issue from last year, and it turns out that our tendency to ideologize issues meant that we could not agree on the substance.  However, as we know, macroeconomics are not an exact science, and so I shall concentrate on two different issues in the following. The first question is not really about macroeconomics, but about a medical problem. The European Union and, above all, the Council seem to be suffering from some kind of schizophrenia in this matter. The rules for the European Semester are approved by the Council. Then the members of the Council, i.e. the Member States, give complete credit for following the decisions they have taken themselves.  We thought that we had hit rock bottom of this development when we felt that only nine Member States had somehow managed to fulfil these councils. But later it turned out that the following year we were down to seven. We must somehow manage this kind of schizophrenia in the decision-making process.  The second question I would like to highlight could actually be described with the word asymmetry. What we experience in almost all decisions is that the 28 Member States are, in many respects, extremely different. At the same time, however, there is a tendency both within Parliament and within the Commission and the Council to take decisions on the basis of the old and bad rule that the same size of the pantyhose should be good enough for everyone.  That is a bad starting point. We must learn that the asymmetric forces in the European Union are extremely powerful and that we must be able to take decisions that reconcile these asymmetric tendencies in a way that keeps this Union together. And that we don't need to hear too many exclamations from, for example, Britain that they want to leave us.

Mr President, I would like to thank the This sentence is not by me, but by the French star economist Thomas Piketty: the European Semester is a European disaster! It is hardly being implemented anyway, and that is a good thing, otherwise the situation in the euro area would be even worse. Since the crisis, government spending and wages have been cut, but unemployment has risen. The eurozone remains in depression, and public debt has exploded rather than fallen. Monetary policy is at its limit and fizzled out. If this policy were a scientific experiment, then the Dijsselbloens and Schäubles would now have to pack everyone up and go home. The experiment failed. Every year the Commission talks about an upswing, but the people do not see it. With the problem in China, hopes for an export-driven upswing like ice in the summer are also melting. The five presidents' report is intended to continue this crazy policy: competition committees should intervene in collective bargaining autonomy, wages should fall until all export champions are world champions. But every child understands that not everyone can be export world champions at the same time. The euro is in danger of breaking up in this policy. Everywhere this policy is being voted out – in Greece, in Portugal – and that is a good thing. Mr Juncker said before the Greek referendum that a 'no' to this crazy policy was incompatible with the euro.

Mr President, welcome Vice-President Dombrovskis, I have listened very carefully to you. I do not see much new in your speech, but if I listen carefully to the weak signals, I hear the adjective or the noun \"social\" several times. And so I'm curious to see the contents of the fall package. Since you are talking about this and your boss wants the European Union to be given a triple-A rating for its social policy - and we are a long way from that - I would like to make some suggestions. In the fight against poverty, as you have noted, the results are not very good; however, when it comes to tackling inequality, you have instruments at your disposal in the Semester. Today, your answer is that you have to continue to deregulate labour markets, because ultimately it is easier for those who are excluded from the labour market to enter. But the result is that those who have a job see their working conditions, wages and non-wages, deteriorate simply because of greater competition between workers. What you could do is decide to focus your recommendations on tax instruments, because the tax instrument is the first redistribution instrument. If you really want to fight poverty effectively, maybe that is the direction that needs to be taken. Do not tell me that tax policy is not a competence of the European Union, because I have already seen in many country-specific recommendations recommendations on the tax system. And so rather than focus on competition in the labour market, you could say: 'I encourage the Member States, in fact, to introduce a tax shift of labour incomes towards other forms of income', but we have to be careful because, if you say 'work income to VAT', it is again the weakest classes in society who are affected. So perhaps you could focus on the issue of tax progressivity. We have been witnessing a reduction in the progressivity of income tax in Europe for decades. Perhaps there is something to be done on this side that would in any case allow you to recommend greater social justice to the Member States. Same thing when it comes to competitiveness, it's not a bad word! I've heard you talk about reviving investment. The two areas where investment is absolutely necessary if we are to be competitive are energy efficiency and resource efficiency - in other words, for the same unit of gross domestic product, we should be using both less energy and less resources than our competitors. It is a question of Greater independence for Europe, which is known to be poor in resources and energy, but also a condition of competitiveness. It would be nice to find that in your recommendations, since the European Commission talks a lot about the circular economy, having said that, I have not seen much action yet. I would like to finish with two specific countries, I have one minute left. Firstly, Germany: the Barroso II Commission had once again protected Germany by preventing excessive surpluses from being really targeted by the macroeconomic imbalance procedure. Where are we today? 8.4% forecast by Ifo in terms of Germany's trade surpluses. I hope that the macroeconomic imbalance procedure will point the finger at the inadequacy of German domestic demand and ask Germany to permanently rebalance its balance of payments. A surplus of 8.4% is completely insane from a macroeconomic point of view. Secondly, I would like to say a very small word about Greece, above all for our colleagues.

As far as we are concerned, this Europe has failed profoundly because it has put profit at the centre of its economic ideology, not man and, therefore, not the whole economic and social situation, which is disintegrating. Democracy is reacting violently and we are seeing how, precisely, an attempt is being made to rebel against what is a technocratic imposition that is coming from the European Commission and the Member States, which only listen to the financial lobbies when they tell them to make a certain kind of reform – I have in mind the reforms in the world of work, which are further widening the social fork and inequalities : we are getting richer and poorer or more exploited.  This is the current situation, and I do not see any interesting reforms, for example in the field of taxation: countries with immoral conduct continue to do so, showing a very poor will to move towards real fiscal justice, precisely because the interests of multinationals are still being done.  This neoliberal approach is not working and will collapse on your head precisely because, by taking away the economic and monetary sovereignty of the countries, you are taking away the possibility of deciding on their own future, of being able to make economic manoeuvres that can really help to emerge from the crisis.  The direction the Commission is taking on financial deregulation is crazy. We have a system that is in danger of imploding and we are moving forward with systems that have proved to be bankrupt, such as the use of financial products to revive the economy instead of seriously regulating finance, making a real structural banking reform that separates business banks from commercial banks. These are the reforms that should be carried out, but they are being shelved because there are lobbyist interests which, I repeat, widen the fork and when there are so many poor people who complain, I repeat, everything will fall on your head and democracy will react violently.

Thank you, Commissioner. The European Economic Policy Coordination Semester was introduced four years ago, together with the Europe 2020 strategy, and it is no more effective in implementation than this strategy. It was certainly well-intentioned, and it is important to coordinate economic policy, only that Europe's economic policy practice shows us that the European Semester does not seem to be a truly effective element of governance for the coordination of economic policy. With review I mentioned that the balance sheet of the Europe 2020 strategy; it is sobering: unemployment remains high – 9.8% in Europe, as we know from the Commission's autumn forecast – investment in research and development is too low and there has been no real progress in the fight against poverty either, and the aim of the 2020 strategy was to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty to just under 100 million. We are a long way from that.  Equally sobering is the results of the European Semester: only 11 percent of the country-specific recommendations are adhered to. We have heard it: nine Member States out of 28 do so. The review of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure discourages a few Member States from passing such macroeconomic imbalances. The same applies to possible measures in connection with an Excessive Deficit Procedure. Here, too, it can be said that some people make it easier. Crisis countries, former crisis countries that have been successful in implementing structural reforms, are making it. We have already heard this today, and the European Commission's autumn forecast has shown it: take Ireland, take Spain and Portugal, here we are on a growth course, here we are going up again, because the structural reforms have been implemented. This is not being done in other countries – regrettably – and because it is not being done, the European economy will not go up.

Despite the fall in oil prices and the relatively weak value of the euro vis-à-vis other major international currencies, the positive growth rates we have in our economies manage to compensate for the huge losses accumulated during the years of the crisis, but fail to substantially affect the still present investment deficit and generate a substantial increase in the employment rate. In the light of this situation, it is essential to intervene with an appropriate policy mix, as my colleague Maria João Rodrigues has already mentioned. The right monetary policy choices that have already been made and those recently announced are certainly heading in the right direction. However, as Governor Draghi himself has repeatedly pointed out, monetary stimulus alone cannot solve the problem of anaemic growth. Fiscal discipline and structural reforms are necessary conditions for rebuilding investor confidence, attracting investment from abroad and improving the competitiveness of our economic system vis-à-vis the rest of the world.  However, relying solely on foreign demand to strengthen our growth is extremely risky. History, as well as the difficulties of the Brics in recent months, teach us that economic systems only become virtuous if they are able to govern their economic cycle on their own, without overly depending on fluctuations in world demand. This means working to relaunch all components of domestic demand, both consumption and investment.  Some countries, with the presentation of their stability laws, have shown that they want to move along this line and at European level many things have already been done, I am thinking, for example, of the Juncker plan, but much remains to be done.

We contemplate the game of chess; we tell each player what he does well or what he does wrong; we sanction some behaviors, but not others; we formulate forecasts that are not always confirmed and recommendations that are not always met. The real deficit we face is European economic governance, global, democratic, responsible.  Everything seems to stay the same here: we have moderate growth,\" they say. We have some new problem, such as refugees, but we must continue with the usual policy: jobs and growth, structural reforms and fiscal balance. We want to believe, it seems, that it is enough to repeat the mantra of austerity so that everything ends up being solved. We insist on the misconception that problems lie exclusively in countries where specific symptoms appear: imbalances, imbalances, mainly deficits and unemployment; and in the also misconception that it is these countries that must and can solve them.  There is no deficit without a symmetrical surplus or debt without equivalent credit. Excess debt is an equivalent excess of credit. Insisting on claiming payment for what should not have been borrowed ends up drowning the debtor and dragging the creditor.  For this reason, the United Nations has just adopted in September the basic principles for sovereign debt restructuring as the only way to break the pernicious loops of \"debt, austerity, more debt, more austerity\".  We issue recommendations for each country and none for the common government: for countries, the European Union is guilty; for the European Union, countries are. Isn't it time to admit that we are all equally guilty and responsible?  Without resolving disparities, increased demand would grow deficits and debt in less competitive countries. If to contain these imbalances we maintain austerity globally, aggregate demand falls and unemployment soars. We will not get out of this loop without a European fiscal policy, both on the revenue side, now diminished by fiscal dumping between countries, and by that of spending diligently designed to increase supply where there is unemployment.

To the extent that the vista ahead is any less bleak, the prime cause is not a sound basis for long-term progress; it is the belated application of quantitative easing across the euro area and the accompanying weakening of the euro. A few years ago one pound sterling was worth only EUR 1.10. Now it is worth EUR 1.40, and yet this exchange rate will surely merely further demonstrate the folly of holding so many divergent economies within a single currency. A somewhat weaker euro will tend to increase trade surpluses in Germany, while it will not be sufficient to stimulate recovery in Greece. After 15 years of failure, it is surely not too early for supporters of the euro to admit it has been a calamity. It has failed for precisely the reasons we sceptics forecast. Weaker economies on lower productivity paths have had economic activity sucked out of them while stuck in a fixed exchange rate with Germany. Artificially cheap money, loaned under the misapprehension that the might of Germany stood behind the borrowings of others, has destabilised economies across the euro area. Yet now you seem to want to integrate further to create a common treasury which will remove tax and spending decisions from national democratic control, and yet the productivity path of the southern periphery will still not match that of Germany. The southern countries lack the scale, the brands, the R&amp;D budgets, the technical education, the smooth industrial relations, the communications infrastructure and the exceptional cultural reverence for work and organisation of Germany. You will need enormous and permanent transfer payments to compensate the weaker parts for living in this straitjacket, and yet the levels of social solidarity required for that will not be forthcoming.

Yes, there is certainly waste that has to be taken away and there is so much to do and to operate. However, it almost seems that we do not want to realize that there are policies, including international policies, that affect our economy: especially during this period we have seen it with the fact that the euro has fallen, with the fact that the energy bill has fallen, that the price of oil has fallen, and this has certainly given our economies some breathing room. I do not know whether these structural reforms will then give us the opportunity to revive the European economy, as they say. What I do know is that having done them and having had austerity has created serious problems, especially from the point of view of poverty, unemployment and the increase – especially in those countries most in difficulty in this respect – of taxes, which then caused business bankruptcies and therefore caused more unemployment.  Now those people who have made these great structural and economic reforms, and who have told us and forced us to do so, are now telling us that there may be an increase in the economy. By the way, it is curious to note that the countries of the euro area will grow less than the countries outside the euro, and this should make the Euro-enthusiasts, those who believe that the single currency is the most important thing, reflect.  I would ask you to reflect on other issues as well. For example, sanctions against Russia have caused economic damage. What are we going to do about China's want to become a market economy? Be ware, because if China has a market economy, that will mean that we will have competition in certain sectors that will be devastating.

I have the honour of accompanying next year's Annual Growth Survey and all the resulting measures within the framework of the semester for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We need to keep three points in mind: firstly, improving the financing environment. The autumn forecast of Directorate-General ECFIN shows that economic growth will increase moderately. In other words, further measures are needed to ensure that we can achieve a further improvement in growth. Measures on the capital market are necessary. In particular, of course, it is important to implement the Capital Markets Union quickly, and it is a question of addressing the banking union and banking financing issues in order to create a favourable refinancing environment. Secondly, as I would like to say at odds with many of my colleagues in this House, structural reforms are needed. We must move away from the idea that the state can deliver everything that people expect without any contribution being made, or that the states are no longer able to refinance themselves on the capital markets. That is why the key word is structural reform and competitiveness. On the other hand, however, we must also be careful not to have a downward quality competition. So when liberal professions are called into question – in Germany, for example – I have no understanding of it either. And we need a credible and responsible fiscal policy to ensure that the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are respected. I hope that Portugal will be looked at closely here. However, I would also like France to finally be looked at clearly – France, which has been violating the Stability and Growth Pact for many years and is unable to achieve its own objectives.

In spite of what party politics may inspire in my colleague, Paulo Rangel, I want to reassure you that the Socialist Party in Portugal has always been the most pro-European party and that the programme of the government that has been prepared as an alternative to the one that has just been dismissed complies fully with Portugal’s commitments in relation to Europe and, in particular, compliance in the governance framework. This is a reassurance that I do not think any party politics should put in jeopardy, and I hope and trust that, if this government is brought to power with the support, in the Portuguese Parliament, of the parties on the left, this is considered as a normal, democratic procedure and that as Commissioner, you will be thinking and acting independently of party politics. So this is something I want to reassure you on, and I really regret that after such a dramatic, negative attack on democracy and on his own country, Mr Paulo Rangel just left the Hemicycle and is not here for a complete debate.

However, the fact that this terrible attack on my own country was prepared and made here in this Parliament has forced me to diverge from my previous organised speech.

At the centre of this political project is an economic anomaly, the euro. This currency never was – and never will be – an economically-sound project. It was a political project and not an economic project. While this may make the federalists here feel fluffy and warm, it certainly does not make the people of Europe feel fluffy and warm as they are entering into an economic crisis.

Thankfully, the case for the UK is not so dire. In the last five years the UK has generated more jobs than the rest of Europe put together. Unfortunately, the Brits are not feeling the benefits, because of endless supplies of cheap European labour flooding our markets and reducing our standard of living.

However, the political rhetoric used to frame and run initiatives has an influence that extends beyond their scope. On the issue of taxation, for instance, the need for Europe-wide action should be restricted to the need for transparency. Widening this approach to open the way for tax convergence and harmonisation is outside the present scope of the Treaties. It is also counterproductive, since it further limits the flexibility of the regions and peripheral countries which most need it. So I would agree to all measures intended to ensure transparency in the assessment of tax dues, but not to measures that contribute to tax convergence and harmonisation. First, there need to be viable programmes that really compensate for the growing economic divergence between the centre and the periphery of the European Union. Too often, EU programmes are assessed on whether they contribute to greater or lesser union. This focus is misplaced. We should be asking all the time how programmes will directly benefit citizens – which citizens, how, when? – taking into account national realities and avoiding one-size—fits—all solutions.

It is clear that the absolute priority that austerity policies place on fiscal consolidation is wrong. And if one had not only approached economic policy with an ideological drive, one should have already known that austerity cannot overcome a crisis. And only for the German colleagues, who sometimes take this particularly vehemently: Germany, too, did not overcome the crisis by fiscal consolidation from 2008 to 2010, but we launched a comprehensive economic recovery plan in Germany, supported the banks, extended short-time working, and we financed this by significantly increasing new debt.

First, last year’s report ignores the disaster of competitive wage devaluation. The economic evidence speaks for itself. Where there has been recovery, in many cases this has been driven by exports, with the notable exception, of course, of my own country, the UK, which has an appalling current account deficit. Across much of the EU, demand from domestic consumption has stagnated, and it has often stagnated because wages have stagnated or even fallen. Increasing the incomes of the least well-off people across Europe is one of the most effective and sustainable ways of promoting growth. I hope this will be acknowledged, rather than dismissed, in the new report. Second, last year’s report only promoted the involvement of social partners in implementing decisions – decisions that were taken by others – yet trade unions in particular often play an essential role in increasing workforce skills and productivity. Five minutes from where I live, there is a factory that produces three mini cars every minute. Trade unionists in that factory, working hand-in-hand with management, have introduced radical innovations, both in production methods and also in management of the workforce. Commissioner Dombrovskis, we have got rid of many relics from the 1970s: flares, kipper ties and Abba have all gone, whether we like it or not.

Where we lack competitiveness we are also suffering increased deficits, and that will not help with the increased spending.

That is a very clear and obvious pattern.

Obviously, in the case of budgets, growth, employment, i.e. competition policies, comparisons are really necessary, because otherwise we will never understand what makes the difference in European wages almost 20 times, depending on which corner of Europe we are looking at, and that is also where the problems arise in terms of taxation.

It is about how to make our economy more competitive and able to meet the new challenges ahead of us. Some say we need to turn challenges into opportunities; for instance that the migration flow can increase regional growth and help us address labour market productivity and demographic challenges. I am actually unsure how straightforward this would be: without the skills and competences, asylum seekers could fall into irregular employment, with disruptive effects on the labour market. We must remember that challenges are not always opportunities and that they must always be carefully addressed at the same time. What we need to do is make Europe’s economy strong enough to respond to difficulties if they arise instead of simply looking at the best-case scenario for the moment. This means serious structural reforms in places where they are most needed, and investing in Europe’s growth. One point I would very much like to emphasise: making the investment plan truly European is also key to the European Semester. It must support the Member States and regions that were hardest hit by the crisis and those with fewer internal resources.

Structural reforms consist of deregulation of the labour market and the insurance system, i.e. a reduction in consumer purchasing power, which means that a recession is under way. Finally, fiscal stabilisation does nothing but ultimately raise the ratio of public debt in relation to Gross Domestic Product, through the recession it is causing.

We will be presenting the annual growth survey (AGS) in detail in a joint meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), so I will be doing this together with Commissioners Thyssen and Moscovici. The European Semester package is specifically designed to shape discussions between EU institutions and in the Member States, including with national parliaments. The various documents will therefore be the subject of debate with the Council, the Eurogroup and this Parliament, and the ensuing common understanding will shape the remainder of the 2016 European Semester. Now let me come back to some of the specific questions which were raised during the debate. First, on strengthening the euro area dimension. Some concerns were raised as regards the practicality of this approach, but here I must note that we are doing this, of course, while respecting the rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, and our intention is to very clearly communicate this also in our documents. A number of questions were raised on strengthening the demand side of the economy, including by investment and consumption, and this was certainly among our priorities in the last European Semester and will remain so in this European Semester too. There is an obvious need to strengthen the demand side of the economy as well as the questions which were raised concerning strengthening the social dimension, reducing inequality, reducing poverty – these are important policy goals. As I said too in my introductory remarks, strengthening the social dimension within the European Semester is one of the work directions we are pursuing, and we will continue to do so in the next European Semester. Some questions were raised on tax policy, including on tax fairness and the effectiveness of the tax system. Here it must be said that the Commission’s recommendation to the Member States typically is to shift the tax burden away from labour – especially low paid labour – to other tax bases which are less detrimental to growth, such as property, consumption, capital. So this emphasis on actually reducing the tax burden – the tax wage on low paid labour – should also contribute to tax fairness. There were probably a number of other issues that were raised, but to give a rather more general summary, I think the approach we are now preparing in the next European Semester in the Annual Growth Survey is a balanced approach which takes into account different concerns, and we hope it will also ensure sustainable and balanced economic growth and strengthen job creation, something we need in Europe very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The debate is closed.

I really welcome the interest Members have put in this topic and I am pleased to see that our views and assessments converge in many aspects. As you know, aviation is a strong driver of economic growth, jobs, trade and mobility. That is why a strong and competitive European aviation sector plays such a crucial role for the EU economy in delivering on the core priorities of the Commission. Europe must maintain its leadership position, in the interests of its citizens and its businesses. The Commission warmly welcomes the support for this approach in Parliament’s draft resolution and the emphasis put on the aeronautics industry as a major contributor to EU growth and jobs, and on innovation as a prerequisite of a competitive and sustainable aviation sector. We fully agree with the call for a long-term strategy for Europe’s aviation sector. Therefore, the upcoming Commission initiative on an Aviation Strategy for Europe, to be adopted on 2 December, will stand as our contribution to help shape the future of the EU aviation system in a comprehensive, holistic manner. Regarding Members’ specific demands, and considering that our work is still ongoing, please allow me to highlight several points. First, in relation to the global perspective, the global aviation market is changing – it is reshaping. We should not be afraid of that but should engage and play a major role in shaping this new world. In this context, I agree with Members that it is essential for EU aviation to be well equipped to compete with strong players in the global marketplace. We face new and relentless competition from regions such as Asia and the Middle East. I just came back from the Middle East today and I can only confirm that. By pursuing an ambitious external aviation policy, the EU could greatly contribute to that, notably through negotiating comprehensive EU-level air transport agreements with key third partners. In particular, market access should be based on a regulatory framework which promotes EU values and standards, enables reciprocal opportunities and prevents distortions. I welcome the call for measures which can effectively address distortive market behaviour in international aviation, which is why the Commission is currently considering new measures to address unfair commercial practices from third countries and third country operators. Second, the internal market. From an internal market perspective, we see that, whilst some airlines continue to struggle with problems, other airlines are doing quite well. Similarly, whilst large airports are profitable, smaller airports struggle to make money. So, despite the industry performing well compared to other world regions, overall financial performance unfortunately remains mixed. Against this background, we have taken a close look at the EU’s regulatory environment. We know that further improvements are necessary to make the sector more efficient, provide stability to investors, encourage new research, innovation and technical solutions, and ensure safety is maintained to its current high level. Third, EASA. I am confident that the proposal to revise the EASA Basic Regulation will allow EASA to continue its good work while adapting to the evolving needs of citizens, industry and regulators. The main objectives will be to introduce new mechanisms for more efficient safety oversight and new methods for more risk-based, proportionate and performance-based rule making. Within this revision, we intend to lay down the basic legal framework for the safe development of all drone operations in Europe, in proportion to the risk. I would like to congratulate Parliament on its work on its report on drones. The fourth issue: social matters. There are many social matters that need to be addressed to ensure competitive and sustainable growth in aviation. I fully agree that we must maintain leadership in aviation, including through a highly-educated, qualified and experienced workforce. At the same time, new businesses and employment models have emerged; their consequences on employment should be looked at closely. An active and comprehensive social dialogue is therefore really essential in this regard. Fifth: improvements and innovation. We welcome the highlighting of the importance of implementing the Single European Sky. SES2+ is an important enabler for modernisation of air traffic management and also ensures better safety oversight of air navigation services. Furthermore, it allows for improved capacity and environmental performance, less congestion and delays for passengers, and reduced costs for the aviation value network. Regarding SESAR, we now have a coherent project, governed by a strong legal framework, driven by innovative partnerships and supported by Union incentives, that is capable of deploying innovative air traffic management concepts in a coordinated manner. Therefore, we agree and share Parliament’s desire to implement SESAR as quickly as possible. For this reason, I can only echo the dissatisfaction with the legislative files on aviation that are still pending – the Slots Directive, Single European Sky 2+ and Passenger Rights. Parliament’s political support is highly welcomed. The sixth topic: the environment. We must deal with the environmental impact of an ever—expanding sector. I am confident that innovation and technical solutions can contribute to a reduced carbon footprint for aviation. I witnessed this myself at the recent Paris and Dubai air shows. The technology is here to serve. At the same time, the EU has put in place powerful regulatory tools to address CO2 emissions. In ICAO, we need to play a critical role towards developing a global solution. We will do everything to enable this to happen. I believe that by working together we can ensure a strong European aviation sector, and I look forward to hearing Members’ views on this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 103, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Marian-Jean MARINESCU", "mepid": "33982", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the Commissioner has already said how important this mode of transport is, which provides connectivity, mobility, economic development, jobs. I think you can see what can happen without this mode of transport even these days, when there are strikes and it creates the big problems that are created in such situations. That is why we must support this industry in absolutely all areas, starting with infrastructure, with airports, with regional airports, with new infrastructure, because airports need this, and then with airlines, to which we need to provide a fair environment for competition. To do this, we need global agreements with the main states, with the main areas that comply with European rules. In particular, I hope that you will receive a mandate from the Council to start negotiations with the Gulf countries.

You mentioned much of what we share, Mrs Bulc: the European aviation industry, with 5.1 million employees, contributes approximately EUR 365 billion a year to the EU's gross domestic product. In this respect, the importance is very great. Nevertheless, we have problems with international competitiveness – that cannot be denied. Today we are deciding what we, as a Parliament, expect from the European Commission in the air transport package. We know that European airlines are exposed to strong international, global competition, which, it must also be said, gains a certain competitive advantage through state support in various ways, whether that is the Gulf States or countries in Asia. However, we should not respond with foreclosure, but rather with a smart and proactive strategy to establish a level playing field for all. We want cooperation based on fairness and transparency. That is why we would like to see the revision of Regulation (EC) No 868/2004. Internally, too, we must first do our homework in order to achieve various objectives internationally through the air transport agreements. In this context, I would also like to mention the social aspects of the European Union. As you mentioned, Commissioner, we need well-trained, motivated workers.

I shall focus on the content of that, and of course the effort he has made to gain support across the groups. But whilst we agree with a great deal of the content, unfortunately there are three key areas which we cannot support. The first is in paragraph 7 and the reference to competition issues. In my view, it is not the EU’s role to determine how third-country global carriers run their businesses or are funded. Provided they are complying with the terms of their air service agreements and international obligations, we are not in a position to interfere. This approach would without doubt seriously damage the credibility of the EU, and it would also undermine our businesses. My second point focuses on the social agenda section. We stress that the aviation industry is recognised as a growing sector that has attracted and provided highly-skilled and motivated professionals, and that in order to continue this trend, current employment legislation on working conditions, standards and practices, including collective bargaining, should be maintained. Unfortunately, the additional paragraphs are extremely overly prescriptive and go into details on employment contracts, job location, etc, which are issues that come under the auspices of national and EU employment law and are not directly dealt with in the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN). Thirdly, paragraph 23 makes a reference to EASA’s role in ICAO, and whilst fully supporting proper recognition of EASA as an extremely effective safety agency, I should stress that we do not support a single EU voice in this area. Worldwide, individual countries are contracted directly to ICAO under the Chicago Convention, and therefore I do not support the removal of the representative from each Member State. To conclude, these are the key reasons why we have tabled a separate ECR resolution, and we will be unable to support the joint resolution at this time.

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the input you have given and your recent impressions of your trip to the Gulf States. It is very important, because it has already been said that the air transport sector is a very important economic factor in Europe, and of course it is very important to us, because many jobs are also attached to it, also indirectly, that we maintain this sector well and strongly. At the moment, we really have various things that we need to make possible: firstly, of course, it is a question of achieving more innovation and, for example, making this possible with new energies and new materials, for example. Three years ago, I got an idea of what the plane of the future looks like, that it flies with seaweed fuel, for example. We are far from that far off, but we must see that we are really making research in this area possible. We need aircraft that are quieter, we also need the opportunity for frequent flyers to go through the security controls more easily, a lot of things that we can achieve. I am convinced that we need global solutions to emissions trading, and we naturally need a solution for competitiveness. As has already been said, it is true that not only the Gulf States, but also others, are making competition for European airlines some whatsoever, and we must see how we create opportunities. It has already been said that we should re-examine this Regulation (EC) No 868/2004 and see whether or not we are actually well equipped to deal with unfair conditions. This should be put to the test – and I am absolutely in favour of this – but at the same time it is also important to consider, we not only have the airlines, we also have jobs at airports and we also have jobs in the aircraft industry, in the aviation industry. I believe that when the Commission comes up with the proposal later, we must ensure that we have a sensible, balanced proposal as a solution on how we want to improve Europe's competitiveness in this area. This is, of course, also possible through air transport agreements, as we have mentioned in our joint resolution. A few more points that I would like to mention: working conditions are of course also important, we need attractive jobs and good training, and we also need good safety options for passengers and crews, too, in order to find satellite systems and aircraft whenever they really have a problem, better provision for the mental health of pilots and also the possibility that new systems for communication between aircraft will also take into account small aircraft.

Consumers are also or, rather, are first and foremost producers and any benefit achieved by the erosion of their social and working conditions cannot be considered a real benefit. I mention this because aviation, and in general transport, is one of the sectors most affected by social dumping. The situation is so serious that it affects even air safety, as recent studies have reported.  I therefore ask the Commission not to delve into the liberation of the aviation sector at the expense of workers, as already raised in agreements such as the ACS or in its commitment to the single sky. We must start from the prior harmonisation of wage conditions, job security and collective bargaining, or quality employment will continue to be destroyed and working conditions forced down. I take this opportunity to express my solidarity with air france workers in their recent conflict.  I would like to raise two additional issues. The first is public property: in connection with the liberalization of the sector, we have seen serious privatizations of airlines and air infrastructure in recent years. We oppose these privatisations because, as the case of AENA in Spain shows, they are real scandals: a gift from the public to financial investors with the support of the Commission.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, aviation is the most greenhouse gas-emitting mode of transport. Per passenger and per kilometre travelled, this mode of transport is three times more harmful to the climate than the car. Imagine that a round trip from London to New York generates about as much greenhouse gas as a single person to heat for a year. And yet, bizarrely, this transport is tax-free: no tax on kerosene or no, or little, VAT for cross-border flights. It's simple, airlines are the champions of the tax gift. We're walking on our heads! Is it normal that kerosene is the only fossil fuel that is not taxed? And why are trains overtaxed, when the air is not, or so little? The result, since 1990, has been that as airfare has decreased, airfare emissions have increased by 110%, and they could even triple by 2050 and take us well beyond 2oC of global warming. With less than a month to go until COP 21, the end of recess must be sounded. Finally, let us tax kerosene like other fuels and end it with the minimum VAT in the air sector. The other challenge is social. The air force has become an economic jungle where all moves are allowed: zero-hours contracts, fake independents, mailbox companies. Employees must have rights guaranteed by EU law. Mrs. Bulc, I trust you. You told us last June that you will not look away from this issue. So let's go, let's end with social dumping and tax dumping in the air, which are always at the expense of employees. Let us reopen Regulation (EC) 868/2004, which has never been implemented to combat unfair tariff practices. Finally, let us put airlines like Ryanair, Norwegian Airlines and others on the right by forcing them to respect the law. This regulation must also enable us to combat unfair competition from Gulf companies. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provide their airlines with tens of billions of euros in state aid to gain control of the air market. How do you want European companies to follow? New regulations are needed against state aid and unfair tariff practices that distort competition. So you see, ladies and gentlemen, we face three challenges when we talk about aviation: the climate challenge, the social challenge and the international challenge. They need to be raised today. The EPP resolution does not answer this at all, but the resolution of the environmentalists brings concrete solutions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in the preamble, I would like to make it clear that I am rather circumspect about the single European sky. The best intentions of the world may well be included, I fear that under the pretext of simplifying the operation of European civil aviation, we will end up creating a gas plant, hit by gigantism and lacking greatly flexibility. However, the resolution we are proposing to address to the Commission seems to me to be interesting on a number of points. First of all in terms of security, and of course we are always in favour of strengthening security, regardless of the field. The uniqueness of civil aviation, which I am familiar with having worked for 35 years at Air France, requires that the safety requirements be maximum. It would be more than time for action by the civil aviation authorities to take action on, for example, the medical follow-up of flight attendants, following the Tragedy of the Germanwings Company.  I am pleased that the joint motion for a resolution calls for supporting the competitiveness of European airlines, we cannot actually stand idly by and watch our historic national airlines, which are part of our country's heritage and influence, sink. Of course, efforts must be made by everyone, including employees, but our companies will not survive if they are not finally put on an equal footing with their competitors, especially the companies of the Gulf countries and Turkey. The latter are heavily subsidised, it has been said, by their governments, not to mention indirect aid, such as exemption from social charges, almost free fuel or exemptions from airport taxes, all of which weigh heavily on European companies and cannot be compensated by any aid, since the Commission prohibits them in the name of the same competition.  Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, you are not going to the end of that logic. By recommending to the Commission to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, you will inevitably increase the already heavy constraints on our companies and thereby penalise customers, since inevitably the price of airfares will be increased again by one or more taxes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 111, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "  NI). Mr President, the air transport sector has all the conditions for it to become an important factor in the economic development of the Member States of the European Union in the near future. For this to happen, however, the relevant strategy of the European Union must be amended so that it can meet the challenges of the present and the future.  Firstly, the industry will have to become competitive in order to cope with the economic pressures it is under from airlines from countries outside the European Union.

On 2 December, we really want to receive an innovative and competitive piece which shows where Mrs Bulc wants to go with the European aviation industry in the coming years. I now understand that it will actually happen on 2 December. I would like to cite four elements. First, competition. In fact, the European aviation industry is already too small. We must be able to compete at world level. But that has to be done in a fair way, and as you know, we have our doubts as to whether that is the case with some Far Eastern countries. So that is a big concern. The second point concerns innovation. The European aircraft industry, as well as developments in drones and satellite systems, are of enormous importance to European industry and we must cherish and promote them. The third point is the social agenda. In the aviation industry, things are sometimes going well and Europe needs to look after its social agenda. And finally, safety.

First of all, it has to take care of this itself. Innovations, outsourcing, mergers – these are painful adaptation processes. But Europe, too, must improve the framework conditions.

However, customer confidence and the increasing price availability of this mode of transport have splendour and shadows. The European Commission rightly wants to address the problems of the present and future of this sector by designing an aviation package. However, such a set of regulations must not hamper the dynamic development of the European aviation industry, in particular by imposing a significant financial and administrative burden on entrepreneurs.  First of all, we need to take care of the safety of pilots, passengers and ground handling and find a way to eliminate air traffic risks early. It is also important to support innovation, which is the key to building effective air control tools.

I am therefore also looking forward to the future: after the aviation package, we can count on a road transport package and, finally, a legislative package on maritime transport. Commissioner, class! The air transport sector has a strong global component, so we should avoid European solo actions and seek action at global level. For example, on the issue of aviation emissions, where only global regulation within the framework of ICAO makes sense. For me, aviation issues also belong in trade agreements such as TTIP. Global regulations play a crucial role, not least because of the competitiveness of the European aviation industry. I am pleased that in our resolution we want to promote competitiveness in particular. Today, European airlines are exposed to strong competition, including from the Gulf States. However, there is virtually no use of existing legislation on protection against unfair pricing practices in the air transport sector. It is therefore desirable for the Commission to address this issue and to present appropriate amendments to the air transport package.

Secondly, the carbon footprint has been referred to, and obviously that is a worry because it is huge, and the Commissioner referred to having powerful regulatory tools to limit CO2 emissions, but also, as one of those representing Parliament in COP21 in Paris, I hope that both the aviation and maritime industries can be included in a global agreement, which we hope we will be able to reach there.

In spite of the big challenges, I know that we are going to address it in the best possible way, with all stakeholders included. Let me quickly reflect on some of the Members’ questions and comments. Unfortunately I will not be able to reply to all of them because of the limited time available. I could speak really fast, but then our interpreters would have a real challenge, so I will try to address as many as I can. Please send us additional questions if I am not able to respond to everyone. First, the issue raised most frequently was that of the safeguards on fair competition. The Commission supports the objective of ensuring fair competition in the aviation sector and we have different tools in order to do this: first, by promoting sound principles of competition enforcement in the bilateral air service agreements, and second, by promoting EU-level air service agreements – especially with important trading partners – that lead to comprehensive agreements and revising the standard ‘fair competition’ clause in order to make it more usable in negotiations with third countries, while ensuring that the exclusive competence of the Commission and national competition authorities in applying EU competition rules is fully respected. That will be stated very clearly. The next question related to subsidies. Let me underline that the existence of subsidies is alleged and not yet proven. Even if subsidies exist, we would need to see whether they have a negative impact on EU companies. That is what we are really after. Let us not forget that the loss of competitiveness in the EU aviation industry is due to a number of reasons, from the continued fragmentation of the European air traffic systems and lack of implementation of the Single European Sky to insufficient infrastructure, and also the lack of a level playing field. The Commission intends to address this in the aviation strategy. The next questions were related to Regulation 868/2004. So far – which is really interesting – no complaint has been lodged by the EU in the industry under the regulation, despite frequent claims and concerns about unfair practice from third countries. The Commission is therefore in the process of finalising the internal revision of Regulation 868/2004. A legislative proposal as a follow-up initiative for the aviation strategy could then be expected by early 2016. Regarding working conditions, in a competitive air transport market, pressure to reduce operational costs is high, which can have an impact on social matters. The Commission, through the aviation strategy, aims to tackle all these challenges. EU aviation players across the entire value chain should be able to benefit fully from the growth potential to allow the maintenance of a strong social agenda and the creation of high—quality jobs. In this context, the most important thing is a very strong social dialogue. I think we established really good conditions for that at the Conference on social issues in transport in June 2015. Atypical forms of employment was the next most frequently mentioned challenge. It is important to have all the factual and legal elements of the developments on the market to understand the implications of the use of atypical forms of employment in aviation and the implications for the EU aviation policy. To this end, the Commission will publish shortly a study on employment and working conditions in air transport and airports. Furthermore, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has set up a working group to assess the safety aspects of new business models. Training and skills and safety and security in Europe meet the highest standards, and they must continue to do so. Some skills and competences are not yet widely available and will have to be developed. Training should be given a high priority. On this matter, the EASA Virtual Academy is developing into a true European network of accredited aviation training institutions and institutes. Common standards regarding the competences of aviation safety inspectors is also a matter we are looking into. The environment: the EU has also put in place powerful regulatory tools, such as the emissions trading scheme, addressing CO2 emissions in the EU. A global market—based mechanism should be pursued to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020, as well as the option of the first ever CO2 standards for aircraft. The challenges of Gibraltar were also mentioned, and I would really like to address them. The Gibraltar issue risks jeopardising several years’ work of three institutions, while preventing the EU from upholding its commitments in this field. We therefore continue to urge both parties to take a constructive approach and find a pragmatic solution. The aviation strategy should provide the political momentum to make progress in this field, in particular for passenger rights and SES 2+, which many Members mentioned. Finally, the Commission intends to put forward its aviation strategy in early December. This will not be a one—off exercise – there is no magic wand – but it the beginning of a process that should lead us to a strong and competitive aviation sector and an ever-stronger single aviation market. I really look forward to continuing this close cooperation with Parliament. I am hopeful that we will achieve a really important breakthrough and that European aviation will continue to be the leader on the European market and globally.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 146, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure to wind up the debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament on the one hand for its essential contribution throughout the legislative process on the open internet and the end of roaming, and on the other hand, in particular for its vote on 27 October. By this vote, the barrier within the internal market represented by roaming charges was abolished and non-discriminatory access to all services offered via the internet was confirmed.  Indeed, it has taken us some time, but together we have achieved, for the benefit of consumers, a common vision that also opens the door to innovative services that we want to see grow more and more in Europe. The issue of zero, which you wished to discuss today, deserves to be addressed in the context of the open internet. It is true that leading experts, including Mr Tim Berners-Lee, on 26 October called on the honourable Members of Parliament to adopt amendments that would allow Member States to create their own rules to regulate the practice of zero rates. In our discussions, whether in the Council or in Parliament, the zero rate has indeed been studied. Why then did we not choose to include these elements in the agreement or, indeed, to propose amendments? I believe that for Parliament and the Council it was important to achieve real European coherence in order to continue to develop the single telecoms market. We wanted to avoid the proliferation of divergent national laws that could create new barriers to the digital single market. In this sense, the adoption of a European regulation would of course be ideal. On the other hand, when we looked at the zero rate, we listened to the opinions and took into account the experiences of the countries that had banned the practice, and the experiences of those who accept it within certain limits. However, we have seen that the practice, while risky, also has a number of tangible benefits, particularly for the consumer.  The main risk is related to the power of operators who could favour their own services or choose the services to be preferred instead of the consumer. We recognise that if there is insufficient competition between operators or between services, this practice poses real risks to the open internet. In the light of these benefits and risks, we did not wish to abolish this practice, but wanted to put in place in the regulation a security system based, in particular, on the control carried out by national regulators or the relevant national authorities.  In practical terms, the regulation obliges the relevant entities to supervise and ensure that the rights of end-users as defined in the regulation are not infringed. In this context, the competent entities are empowered, on the one hand, to intervene against agreements or practices harmful to the rights of end-users, and on the other hand, if necessary, to sanction.  I believe that at the end of the discussions, within the institutions and among co-legislators, we have reached a balanced compromise with this regulation that guarantees an open internet and preserves the interests of consumers and Internet users, excludes abusive behaviour, but leaves whole opportunities for innovation for both new and established operators, and which encourages investment by both.  I would also like to recall the context in which we find ourselves: the Council, Parliament and the Commission are constantly working to improve the internal market, and in particular the digital internal market, and, Commissioner, I heard you this morning - live from Brussels, in Luxembourg - strongly advocating for this digital internal market, so I believe that we are on the right track and of course for the digital attractiveness of Europe. And that is the fundamental issue. In particular, we are advancing very high-speed infrastructure. The more present and accessible this infrastructure is, the less attractive zero-rate practices will be.  Finally, with the end of roaming, we have created additional opportunities for competition between operators at European level. I believe that this increased competition should also contribute to the reduction of the risk associated with the practice of zero rates. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize this great step forward, which we have taken together. With our definition of the open internet, we are definitely putting an end to practices that have been harmful to the consumer for too long.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 176, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. There is no conflict between the Council and the Commission. The TSM Regulation aims to ensure a coherent approach to access to an open Internet in the Internal Market. National regulators will be responsible for ensuring the effective implementation of net neutrality rules. The TSM regulation, adopted here in Parliament in plenary session on 27 October, is the first time that binding net neutrality rules have been incorporated into European law. These rules are genuine common rules based on full harmonisation. And since this is a regulation, the rules are directly enforceable by national courts at the request of citizens or other end-users, as well as by regulators. Until now, most Europeans have not had comparable legal protection for their right to access or disseminate information, content and services of their choice via the Internet. The Regulation also prescribes the principle of non-discriminatory data traffic management – for the first time ever in the EU. It contains a clear anti-discrimination clause that must be respected. Incidentally, by deciding this as a Parliament and the Council, it has become a law, it has far more stability and legal certainty than an administrative decision in the United States, which can be collected or amended at any time overnight. The Regulation is clear in relation to commercial agreements and practices such as zero rating, under which the use of certain services is not counted against the data volume of the end-user. It is neither a blanket ban nor a free pass – zero rating. Such practices are only permitted if they are compatible with net neutrality rules. Our TSM Regulation includes three safeguards to protect end-users from any adverse effects of business agreements and practices, including zero rating. And these safeguards should and can and will ensure that the right of all end-users to access and disseminate information, content and services of their choice via the Internet – which is the cornerstone of the net neutrality provisions in the TSM Regulation – can be effectively applied and enforced. These safeguards ensure that regulators and courts examine the pros and cons of zero-rating and other practices on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the objective of effective choice of end-users is not undermined. According to the first safeguard, commercial agreements and practices are not compatible with the Regulation if they restrict end-users in the exercise of their right of access to or dissemination of information, content, applications and services of their choice via the Internet. This applies to all possible situations in which the choice of end-users is significantly restricted in practice. The second safeguard relates to the fact that all commercial agreements and practices, including zero ratings, must comply with the principle of equal and non-discriminatory treatment of all data traffic, from which no unilateral and contractual deviating must be made. This means that Internet access providers must not apply discriminatory traffic control measures to comply with their contractual arrangements or business practices. The third safeguard concerns the role of national regulatory authorities and other competent authorities. The TSM Regulation gives national regulatory authorities the task – entitles them, obliges them – to ensure, through monitoring and enforcement measures, that the rights of end-users are not adversely affected, including the rights of content, service and application providers. More specifically, national regulators must be empowered to take action against agreements and business practices, including zero ratings, which could lead to situations where the choice of end-users would be significantly restricted in practice. Let me be clear: I have fundamental confidence in the national regulators. They are independent and will further develop independence. They are democratically determined and they are doing a good job. A basic confidence, not a basic mistrust, is my position. Together, these three safeguards provide a future-proof approach that makes it possible to respond not only to current but also to future practices. These provisions leave room for both independent regulators and courts to the concrete impact of commercial practices. They need to examine, taking into account the specific national circumstances, whether a particular practice circumvents the guarantees of an open Internet and whether the choice of end-users is significantly restricted in practice. In addition, the competition law enshrined in the Treaty is directly applicable and can also be enforced. Moreover, the TSM Regulation requires the body of European regulators for electronic communications – BEREC or BEREC, in close cooperation with the Commission and after consulting stakeholders, to issue guidelines for the implementation of the obligation of national regulatory authorities in order to contribute to consistent application. The Commission, in close cooperation with BEREC, will ensure that end-users' choice is ensured, thereby ensuring competition, pluralism and cultural diversity. BEREC and the Commission have already started work on these guidelines. BEREC is expected to adopt it within nine months with our cooperation. The guidelines will provide national regulatory authorities with a common benchmark for examining agreements and commercial practices so that they can take and enforce identical, coherent decisions. Let me add: we are monitoring market developments and if there is abuse in the market, we will react, we will improve our legislative text.

That is why my group has insisted on asking the Commission such a question to ensure that it is actually excluded from a zero-rating practice offered by some entrepreneurs. The answers we have now received – both from the Council and from the Commission – show that the concerns that my group has are entirely justified. Because this practice of zero-ratings is – that sounds good – Internet for free, services for free. However, I maintain that zero-rating is a pseudo-consumer-friendly business practice, because it is a means of infiltrating net neutrality. We must be very clear about this, that we cannot let it run. I cannot allow myself to be fed up with an answer that in two years' time we will see what happens next. Because then the dice have fallen and we will not be able to catch up with them. We only need to look at what the project is doing Internet.org, for example, and how it is questioning precisely this net neutrality and infiltrating, preventing, preventing the possibility of pluralistic access to services on the Internet, and preventing it from being there. And I find that very worrying. I find it all the more worrying that both the Council and the Commission, obviously still do not want to see this and are not prepared to address these issues very quickly. This zero rating also has a direct impact on the competitiveness of innovative young tech providers and app developers, as well as restricting access to a pluralistic Internet.

They argue that consumers have a choice between different free tariffs. Let us assume that is true. They argue that there is competition between telecomcompanies over who offers the better tariff. Let us assume that is true. Then, in any reasoning that they have put forward here, they ignore the third side, namely the services that provide the data, the companies that provide services on the Internet, and they are massively disadvantaged.

Big corporations, big companies and those that are already big, i.e. Google, YouTube, Facebook, similar companies on this scale.

On the contrary, however, the way in which taxation is carried out in Europe at different rates per state inevitably leads to inequalities.

When I think of the fact that consumers with little money will also have access to the information world with free use, I cannot understand why they do not advocate zero-rating. It will be extremely important, especially in the developing countries, to provide access for the poorest of the poor, so that they can use the Internet.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work he has done. Our legislation, which you decided by a large majority, will enter into force on 30 April. It will give our citizens and users significantly more rights – the same in all Member States – than before. It is clearly a strong improvement in the position of consumers with regard to non-discrimination. That is why Parliament voted in favour by a majority. Secondly, I have the impression that the speeches were mixed – some were in agreement, some were very critical. But no digital doom is to be expected. Once again, my request is that the Commission makes proposals, parliament and the Council decide. Now to give the black Peter back to me, two weeks after your decision by a large majority, I call it a transparent game. Nevertheless, I am following your requests. But you could have refused. It is not me, you have decided in Parliament. Sorry – democracy means majority, nothing else, unanimity is unfortunately in the European Council, such a nonsense! We have a majority here, which is an advantage. Parliament has always wanted majority voting, full co-determination and majority voting. You have that, now you have to accept it! This is a strict civic duty for democrats who are subject. Then to speak of \"perverse\" outrages me. \"Perverse\" is a term that I totally reject in terms of subject matter and technical issues. That is under every European belt! Then bringing in the issue of Greece here and linking it to zero ratings is also absurd. These are speeches that are not worthy of a Member of Parliament. Then there is Mrs Reda – she is not here, but she tweets around, presumably she has a pirate-sinking session, so she cannot be there, wants to save her seat – who is constantly tweeting against it. She has the right to speak here, she has the right to vote here. Not me! If it bothers me from the outside in my work here, in the attention to you, I don't call it okay. Only her youth protects her from sharper assessments of her person by me. We want the open Internet. Incidentally, we do not want monopolies, either from Silicon Valley or from powerful large European telecoms. That is why it was the Commission that started the platform consultation. I note in San José, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., there is a lot of interest and nervousness. In the course of next summer, we will make a proposal to you as to whether and to what extent European rules for new players in this market are necessary for fair competition, for competition and for a level playing field. Please support me then! Our telecoms companies – let's take the big ones: Vodafone, Orange, Telefinica, Deutsche Telekom. I think it is also about consumers. And we have achieved a great deal for consumers since liberalisation and privatisation. Today you can buy far more services in mobile communications and the Internet for 100 euros than 20 years ago – far more! We have done our duty to the consumer. But I also do industrial policy. I am with works councils, with trade unions such as ver.di, I am with workers, and I want the telecoms market and the Internet market to be shaped by powerful European telecoms and not just by Americans and Asians. That's what I want. If you want something different, you should say it – to me, but also to the works council of Deutsche Telekom, that of Vodafone, that of Orange, that of Telefinica. I broadly agree with the Italian colleague's intervention. But my main concern in your place would be that the very weak Telecom Italia will be taken over these days. Italy has hardly any more independent companies. Fiat gone, others gone, Alitalia is practically broken. In other words, you must want to work with me to ensure that in some sectors Italy also has independent players with sales, revenues and prospects in the European market and is not taken over by two French investors. Then: Arrivederci, Italia! I trust the regulators a lot. I am sure that the regulators will do their job. If not, we will address it, but now we have a crucial point: we have made a proposal as to what the Competence of the Commission, which you are requesting, should look like. I'll read you the original English text when my services work digitally. Before that, however, there is another point. We have promised to monitor the market, development and, if necessary, to react. Why don't you trust me? That is my word! I I have a few more years of office, and I keep the floor! I have never lied to Parliament and I am constantly talking to rapporteurs and others so that we can respond to abuses – if it shows up – through regulators or through legislation. It is up to you and us alone. By the way, the regulatory authorities – I have looked at a few speeches at their national origin – I would ask Members to ensure a little more independence and a little more staff and a little more authority and competence and quality of some national regulators, who are extremely weak. I am happy to say in four eyes who is meant. They are citizens there, have weight there, I have only limited weight. Support me in the ten or twelve countries where I am not satisfied with the regulation in any way. The Commission has proposed the text proposed by the Commission. 'The Commission may adopt implementing acts defining uniform conditions for the implementation of the obligations of national competent authorities under this article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure procedure referred to in Article 33.' The amendment from Parliament – I respect that, I am a Democrat, I have no right to vote, you are an adult yourself – reads as follows and was adopted as follows: Within six months of the adoption of this regulation BEREC shall, after consulting stakeholders and in close cooperation with the Commission 'lay down general guidelines defining uniform conditions for the implementation of the obligations of national competent authorities under this article, including with respect to the application of traffic management measures and for monitoring of compliance.' In other words, the Commission went in with long trousers and came out in shorts – your work! They cut off my pants. I also get along with shorts. I have enough voice. I can also cope with this competence. However, it is only to take away my competence because Parliament is reluctant to accept implementing acts and then to ask me to be stricter is, in my view, only to a limited extent fair.

And our goal today is indeed to develop this internal market.  So, of course, an important step has been taken thanks to you, thanks to the European Parliament, thanks to the Parliament's vote which took place in October. It is also clear that this single market needs what the Commissioner has called a level playing field and, of course, we must ensure that positions that tend to become monopolies do not develop and that there is free access, open access to the internet. I think that is the other major principle that has been adopted. Of course, you have to be able to ask yourself the questions that one or the other has asked themselves precisely about the level playing field and precisely about possible risks. But there is also the question: how are we finally going to configure each other's offers among operators? I think it's a problem, too.

There is a real risk that mobile operators could use zero rating as a way to incentivise the use of their own services, while lowering overall data allowances. These uncompetitive practices would be bad for consumers, bad for start-ups and bad for competitiveness and innovation in the digital economy. It is now up to national regulators to uphold an open, competitive internet which allows entrepreneurs and start-ups to thrive and compete on a level playing field. If operators are using zero-rating practices to limit competition and favour their own services, immediate enforcement action must be taken. I, along with other MEPs, will be carefully monitoring developments and fighting to ensure the principles of net neutrality we voted for are properly upheld.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to remind you once again of the seriousness of the crisis we are still facing. It is quite normal that this crisis, its difficulties, its problems and also its solutions, should be debated in Parliament. This crisis is not over and may not end any time soon, especially as winter approaches and the situation of tens or even hundreds of thousands of refugees deteriorates. Europe, the European Union and the Member States have not been left inactive in the face of this most complex situation, because there is no quick and easy solution to this problem. A number of proposals have been made. They are being implemented — perhaps too slowly, I grant you. But additional efforts at all levels remain absolutely essential. At their meeting on 23 September, the Heads of State or Government made a number of commitments to address what is already a major challenge for Europe today. The first step is to support refugees who need help and are close to their country of origin. In these camps, housing conditions are often poor, sometimes even catastrophic. There is often no school education for children who are the first and main victims of this crisis and conflict. Food security in these camps is sometimes extremely precarious. The consequence, you know it, is of course the departure to Europe for these refugees who ultimately have no other choice. It is therefore now important to live up to our commitments and implement them. An increase in contributions to various humanitarian organizations and financial instruments are part of these commitments, including the two new trust funds that we can talk about today. The heads of state or government have pledged to increase the European Union's support to international organisations and NGOs supporting Syrian refugees to the tune of EUR 1 billion. These include the World Food Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies. Half of this amount must come from the EU budget and the other half from the member states' bilateral contributions. The first commitment is being made, starting in October. The Member States have given us important additional commitments. The Union will exceed the planned EUR 1 billion, and bilateral discussions with the recipient bodies are already under way to translate these commitments into concrete projects, just as the Commission is doing - I think the Commissioner will tell us. With regard to the new trust funds, these are important tools for pooling financial resources from many sources, both from the EU budget, from the Member States and also from third countries, as well as from various budget lines, including humanitarian aid and development aid. The fund in response to the Syrian crisis is consistent with the contributions to humanitarian organizations I have just mentioned. The focus, particularly in this context, must be placed on the resilience and stabilization of the situation, which, as I have indicated, is extremely precarious. At this stage, the state of contributions to this fund, admittedly, is not yet satisfactory. We must now increase our collective contribution, given the chronic underfunding of resilience projects financed at only 20%, according to the UN, in addition to the contribution of EUR 500 million from the Member States through the EU budget. Let me also point out that the European Union has already committed more than EUR 4.2 billion for humanitarian action since the beginning of the Syrian crisis. The Luxembourg Prime Minister joined the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission in reminding all Member States of their collective responsibility in this regard. In Africa, it is our responsibility to create sustainable conditions so that people seek a better life elsewhere and find opportunities in their home countries. Their families need them; their talent, their energy are needed. The money they have to pay to smugglers and criminals for their passage to Europe would be better invested in the economies of their home countries. But let's face it, it's not going to happen any day! Indeed, we need a new approach to development that focuses on the creation of activities, decent jobs in African countries, on investments that we will make or support in these countries, on the training of young people which is often insufficient, on the development of traditional sectors that sometimes suffer from competition, even In Europe, in agriculture, at the level of fisheries, and we therefore have an absolute obligation to support what we are committed to supporting sustainable development. At this very moment, the Valletta Summit is being held in Malta, where the European Union, together with its African partners, aims to make important decisions on a range of migration-related issues. And as I just said, who says migration, who talks about migration, cannot ignore development issues. One of the measures within this package is the European Union's Emergency Trust Fund for Stability and Combating the Root Causes of Irregular Migration and the Phenomenon of Displaced Persons in Africa. Of course there are political issues, issues of human rights violations, issues of oppression that are very concrete - moreover, when we look at the countries from which illegal migrants come, they often come from countries where, indeed, human rights guarantees are completely absent, if not quite the opposite. As far as the European Union's contribution to this fund is concerned, it will be divided into two parts. The first comes from the European Development Fund (EDF) and the EU budget. That is why it was possible to clarify it at the outset. It is clear that our commitment to sustainable development in Africa must cover the medium and long term, because the problem we must solve is not a short-term problem, it is a problem that can only be solved in the longer term. The Commission has announced funding of EUR 1.8 billion by 2020. In addition to their substantial contribution through the fund, the EDF, which is an intergovernmental fund, some 20 Member States have so far announced an additional national contribution, to the figure of 1.8 billion. Switzerland and Norway also intend to contribute. At the same time, of course, the Member States' bilateral development aid programmes continue to be implemented. The trust fund is part of the answer, but it cannot be a substitute for the usual programming of our financial assistance, especially if we are aiming for a lasting impact — which I believe is our goal for all of us. The Valletta Summit, which is taking place right now, will be an opportunity to make additional commitments with our partners. I therefore ask your understanding if I am not in a position today to give you more precise and definitive figures on the bilateral contributions of Member States to the emergency fund. These will depend, for some, on the outcome of the negotiations in Valletta. My own country, Luxembourg - just to inform you - will contribute 3.1 million euros to the trust fund. We have a development aid contribution of 1.03 per cent of GDP. I would remind you that we have all made commitments in that regard; we made a commitment of 0.7% some time ago. It is true that not everyone reaches this 0.7%, and the situation is such that some countries have cut their development aid. I am not criticising and it is not for me to do so, but I know that, even in my own country, there have been calls for us to actually save a little on development aid because, in the end, it does not hurt anyone. We must then know that, even under budgetary discipline, under budgetary constraints, making these savings represents a cost that could be called a \"deferred cost\", because we see today that migration and underdevelopment are two sides of the same coin and that, if we do not take the issues of underdevelopment, poverty and exclusion of young people in developing countries , the solution for them will ultimately be migration at the cost and risk of their lives. We have often discussed - I think the President of the Commission has also said this - that it will not be barbed wire or walls that will prevent them from coming! What is at stake today is of course an investment in solidarity with our neighbours in Africa, but it is also an investment in our own security. I believe that this is what is at stake and that is what we need to do today and give an important signal at this valletta meeting.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 207, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, our world has become so wealthy that on an annual basis, we produce the incredible amount of over EUR 67 trillion. In this world of ours, unfortunately, the number of people that depend on aid to survive has been growing exponentially. Today, we have 120 million people needing help for their very survival. If they were a country, this would be the 11th largest country in the world, between Japan and Turkey. Half of the population of this country are homeless. They are displaced by conflicts or by natural disasters. Of those displaced, the largest share live in our neighbourhood. They live in Africa, North Africa and the Middle East. It is very clear that we in Europe are being tested not only to help the one million that have made it to our shores, but also to help the 59 million. That task is morally right, but it is also in our own self-interest. If we want to have a more manageable situation in which we can be good citizens and help people, we absolutely must increase our attention and support for people where they are – in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, as well as in the countries of the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. That is why we in the Commission have decided that, in addition to our normal development and humanitarian work, we are going to make use of the new Trust Fund instrument, because this has the capacity to pool large sums which otherwise may be dispersed in small and not sufficiently effective programmes. It allows us to make quick decisions and finance activities, and it gives us the flexibility to adjust to changing demands. It gives us a chance to bring in more donors and, by doing so, to reduce the administrative costs and increase the effectiveness and impact. We have taken decisions recently to create two trust funds. As we have heard, one of them is on the table of the Valletta Summit – the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. I will start with that. It has already been discussed by High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini and Commissioner Mimica with the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and the Committee on Development (DEVE) in September. On 9 September, President Juncker framed the proposal for the creation of this trust fund with the objective of helping people, addressing the root causes of instability and irregular migration, and helping displaced populations in Africa. I am very pleased to say that, between 9 September and 20 October, work had advanced to a point where we in the Commission were able to adopt the relevant decision with the draft constitutive agreement to get the trust fund up and running. It focuses on providing economic opportunities, supporting the resilience of communities, building more security and development opportunities and providing better migration management in the Sahel, Lake Chad, Horn of Africa and North Africa. It is very important to stress that the trust fund helps us to tackle the root causes of migration and to help people with immediate priority needs. It is flexible, it allows immediate and concrete actions, and it is also a very good framework for more EU visibility for doing what our people fund us to do. The specific targeted actions include creating employment, especially for young people and for women; building links between development and security; and supporting very concrete actions in terms of migration and refugee management. We are looking forward to the outcomes of the Valletta Summit. We hope to see additional resources. Today, as we have heard from Mr Schmit, we have EUR 1.8 billion in the trust fund, plus an additional EUR 70 million committed already by Member States, and I hope that we will see additional commitments at the Valletta Summit. I want also to flag up that in this trust fund we are proposing to allocate EUR 200 million to a specific window for Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. I do not need to explain why these countries are such an important target area for that kind of assistance. The second trust fund we have created is the Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis. It was established in December 2014 with the objective of providing a more coherent and comprehensive aid response to the Syrian crisis on a regional scale, primarily focusing on the needs of Syrians in neighbouring countries. But we are also able to use this fund to help Syrians in Syria, and to help Syrians that have already taken the route to Europe and are in some of the countries neighbouring the EU on the western route. This fund has actually got a very appropriate name. The name is the Madad Fund. Madad means hope, and it is about sending a signal to the Syrian refugees that the world has not forgotten them, that there is hope. Many of them are on their way to Europe because they lost hope for themselves and for their children. One of the objectives of the fund is in fact to support education for Syrian children. This has been one of the biggest tragedies of this five-year war. Syria is a country that used to be very high in educational achievement, with a 97-98% literacy rate. It was a country where you would ask children what they wanted to be they would say a doctor, an engineer or a teacher. Almost two-thirds of these children are either out of school or are attending school irregularly. Having a chance to help them to get the education they deserve is also a way to help their families to stay and not to be on the move. To date, we have received pledges from nine Member States to contribute to the fund. This is an additional EUR 2 million, and we certainly hope that there will be pledges from Member States but maybe also from third countries. I want to thank the Member States that have already contributed, but also those that have contributed directly to UNICEF, UNHCR and the World Food Programme.

I agree with you on one thing, Minister: anyone who thinks that he can solve the problems with fences and barbed wire is mistaken, he is only obstructing one's own view. But you obviously cannot say today who wants to contribute to these two funds, when and how much. So that we do not misunderstand, we all worked together in a fast-track procedure a month ago to ensure that EUR 9.2 billion was allocated from the European budget in 2015 and 2016 through massive reallocation and a change of priorities. But if you listen to what the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Guterres, has said – 5 000 every other day until the end of February, more than half a million people – small signs are not enough if we want to help them stay in the camps near their home countries. And what is now being spent on the World Food Programme, including what has now become more of a budget for UNHCR in October, is very modest and cautious, but at least something is moving. But you're far from winter-proof – far from it! That is why I say here too: the question of the distribution mechanism should not have been used in Article 78(3), but should have been used to rely on Article 79(3), a common system for the temporary protection of displaced persons in the event of a mass influx. We did not dare to do that. Many Member States are partly responsible for this. That is why I would ask you now to make sure that this fund solution works.

When the European Commission presented the European Agenda on Migration, it included the necessary funds – almost EUR 10 billion, including those EUR 2 300 for trust funds for Syria and Africa – and I sincerely believe that a commendable effort is being made from the European Union, through the budget, to address this crisis. But the needs and commitments do not end there, because that is the part that corresponds to the European budget, but what about the part that corresponds to the Member States?  Both at the informal Council on 23 September and at the October European Council – and Minister Schmit recalled – Member States undertook to contribute, together with UNHCR, to the World Food Programme and other agencies, worth EUR 1 billion, as well as to equal european contributions to trust funds. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of some Member States, we still lack more than EUR 2 billion. But it is not going to be bad news, and the European Commission recently informed us that Member States will receive EUR 9.4 billion from the European budget for various adjustments, but also for extraordinary revenue from fines and tariffs.  We have already let the Council know: this Parliament does not call into question either the amount or legality of that reimbursement, but it would certainly seem to us a commendable political gesture if the 28 committed to using some of this extraordinary revenue from the European budget to finance their corresponding share of the trust funds.

This is not only necessary from a budgetary point of view, but is also a question of how money can be used efficiently. We have always believed that we must use our resources as close as possible to the hotspots, because we are much more effective there, because we can achieve more there for the same money: that is, we should ensure that people do not flee thousands of kilometres, but that we should be as close as possible, on the ground. Help. We are talking about the budget here, and that is the issue. What we always criticise, however, is that we usually only talk about the budget. We're just talking about money.

Madam President, Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I have listened attentively to you and I do not hide from you that I have remained somewhat hungry. It seems to me that you are a little underestimating the seriousness of the situation. The latest figures published by the Commission speak, for the next two years, of an additional 3 million refugees. If this is the situation we are facing, we must have the courage to say so! So I think you're a little below the truth. But I find you a little above the truth as to the results you expect from the actions you have just taken or are about to take.  Agree with the funds, but let's look at the Syrian fund, which is one billion, if the Member States contribute up to the 500 million they must add to the Commission's 500 million. One billion while there are 2.5 million refugees in neighbouring countries and 4 to 5 million displaced people in Syria itself.  A billion! In Europe to relocate 160,000 refugees, we will spend a billion. Make the comparison and tell me if objectively you do not expect this billion excessive results.  Overall, I tend to say that when you look at the instruments that are already operational, such as the European Development Fund or bilateral cooperation, one billion from the Syrian fund and 1.8 billion from the African fund is a drop in the bucket! I would like to think that it will change something, but only on the margins. What would be fundamental is for the European Union and the Member States to define a comprehensive strategy and pool all the instruments to try to see how we can achieve better results than we have achieved so far.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have learned this morning that the Syrian army has finally managed to break the siege it has been under for more than two years now around Kweires airport, a strategic military airport on the outskirts of Aleppo, a martyred city of this never-ending conflict. I want to salute this key victory in the fight against the Islamic State, and I hope that this is the beginning of the end for this Islamist terrorist organization. Since the outbreak of the Syrian conflict, the European chancelleries have singularly lacked pragmatism. All they did was throw oil on the fire by closing their embassies and then supporting rebel factions that had only the name. Last March, together with my colleague Marie-Christine Arnautu, I tabled a motion for a resolution calling for the resumption of diplomatic relations with Syria, prior to any resolution of this conflict. For once, I must acknowledge to the European Union a certain lucidity, because the head of the European Union's delegation to Syria has never broken off the dialogue with the Syrian authorities. In fact, Mr. Anis Nacrour continues to visit Damascus several times a month. With regard to the aid to be provided to the Syrian people, I regret that the Commission is relying on organisations such as Doctors Without Borders, which only intervene in rebel-held areas. Instead, we should help organizations that work throughout Syria and carry out their true humanitarian mission without taking sides. I am thinking of the Red Cross and the UN agencies which, overwhelmed by the scale of the tragedy, are now short of funding. I also invite you to support NGOs that have proven themselves, such as the Work of the East and SOS Christians of the East, whose young volunteers, as dynamic as they are effective, work as closely as possible to the people in Syria, of course, but also in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan.

Let us imagine for a moment a patient on the couch of a psychiatrist who says something like this: 'Mr Doctor, I am the head of government of a Member State of the European Union. When I am in Brussels and i am sitting with my colleagues in the European Council, I take decisions in which I call on myself, as head of government, to make payments, for example, to the EU trust funds in order to be able to combat effectively the causes of the refugee crisis. And when I am back in my office in my capital and head of government, I say to myself: oh, this is only a general declaration of intent and not legally binding at all. This invitation to myself, I ignore it.\" What would a psychiatrist do? Prescribe medication? Surely he would recommend therapy. Unfortunately, however, what this little anecdote describes is a European reality at the moment! European Council meetings rightly recommend setting up trust funds to tackle the root causes of the refugee crisis, and Member States do not respond at all, or with rather small amounts, but which are sufficient to secure the right to vote in the allocation of funds. And this in a situation in which the Member States are faced with a warm rain of money from the EU: the European Commission has just presented Amendment Budget 8 in 2015, which will relieve the Member States by as much as EUR 9 billion. So the money is there.

These programs have failed to anticipate and prevent the crisis we are experiencing today. So let's not stop asking ourselves why? I will emphasize three fundamental aspects: yes to intelligent financing, yes to anticipation and yes to result. First, the need for sufficient funding, but above all thoughtful and intelligent. Caution must be exercised. Let us make this fund a true multi-donor fund with the participation of our public and private donors and think together about how to give this fund a truly global scale. Second: anticipation. These funds must enable us to build the capacity of these countries, beyond the urgency, in order to better anticipate future crises. In this regard, what is the added value of these funds compared to the old development funds? How is the objectives consistent? Third: the results. If we are to increase the effectiveness of aid, perhaps it is time to say that one of the possibilities would be to limit our priorities to better target them. There is a need to strengthen the mutual obligations of donors and partner countries to achieve results by defining performance indicators and systematically referring to them. Finally, let's put into practice the principle of giving more to receive more.  Finally, the efforts of The Member States to participate in the fund must be strengthened and commitments must be kept, but we cannot ask our African partners in Valletta to do more if our actions do not reflect our words within the tools we create ourselves.

Madam President, I believe that no one doubts and disagrees that there must be support and solidarity on the refugee issue. No one in this Chamber, I believe, feels that we should not stand in solidarity and I believe that the European Union, the Member States, the European citizens themselves are the only ones who have stood in solidarity on the refugee issue. And the refugee issue I think is not just a matter for the European Union. It's an international issue. It is not only the European Union that can show sensitivity and solidarity and all the other countries that are indifferent. At the moment, the European Union cannot do its utmost to find resources to support the refugee crisis and not to create an International Refugee Support Fund.  It is an international issue that concerns both the United Nations and all countries. It is not possible that what the Arab countries are talking about is known for their huge investment funds and that they do not have a single euro or a petrodollar to support the crisis appeal as well. I therefore think that the European Union is wrong when many say that it has not done what it should have done. It could have been better. However, the only one that has taken action on the refugee issue is the European Union itself. I find it unacceptable, and I am not saying this either out of prejudice or for any other reason, that countries such as Turkey, instead of doing the obvious thing about refugees, as other Mediterranean and European countries are doing, are trying to take advantage of it.

Firstly, this is a global crisis and it requires a global response. We in the European Union are 20% of the world economy but 50% or more of development and humanitarian aid. We are doing our part, and it is important that everybody who has the means to contribute should do so. More wealth means more responsibility, and I share the comments that have been made that we need to call for mobilisation so we can help people and help people help themselves. My second general observation is that, in the same way that the financial and economic crisis has pointed out to us that we have work to do in terms of building the institutions and capabilities to deal collectively with this crisis, the refugee crisis is also exposing some of the deficiencies of the European Union in terms of collective action. I hope that we will see proposals ranging from border control, common defence and security, to rethinking Dublin but, most importantly, more coordinated and coherent medium- to long-term engagement with the countries that need our assistance to continue to build their own capacity to cope with their development challenges. It goes without saying that the best way to deal with the humanitarian crisis is not to have it in the first place. In other words, we have to invest more in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and disaster risk reduction – in things that help fewer people to be affected in the future by what, inevitably, climate change is going to cause – more disasters – and what, unfortunately, violent extremism is producing – more conflicts and more severe dramas. This goes without saying. I do not think that the European Union has been perfect, but yes, we are more engaged and we are contributing more than many others around us. I would like to make some specific comments. It has been pointed out, and rightly so, that we have to reach out to other key development partners, and we are doing so. I myself was in the United States last week to meet with the World Bank, the IMF and the US authorities. The US is our most important partner and the most aligned in terms of how we approach this kind of crisis, and we need to expand beyond an immediate urgent response to creating fiscal capacity for countries to have a buffer against crises, to get the development community more aligned in how we deal with fragility. I am very pleased to see the IMF building a much stronger capacity to address fragility in the world, and rightly so. There has been a very clear call that this money should not be a fragmented little island, and that is my fault, as I should have started by saying we are placing this 2.3 billion in the context of what is now 10 billion from the Commission to address the refugee crisis inside and also outside. The specificity of these trust funds is that they are a new way for us to better organise and deploy our resources in a more agile manner, but it does not diminish accountability, and we are of course going to have the reporting to, and engagement with, the European Parliament. I hope this will be more substantive, because it would be a well thought-out, longer-term programme. There was a question on whether this money is only revamping what already exists in our budget. The answer is that a big chunk of it is fresh money. We have taken a billion from the EDF reserve. This is money that is now added specifically to deal with this crisis. We have also found and relocated funds from lower-priority activities to what we believe is right now our top priority, and I think this is right to be done. We have been criticised, and unfortunately those who made this criticism were here to speak but not to listen – if you ask a question it is a good thing to actually wait for the answer. We have a very good track record in the European Union in development programmes, and in particular in humanitarian aid. The UK Government has ranked us – my former service that is, and I am very proud for the people there – as a top performer for a good reason, because we have eyes and ears on the ground and we are very connected to what the priorities are. We have been deploying our resources to aid people in Syria. The point was made that we only help the neighbourhood but not inside Syria. That is not correct. Half of our humanitarian aid goes inside Syria and about half of that goes to rebel-controlled areas. No, we are not going to disclose with whom we work there, because that would put people at risk – but we have a very strong presence there. We are one of the very few funders that have never given up on the most affected parts of Syria where bombs fall and people are living in tragic circumstances. The point was made a couple of times that we are wasteful and that our accounts have not been signed off for 20 years in a row. Wrong. Our accounts have been signed off for eight years in a row; the last signing came yesterday. We should not mix up errors, which are undesirable but are what they are, with waste or fraud, which they are not. Errors such as people incorrectly filing documents on how money is being used are errors, not fraud. I think we have to be clear that yes, we are facing an enormous challenge. This is hugely important for Europe’s own standing, and we will face this much more effectively working together. I hope we will see that these trust funds – which are, by the way, a new platform for action – will gain more traction and that we will see more contributions from our Member States and, I would also say, from others. There have been some encouraging signals, for example from the US, that they may now join us in the Syria Trust Fund; whether directly or through parallel financing remains to be seen. Finally, I want to thank Parliament very much for engaging in this topic, for its call for more joined-up action and for Member States to join us. I will finish with special thanks to Luxembourg, and to Minister Schmit.

Madam President, I do not have much to add to what the Vice-President has just said. I believe that we are in absolute urgency and that we must now effectively mobilize the resources we need. It is true that some Member States may not have reacted sufficiently yet and that not all commitments have yet been met. I will send a strong message from Parliament that the commitments are absolutely respected and kept.  It must also be said openly that there are no two absolutely separate entities: there is not the Union on one side with its budget and the Member States on the other. What we do, we do as the European Union. While some contributions come from the EU budget, and therefore from the Member States, and other resources come from the Member States, they must be put together. I believe what you are saying now about the trust fund, which must be opened as well.  I think you have put your finger on a crucial point, as have others among you: this issue concerns Europe first, because it takes place in its neighbourhood, and strikes us because people come to Europe. But in reality, this issue is not just about Europe, it is an international crisis. It is therefore quite clear that if we are to act, we must also engage the entire international community and in particular a number of States which have a strong interest in us's proper control of this crisis. The second point is of course the longest term. I think that is the whole issue of development. It is, perhaps, a matter of rethinking our development policies a little too because we cannot conclude that we are a success. Do we have to look at where the money is going? How effectively do we spend it? How can we engage the countries in question - to the extent that we can engage them because, as has been raised, we are sometimes in situations where there is no state, there is not a beginning of the rule of law, etc.? So there is also a major problem, because when we talk about Eritrea, for example, we know very well that there is a regime somewhere that scares people away, young people because ultimately they are forced to spend their lives in an army that they reject. So I think that is a difficult point to resolve and, of course, long-term action must be taken. I conclude from this extremely rich debate that we must give a clear message, that the only solution to control these problems is a solution of solidarity, there are no others. It is not by focusing on one or the other, by carrying out an action separate from the global action that we will achieve results.

Improving living standards in these countries may deter the wave of economic immigrants coming to Europe. This is what the European Commission hopes to achieve with new trust funds earmarked for Syria and Africa. The problem is that for decades the European Union has been supporting developing countries, but the result is an ever-increasing number of illegal immigrants. Rather, it means that by pouring even more money, the problems will not be solved, especially as far as Syria is concerned.

We are therefore possibly moving this issue to the Bureau of Parliament to conduct a study and see how many times the last debates in the House have had as their object issues relating to equality between men and women. For us, for those of us here, it is not something that lasts, it is an absolute priority of the European institutions. And I'm going on to ask the question about the Daphne programme to combat gender-based violence. I wanted to start by giving some statistical data. In March 2014, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights produced a report on gender-based violence with truly chilling data: 33% of European women, according to a survey conducted, had been victims of physical, sexual violence, labour violence of different types throughout their lives. 33% of women! It is estimated that nine million European women had been victims of violence. This data became an alarm and tell us the need to act on this matter.  I'm going to give you more data. In what we have been in Spain, in spain, in my country, 44 women have been killed victims of sexist violence. And I can tell the figures because a law we have in our country, a comprehensive law on gender-based violence, makes it possible for real data on the situation, which at European level does not happen. Today in Europe we do not have approved criteria to be able to know how magnitude we are talking about when referring to a reality that we know to be a social scourge and on which it is necessary, it is essential and urgent to act.  Today we talked about the Daphne program. The overall objective of the Daphne programme is to prevent and combat all forms of violence, whether they occur in the private or public spheres. It also aims to achieve a high level of health protection, well-being, cohesion, and is a programme open to NGOs, public institutions, associations. It was created in 1997 as an initiative to promote the action of non-governmental organizations and establish better cooperation.  The European Commission decided to include the Daphne programme as part of the general Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme for the period 2014-2020. At that time, when this decision was taken, this Parliament, civil organisations, women's organisations spoke out against it, because it was essential for us that there was a specific European programme to combat gender-based violence, because the visualization of this reality is essential in order to raise the consciences of those of us who have the obligation and responsibility to act in this area.  Finally it could not remain as a specific program and remained in the Rights, Equality and Citizenship program. This programme aims to prevent and combat all forms of violence against minors, young people and women, as well as violence against other risk groups.  The financial endowment for the implementation of this programme, in this period 2014-2020, amounts to EUR 439 million; 43% of the funds are for Group 2, which is the fight against violence against children, young people and women. And we want to debate here and we want to ask the European Commission how these objectives will be pursued in the context of the new Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme, and we also want clarification on the amount of specific funding for gender-based violence fighting and prevention.  Since we are unable to maintain a specific programme and it has become widespread in a comprehensive programme, we want to know what the European Commission's intentions are about what specific funding will be in this area, what programmes will be able to be financed in cooperation with the Member States, with social organisations, with civil society, because we are talking about an urgency , so it is necessary that, from the Member States and from the European Commission, we are working to end, as I say, the greatest social scourge that Europe has at the moment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 271, "date": "2015-11-11.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Thank you very much for the Member's comment and question.

The latest figures which were delivered by the Fundamental Rights Agency and from other surveys really show that there is a huge instance of violence against women – and the numbers are not decreasing. We are fully aware of the need for better collection of data to address this problem properly and also the need for effective campaigning against violence against women. Another of the means which we traditionally use is funding grassroots activities and supporting Member States’ activities. There is continuity: we have funded activities contributing to fighting violence against women under the Daphne Programme, and we continue to do so also within the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework, under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. It is our priority, and the objective must remain highly visible. This is why we have kept referring to ‘Daphne’ activities in the Annual Work programmes of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme for 2014 and 2015. We want to make clear that, although the name of the programme from which the relevant funding is made has changed, the objective of fighting violence against women remains high on the agenda. This is also the reason why relevant calls for proposals published on the DG Justice website always contain a specific reference to the Daphne objective, both in their title and in their text. A filtering mechanism has been set up which allows searching per programme and per priority. This means it is possible for interested NGOs to have an overview on one page of all upcoming, open and closed Daphne calls. A reference to Daphne is also included on the website presenting the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. We follow the same approach in all communication activities relating to funding opportunities under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. In particular, in order to raise awareness about the funding possibilities under the new programme, reference to Daphne is always made when the Commission holds information events. The Commission has so far organised eight such information events in cooperation with Member States. The Commission also participated in several meetings of stakeholders, where we were invited to present the funding opportunities under the new programmes. In their relations with Member States and in the relevant conferences, the Commission representatives will continue to refer to Daphne funding and to highlight its essential role in combating violence against women. Before going into the details of the specific amounts to be spent and the actions to be funded, I would like to stress that clarity and transparency – allowing Parliament and citizens to scrutinise the use made of public funding – are a must. In this respect, DG Justice publishes the award decision of each of its calls for proposals and the summaries of the projects selected for funding, including amounts and partners involved, on the website. In addition, a first monitoring report on the programme’s implementation for the budgetary year 2014 will be transmitted to Parliament and the Council at the beginning of 2016. It will contain information on the use of funds per specific objective, thus also including Daphne and gender equality. Now to the details. The whole amount reserved for the Daphne specific objective in the 2015 Annual Work Programme is EUR 14 million. The main part of it will be spent on concrete, tangible projects, awarded through five different calls for proposals. I insist that they must make a real difference to the lives of women and children in the EU. The first of these calls is already under evaluation. With an amount of EUR 3 million, it targets women and girls and addresses sexual harassment and sexual violence against women and girls. Two other calls, for a total amount of EUR 3.4 million, will specifically target children: one on the elimination of corporal punishment, to be launched in November, and one dedicated to support the already existing European hotlines for missing children under the phone number 116, which is currently open. In this case, the aim is to support the integration of hotlines into child protection systems rather than have them as stand-alone services, and to put in place structures and measures to ensure their sustainability after the end of the Union funding. The fourth call aims at supporting victims. Also to be published in November, it will tap funds from both the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme under the Daphne objective, and from the Justice Programme. EUR 3 million will stem from the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, plus EUR 2 million from the Justice Programme, amounting to EUR 5 million in total. This call will address, in a comprehensive way, victims of violence and crime and will contribute to the implementation of the Victims’ Directive. The deadline for Member States to transpose the Directive is 16 November this year – in a few days. The funding will help women and children who are victims of violence to benefit from the rights deriving from the Directive, such as the right to specialised support services. A fifth call for a total amount of EUR 3 million will encourage multi-agency and multi-disciplinary cooperation to respond to violence against women and/or children, and encourage victims and witnesses to report incidents of violence. In addition, about EUR 1.1 million of the 2015 budget will be spent on supporting European organisations and networks that work to combat violence against women and children. About EUR 370 000 will be spent on procurement activities, for example for carrying out a necessary study on migrants’ attitudes towards female genital mutilation. The same general approach applies to the specific objective of the promotion of equality between women and men. I want policies with a tangible impact and a focus on implementing existing legislation. The whole amount reserved for this specific objective in the 2015 Annual Work Programme is around EUR 7 million. Under the 2015 Annual Work Programme, a call for an amount of EUR 3.4 million will be launched in the coming months to finance projects presenting innovative answers to educational and occupational labour-market segregation. The aim is to promote good practices on gender roles and to overcome gender stereotypes in education and training and in the workplace. Finally, for 2016, nearly EUR 1 million has been reserved to support the work of the European Women’s Lobby as well as around EUR 1 million funding for gender equality-related research. Let me also add from my side the comment that for me also the timing for the discussions on gender topics is rather problematic because they are held every time very late at night.

That is why, and on behalf of those of us who devote all our efforts to combating violence, I ask the Commission to inform us of the funds to be devoted to this fight.  The numbers are alarming: sexist violence does not mean countries, so this battle must all be united. Women are harassed, raped, killed, both in northern and southern Europe.  Spain is a benchmark in the fight against gender-based violence and, despite all our efforts, we do not always manage to save these innocent women who are so often murdered in front of their children. Recently, in my country, the figure of the child has also been introduced as a victim, and adolescent awareness campaigns have been increased.  I feel a deep helplessness in the face of these deaths because one, one victim is too much for me. That is why I carried out the European Order for the Protection of Victims to stop aggressors in any country in Europe. We need greater protection and education measures.

That is why, of all the things I have done today, the outcome of this debate goes straight to my heart. Since its launch in 1997, the Daphne Programme has helped fund some powerful causes.

Mr Jánoš, who is accused of torturing his wife, is being prosecuted at large. And although more than half a year has passed since the charges were filed, the case has gone nowhere. Similarly, almost nothing has changed in the area of protection and assistance to abused women who do not attract media attention. Although government leaders had strong talk of taking effective action after the case was made public, it remained on promises and cosmetic adjustments. Free legal aid for women is still inaccessible, victims of violence do not stop complaining about insensitive and unprofessional practices by the police, prosecution and courts, there is no state funding system for crisis centres for abused women. As a result, victims of violence have no confidence in institutions, have nowhere to go from the rapist, suffer in silence. And why am I talking about all this? I am talking about this because it is the non-profit organisations supported by the European Daphne programme that are often the only straw they can catch for abused women. It is these organisations that provide psychological assistance to women, accompany them to the doctor, to the police, to help them find safe housing. These are these organisations which, to the limits of their capabilities, will, at least from time to time, train part of the experts. Daphne is an extremely important program.

But it seems to me that one of the key issues on which we must influence is that many of these funds – on which Mrs Jourová has already explained to us in great detail how they will be implemented, how they will be allocated in parts – must be used to raise awareness among young people: the growth of violence against adolescents must be a priority because it is increasing and really alarming.

Of course, it is necessary to lead this fight not only against domestic violence, but also against excisions, a barbaric rite imported alas!, in Europe for a few decades. However, we must be vigilant. A 2014 report reveals that the Commission has financed transnational projects to the tune of EUR 9 million. That is a lot of money, and it is not certain that it has always been used to protect women and children. The Bastos report of 5 January 2012 stresses the need to improve the transparency of programmes and the effectiveness of grants. In other words, a lot of money was distributed lightly, and NGOs spent it on operating costs. A Belgian NGO, for example, has received almost 400,000 euros for - I quote - \"to get an overview of how to deal with the phenomenon of missing children\". This did not allow a single family to find their child. It's expensive paid for a simple overview. The Daphne programme also has the disadvantage of trying to combat stereotypes.

I will now try to summarise several key issues and also to respond to some concrete questions. As I said before, this must be a smart combination of enforcement of existing legislation. Some of you mentioned the application of the European Legal Order, which is a typical case. Also, the Victims Directive, which will be in force in all Member States on 16 November. Speaking of enforcement, I have in mind especially enforcement at the level of the activity of police and procurement, because we are speaking here about criminal activity, which must be punished but also published, and which must be responded to from the side of society. We see increased violence against women, but also other forms of intolerance in Europe, which is now a very nervous and unstable society. So we are seeing these increasing numbers in the Member States where there is higher intolerance from the side of wider society. It leads to the need for better use of funding for efficient campaigns, better training of people working in the field and very-well—targeted support of grassroots organisations and NGOs which do our work in the Member States on the ground and who also work with the victims. One of the big problems is that we are still missing data which is caused also by the fact that victims do not report because they still feel ashamed, as though they are the ones who have done wrong. This is also something which we have to change. As for the funding, I fully understand all Members who speak about the need to better evaluate efficiency and value for money. We are now evaluating previous projects and, as I said, we will submit the report at the beginning of 2016. I can only promise Members that I will be very strict and will look at projects which have already been funded from the point of view of tangible results and whether these have been achieved or not, because I am afraid that, in general, in funding we use again and again standard kinds of projects which in many cases have proved not to be efficient. We should go for more innovative ways and projects which are better targeted towards tangible results. We do not have enough money for combating violence against women, but that is a never-ending story, and we will always be missing money for important priorities because we have too many priorities to finance at the same time. Also, when speaking about legislation, we are not preparing any legislation for the whole of Europe. Next year we are planning, as the European Union, to accede to the Istanbul Convention, which I will also confirm here in plenary on 25 November, when we have this topic again in plenary. We plan to do it and we see this as a big step forward in the legislative field of combating violence. I was asked by Ms Noichl about the strategy. Yes, we are now finalising the document, which we are calling the Strategic Engagement of the European Union for the Years 2016 to 2019. This strategy will be submitted to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) in December, and there, Members will see that the priority of combating violence against women is very highly prioritised. You are right, and only when we work on the wider strategy do we see the wider context of this phenomenon. We see, for instance, very clearly that there is a very close correlation between the economic vulnerability of women and violence. There are some other clear links which we have to look at when planning the proper actions in gender policy. So this strategy is now being finalised and, again, combating violence is one of four main priorities. In answer to Mr Polčák’s questions: yes, we of course cooperate with the relevant bodies, and not only with NGOs but with governmental bodies – with the relevant ministries – and we try to plan together with them the funding so that it is in good synergy. On the second question, there is no Member State package. There are no envelopes correlating with the appearance of the phenomenon of violence against women. I must say that this is based on the principle that we are trying to campaign and to inform more strongly in the Member States where this problem is more serious and where the tolerance of violence is higher, but then it is up to Member States and up to the relevant organisations to come for the money, so this is how it stands. I would like to thank Parliament again for talking about violence.

Daphne is designed to prevent all forms of violence against children, young people and women, as well as to prevent and protect victims of violence against other groups of violence, in particular those at risk of domestic violence. Various forms of violence are being experienced throughout the European Union, and its consequences for the physical and psychological health of the victims, as well as for society as a whole, are extremely severe. Addressing this problem and protecting victims requires strong political will and concerted action based on daphne methods and results. Action to combat violence against women contributes to promoting equality between women and men. Daphne has been a very successful programme since its inception in 1997, popular with stakeholders (government and academic institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the projects funded are effective, so it is important to continue to link the Daphne name to the specific objective of preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women, so that daphne remains as visible as possible.

It is a fact that the Daphne programmes play a key role in combating violence against women in the EU. The available data require us not to lower our attention. 35% of all women are victims of domestic and/or sexual violence by their partner or strangers. The consequences are very serious and the numbers vary according to the country and the culture to which they belong. In Italy, almost 7 million women between the age of 16 and 70 would be victims of physical and sexual abuse, or 31.9%. The regions of the Mezzogiorno almost always have values lower than the national figure, although we must consider the different factors that contribute to the willingness of women to respond and to their awareness of the crime suffered. It is therefore likely that the underestimation of the phenomenon is particularly important for the southern regions.

Second, the nature of the border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland would fundamentally change.

In view of the right of our citizens to travel freely within the Union and to reside in any Member State, public administration services must also maintain their effectiveness and meet the needs of European citizens. In this respect, a number of programmes on interoperability solutions for European public administration have been launched, and the report we voted on today focuses on ISA2, a welcome continuation of the IDA, IDABC and ISA programmes. Today, eGovernment is public administration, but the digital gaps we are seeing still make it difficult to exploit the full potential of making public services more efficient.

Over the years, since 1976, attempts have been made ten times to improve European electoral law, but the Council has always vetoed it.

This report is neither, as Jo Leinen mantra-like, a mantra-like gain for the attractiveness and transparency of the European elections, nor is it a decided thing, as a Herbert Reul claims on the evening of the vote against better knowledge. The SPD, CDU and CSU have abused the efforts pushed for years – especially by their liberal ex-colleague Andrew Duff – to reform the EU's electoral law sensibly. They are simply trying to overturn the judgments of the German Federal Constitutional Court on the blocking clause on the European back door. They are right to do so – and the right to vote is a ribbon that is as cheap as it is suitably red. This behaviour is national party politics of the most evil kind. The result is a proposal on EU electoral reform as a meaningless smorgasbord with a democratic guarantee of chaos.

Although the possibility of creating a single electoral procedure based on direct universal suffrage was already taken into account in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, elections to the European Parliament are still largely based on national principles. Campaigns in their home political arenas do not represent the real visions and interests represented by the European Parliament. I agree with the rapporteurs that the inclusion of the names and logos of European political parties on ballot papers and election posters will affect their recognition. Nevertheless, it is important to increase the democratic dimension of the European elections and the turnout, which in Poland did not exceed 24% in 2014. In this context, they are pleased with the proposals to implement the right to vote in European elections for all Citizens of the Union living outside the Union, as well as the possibility of electronic voting, online and by post. In addition, the introduction of a common deadline of twelve weeks before election day for the drawing up of lists at national level and for the designation of the main candidates by European political parties will streamline and harmonise procedures.

The EU's electoral reform initiative is an attempt to intervene deeply in the electoral law of the Member States.

Given the peculiarities of the Electoral Systems of the Member States and because small countries are excluded from the reforms, we have to note that a significant part of this initiative has been tailored to Germany. The European electoral system penalises the people of the large countries because their votes are worth less.

Given the peculiarities of the Electoral Systems of the Member States and because small countries are excluded from the reforms, we have to note that a significant part of this initiative has been tailored to Germany. The European electoral system penalises the people of the large countries because their votes are worth less. A 3% quota for Germany can potentially exclude millions of people from political participation in the European Parliament, while the population of smaller states is represented at far lower numbers. That is why this quota system is not acceptable. Nor is the enforced quota system for men and women acceptable. Even if the zipper procedure has failed, a quota is to be introduced.

Given the peculiarities of the Electoral Systems of the Member States and because small countries are excluded from the reforms, we have to note that a significant part of this initiative has been tailored to Germany. The European electoral system penalises the people of the large countries because their votes are worth less. A 3% quota for Germany can potentially exclude millions of people from political participation in the European Parliament, while the population of smaller states is represented at far lower numbers. That is why this quota system is not acceptable. Nor is the enforced quota system for men and women acceptable. Even if the zipper procedure has failed, a quota is to be introduced.

In many respects, the motion interfered with detailed electoral acts which are part of the decision-making powers of the Member States. The proposal dealt with in relative detail, among other things, the methods by which the parties in the Member States should choose the candidates for the European elections and how the European party should appear during the elections. The presentation of the elections and procedures were strongly addressed in the proposal.  The motion also proposed a common constituency throughout the EU, which would lead to some MEPs being elected outside national quotas. Solutions were also proposed for postal and remote voting that are difficult to fit into Finnish practices. The common threshold for voting was also a motion that I could not accept.    Overall, the performance was poor. It sought to develop the Union in a supranational direction and to weaken the decision-making powers of the Member States.
