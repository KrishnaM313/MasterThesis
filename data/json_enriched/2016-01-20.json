At the request of the Conference of Presidents, I have asked the Committee on Home Affairs and Civil Liberties to look into the matter. The coordinators of the committee decided by a majority not to discuss the matter directly, but only at one of the next meetings.  Mr Lamberts then contacted me with his group's request that, by a majority of Parliament – spontaneously – even without consideration in the LIBE Committee, the matter should now, for today or tomorrow, put the matter on the agenda of the plenary session, which we could do. I then consulted all the political groups in the House to see if there was a majority in favour of this.

We have in the past devoted considerable and justified time to the situation in Hungary. We have a situation that is developing in Denmark which I think requires us to debate it.  We have offered the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs the opportunity to discuss this before a possible plenary debate.

It is a fine tradition that each new Presidency outlines its plans before this Parliament. And it is also entirely logical, because the European Parliament is where all the lines of the EU converge, so we will be working together closely over the next few months. The Dutch Presidency looks forward to this opportunity, I can assure you. Together with you, we will work hard to achieve as much as possible for the people of Europe. How we see the EU depends in part on when and where we were born. I was born in 1967 and, living in The Hague, my family’s conversation at the dinner table often revolved around politics and society, including the latest developments in European cooperation. Like the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979 – a discussion I can still remember. I was only 12, so I could not vote yet, but I did feel somehow it was a big deal. After all, for my parents’ generation, European cooperation was linked directly to history. For that generation, above all, it meant ‘nie wieder Krieg’ – no more war. For younger generations, Europe does not carry the same emotional charge – if at all. The reality is that many people are slowly but surely growing sceptical about the EU. The way they see it, the EU interferes in their lives for no good reason, while achieving few results. Its benefits seem far removed from everyday life. At the same time – rightly or wrongly – the irritation people feel about rules made in ‘Brussels’ is never far away, and I believe there is only one way to counteract this: we need to achieve concrete results and make sure they are visible, and we need to stick to areas where the EU can achieve more than Member States can by themselves. In short, Europe must be relevant to people’s daily lives. Over the next few months, the Netherlands wants to help to make that happen. It is clear that the Netherlands is taking over the Presidency of the EU in difficult times. We are seeing a massive influx of refugees, fleeing a bloody conflict that is happening all too close by. The situation on our eastern border is also complex and fragile, and the EU’s relations with Russia are troubled. The barbaric attacks in Paris have shown once again that we cannot take our free and democratic way of life for granted. And all this is going on while Europe is recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Second World War. Far too many people are still unemployed. None of these problems can be solved by a single country acting alone: the countries of Europe share a big responsibility. Against this backdrop, the Netherlands has been preparing intensively for the Council Presidency. Two months ago, for example, I welcomed a delegation from this Parliament at the Hall of Knights in The Hague’s Binnenhof, at the heart of our parliamentary democracy. It was a successful, productive visit, and we addressed a number of pressing issues, but there was also a historical symbolism to the occasion, because the Hall of Knights played a special role in the early history of European cooperation. In 1948 it was the venue of the Congress of Europe, which would go down in history as the dawn of the European Community. The Congress was attended by 750 delegates from 26 European countries: politicians and academics, artists and journalists, philosophers and business leaders. They included great Europeans whom we remember to this day, from Konrad Adenauer and Jean Monnet to Altiero Spinelli and Paul-Henri Spaak. The event’s honorary chairman was Winston Churchill, who spoke passionately about the importance of cooperation based on common values, common economic interests and common security needs: three pillars that have lost none of their relevance today. The Congress in The Hague laid the foundations for the Council of Europe, the European Coal and Steel Community and the Treaty of Rome. It even discussed – only three years after the end of the Second World War – the idea of a monetary union, a single market without borders and a representative assembly. It was a conference full of lofty ideals and grand institutional visions, and in the decades that followed, those ideals and those visions would slowly but surely take concrete form. One of the Dutch delegates was Foreign Minister Dirk Stikker. Fifty years ago, when he published his memoirs, Stikker looked back at the early days of European cooperation, which he called ‘an age-old dream’. He wrote, ‘It has been attempted by conquerors, pondered by philosophers, sought by scholars, and sabotaged as well as extolled by politicians – often at the same time. It is not a simple thing, to be accomplished with a bit of good will and the stroke of a pen.’ This is the tradition in which we stand today. ‘Europe’ is a large, complex, shared project that can only move forward one step at a time. I do not believe that anyone in those early years could have imagined quite how complex the project would be at times – both technically and politically. But the founders might also have been pleasantly surprised at many of the things the Member States have jointly achieved over the years: our free and open democratic systems; the unprecedented prosperity and welfare enjoyed by Europeans today; the power of our single market. We can be proud of these achievements, but we must be vigilant, because they need to be maintained. This is the tradition in which we will fulfil our duties as Presidency holder. The tradition of cooperation that transcends what countries can achieve alone. The tradition of working step by step, Schritt für Schritt, towards a goal. We must be committed and determined, but also pragmatic and realistic. That is the approach we want. I promise you that we will put our long Dutch experience of coalition-building and consultation to full use. There is plenty for us to build upon. Take the political priorities of the European Commission under the leadership of Jean-Claude Juncker, or the strategic agenda of the European Council. And let us not forget the calculation made by this Parliament that we are missing out on EUR 1.25 trillion a year by not making full use of the single market, for example in the digital domain. In short, Europe does not need new lofty ideals or grand visions. It needs results. It needs to deliver. And for that, we first need to follow up on what we have agreed. Keeping promises and sticking to agreements should be the new normal for Europe. A deal is a deal. That’s a key principle for the Dutch Presidency. Of course, I say that partly in the light of the most urgent issue we face at the moment: the continual flow of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries. It is crucial that the agreements we made with Turkey last year are carried out fast, to relieve the pressure on our external borders. It is crucial to offer refugees a humanitarian alternative to risking their lives at sea in flimsy boats. We need safe reception in the region. It is also crucial that we get Europe’s borders under control, especially in Greece. And that the ‘hotspots’ we have agreed on are put in place. We must also get the registration of refugees sorted out as soon as possible so that every Member State can play its part.  We are all in this together. It is precisely at difficult times like this that we need that shared sense of responsibility. Let me be clear: the current numbers are not sustainable. We are running out of time. We need a sharp reduction in the number of refugees in the coming six to eight weeks. So it is both logical and necessary that we devote a lot of time and energy to the refugee crisis in the month ahead. That is a priority, and the Netherlands Presidency will give it as much focus as possible. At the same time, I would like to commend the European Parliament on its study of ‘The Cost of Non-Europe’, which I mentioned a moment ago. Because however pressing many issues are, we cannot lose sight of our long-term goals in areas like innovation, economic growth and job creation. We are putting the economic crisis behind us, and the European economy is finally picking up again. But one in ten adult Europeans is still out of work, and that is simply too many. And for young people it is very hard to get a foot in the labour market door. So it is good to see the European Parliament mapping ways of getting more people in work. A key goal of the Dutch Presidency is to move forward with all existing initiatives, plans and projects aimed at innovative growth and more jobs, and of course enhancing the stability of the eurozone will remain a focus of those efforts. But above all, we must seize the existing opportunities in our internal market. The figure I mentioned before – EUR 1.25 trillion – is double the size of the Dutch economy. It would mean millions of jobs for millions of people. We cannot ignore that opportunity. How could we explain that to future generations? I believe that the Commission, the Council and you – the Members of the European Parliament – broadly agree on what we want to achieve here. The Dutch Presidency will do all it can to foster a good working dynamic, and to ensure that the institutions can work together as effectively as possible for the sake of all those in Europe who are desperately trying to find work: above all, our young people. The debate on the future of our European institutions is going on – in one way or other – in almost every Member State. I believe there is growing consensus that the EU needs to focus on areas where cooperation is either essential, such as the migration issue, or clearly adds value, such as the single market. ‘Focus’ includes cutting back on the excessive regulations that restrict people and companies. Our Presidency fully endorses the Commission’s priorities and work programme, which are founded on these principles. It is also good that we are debating the Union’s future so openly, and I say that, of course, with particular reference to the position of the United Kingdom. The UK is a very important partner. Leaving the EU would be bad for the UK and bad for the EU, but we should never reduce that debate to the question of ‘more or less Europe?’ The question is how to build a better Europe: a Europe that makes the best choices and achieves the most benefits for its people.  Certainly, in some areas, the EU needs to step back and the Commission is now addressing this to good effect, but there are also areas in which we are not yet making the most of EU cooperation. The perfect example is of course the single market, which is not only an engine of economic growth and innovation, but also the cement that binds us together and makes us strong. That is why we need to keep a deeper and fairer single market high on the agenda. When it comes to deepening the market, I am thinking mainly of services and the digital market: two sectors that are almost completely untapped, even though most Europeans earn their living in one or the other. We need to facilitate online shopping in other Member States, attune legislation to the digital age, and tackle unfair geo-blocking. In the market for services, the Dutch Presidency will also be pressing for States to reduce the number of regulated professions. But I am also thinking of the challenges and opportunities in the area of energy and climate change. At last month’s successful summit in Paris the EU presented a strong, united front. In the follow-up process, it is now vital that we make full use of the single market’s innovative potential. That is something the Dutch Presidency wants to take forward. We also need to make sure that all workers receive equal pay for equal work in equal circumstances. Yes, it is a question of fairness, but not of fairness alone, because a fairer single market will help maintain support for free movement, and will help guarantee that the market functions properly. So this issue will also get a big push during our Presidency. Dirk Stikker was right: European cooperation is not a simple thing, accomplished with a bit of goodwill and the stroke of a pen. In many cases, the EU does not have ready-made solutions for the problems we face. Every country has its own interests and considerations, and negotiations can be tough. It is a bit like a football match: it is not the style of play that matters, but the final result. And as we all know, Europe scores most of its goals in injury time.  Europe has shown that it can tackle some major crises. The financial and economic crisis prompted us to step up oversight of our banks and to place our currency on a more solid footing. We have taken a common line on Russia’s actions in Ukraine, and we have closed a deal with Turkey on the refugee crisis. Step by step we are moving forward. That is in keeping with the European tradition, and it is in that conviction that the Netherlands is looking ahead to its Presidency. Our first and most important ambition in the months to come is to be a good and effective Presidency: one that makes sure that all 28 Member States can play their part. One that serves the process effectively, and takes account of everyone’s interests. But also a Presidency with the ambition to achieve concrete results. We can only do that by working closely with the European institutions, and above all, the European Parliament. The Netherlands looks forward to working with all of you. Indeed, it is only by working together that we can solve the problems facing the Union. Let us do so with the same resolve shown by Sir Winston Churchill when he addressed the Hall of Knights in The Hague in 1948: ‘We cannot rest upon benevolent platitudes and generalities,’ he said. ‘Our powers may be limited, but we know, and we must affirm, what we mean and what we want.’ In other words, there is a job to be done, so let’s get to work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Mr President of the Commission. Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. When Mark Rutte first presented the Dutch Presidency's programme to me two three months ago, I thought to myself: the Dutch have a capable Prime Minister, because the man can read thoughts. Because he said exactly what the Commission thought he should be presenting. I note that there is a great deal of agreement between the Dutch Presidency's intentions and the intentions of the European Commission, as presented in our own work programme in recent years and months. Prime Minister, you are taking over the Presidency of the European Union at a time when the European economy is visibly recovering and is getting its face back. The European economy will grow by 2% this year – 2% is not enough. Unemployment is down to 9.2% – this unemployment rate is too high.  But both the European Union and the euro area are no longer among the last in the class. Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant and we must strengthen the growth forces that exist in the European economy, give them muscles, give them legs. That is why we have launched the European Investment Plan. To date, EUR 50 billion of effective investments have been found in our balance sheet. 47 major infrastructure projects have been launched, more than 81 000 small and medium-sized enterprises are benefiting from this European investment plan, and we are only just beginning, because there is still a long way to go before we reach the 315 billion capital expenditures that we have written in the logbook. Investment only takes place when the regulatory density decreases: better regulation. This is also one of the main highlights of the Dutch Presidency. The Commission is in the process of putting into practice this catalogue of intentions, which we had given ourselves at the beginning of our mandate.  Led by Frans Timmermans, the first Vice-President, the Commission has ensured that the regulatory landscape has been scoured. We withdrew more than 100 initiatives from the previous Commission and we actually only envisaged 23 new initiatives per year. So there is a significant reduction, a reduction in the density of regulation. The European economy, like the people, needs less regulation so that more happens in life.  The Dutch Presidency is well advised to tackle some of the main points of the European Commission's action programme very deliberately. This is true of the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union, the Capital Markets Union. All three points are within the framework of the completion of the European Economic and Monetary Union, because the European Economic and Monetary Union is also an economic union. The European economy needs these modernisation surges exceptionally urgently. It would also be advisable for the Dutch Presidency to enthusiastically rush to complete the European Economic and Monetary Union and, above all, the Banking Union. A good example of showing that we are serious now would be to approach the issue of common European deposit insurance with a courageous step. I can only support the Presidency in its intention, if it has it, and i would like to share my good wishes. Videmment, la crise des réfugiés laquelle le Premier ministre a fait référence occupe nos esprits. Je ne voudrais pas répéter, devant vous, ce que j'ai dit hier deux reprises en pléni re, mais il est évident – tout comme le Premier ministre l'a dit – que nous devons redoubler d'efforts pour faire en sorte que les décisions que nous avons prises au niveau du Conseil des ministres et du Conseil européen  Il en va de méme pour l'application du plan d'action conjoint que nous avons négocié avec la Turquie. Il est urgent que toutes les dispositions de ce plan d'action soient mises en éuvre concr tement dans les semaines venir. Cela m'améne reconsidérer devant vous tous les probl mes gravitant autour de l'espace Schengen. Je veux répéter ici, comme je l'ai fait hier et avant-hier, que Schengen est menacé parce que nous avons un comportement qui se caractérise par sa légéreté. Nous fermons l'une apr s l'autre les fronti éres en Europe. Lorsque nous les aurons toutes fermées, nous constaterons que le co t économique du non-Schengen est considérable.  Rappelez-vous qu'il y a 1,7 million de travailleurs transfrontaliers en Europe. Souvenez-vous du fait qu'il y a 57 million de mouvements de transports routiers transfrontaliers. Rappelez-vous que le co't est énorme. Rien que sur le pont entre le Danemark et la Suéde, la réintroduction des contr les aux fronti res comporte un co t de 300 million d'euros. Les pénalités, sous forme de délais d'attente aux fronti res pour le transport routier, se chiffrent trois milliards. Le non-Schengen a donc un co't. Si les fronti res sont fermées, si le marché intérieur commence souffrir des conséquences non ma trisées, parce que non ma trisables, de la réintroduction des fronti res, il est évident que viendra le jour o nous nous demanderons s'il nous faut vraiment une monnaie unique si nous n'avons plus de marché intérieur et si nous n'avons plus de libre circulation desvailleurs. Tout se tient et tous les éléments doivent faire l'objet d'une analyse détaillée.  Si nous voulons sauvegarder Schengen, il faut de toute urgence nous doter d'un syst me de contr le des fronti res extérieures et c'ti res. La Commission a fait une proposition et je voudrais que le Conseil et le Parlement se pressent et accél rent le rythme de l'examen de ce texte. Je sais que le gouvernement néerlandais en fait une priorité en demandant aux ministres des affaires intérieures et de la justice de se réunir au moins une fois par mois pour pouvoir accélérer ces travaux. La Commission vous présentera, au cours des semaines venir, un texte sur la migration légale, parce que nous pensons que des fronti res intérieures s'res, des fronti res extérieures sécurisées et la migration légale sont trois choses qui vont ensemble.  Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, apr s avoir pris la parole hier deux fois sur le méme sujet, et par peur de me répéter, je terminerai ici mon introduction ce débat.

Europe must deliver! I would like to begin by signalling to you, as the new President-in-Office of the Council, the full support of the European People's Party. We want to deliver together with the new Presidency. However, I have to go straight to the house, because, unfortunately, from god's point of view, there is a major problem on the Council side, namely the question of credibility. You pointed out in your introductory remarks, in your outlook on the presidency, that a deal is a deal. Now, however, we are faced with the question of the fact that it has been agreed in the Council to offer Turkey EUR 3 billion in order to create conditions on the ground, that people do not have to flee, and the money does not come together. Brussels is delivering, the Commission and we in the European Parliament are providing the money in a fast-track procedure, and the Council is not delivering. That is why, Prime Minister, the most important task is to restore credibility, to implement in the Council the issues that have been decided upon. (Applause) The priorities are right. Jean-Claude Juncker has said that. The issues of the eurozone that you are taking up, the internal reform process that Europe needs in order to create competitiveness in order to remain strong in a globalised world, are on the table. I am grateful to you for continuing to do so. I believe that the facets of the internal market are extremely important, that we strengthen it. I would ask you to talk not only about the new legislative issues, such as the internal energy market, digital, but also in the Councils about implementation, about the implementation, that what is decided in Europe is also carried out at national level. That, too, is on the table. And then there are two major issues that concern us: one big issue, of course, is migration. Yesterday, Donald Tusk said here in the European Parliament that we have two months to go – you are also talking about a similar scale – to get the issues under control. In this respect, your Presidency faces a huge challenge and also a great responsibility to defend the Schengen area, to uphold the Schengen idea and to implement it. I would also like to assure you, on the part of my group, that we are also open to a fast track procedure on the legislative issues that Jean-Claude Juncker and the Commission have put on the table – I am addressing only two: safe third countries and the Frontex issue. We want to achieve results quickly. These issues must be concluded during the Dutch Presidency. This includes security issues. We have done PNR and data protection. But there are other issues. Yesterday, the Commission presented a proposal to exchange data in the area of criminal records, which aims to improve networking in the exchange of data between judicial authorities in the case of criminal offences in Europe. Here, too, we assure you that you will be able to work quickly. The last major topic is the economy, economic development. We are hopeful going into 2016, as Jean-Claude Juncker rightly said. But we have to stick to it. For us, this is about trade policy. We will be talking about CETA in the next few weeks, about trade relations with Canada. We will continue to have TTIP on the table. In the negotiations, my group fully supports the Commissioner responsible. We want these agreements. We stand by the fact that trade policy creates jobs and thus also creates the future. I also hope that you can convince your citizens in the Netherlands that the agreement with Ukraine is a trade agreement. It is not a question of Ukraine's accession to the European Union, it is about trade policy. I hope that we will be able to convince the citizens of the Netherlands of this. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which All of this, taken together, is already big enough. But the big question, of course, is how we convince people of our project. And a new presidency is an opportunity for that. I would therefore like to thank you for the introduction you have chosen today and the message you have brought with you. The first message to convince people of the European project is that we must give answers, we must deliver on the substance and try to clarify people's everyday issues with our contributions at European level. This pragmatic approach is important first of all. And the second thing you have said today, and for which I thank you, is your introduction to the speech, namely to reflect how Europe was talked about decades ago, even with a story, with a narrative about Europe, not just facts, facts, facts, but emotion. And perhaps we need to talk more about it, about the emotions that resonate with Europe. When you spoke about the criticism of Europe that we all share, in terms of bureaucracy and so on, our populists were loud. They applauded, they were happy because they felt confirmed. But they then became quieter and quieter in the course of your speech, because then you talked about the big issues of our time, about Russia, about securing peace, about how we create the economy, how we create jobs for the citizens. Then the populists become quiet, because they then know that their approach does not work, that they have no answers for the future of our continent. And that is why let us tell this story, this story, that it is better for Europe to work together.

Our group, the Group of The Party of European Socialists, wants to help you. It wants to help it on the road to recovery and to support economic recovery, as Mr Juncker said, it is not enough to strengthen the internal market, we need a change of pace in economic and social policy and we expect the Member States to commit themselves to strengthening the investment plan. We must also immediately lay down the conditions for the Union's fiscal capacity.  The Member States must be put in a position to invest. That is why we always insist on the concept of flexibility. It is not a musical refrain, it is a real opportunity to invest, to create an economy, to create new jobs. Flexibility which, as Juncker said, must also apply to refugees. We will then have to move forward with the banking union and approve the European deposit guarantee. On taxation, we expect a breakthrough to support the Commission's efforts.  We cannot be obsessed with the dogma of regulating public budgets and then allow multinational companies to take hundreds of billions of euros out of the public purse. Taxes must be paid where profits are made, and that is why we are asking the Dutch Presidency to support the proposals contained in the Ferreira-Theurer report. First of all, we want rapid approval of public country-by-country reporting and social Europe and environmental sustainability. Here, too, we need a shot, social dumping is a disaster. Our group wants your Presidency to be remembered for its decisive contribution to the adoption of a good Labour Mobility Package. We look forward in the coming weeks to the presentation by the Commission of this package and, above all, to the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive. For us – and we remind Mr Juncker that he is sensitive – this is a red line and is part of the pact on the basis of which we voted for the European Commission. On the refugee crisis, solutions are on the table and the European Commission has put them on the table, I must not remind you of them, as Mr Juncker mentioned just now. The stalemate created by some Member States must be overcome, and I want to say this to you, I want to say this to Tusk, it is hours, not days, not weeks, that must be spent convincing the states that have been rebellious and reluctant, because then spring comes and the situation will become even more difficult. Even on Schengen, the signals coming from some Member States are not at all encouraging. I hear talk of mini-Schengen. I see Member States reintroducing border controls. These are bad choices, ineffective choices and even harmful, as Juncker said, to the European economy.  I will conclude by concluding that Europe must not close in on itself.

We have seen the EU change much in our lifetime, and in your speech, Prime Minster, you laid out the road along which the EU has travelled over time. But now we are at a fork in that road, and by the end of your Presidency we will determine which fork to take. Will we take the road that sees our migration crisis continue, fudges decisions over the eurozone and sees a country, my country, possibly vote to leave? Or will we take the EU along the road to recovery, to a reformed EU that allows our citizens to harness the spirit of enterprise, to create jobs and growth? And at that fork in the road stands a traffic cop for the next six months, and that will be you, Prime Minister. And it is great to see that there are still some real market liberals left in the ALDE group rather than the pseudo-socialists that we see lined up in this Parliament. But your Dutch Presidency is right to focus on the key to recovery, the economy. Because if the European Union does not have innovative and growing economies, we cannot offer opportunities to young people who want a job, we cannot provide the resources needed to tackle the situation in Syria and the refugee crisis, we cannot tackle any of the other challenges we face. So your priority of cutting red tape that ties down businesses is one that the European Conservatives and Reformists Group welcomes. But we have seen all too often how presidencies become so desperate to get legislative agreements on their report card that they agree to any old rubbish. So my group will judge your Presidency not on the quantity but the quality of legislation that we see passed in the next six months. We will look to you to remove obstacles to trading across the single market, especially the digital single market. We will look to you to advocate enforcement of existing rules such as the EU Stability and Growth Pact. And, as well as a digital single market, we will look to you to quickly move on proposals on capital markets and energy proposals. We hope that the Dutch reputation for pragmatism will ensure that these proposals will not simply create more bureaucratic regulatory unions. In capital markets we do not necessarily need another union but transparent, efficient capital markets that allow entrepreneurs to access alternative sources of finance and not rely on banks alone. For energy, rather than focus on a bureaucratic union, we should be looking to interconnect energy grids, diversify supply and improve energy efficiency and conservation. But, as we look ahead today, your greatest challenge will be the refugee and migration crisis, and as you try to find solutions we hope you will rely less on imposed solutions and instead focus on cooperation and countries taking responsibility. Any leader that sends out an open invitation to all, regardless of whether they are genuinely fleeing persecution and war or seeking to queue-jump the legal migration channels, needs to take responsibility for the impact on their country and other countries. Those countries that are failing to protect the Schengen zone’s external borders need to live up to their responsibility. And all of us here and in the Commission should be helping countries to cooperate, to find solutions that are fair to Member States, to find solutions that are fair to their neighbours, and to find solutions fair to the people seeking asylum. We will certainly see one referendum during your Presidency; we may see two. The outcome of both of these referendums may depend on whether we can show the people that we are listening to them and that we can offer them solutions and not more problems. It is a heavy burden on your shoulders, and we in the European Conservatives and Reformists look forward to working with you to tackle the crisis with better solutions, to allow countries to cooperate better, and to steer the EU in a better direction.

That is the internal debate in Britain. I think there is more debate here than in the British Parliament, Mark. Anyway, so be it. You see, Britain could not do without European democracy. Where else would they be able to have their debates if we did not have the European Parliament?  The Dutch Presidency is coming and expectations are always high. It is not for nothing that there is a Treaty of Amsterdam and a Maastricht Treaty. I am not proposing, of course, that a new treaty be concluded immediately under the Dutch Presidency. I don't think that's realistic. But, of course, we have great hope that the Dutch Presidency can do something about the deep crisis in which Europe has been caught. I see - as you have also mentioned - three priorities. The top priority, of course, is the refugee crisis. What you said is almost exactly the same as what President Tusk said yesterday: 'We have two months, otherwise Schengen is dead'. I wonder if Schengen is not already dead. If there are border controls in Slovenia, hungary, Austria, Denmark and Sweden, and if there is any addition to Germany, then there is really nothing left of Schengen. I know that on 18 February you are planning a special summit on the Brexit story. Perhaps we should have an extra summit on the refugee crisis rather than Brexit. Because that's urgent. As Jean-Claude Juncker has said, we are waiting with the European Parliament for the european border and coast guard proposal. We're done. We have proposed to follow a fast track procedure. Manfred Weber repeated it this morning. The problem is when the Council is going to say yes and so I have one request to you. Because that's where it starts. There are 3 000 refugees a day arriving in Greece (which shows that the agreement with Turkey is still not working optimally). So that seems to me to be the priority. Mr. President, the second priority is the internal market. I would like to tell you, Mr Kamall, that I agree completely with you but your voting pattern is a little bit different. Yesterday we voted here on the harmonisation of spectrum in the Langen report, but we voted against the ECR, against harmonisation of spectrum. Yesterday we voted about one regulator in the digital market, we voted against the ECR on that issue. They want the digital market, a harmonised digital market, but they don't want it to be Europe that creates the digital market. It has to become the digital market 'spontaneously'. Well, a digital market doesn't come spontaneously; a digital market comes if you have the right legislation on the European level in place and we encourage you, Prime Minister, to come forward in the tradition of Jan Willem Beyen, the first Dutch person who defended the idea in the 1950s to have a customs union, an internal market.  We all know only 35% of the internal market exists; 65% is still closed: digital, telecom, capital markets. All this is closed; services are closed. My proposal is that the Dutch Presidency should agree on a timetable, so that in 2019 we have a full opening of the internal market. That should be a big achievement, because the actual growth we have – I agree with Mr Juncker on this – 1.5–2% is mainly expansive monetary policy by the ECB: low interest rates, low oil prices and a weak euro. We need, structurally, this fully-fledged internal market, and I hope then that the voting pattern of Mr. Kamall and his Group is going to be a little bit different than yesterday. Not only words, but also action, Mr. Kamall. Finally, the Brexit: I think you did a fantastic thing in your introduction, Mr Rutte. You have effectively given the greatest British statesman as an example: his speech in the Hague, but moreover his intervention in 1946 in Zurich at a university where he said that not only for economic but for geopolitical reasons, Britain has to remain in a united Europe. The Soviet Union may have disappeared, but in the me time we have Putin – one of the friends of Mr Farage – and while the threat in the Middle East may be different, in the meas we have terrorism. So, let us make a deal with Mr Cameron, and it has to be a deal with balance – we have interests too – and let us not forget that only a united Europe is in the geopolitical interest not only of Britain, but of all European states.

Mr President, I would like to thank the You, Mr Rutte, have taken a long look back in history and flirted a bit with the complexity of the EU's development. I understand you to want to manage the Union in practice during your Presidency. You also pointed out that you were taking a step back and– to put it somewhat ironically – I did not even know that you were borrowing from Lenin, in his strategic work: two steps forward, one step backwards. We have converted this a little: two steps sideways and one step back. I do not think that this will give the necessary answer as to how the EU can really become suitable for everyday use. What do you say to people? Do you think it is important for the citizens of the EU how the profits of the banks increase and how a part of the population is increasing wealth and an ever-increasing proportion is increasingly excluded, also feels socially excluded and, in the end, also postulates a defence against the European Union.  Yesterday we had a discussion with the Polish Prime Minister. That was clear. Looking at our Member States in Eastern Europe, we should make it clear that there is more to it than just saying that we must continue the radical reforms of the market and then believe that we can create high-quality jobs with them.  The cat bites its tail. That will not work. That has nared so far. This has led to the growth of precariousness. That is the point that needs to be discussed. I just cannot accept that you are simply thinking this way: carry on as before, perhaps a little slower. The tension that was also felt here yesterday was made very clear by the Polish Prime Minister. Anyone who has listened carefully has realised that it is not about an EU that is evolving, it is about a Europe of nation states. That is something else. I would ask you, in your responsibility as President of the European Union, to counteract this for the coming weeks and months. Then I ask you the question of migration. What does this mean: a deal is a deal and we have six to eight weeks? What does that mean? After six to eight weeks, is the Union prepared to pat Turkey on the fingers and say what you are doing in south-eastern Turkey, that is not possible? Is it not acceptable for us to accept that you are waging an aggressive fight against people, against civilians, in a part of this country, in the reduction of the number of refugees?  For example, they could provide a very specific action, a small piece of the puzzle, also for combating the causes of flight. For example, by taking the warlords the sources of money. Finally, by monitoring trade in raw materials as it has actually been agreed by the OSCE. Then, during your Presidency, let us start negotiations on the regulation on raw materials for conflict and quickly reach an agreement. Parliament has already laid very good foundations for this.  Please also set more ambitious targets for the fight against climate change. You also have the opportunity to do so, you have the opportunity and you have the support of Parliament on this point. One final question. I do not want to be rude, but I have to ask them: what are you going to do with the results of the referendum on the agreement with Ukraine?

I ask you one question: \"Would you ever have become Prime Minister of the Netherlands if you did not have a vision for your future?\" I don't think so. If Europe is now in serious trouble, it is precisely because of a lack of vision. We are creating a monetary union without a fiscal and a social Union. That can't work. We are creating a Union with free movement without a common asylum, migration and border policy. This may not work and that shows that there is a lack of vision rather than a lack of results.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem says: \"Forget Schengen, we need a mini-Schengen.\" And when I hear your comparison between the European Union and the Roman Empire, I think this view may be wrong. Anyway, you're right. Let's talk about results. Will it be under the Dutch Presidency that Schengen will fall apart? Without a well-functioning registration and a distribution schedule, it will not work. I know that the challenge is very great and I hear you say that this is a priority for you, but results are now needed in this area. Will it be under the Dutch presidency that one of the largest countries leaves the EU? We have already discussed it and I will not say more about it. Will it be during the Dutch Presidency that the EU-Ukraine agreement be shot down? I expect you, as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, to stick your neck out to win that campaign and not just play D66 or GroenLinks. You have a responsibility there, Mr. Rutte.  We need results. You have listed COP21. That is also very important. I note that an agreement has been reached there to limit global warming to a maximum of two degrees and, if possible, to one and a half degrees. This means that Europe must revise its objectives because all our legislation is aimed at the two-degree target. That's where work is needed, and I expect you to do it.  Finally, I will use my last minute to talk about something you have not mentioned. The Netherlands will not be a European champion in football this year. But the Netherlands is a European champion in another area that you have not mentioned and that is tax avoidance. There are others who compete for this title, but the Dutch may be European champions in this field.  I see that Portuguese companies that do not have any activity in the Netherlands are moving to your country in a 'legal' or totally artificial way. I see that Lithuania's largest supermarket chain, called Maxima, is moving to the Netherlands, which has no activity in your country. How long will the Netherlands be considered a team player by the other 27 Member States if the Netherlands continues to steal money from its neighbours? I find this totally unacceptable. I hear nothing of your priorities for a more common approach to business taxation. The Commission has taken a number of initiatives in this area, but you are not saying anything about them. This means that the Netherlands has no interest in this. By the way, I've visited you several times. I have seen Eric Wiebes, I have heard Dijsselbloem and nothing has been said about that.

Now a Europe capable of focusing on the essentials is a Europe capable of governing the fundamental variable of political action: time. yes, the time, the time that requires us to act quickly to stop climate change. Europe faces the challenge of two major reforms. The one for a circular economy and the one for the reduction of CO2 emissions. The circular economy can become a real engine for changing the European economic model, but it must be adequately supported to express this strength and balanced with all economic and social actors, in particular European SMEs, who will have to adapt to this transformation. Time, what is too often lacking to save the many lives of desperate people trying to reach our shores. The creation of a European Border Guard and a strategy that will be able to implement the relocation mechanism in practice is therefore welcome as soon as possible. The time to prevent two generations, those of the over-50s and the distrusted young people, from being permanently excluded from the labour market. We are calling for innovative growth, driven by the strategy for a digital single market, but also participatory growth that puts citizenship income at the centre. It is clear that your Presidency is at a difficult time. You will have to make good use of the instruments of a good European Presidency, namely: the ability to mediate, to bring the outstanding legislative dossiers to a successful conclusion, to be flexible in order to be ready in the face of unforeseen emergencies. However, it will be necessary to be able to act in the interests of all the citizens of the Union, not just those who belong to this or that latitude. Trade-driven liberalism, like the one some countries would like, is not sustainable unless it is accompanied by a strong regulatory framework on made in and trade defence instruments. But there is no trace of the unblocking of these dossiers in the programme of the Dutch Presidency, which, on the other hand, looks at the issue of WTO recognition for China.

I congratulate Mr Juncker on this new President of the Council of Ministers: a true executor of EU policy, a pragmatist with no vision. A president who has proved himself not to shy away from throwing elderly people out of the care home, to put the sick on the street, and then to fill the vacant buildings with the warm welcome welcomed migrants. A grey cog in the EU machine of evil, which wishes Muslims a happy Ramadan but is silent when his friends in Cologne's Station Square sexually assault hundreds of women. It is nice to have such a president, who is only too happy to pay billions to Brussels, send billions to corrupt countries such as Greece and Ukraine and contribute to the billions that are disappearing into the pockets of ankara's beast. The Netherlands has drawn up a list of priorities. It wants an innovative Union, a Union that is limited to the main issues, a Union that connects. And do you know what this means? More European Union, more banking union, more tax union, more Union in external border security, more Union in energy supply, more Union in the accession of corrupt countries, more Union in bringing in refugees, more Union in the depletion of pension funds and more Union in plundering savings accounts for bankrupt banks. So what result can we expect from this 62 million Dutch Presidency? More European Union. But also an even wider gap between politicians and citizens, who want to go in a completely different direction, an even bigger economic mess in the Member States, which are bursting socially and financially under the pressure of millions of unemployable and unintegrable migrants, yet more disruption of thousands of lives of women who have been sexually assaulted and raped by testosterone bombs from Muslim countries and, above all, more Islamic culture. And I mean honor killings, female circumcision, gang rape, Jew hatred, beheadings, stonings and attacks. Because for the road watchers under my ear, since 11 September 2001 there have been more than 22 000 Islamist attacks with more than 125 000 dead.  That is why I have the following proposal for Mr Rutte: stop hanging around here. Return to The Hague as soon as possible, pre-emptively lock up all male asylum seekers, legalise pepper spray so that women can protect themselves, introduce administrative detention for potential terrorists and, above all, close national borders to stop this terror threat.

But I think you can be a little more proud of your mother tongue and I will speak to you in Dutch.  I will also thank you in Dutch, Mr Rutte, for starting your speech with the story that there are simply things that you do better together in Europe than as a Member State alone. After the dark brown business card issued by Mr De Graaff here in the Netherlands, I am grateful to you for starting your speech.

You are talking in the Netherlands about reducing the inflow to zero. Zero seems unrealistic to me, but I share your ambition to limit this intake, otherwise the support is lost in the municipalities and among the citizens who are now working hard to arrange reception.  My question to you is: what are you going to do in concrete terms? You pride yourself on concrete results. What are your concrete intermediate steps over the next six months to get that done?

That is, of course, what Europe is all about. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. There is a lot of discussion, but when it comes to implementation and enforcement, there really is not enough going on. Let the Netherlands reverse and change that.  I am thinking, for example, of human rights and, in particular, religious freedom, Pakistan. We are about to review the system of general tariff preferences for developing countries. It is a country like Pakistan that benefits enormously from this. But what do we see in Pakistan? Minorities such as Hindus, Ahmadis and Christians are systematically oppressed by these so-called blasphemy laws. Even in small incidents, blasphemy is thrown into battle and people disappear into prison, with Mrs Asia Bibi as the most famous victim. She has been given a death sentence!  We need to stop that abuse. The Netherlands must push Pakistan to truly comply with human rights and religious freedom. If this does not happen, this system of tariff preferences for Pakistan will be shelved.  Then there are the refugees: we are, of course, dealing with a major issue within Europe, namely the refugees. How are we going to restore Europe's credibility? We must distribute refugees fairly among all Member States. Solidarity is needed. Put that at the top of the agenda! And let us provide concrete solutions.  Take Calais, a fairly well-organized problem. And what do we see there? For years now thousands of people have been living there who want to move on. Truck drivers are threatened, cabs are pulled open, cargo destroyed. Just take such a concrete example. Now organize an extra summit about that in a few weeks. Then you can achieve concrete results.  And speaking of transport, I am also thinking of a very different but relevant point: the unfair competition of airlines such as Emirates, Easyjet and Qatar Airways. They are subsidized by their states and can therefore fly at dump prices. We can no longer compete with KLM! Now tackle such a point in Europe together with other airlines!  So, Mr President, it is ultimately about honouring, maintaining. Maybe not so sexy, but you get results with that and with that you can restore credibility. Finally, two points. Correct the mistake, Mr Rutte, made during the last Dutch presidency in 2004. That is when the European Union started accession negotiations with Turkey. Stop that! Neither Much of Turkey nor its capital is located in Europe. And besides, we see that there's a police state there. Opponents of the regime awaits either the gummy bat or prison. We have to stop that. Stop turkey's accession! Point two, you rightly said it, Brexit. Make every effort to prevent a Brexit. A Brexit would be disastrous and we must prevent it together. Good luck.

You are right to say that citizens are sceptical about the European Union because of too many rules, and they are also very irritating.

But the real problem is not the EU. It is the national governments that, every time, torpedo every solution in an endless series of summits where there is a lot of talk but no action. You want to be pragmatic, I totally agree. So let us stop the theoretical discussions about national sovereignty and produce results. So no cosmetic and symbolic things, but real reforms of the EU.

Unfortunately, the Dutch Presidency presides over the crises. We know Prime Minister Rutte as someone who is averse to vistas and wants to tackle the problems practically. Still, I ask for vision. The crises do not come out of the blue, but have a similar cause.  In recent years, the European Union has been a toy for large companies, not Europe of and for citizens. This became very clear when the citizens of the Netherlands and France voted no to the European Constitution in 2005, but that constitution was pushed through the Treaty of Lisbon. But there is more: the British are becoming an increasingly federal Europe, even though they have made it very clear from accession that they do not want it. And now there is a threat of Brexit. When internal border controls were abolished, no one was told that there would be an asylum policy at European level. I reject the attitude of those Eastern European Member States that do not want to take in asylum seekers. But I do understand that people feel robbed there. Add to this the dictates to Greece, to Portugal and Ireland, while the imbalances in the euro area continue to exist. When the euro was introduced, that was not mentioned. While the Brussels bubble knew full well that the euro would lead to a huge transfer of financial and economic powers.  Mr Rutte, you now have a great opportunity to restore the public's confidence in Europe. And not via a nice app, as Minister Koenders suggested this week, but by finally taking the Dutch electorate seriously when a referendum on the treaty with Ukraine is held in the Netherlands on 6 April.

We hope for a successful Dutch presidency. I would like to start with a quote: \"We are committed to strengthening economic growth. We must create jobs in Europe and reduce backlogs.\" You will probably think: well, that is a bit of our presidency. That was Balkenende, July 1, 2004. In fact, since every presidency, every president has put jobs and growth first . We have to deliver that, and confidence in Europe will be all right.  Perhaps we should remember that this increasing Euroscepticism and the turning away from Europe is because of something else. It's a lack of credibility. Wonderful stories in Brussels or Strasbourg, but in the meantime at home in Berlin, in Paris, in The Hague keep your own story in which you drop off against Brussels or Strasbourg. In this sense, it is nice to hear that you think the European Parliament is so important, because I have not heard you say that very often in The Hague.  Let's go to the credibility problem. Europe has a credibility problem in Greece. As the economy is cutting back, Juncker's investment plan in Brussels has been cut to a minimum amount. In Poland, we have a credibility problem. By talking about values now and talking about a Union of values, but in the meantime continue with Nord Stream, also the Netherlands. In France, by leaving test balloons on mini-Schengen that France doesn't even belong to. What kind of credibility is that? In Portugal, by talking about balanced budgets in Portugal, but in the meantime luring the 20 largest companies to Amsterdam to get their income there without any economic activity. In our neighbouring countries, by talking about reception in the region, but in the meantime cutting back on development cooperation and transferning EUR 0 to the UN Food Programme, which has been promised. Or in the Netherlands by constantly talking about the transfer of sovereignty, which we do not want when it comes to the EU, but in the meantime want to give away tons of sovereignty when it comes to TTIP. That's credibility!  It is time for the Netherlands to show leadership to become truly credible. That means relocating, more than that 50, transferring the money that we promised, stopping Nord Stream 2, really going to a social Europe where we tackle our own trade surplus and not just look at the deficits in the south, but also our surplus in the north, and finally in the Ukraine debate, really campaigning. Not only because the association agreement is a trade agreement, but also because it is important for Ukraine that it is not a political plaything between Russia and Europe. That is a credible Europe. That is the leadership of the Netherlands that we need during this presidency.

Mr Rutte, I note you are a keen historian because you were quoting Winston Churchill for us this morning, and indeed Mr Verhofstadt backed you up. You are quite right, post-war Churchill did encourage integration, especially between France and Germany, but he made it absolutely clear at all times that the United Kingdom should not be a part of it and I would like you please to acknowledge that. I also very much doubt that, 50 years after his death, Churchill would approve of the club the way it is, because he was a democrat.  This EU faces an existential crisis. Indeed, there is an outbreak of a contagious disease. It is not a new one; the Greeks first came across it a couple of thousand years ago. The virus in its new form began in Denmark in the early 1990s, but was put down with a heavy German hand. There have been a couple of outbreaks in Ireland, but substantial European money again cured the outbreak. But the red alert in 2005, when the contagion swept across the Netherlands and France, frankly has never gone away, and I think now we have simultaneous outbreaks of the disease. In Denmark it now looks to be wholly irreversible and, in my own country, despite decades of our political establishment denying its existence, a recent opinion poll showed that sufferers may now be actually in a majority. What surprised me about your speech, as the Dutch Prime Minister, is that you did not mention the fact that 427 000 of your own citizens have outed themselves in public, declared themselves to be carriers, called a referendum for 6 April and encouraged the rest of the country to join in. I suppose it must be embarrassing for you.  The diagnosis, by the way, will not be popular in this House: the disease is called democracy. People want to have a say on their future. Mr Juncker here says that there will be a continental crisis if the Dutch vote no. Well I’ll drink to that, is all I can say. When you add to that Schengen, and when you add to that people’s utter revulsion at what happened in Cologne, I think that you are going to have a very, very hot time over the course of the next six months.  Whether we can, the peoples of Europe, break this Union between now and the end of June, I do not know. But I will tell you what, we going to have a damn good go.

Today, the European Union has reached a negative culmination of all its developments. In the economic sector, in the field of currency, social affairs, labour market, security. Never before has Europe functioned as badly as it does today. Of course, the three anti-EU groups in the House are right: EFDD, ENF and ECR.

A Europe of sovereign states that has gone into a good future here in friendship with each other on an equal footing.

I would just like to say: Poland, Hungary, Denmark, the procedure that is now being opened. I do not want to mention the many negative voices of southern Europe towards Germany and Austria in the course of the whole currency crisis. This is not a Europe that can work. This is not a Europe of friendship and a positive future. This is a Europe of bickering and strife. We should correct all the negative developments in the area of the currency. I have nothing against a common currency if it worked. The only thing is that the euro is not working. The euro destroys prosperity, the euro destroys purchasing power, and so the euro should be divided into two zones, perhaps – or a return to national currencies.  It worked. Also the question of Schengen. I would not mind if we could leave borders open. The only fact is: it doesn't work. Organised crime is spilling over into the countries of Western Europe. We have a wave of refugees and a wave of illegal migrants that allow terrorism to come to Europe. Therefore: suspendIng Schengen, pulling up borders again.

This is the need to find a sensible compromise on the immigration crisis – a compromise that will replace the existing policy of forced relocation. We are wiser today about the events of Paris. We know the plight of drivers in the Calais area or do we already know, despite attempts to self-censor the media, what happened on New Year's Eve in Cologne and other European cities. After all, it is worth using these experiences.

And that means that guarding the Schengen external borders is vital.  Because then we can distinguish between genuine asylum seekers and refugees, between people who pretend to be and migrant workers who are not allowed to mingle as asylum seekers or refugees in these large streams. There are other solutions for that.  Mr President, protecting external borders also means making it easier to deal with criminals and terrorists. In the case of open external borders, the state can no longer protect its citizens. The abandoning of Schengen is an economic disaster and that is why we must act. I am sure you will remember all those lorries for the borders. Citizens will no longer be able to travel freely. There has been a lot of talk about Sir Winston Churchill.

Mr President, I have no idea where this Dutch Presidency wants to go.

I am sorry because you are starting here today with your government and with your members this semester and you see such a spectacle.

So I would advise you to do this: in Italy there is a film called \"Quo vado\", which made the record of receipts, made by a gentleman named Checco Zalone, and in fact his name is Luca Medici, and by the director Nunziante, who speaks of the flaws of the Italian reforms putting them in a joking tone, but who has made it clear exactly how Italy works. Do it yourself, I invite Zalone to do the same thing about Europe and you watch this film, because you will understand how so often all politicians talk, the rulers talk, but then they do exactly the opposite of what they say and people are not stupid. I am a mayor of an Italian town, but ordinary people – not here who seem to be on Mars, it feels like they are on Mars here – ordinary people want concrete solutions. It seems to be like in those construction sites on the highway where it says \"We work for you\" and one arrives on the highway, there are kilometers of queue and in the construction site either there is no one or there are two people who run two buckets. This is today's Europe. As with illegal immigrants, but can we say months ago 'we will stop tens of thousands of illegal immigrants' and after months we have sorted two hundred illegal immigrants?

Improved border control, in compliance with humanitarian and international obligations, is a shared European responsibility. But what exactly will be the task for the states without an external border in the future? After joint control comes the shared responsibility for arriving refugees. I have so far lacked clear and binding statements. The third countries: do you want to support countries of origin and transit so that they can take in people or offer them a perspective and thus reduce the number of refugees? Or do you seriously want to develop the number of refugees arriving in Europe against zero, for example in cooperation with Turkey? That would be denial of one's own responsibility and foreclosure with visibly catastrophic consequences.

Strengthening repression measures, border controls, fences, i.e. the creation of a 'Fortress Europe' against refugees, and the continuation of the same neoliberal policies of harsh austerity will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis.

With regard to the Energy Union, we expect some of the positions expressed in the European Parliament's report to be implemented, namely to promote measures to combat energy poverty and to exploit the natural gas deposits of the Eastern Mediterranean to enhance the Union's energy security.

It is up to you to take the witness at a time when Europe is experiencing some kind of difficulties, which you have not stopped describing. Undoubtedly, the biggest challenge is the refugee crisis. The channeling of migration flows is an objective that requires a complex response and will not be solved without addressing the causes of the migration flow. We must also provide an effective response to contain and manage the flow of refugees from Syria, ensuring in their management a correct balance between the different Member States. Responses to this challenge must be addressed from a common and European perspective. During this Presidency we will also have to fight the call for themselves 'Islamic State' both outside and within our borders.  But providing an adequate response to these challenges must not be a closing of one of the Union's precious achievements: Schengen — the free movement of people and goods, and the elimination of internal borders. We cannot allow them to damage the foundations of the European project, and in this case President Juncker's repeated warnings must be heeded. Let us continue him, because, in our view, he is in possession of a truth that affects us all.  The current geopolitical framework of the European Union and its Member States is defined by increasing instability and, in these circumstances, the 2016 European Council will analyse the work done to renew the overall foreign and security policy strategy.  Mr President, you talked about the economy and talked about important things.

On the one hand, on strengthening development in less developed countries. You got off to a good start with the major conference on global value chains in Amsterdam, and we must continue to do so.  We will have the question of revising the generalised tariff preferences during your Presidency.

We will also talk about the raw materials for conflict. I hope that together we can ensure that raw materials used in the European Union ensure fair working conditions in their countries of origin, and that is binding.

So we must work quickly with the Coast guard and the border guard, make the hotspots work and we must make the conditions of refugees in the countries of first reception livable. Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva also said this recently. If 70% of the children who escaped the Syrian massacre do not go to school in the refugee camps, then if we take away from the younger ones a normal life expectancy, the families move. But you see, Mr Rutte, you will then have to explain well to certain governments and also to certain political parties the difference that there is between these refugees, these families and the illegals, pardons, economic migrants as the politically correct wants. Because he sees the confusion is precisely between this, between refugees and illegal immigrants, which means that among migrants we have 75% male presence in some countries, in others we get to 85, in some cases to 90% of men.

I agree that you want to prioritise the achievement of sustainability objectives and the implementation of the tasks arising from the 2015 Paris Climate Summit. At the same time, I think that when we talk about energy policy, we must also talk about protecting the international competitiveness of European industry. European energy-intensive industries are at risk as a result of high energy prices, administrative burdens and inadequate trade policies. That is why I welcome the fact that the Commission is organising a conference in mid-February on the challenges facing energy-intensive industries, and I trust that this meeting will have tangible results. At the same time, I call on the Dutch Presidency, in addition to climate policy, to give due emphasis to industrial and trade policy considerations. A good example of this is the proper management of industries exposed to carbon leakage in the ongoing reform of the emissions trading system. Or, in the longer term, examining the possibility of carbon adjustment at borders. When making trade policy decisions, efforts should be made to ensure that products from third countries which are more competitive than those produced in Europe only because they have to comply with less stringent environmental or e.g. labour protection standards cannot break into european markets.

Two more questions – trafficking in human beings. 2016 is key: the Commission's strategy expires; progress reports and implementation of the Directive in this area. This issue must be clearly distinguished at the same time, but also treated on an equal footing with the other equally scary phenomenon as the fight against migrant smuggling.

It is a very ambitious programme and one that is on the essentially right path. I would just like to highlight two aspects. The first has to do with the issue of refugees and therefore with the problem of migration, and here, frankly, I would like to see a greater commitment by the Dutch Presidency to the creation of a border guard and a coast guard, because I think that is the essential pillar, on the one hand, to defend our borders, but to create also what will be the embryo of a security policy and even a Union defence policy European. If we have this force, which is a partly military force, partly police, working – and unfortunately the results of the December Council were deceiting – I think we can take a big step forward in protecting our borders and defending the status of refugees, and even migration policy for the Union. The second aspect is a more negative aspect and has to do with the issue of international trade. I note that there is no room for Mercosur in the priorities of the Dutch Presidency. Mercosur made its offer to the European Union last year. How can the Dutch Presidency leave behind countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay? How can there be a bet here, as we see, in the case, for example, of Mexico, in the renegotiation, and whether it is creating the most important commercial space in Latin America, and the EU is completely in paralysis?

Instability outside the European Union certainly increases security risks including terrorism. You are aware that the events in Paris have intensified concerns about these problems. Strict control of our borders is certainly necessary, and it conditions that you firmly implement the migration package presented by the Commission.

Capital market union and banking union are essential for growth and stability and it should be remembered that risk sharing through capital and credit markets is in itself a means of reducing it. Further steps, if reasoned and balanced, to reduce risk can be examined, but anticipating solutions before and outside the Basel international framework would be unacceptable and counterproductive.

Mr President, I believe that the Dutch Presidency has significant challenges ahead of it and that it must certainly give priority to the refugee problem. For us it was not and is no surprise that Turkey, once again, has not complied with what has been agreed. Quite rightly, the Commissioner of the European Union, Mr Hahn, also pointed out that Turkey once again does not respect and recognise what has been agreed. But tell me when Turkey has complied with what has been agreed. Is it when Turkey signed the Ankara Protocol on its cyprus obligations which it has so far refused to implement? Is it when, completely ignoring the principles and values of the European Union, it violates human rights not only within Turkey but also outside Turkey and especially in Cyprus? When he maintains an occupying army on European soil? When he has never, ever respected and respected any agreement in the European Parliament? I believe that, also on the refugee issue, the characterisation appropriate to the issue of Turkey in relations with the European Union is attributed in just one word: mockery. It is a mockery of what has been agreed, because while the European Union has approached and opened Chapter 17 for Turkey, Turkey has written what has been agreed in the oldest of its footwear. He didn't respect and didn't recognize anything. If one examines the geography of the region, then one will see Turkey's enormous responsibilities for the refugee crisis. The Turkish-Syrian border is a long way, hundreds of kilometres away, from the Greek coast, and yet Turkey is letting refugees unchecked to get there. This is Turkey: instead of helping to solve the refugee crisis, it is hitting and flattening the Kurds who are the only ones who are actually fighting against terrorism. I will call on the Dutch Presidency not only to press but also to persuade Turkey to fulfil its cyprus obligations towards Cyprus. I will call on the Dutch Presidency to strengthen the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, and to support his sincere intentions to solve the Cyprus problem. I will ask her to stand and stand even at this late moment in a Country member of the European Union which is being invaded by a country with which we want to cooperate and which we want to consider to be a reliable partner.

The North Sea offers Europe an unparalleled opportunity to generate 8% of our electricity supply from wind and other renewables by 2030, while at the same time realising savings of EUR 5 to 13 billion a year. In short, I believe the Dutch Presidency should bring the countries surrounding the North Sea together and go for that vision. Finally, I think we need to deliver on the fight against tax fraud.

The Presidency always has ambitious priorities and then life verifies its real objectives. It seems to me that, firstly, the Presidency will have to deal with the problem of migration and, in particular, the sealing of the European Union's external border. This is a prerequisite for maintaining the free movement of persons and goods, and thus of the common market as a whole, and for maintaining the Schengen area. The potential costs of decommissioning the Schengen area – both for citizens, for businesses and for the transport services sector and many others – have been presented, inter alia, by President Juncker. The second key political issue will be negotiations on the UK and a potential Brexit. The changes negotiated will affect not only the European Union-Uk relationship, but also the future of the Union as a whole. It is important to remember that they are acceptable to all members, all parties and all countries, and not to undermine the foundations on which the European Union is founded, such as the right to social benefits for those who work as migrants in the UK. Thirdly, we must answer the question of what to do next with European climate policy after the COP in Paris. The European Union has the most advanced climate policy, but not everyone shares it. We want to be a leader, but not everyone wants to acknowledge that. After the summit, the time has come to make this policy real, which does not mean that we are not to be ambitious, but that excess ambition will often harm the economy, if only by carbon leakage, which threatens the European Union industry. Fourthly, I would like to draw attention to the need to work on the circular economy (recirculating economy) package, a project that has great potential for significant remodelling of the Union's economy. Fifthly, the review of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The question is, will we maintain the existing rules?

There have been so many questions that I feel awful for the fact that I can only try in 10 minutes to answer a couple of them, but I can assure you that I made many notes. We will study them carefully, so nothing will be lost. Everything will be studied. Not everything will be taken on board – that will be difficult – but there have been many insights which we will make full use of in making a success of our Presidency.  First of all, thanks to the President of the Commission for his words of encouragement and support. I think one of the issues he highlighted is the question of Schengen and how we proceed with it. There were also questions from Mr Lamberts, from Mr de Grandes Pascual, from Ms Toia and others on this, and this all has to do with the question of how we deal with the refugee crisis in the coming weeks. I think we have to do two things at the same time. We have to make a success of the package, the proposals the Commission put forward on border control, on a voluntary settlement scheme and some of the other proposals, to bring them forward as soon as possible. It will not happen in the next six to eight weeks; we will need more time to do that, whilst at the same time for the next six to eight weeks we have to make sure that we get the current influx of refugees under control.  How should we do this? There were many questions from Ms de Lange, Ms Sippel, Ms Gardini, Mr Rangel, Ms Šuica and many others – Mr Zimmer, Mr Verhofstadt. It is my intention to work, with the Commission and with my colleagues on the Council, very closely with Turkey to make a success of the Turkey-EU agreement. It needs to be seen to deliver in terms of lowering the numbers very considerably in the next six to eight weeks, while at the same time we have to make a success out of the relocation scheme which has been agreed, yes, I know by QMV, at the October Joint Council.  This is what we have to do in the next six to eight weeks, at the same time working on the more fundamental questions of border control, and the more fundamental questions of resettlement, of voluntary settlement, in the future. But we have to make a clear distinction. I believe that everybody wants to keep Schengen on board. Here I would say in reaction to Jean-Claude Juncker and others mentioning this issue that, in my view, what is now happening in Denmark, Sweden and other countries is not about closing Schengen or making sure that Schengen is no longer valid. I think what these countries are doing is trying to deal with the crisis at the moment. It is all temporary. It is not a full closure of these borders, and we have to make sure that we do deliver in the next six to eight weeks so that it does not come to a situation where we have to do more.  I want to thank Mr Weber for his very kind words, for ‘Unterstützung’ (support). Indeed ‘Glaubwürdigkeit’ (credibility) is a key word for the next six months and even beyond. Implementierung und Migration – das sind ja die wichtigen Wörter für die nächsten sechs Monate – und auch Sicherheit und Wirtschaft. And yes, we will work on the free trade agreement with Canada. We will try to push forward the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and I do believe, along with Mr Weber, that we need this, and also the Ukraine agreement. We need the Ukraine agreement because it is, on the one hand, a free trade agreement, but it also has to do with stability on the borders of the European Union. It is not about pre-accession. That is why I, in the Dutch referendum, will make a clear plea, together with my colleagues, in support of this agreement with Ukraine.  I want to thank Mr Pittella for his very kind words of support. I do agree that in the whole area of the labour mobility package and the Posting of Workers Directive there is a lot we need to do in the next couple of months, and we will try to push this together with the Commission. I think the deeper and fairer market in the European Union will go hand in hand. This is also to Ms Steinruck and so many others who made a point on this. Mr Pittella also asked me about the situation concerning the humanitarian corridor for Syrian refugees, and I can assure him that the Dutch Presidency is continuing the work of previous Presidencies to pursue and further implement the common solutions Europe needs to solve this crisis, and the facilities for the Syrian refugees we need to work on in the region. I believe that is the best humanitarian corridor we can think of. I also want to thank Mr Kamall of the ECR Group for his kind words of support. I agree with him: it is about quality of legislation, not quantity of legislation, and with him and others we will work on the digital single market, the capital markets and the Energy Union. I would like to thank Mr Verhofstadt of the ALDE Group for his kind words of support for the next six months. There is a lot to be done. Of course, on refugees, I am not sure whether a special summit will be the solution but it will certainly be discussed, no doubt at a level of the European Council. I would also like to thank Ms Zimmer for her kind words of support. I think she challenged me about this question of whether the European Union is a union of nation states or something else. Here, I would say that as a Union it is clear that we pool sovereignty. That is a clear given, to address the common challenges that Europe faces – the economy, climate, energy, migration and, at the same time, security. But we are more than just an intergovernmental organisation. Europe consists of nation states. They are the foundation of the EU and they are, therefore, I believe, the master of the Treaties, but thank you so much for that challenge and this is indeed an important question. Your question on the referendum of Ukraine and the Netherlands I have already answered. I very much agreed with Mr Borrelli on the question of the circular economy.  Mr Lamberts and many others asked questions on the issue of tax avoidance and how we will deal with that during the Dutch Presidency. There were also questions from Mr Lamassoure, Mr Niedermayer, Mr Kofod and of course Mr Pittella. I can assure you that, during our presidency, the Netherlands wants to play an active role in the fight against tax avoidance by multinationals. It is a focal point for the Netherlands to reach an international agreement on increasing transparency and improving convergence between national tax systems. As we all know, the Commission is expected to present its anti-tax avoidance package, including a directive with measures against tax avoidance, later this month. Mr Pittella referred to the Ferreira—Theurer report. It contains far-reaching and interesting suggestions and recommendations. I think at this stage I would prefer to wait for the tax avoidance package which the Commission intends to present, and then the Council will take a position. And, to respond to the point of Mr Lamassoure, we will try to do this as soon as possible – I am not sure it is possible by June – but indeed as soon as possible to take a view on this very important matter. Mevrouw De Lange, u vroeg mij om vooral te voorkomen dat ik met voetbalmetaforen kom de komende tijd. Ik zal dat doen. Het is al pijnlijk genoeg dat Nederland dadelijk gaat juichen voor de Rode Duivels. Althans, dat zal ik doen.  Ik ben het eens met de heer Tang wanneer hij het heeft over het belang van perspectief voor Syrische vluchtelingen, bijvoorbeeld in Turkije op het gebied van onderwijs en gezondheidszorg.  Ik ben het eens met de heer van Dalen dat we heel scherp moeten letten op de concurrentie uit andere delen van de wereld op het gebied van onze vliegtuigindustrie en dat we zeker moeten weten dat er gelijke concurrentievoorwaarden zijn.  Ik was blij met de zeer pragmatische insteek van mevrouw in 't Veld, die opnieuw, zoals ik ook in het Nederlandse parlement een paar keer merkte, nogal verschilt van de benadering van haar partijleider, de heer Pechtold. Zij stelt een zeer pragmatische aanpak van de problemen in de Europese Unie voor. Dat spreekt mij aan en ik hoop dat zij ook in haar partij nog meer mensen kan overtuigen van deze benadering.  Many asked me about my vision on the European Union, particularly some of your Members. Wir alle wissen, was Helmut Schmidt gesagt hat: „Wer Visionen hat, soll zum Arzt gehen.“ That deals with that point, and I believe it also answers the questions by Ms Hazekamp and Mr de Jong.  Er was een interessante discussie tussen meneer Eickhout en Annie Schriejer-Pierik.  We agree that agriculture and fisheries are of great importance to the EU economy and food security. The challenge will be to feed 9 billion people globally in 2050. Climate policy, smart agriculture, combating food and water waste are all important and prominent issues for the Netherlands Presidency programme. The central element, of course, is the review of the common agriculture policy in 2020. We must take the interests of farmers and food producers to heart. Here I fully agree with Mrs Schreijer-Pierik’s approach on this issue.  I thank Mr Farage, Mr Vilimsky and Mr Voigt for their very critical remarks. I am not sure I will be able to convince them in the next six months about our approach, but I can assure them that I will do my utmost to listen.  Mr Olbrycht asked a question on the Pact of Amsterdam and the position of cities within the European Union. I consider them the engines of innovation, so the Pact of Amsterdam has my full support. We will work on this.  Meneer van Baalen, u vroeg over de vluchtelingencrisis. Een gebalanceerde benadering, ik ben het daar zeer mee eens. We moeten ook precies weten wie er wel en niet mag binnenkomen. Belangrijk is ook een betere bescherming van de buitengrenzen, ook om daarmee te voorkomen dat terreur een kans krijgt en een verdere voet aan de grond zou krijgen binnen de Europese Unie. Ik ben het daar zeer mee eens. Mr Buonanno, I would like to thank you for the film tip. I will certainly try to look at ‘Quo Vado?’ as soon as possible and then see whether it can help us in the Presidency. Mevrouw Van Bossuyt, zeer veel dank voor de ondersteunende woorden. I think I am almost at the end of my time. Again, there are so many others who spoke. I can only tell you I wrote everything down, we will make sure that we make maximum use of all your insights, I look forward to working with all of you over the next six months, and this debate has really fired me up for that relationship between the Dutch holding the Presidency of the Council and this esteemed European Parliament.

Overall, the main challenge is to maintain political coherence. This should be a priority for the Dutch Presidency. The rift between the north and south of the Union can be seen by all. It has been honed by the Eurozone’s governance rules, confirmed by the results of the recent national elections in the south and highlighted by the ongoing spat between the Italian government and the Commission. A rift between the west and the east has now also become palpable. It has been spurred by the immigration crisis but is driven too by a growing disparity in economic structures and different approaches to political methods.

It is extremely important that Latvia will now be able to attract assistance from other national police officers, if necessary, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in order to ensure public order and security, or to prevent criminal offences, such as during mass events.

We voted in favour of this proposal as we think it is very important to introduce minimum criteria at European level that will enable Member States to respect the presumption of innocence and other rights of detainees, such as being present during their trial. One of the main ideas introduced in this proposal for a Directive is the shielding of the right to access of all detainees to some form of legal aid, even if provisionally. We find it positive that, in the face of the regressive changes in the judicial systems of different European countries, the presumption of innocence will be shielded and trials prevented in the absence of the accused. Some of the key issues for us have not been included, such as the inclusion of the right to remain silent or some measures relating to the custody of evidence, often violated in the Spanish State in cases related to the persecution of social activists.

Only through effective and consistent procedural guarantees of protection can we ensure that the rights of accused and suspects are upholding. In this regard, I consider Article 4 of this proposal, which insists on a prohibition of prejudgment and reference to guilt before proven guilt by public authorities, to be particularly important.  Furthermore, important achievements are the elimination of the original part of the text, which was to allow in certain cases the twisting of the burden of proof and the principle in dubio pro reo, but also the expressed commitment to the protection of the right to silence. In addition, and also with regard to the rights of individuals and in particular with the right of presence, it is commendable that the amendments significantly strengthen the conditions for conducting proceedings and decision-making in cases where the person concerned is not present.

Likewise, this right is crucial to the fulfilment of the right to a fair trial granted by Article 6 of the 1953 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights I therefore believe that strengthening the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings will greatly contribute to the application of the right to a fair trial. The presumption of ineligency is also important, and the European Commission recognised this during a thorough review of the issue of non-compliance and concluded that a measure on certain aspects of the presumption of non-compliance is necessary to strengthen this fundamental right.  In February 2013, Croatia had a meeting with representatives of the ministries of justice of the European Union members specifically on the presumption of non-compliance and thus proved that it cares about human rights and their implementation. In my view, this directive would greatly strengthen the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings on which the Stockholm Programme has placed emphasis.

The presumption of innocence is a fundamental right and an essential principle that avoids arbitrariness and abuse in criminal proceedings. The principle of the presumption of innocence contains the right to remain silent, transfers the burden of proof to the prosecution and includes the principle of 'in dubio pro reo' (in doubt in favour of the accused). However, the right to be present at your own trial is a fundamental element of the presumption of innocence, which is currently protected in European law only in the context of the European arrest warrant and the Framework Decision on the recognition of the enforcement of criminal judgments handed down in absentia.

The proposal for personal protective equipment regulation aims to update the existing Council Directive 89/686/EEC and align it with the new legislative framework on product marketing.  What is important to point out is that regulation has a great ability to create a harmonised approach to the obligations of economic operators, improve cooperation between actors and common definitions, as well as transform the directive into regulation. Because the current directive does not allow lower or higher standards, significant practical implications will not arise from the change in instruments. It is important to mention that only fully efficient instruments can guarantee the safety of workers.

For these reasons, therefore, we feel that an objection to Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet state in Central Asia which certainly does not represent a problem in terms of potential competition with our production system and which, coincidentally, seems to be politically close to Putin's Russia, seems to be instrumental.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 944, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 I voted today in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Commission delegated regulation of 25 November 2015 amending Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 on the application of a generalised system of tariff preferences.

Mr. Taylor objected to a delegated act of the Commission. This delegated act relates to the regulation of baby food, when baby food starts to eat solid foods. The text merely clarified that food must now be labelled as \"not suitable for children under 4 months of age\".  Of course, breastfeeding is to be preferred, as long as the mother can, and I support any measure that allows for longer breastfeeding, but not all mothers can follow the recommendations of the World Health Organization: exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months. So we need drastic regulations on alternative foods, and immediately, to protect the health of our children. The regulations in place are already very restrictive and can be further improved.

I also note that the peace process in Colombia has been focused on the victims and not on the conflicting parties, a remarkable option for pioneering. Moreover, the agreement on the victims of the conflict signed in December 2015 is a key pillar of this peace process, a process that will be all the more resilient the stronger the role of civil society and a process aimed at ending violence in all its forms.

We are very pleased that you have accepted the invitation to talk to us about the Paris climate agreement. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen! On 12 December last year, a historic step was taken in Paris. For the first time, all the countries of the world have committed themselves to making the fight against climate change binding. 195 countries have agreed on clear and ambitious targets for climate protection. It is clear that success always has many fathers and mothers, so I would like to take this opportunity and on behalf of the European Parliament to thank all those who have worked for many years for the success of this Paris conference. I would like to thank Commissioner Caete, the Luxembourg Presidency and the entire EU negotiating team. But there is no doubt, Foreign Minister Fabius, as President of the climate conference, that you have played a huge part in the success of this summit. They succeeded with great diplomatic skill in reconciling the different interests of the participants. You have shown that the European Union can and wants to take a leading role in climate protection – we also believe that it must take action! For now, countries are also obliged to fulfil their commitments and to implement what has been agreed. I believe that it is indisputable, above all, here in this House, that we must keep our promise to the developing countries. The success of Paris shows that if we stand together, we can achieve a great deal. It is therefore a great honour for us, Minister, that you are with us today.

Mr President, Commissioner Caete, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank President Schulz very much for inviting me, as President of COP 21, to present to you the outlines of the agreement that was adopted on 12 December in Paris, and to speak to you as well, since I think that is what will interest you , next steps. 2015 was a difficult year all over the world, and especially for Europe. In this context, the Paris climate conference was a hope. It has allowed, which is rare, a gathering of all nations. It showed that diplomacy and multilateralism, under certain conditions, could achieve important results. I had the opportunity last October to set out, before your Committees on the Environment and Foreign Affairs, the criteria of what a good agreement would be in Paris. But at the time, we didn't know what the results would be. However, through the 29 articles contained in the Paris Agreement and the 140 points of the decision that accompanies it, these criteria of a good agreement have been met.  We have reached a universal agreement, which is based on national contributions from 187 countries, which is considerable. The agreement is recognized as ambitious; it includes, in the long term, limiting global warming to 2 degrees, as well as a commitment to continue efforts to reach 1.5 degrees and carbon neutrality in the second half of the century. It is a dynamic agreement; A five-year commitment review mechanism is planned, which is very important. A first meeting is set for 2023, but a review of efforts will take place as early as 2018, which will allow for a discussion for an increase in commitments. With regard to the monitoring of commitments, a common framework of transparency is defined, with so-called flexibilities based on the capabilities of each state.  The agreement is legally binding, as much as it could be given the political constraints of several states, and finally, the agreement is generally recognized as just; the concept of differentiation is spread across all subjects and solidarity among rich countries will take place towards the most vulnerable countries, including a commitment to meet and then exceed the target of $100 billion annually for vulnerable countries and to set a new target by 2025. In saying that, I summarize the economics of the main provisions. These results, which few people actually believed before the COP, owe much to the Europeans, as you said, President Schulz. This is particularly true with regard to the level of ambition of the agreement, and I would like to welcome, in particular, the commitment that was expressed in Mr Pargneaux's report here, entitled 'Towards a new international climate agreement in Paris', which you adopted in October 2015, before the conference. I would also like to salute, very amicably, the strong commitment of Commissioner Caete, with whom I must say, without compromising it, we have spent sleepless nights, and of the Luxembourg Presidency, in this case Minister Carole Dieschbourg, who has helped us enormously. I want to thank, of course, through you, each of your countries who has enabled this success. Beyond the agreement itself, COP 21 has allowed a significant number of non-governmental actors to be associated with the climate cause, for the first time on this scale. More than 5,000 cities, regions, businesses, investors and NGOs from 180 countries made commitments on this occasion. So there is the state sphere and there is the non-state aspect. Several ambitious projects, the impact of which is expected to be measured even before 2020, were launched at the conference. In the end, I think a shift dynamic has been set in motion towards low-carbon development; in my opinion, this dynamic is irreversible. The word \"historical\" is often used, a little wrongly and through, but, in this case, I believe that, for once, the word \"historical\" is not overused and that, in the indispensable fight against climate change, there will be a before Paris and after Paris. However, ladies and gentlemen, much remains of course to be done to clarify and implement this historic agreement.  2015, if I sum up, was the year of negotiations and decisions, and 2016 must be what I would gladly call the year of the four \"Ps\". What do I mean by that? The first \"P\" is the signing and ratification process. The opening of the agreement to the signing will take place on 22 April at the United Nations. You are certainly aware that at least 55 countries representing 55% greenhouse gas emissions must ratify the agreement for it to enter into force, and of course the maximum number of European and global leaders must be present on 22 April. The European Union was one of the first to publish its national contribution in March 2015, and I believe it must continue to lead by example by signing the Paris Agreement on 22 April and then ratifying it as soon as possible. The second \"P\" is the clarifications concerning both the Paris agreement and the decision attached to it. In December, principles were laid down, objectives defined; it is now a matter of agreeing on how to translate them into action. This will be the subject of the first meeting of the group in Bonn in Bonn in May to prepare the implementation decisions. In particular, as you will understand, we will have to come up with a common and precise definition of climate finance; we will have to determine the exact terms of what is called the five-year review of national commitments, and we will have to set rules for transparency in the follow-up of commitments. Of course, I will be present at these meetings. The third \"P\" refers to the pre-2020 period. Beyond the implementation of the agreement, which, I remind you, is scheduled to enter into force in 2020, follow-up on the action will be needed before 2020. This is called the Lima-Paris Action Plan, which brings together the initiatives of both states and non-governmental actors. What am I thinking? I am thinking, for example, of the International Solar Alliance, launched by the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Modi, which brings together almost all the countries between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. I am thinking of the \"mission innovation\", a public-private law initiative, launched with President Obama, Bill Gates and other investors for the development of clean technologies. I am thinking - and France has made its mark - on the generalisation of disaster early warning systems, the so-called CREWS system, and on the climate insurance system in vulnerable countries, on which Germany, in particular, has worked hard. I am also thinking about the protection of tropical forests and I would like to stress our financial commitments to renewable energy in Africa, which will have to be honoured quickly and completely. On all these concrete projects and on many others, significant progress will have to take place as early as 2016. The last \"P\" is the preparation of COP 22, which will take place in Marrakech at the end of 2016 and we will work there with our Moroccan friends in the same spirit that the Peruvians had worked with us to prepare the COP 21, in order to achieve this time a success in Marrakech in November. We will therefore hold with our Moroccan friends, and a whole series of international leaders, many informal and formal meetings, according to the method that has been successful in Paris. Beyond these four sets of actions, these four \"P's\", we will also have to move forward in the important sectors that were not covered by the Paris Agreement and for which action is essential: air transport, in particular, maritime transport and an agreement in principle that was reached by the parties to the Montreal Protocol to prepare, in 2016, an amendment to eliminate HFC refrigerants. , high emitters of greenhouse gases, and there, quick decisions will have to be taken. None of the negotiations I have just mentioned, which will take place in different frameworks, will be easy, but the success of Paris and the urgency of the necessary actions should enable us to achieve results also in these important areas. Ladies and gentlemen, in the promising context of the Paris Agreement, I am convinced, and I hope, that the European Union will continue its commitment to the preservation of our planet. In this regard, I think there are a number of initiatives that I believe is necessary. The first relates to the EU's ratification of the Doha amendment on commitments for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol. Only a few countries are missing; they would have to respond to that call. A second initiative will have to focus on the implementation by our Union of the commitments made in Paris for 2030 in terms of mitigation. Several negotiations await us, including the reform of the ETS carbon market and the sharing of effort in sectors outside the ETS , including buildings, transport and agriculture. It would be excellent if Parliament could make progress in its decision-making process, particularly for the first reading of the revision of the ETS Directive.  The European Energy Union project will also need to be seized to achieve the energy transition in Europe, with an emphasis on new jobs which can be created in this way, because , I stress, ecological transition is not only a constraint, it is also a major opportunity. Many texts will be put on the table by the Commission in 2016 in order to move forward on this ambitious project - I am thinking in particular of strengthening our commitments on renewable energy development or energy efficiency. Again, I am counting on the European Parliament to help us move forward quickly. Finally, we must strengthen our European action for sustainable development among our partners in the South. The European Union, which is already, I recall, the leading donor in the field of climate, will have to continue and, if possible, increase its support for these countries in terms of finances, technology and expertise. In total, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Paris conference is therefore unquestionably a success in the fight against climate change, even if it is obviously not the end point. Action will therefore have to continue and the European Union will assume a major responsibility. In the work to come, your Parliament will play a singular role in carrying out all the European ambition.  Finally, Mr President, my last words will be to underline a point which is not often recalled and which I consider essential. The Paris Agreement is not just about climate in the narrow sense; it will serve the environment in general, biodiversity, public health, food security and, more broadly, development. But it is also, and I insist, an agreement for security and peace. Let's be very careful at this point. Food and water scarcity, the risk of mass migration of populations caused by the consequences of global warming, the threat of conflicts linked to the control of fossil resources: uncontrolled climate change would ultimately lead to widespread conflicts. By refusing, as you did in Paris, this drift, by directing the world towards renewable and decarbonised energies, the agreement of 12 December, to which you have contributed mightily, is therefore working for the present and future generations. In our certainly chaotic, dangerous and uncertain world, this contribution to international security is a major component of the Paris Agreement, where Europe has taken and will take its full share.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "S"}, {"id": 1299, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I would also like to warmly congratulate the French Foreign Minister, Mr Laurent Fabius! Their conduct of negotiations was one of the important points, one of the key points that led to a successful agreement in Paris. You have done that really well and you have thrown all your energy and your political weight into this matter. But I would also like to thank you personally and you, Mr President, for thanking Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete. And I am pleased that even my green colleague, Bas Eickhout, in this Chamber in December could not help but praise Miguel Arias Caete. I think back to the time when we had to deal with it. The Commissioner is doing a good job and has done a good job, especially before Paris and Paris. I agree with you, Foreign Minister: this agreement is not only important for climate protection, but it is a very important sign in these troubled times, in this difficult year 2015. The world is uneasy, and we have managed to reach an agreement in which some countries that are at war against each other have made a joint commitment. That is a value in itself. More than 190 countries have made a concrete commitment to how to reduce greenhouse gases, and we have the long-term goal of carbon neutrality. All this is a major breakthrough. However, I am a little sceptical about this 1.5 degree target. If we are honest, we do not even have enough commitments to reach the 2 degrees in the commitments made by the individual states in Paris. I would have liked us to really bring this to the point where we reach 2 degrees and for us to be sure of that before we talk about tightening up. We were right to point out that there is a lot to be done on the subject of air transport and maritime transport. Europe, in particular Parliament, would have liked us to settle this clearly in Paris and to give a mandate to the ICAO and the IMO. It is a pity that this has not been achieved. But I think it is right that you mentioned that something needs to be done in these sectors. I would like to ask you personally to point out in your government, as we do in other governments, including the country I know best, that there is legislation in Europe. And if the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is unable to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases – reduction, not just stabilization – then our legislation, including for international air traffic, will come back into force. And this time we have to be credible. It is not acceptable for all sectors to have to implement some very drastic targets – I have spoken to the steel industry again today, for which it is really very, very ambitious – and for other sectors not to be covered. I believe that we must achieve fair – ambitious but fairer – implementation here, so that we do not place too much strain on individual sectors. With this in mind, we want to work together on implementation. I look forward to it.

Mr President, let me congratulate Mr Fabius in the name of the whole group for the excellent work he has done as the French Presidency. Mr Fabius, the way you prepared the COP21, the way you managed it, was brilliant and outstanding and there was a result. So, thank you so much.  But let me thank you too, Mr Commissioner. The Commission also took a very important role. You managed to keep ambitions high, you were building bridges towards the different coalitions who negotiated and you supported the French Presidency, and maybe the combination of the two of you made the agreement happen. It cannot be overestimated how important that is. For the very first time, in Paris nearly all states all over the world – developing countries and emerging economies – have committed themselves to taking the necessary measures to tackle climate change. In that sense, Paris is the very first universal agreement, and that is crucial and of crucial importance for the future.  As you mentioned yourself, Mr Fabius, 2015 was on its way to becoming an annus horribilis with the problems in the war in the Middle East, Ukraine, the refugee crisis and, of course, the attacks in Paris. These events made the world look divided, and made Europe look divided. The climate agreement in that sense is a game changer and a reason to become at least a little bit optimistic about the future, and Paris – the city of lights – has also become the city of hope. That is very encouraging. However, not everything was a success, we have to admit that. One of the most striking examples is the international aviation and shipping industry. We all know that they stand for a lot of emissions: the emissions of these two sectors, for instance, can be compared with the emissions of South Korea and Germany put together, and these are rising. In the years to come, by 2050, they will rise by 270% and we have to admit that we failed in that we could not include that in the agreement. So, my additional question to both of you is this: how will we deal with that in the next year to come? How will we make sure that these two very important sectors will be part of future implementation? On the level of agreement – and here I do not agree with my colleague from the PPE – I think that agreement on 2°C decreasing to 1.5°C is very important and that, if we want, we can achieve that. But then, that will mean that we cannot lean back. We cannot lean back in Europe either. We have a good agreement, but it is this just on paper. If we want to succeed, we need to implement it and that means – I am looking to the Commissioner in particular – more ambitious targets than we have had up until now.  We had targets for 2030 and 2050. We have to admit that we took the lower end of these targets when the IPCC made the calculations. We said 80% for 2050. We should go now to the higher end, and make sure that our emissions go down 95% by 2050. So we need to look to the world, but we can only look to the world if we take our own responsibilities. I am looking to the Commission again: when can we see further developments in that sense? That needs to be done prior to the finalisation of the revision of the current legislation, for example, as mentioned, before the ETS.  Let me conclude by addressing you again, Mr Fabius, as a final remark. We are very grateful for the work you have done. As I said before, there is a lot of work in front of us and you are not only the President of the COP21 but also the Foreign Minister of a very important Member State, so you now have the moral duty – together with all of us, of course – to take up that responsibility, and we are counting on you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1301, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Ian DUNCAN", "mepid": "124960", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, it was a hell of a result. An extraordinary result emerged from Paris.

It is truly a historic agreement that gave a clear signal that the world is, in an irreversible way, going towards a low carbon economy. Although I do agree with all those who say that Paris was just an agreement on paper, we should not underestimate the value of paper. We needed this paper agreement in order to come to the real action on the ground. Talking about action, just like Peter Liese, I would like to emphasise that we do need to do more than we agreed upon in Paris, not only to stay below the 2°C but – even more importantly – to come near the 1.5°C.  And talking about actions, I would like to concentrate on the EU actions. We do have the EU policies in place, but are they sufficient, given the Paris agreement? What about carbon leakage? The idea of carbon leakage is based on the assumption that the rest of the world is not doing what we are doing. That is going to change now. So what are we going to do about carbon leakage now? What about the 2020, 2030 and 2050 targets, given the 1.5°C benchmark? I am really looking forward to the comments from Minister Fabius on whether he believes that the EU should step up its efforts. Finally, I would like to talk about competitiveness because, if the Paris agreement made one thing clear to our economy, it is that low carbon will be more competitive than high carbon and that is a very crucial notion. To give you one example, we had a historic moment this week at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, where one company that is leading in sustainability, Unilever, for the first time in history became more valuable than a company that it is not seen as one of those leaders, Royal Dutch Shell. It was a really historic moment which I believe was much more than a coincidence. Talking about competitiveness, Minister Fabius, I am slightly concerned here because Europe is falling behind in its investment in clean technology. So my clear question to you is: do you believe that, in order to safeguard European competitiveness, we should step up our efforts towards a low carbon economy in Europe?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1303, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Anne-Marie MINEUR", "mepid": "125037", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Minister Fabius, thank you very much for coming to Strasbourg. I have not had the opportunity to congratulate you on the outcome of the Paris climate conference last month. That's what I'd like to do with this one.  You probably know the lyrics to a Billie Holiday song \"The difficult will do right now, the impossible may take a little while\". That ruling applies here too. The hard is done, now it's the impossible's turn. And there's a lot to do. Europe must show more ambition. We must definitely move away from fossil fuels and switch to alternative, sustainable energy sources. We need to be more sensible and economical with our energy. Isolating homes would be a good start on the part of the Member States and it would also do a lot of work. The low oil price is a good reason for countries to abolish fossil energy subsidies, you said in Le Monde last week. I wholeheartedly support that proposal.  But let us be honest, it will not come from the Dutch Presidency. I asked State Secretary Sharon Dijksma last week what they are going to do to implement the climate agreement, but she refused to go into it. This morning we have heard our Prime Minister Mark Rutte and he only wants to develop the internal market. Now there is nothing against the development of technological development, as you yourself suggest, but we cannot count on it. Europe must show leadership and radically focus on renewable energy and increase its ambitions.  Your presidency of the Conference of Parties will last until the next conference in Marrakech in 2016 and I would like to call on you to help achieve the impossible. 2015 was the year of negotiations and decisions, you said, also in Le Monde. 2016 should be the year of implementation and action.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, thank you for being there. Basically, you should have been there as a guest - I think - in the middle of the votes, when the plenary is present as a whole, as this subject is important and deserves to be debated before all parliamentarians. Everyone has legitimately congratulated you and your team for the great work that has been done in Paris. I hope that you will be able to pass on to the following presidencies the quality of the work and the way in which you have worked, because I believe that you have also reinvented a form of presidency of the COP. It is often said that you were hesitant at first when it came to France proposing its candidacy. I am absolutely convinced today that you have had one of the highlights of your career. So, of course, COP 21, with its goal of getting closer to 1.5oC, requires us to get out of fossil fuels. This agreement is of a weak constraint, let us acknowledge. We will see, yes, how we will build the implementation modalities, but that is a weak constraint. Basically, this is necessarily based on virtuous circles that will take us from today's 3oC - which reflects the reality of the commitments of states, namely climate chaos - to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  But to have these virtuous circles, everyone has to get on with it. So today, the conditions are favourable as they have never been. We see how renewable energy - for example, photovoltaic or onshore wind - is more competitive than oil, gas, nuclear and soon coal. But at the same time, when we look at the latest figures on investments in renewable energy, we see that all regions of the world are making progress in terms of investment in renewable energy, except Europe, and in particular because of France, where investment was cut in half in 2015, when they were growing everywhere. Then, when we listened to this morning's debate, in the presentation of the Presidency's programme, there was only one sentence on climate, Minister, a single sentence on climate! If that is the mood in the Council on the climate issue, I fear that, at the end of the day, this virtuous circle between States, businesses, local authorities and NGOs is not taking place. So you have a huge responsibility, as does the Commissioner, to change the mood in the Council. We have an important meeting: the summit meeting with the Council. To apply to go towards 1.5 degrees Celsius , and the Commissioner is well aware of that - is to change our targets in 2020, because, in any case, we are beyond the targets set. But in 2030, it means purging the carbon market, it's changing the goal of renewable energy as energy savings. And now you have a responsibility, or the Council will not move. Finally, one last request, Mr Fabius, please. We see this incredible movement in divestment. So can France take the initiative of an international conference involving the major players in finance, banks and institutions on divestment, in the run-up to Marrakech? Take this initiative on behalf of France, and we will continue the movement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 1305, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Marco AFFRONTE", "mepid": "124797", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Minister for being here and also for the work you have done in Paris, which we have all appreciated. The agreement is necessarily a compromise, because 195 countries were sitting around the table, so it could not be otherwise. Like any compromise, it has positive points, which have already been mentioned by you and my fellow Members, and others negative, on which I would like to focus on some of them. It is disappointing, for example, that the word decarbonisation disappears: our goal was to stop emitting, but instead we find ourselves with a definition that is a little ambiguous because it says it achieves a balance between anthropogenic emissions and removal through greenhouse gas sources. We are talking about negative emission technology, which, if anything, would balance the positive ones that therefore clearly remain. We have created an alibi and it is an alibi for advanced technologies and huge land use.  In the scenario of the agreement these technologies are absolutely crucial, but they are currently in a very experimental, very expensive state and we do not know if they work, at the moment they do not work everywhere. I would now like to ask you specifically, what is the real capacity to implement these negative-emission technologies on a very large scale and what measures will governments take to facilitate this process? Another point is the market, the ETS. It is a system that we believe is not working, it has failed to stimulate investment in new technologies to reduce emissions, and this has led to fraud and financial speculation. The establishment of a global market, as called for in the Paris Agreement, worries us even more about the delay it would cause in the implementation of other policies that have had a greater impact on ETS in the European Union, such as incentive tariffs for renewable sources and energy saving and efficiency measures.  Finally, we must close a gap between the perception of reality and reality itself, otherwise we will be implementing the changes too slowly. Article 12 of the agreement is good and we welcome it, but it must be implemented decisively and precise messages are needed that are proportionate to the problems. They are needed now and, above all, they must be directed at citizens and local authorities, so that we work hard at this level too.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your comments, your questions. I thank those who intervened, those who did not intervene. I was going to tell you, Mr President, that having heard what I heard, I am ready to come every day, because it was a real bed of roses. More seriously, I will return to the compliments you have given to Commissioner Caete: they are justified. With regard to French diplomacy, I will be a little more nuanced, but I will keep that for the end. On the other hand, first of all, many of you have come back to the question of 1.5 and 2 degrees and the ambition which is, I think, remarkable and which is recognized by everyone in this agreement. I must admit that we might not have agreed, because after all, the previous conferences did not give an example of perfect success, as they say at the Quai d'Orsay. But the main risk, at least the risk I identified, was that we would agree, but on a minimum ambition - and we've often talked about it, you remember. But we have to be honest: not everything is settled. That said, the success of Paris, basically, is to have reached an agreement between 195 countries without any opposition - and people were free - on content that is very ambitious. And that's where the notion of 2 and 1.5 degrees comes in. You have seen, and this has given rise to lengthy discussions, that the drafting is not exactly the same for the 2 and 1.5 degrees. For the 2 degrees, it was already not easy to get; I remember, having replaced President Hollande at the G20, that I had already had a hard time getting the 2 degrees. And then what happened? There has been a kind of dynamic of international conferences that advocates multilateralism. There have been extremely strong interventions from, in particular, the small islands, their representatives, who have said that, of course, the 2 degrees is fine, but if you do not write 1.5 degrees and if you do not make the arrangements to go to 1.5 degrees, you are implicitly saying that we, we no longer exist. It is not simply the question of whether we can live well or not: we will be covered, we will no longer be able to exist. This argument was so strong that it convinced countries that were not spontaneously in favour of the 1.5 degree. I will express myself with my hands. Today, when we sum up all the NPCs, we are on the 3-degree trajectory, we have to be honest. What we are talking about, through the Paris Agreement and now the subsequent decisions, since all this is on a fairly long horizon, is to go from a trajectory of 3 degrees to a trajectory of 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees. And that requires a whole series of concrete actions and a point that many of you have highlighted, namely technological innovations and major investments. Initially, I was not the world's leading expert on these issues, I have to make a confession, but hey, I'm a hard-working mind, so I immersed myself in the subject. I am absolutely convinced that there will be major technological changes that will make the financial hierarchy of energies quite different from what it is today. As many of you have already pointed out, in some cases renewable energy is already much cheaper, when you sum up the direct and indirect costs, than highly polluting energies such as coal. We will go more and more in that direction. The ambition of the agreement and its universal character, therefore, were not contradictory, but they were complementary, and this is one of the great successes of Paris. Second, many of you have rightly come back to the air and sea sectors in international transportation. Then, there, too, I'll be square. There were several parties, including the European Union, who wanted us to mention international transport in the agreement. But you know the mechanism, which is the mechanism of consensus. It soon became apparent that this point was met with strong opposition - let's call it by name - from several emerging and Gulf countries, and therefore consensus was not possible. This is absolutely no impedoful of ICAO and IMO, the two international organizations responsible for this matter, taking steps in this direction. Europe, the presidency of COP 21 and all those who are of good will will mobilise in this direction this year. ICAO has set a target of reaching an agreement by September 2016 to stabilize emissions from the aviation sector after 2020, and why not to lower them. The European Union, if I can give a feeling, must be at the forefront of this issue and promote compromises well in advance.  As far as the maritime sector is concerned, the discussions, let us acknowledge, are less advanced, but compliance with the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement means that negotiations are opened without delay in the case of IMO. Firstly, it seems to me that the EU will have to encourage recognition of emissions levels in the maritime sector and the establishment of a system for measuring global emissions in this sector. But you are absolutely right, because it represents significant greenhouse gas emissions, this year significant progress must be made in these two areas. Thirdly, many of you have intervened, and you are absolutely right, on low carbon issues, a lot of carbon, competitiveness, etc. It's absolutely central. There is no opposition between greenhouse gas emissions on the one hand and competitiveness or employment requirements on the other. Of course, we need transformations, we need accompanying measures, but, again, I am absolutely convinced that competitiveness, not only for countries like ours, but also at the global level, must be combined with downward-carbon progress, and that is where we join the question - I think it was Mr Jadot who asked it - divestment or investment. Yes, you have already seen that, apart from public investment, which is very important and essential, in the private sector, there is a shift that is taking place, and so much the better; we need to be able to speed it up. First, it seems to me, that countries should gradually reduce fossil fuel subsidies. This principle, I remind you, was set by the European Council in May 2013 and France had argued for an ambitious position, for example, in the framework of export credits for coal-fired power plants. This movement has to be general and, I was going to say, let us take advantage of the fact that oil prices are low. You know the numbers: we are talking about the $100 billion that we, as rich countries, have to allocate to poor countries for climate, but the money that is spent on fossil fuel subsidies exceeds 500 billion a year; so we have the orders of magnitude in mind. Then, to answer Mr. Jadot, we must encourage private sector players not to invest, or even to disinvest, in highly carbon-intensive sectors and, as of COP 21, this is a movement that we are seeing: the first sovereign wealth fund, which is a Norwegian fund, has given instructions that there will be divestitures in this sector, to the point that the Governor of the Central Bank of England believes that the next financial bubble could well occur in the carbon sector, because we will realize that this sector, of course, is going to have difficulties, whereas massive investments have been made there. I think that, as far as the private sector is concerned, central bankers and credit rating agencies can now systematically take climate risk into account and make the publication of the carbon footprint mandatory: these are measures that are not beyond our reach and would be extremely useful. However, in parallel with this trend towards divestment, there is a need to maintain a constant effort to invest in renewable energy; the needs are immense. The European Union has instruments: the Juncker Plan, the Structural Funds, EIB projects etc., which I believe can and should be mobilised. You have a European Council in March and, on this occasion, I believe that the Commission will take stock of the assessment for the implementation of the Paris agreement. These are really directions we can go. Finally, the last point - and I do not want to be too long - will be about the compliments, I cannot find any other words, which you have said about the French Presidency. I have already told you that, with regard to the European Union, the role of Commissioner Caete and that of the Luxembourg Presidency, I have no reservations. On the other hand, with regard to French diplomacy, even if it, through me, has blushed when listening to you, especially since our modesty is known to all, in fact, I was thinking about it, our role and mine, was simply to promote, and translate diplomatically, a quite remarkable alignment of the planets.  The first planet was the planet itself. 2015 was the warmest year on record, with considerable disasters and an awareness of the part of the public, and this disastrous situation has, if I may say so, a good side: it has made it even more obvious that there must be an agreement, and this has fostered an awareness. The first planet, then, which is ours, is an element of alignment.  The second planet - I really want to pay tribute to him - is the scientific planet. I want to pay tribute here to the remarkable work of scientists, and in particular to the work of the IPCC, which established the indisputable nature of warming and quantified threats. When we were having public meetings 5, 10 years ago, etc., half of the meeting was about whether or not there was climate change and the second part of the meeting was about whether it was due to human action. Now I am not saying that these debates have completely disappeared, but they have largely disappeared, at least in many of our countries, and that is thanks to the work of scientists. This scientific planet has helped us a lot. The third planet is the planet I will call political-societal. There have been major countries emitting greenhouse gases that have taken very strong positions: China, the largest emitter which, for obvious reasons, which are practical, economic, societal and social reasons, played a very important role, President Obama, who has committed strongly and, of course, the European Union, and other countries still , but it allowed there to be, in accompaniment, a very strong evolution of the economic circles, the commitment of the municipalities, the commitment of the regions, the commitment of NGOs, the commitment of great spiritual and religious voices, and this is all this, this planet that I call political-social, which is a completely new element, which has made the Paris conference obviously presented itself in circumstances quite different from those of the famous Copenhagen conference. And finally, the fourth planet is the diplomatic planet. Our task has been, with all countries, and particularly with the European Union, to promote convergence and to translate all this into an international agreement, with its 29 articles and 140 decision points.  I am often asked: but the work of diplomat, etc. I say, with a little humor, that I do not fully understand the reasons for this success, but that I prefer not to understand the reasons for a success, rather than having brilliant explanations to explain a failure, but once I have said that, basically, when I look back a little bit at the work we have done, it is a bit of a sculptor's job. You know, the sculptor takes blocks of clay, he first takes the main blocks, which were China, the United States, Europe, India, and you had to aggregate all these blocks and then give them some shape. Then there are the smaller blocks, which are also needed because, without consensus, there is no agreement. We had to give shape to all of this, but without losing any of these blocks and, ultimately, that is the work we did in a spirit of transparency, of trust, that was underlined. At the end of this show - later, I will give a small hammer to Mr Schulz, who has become the most famous hammer - and it is quite rare in international conferences, everyone kissed. But it was not something agreed upon; we had the feeling that in a world really very hard, very dangerous, very complicated and very uncertain, for one of the first times, thanks to the work of all, there was really something that would allow not only the current generation, but future generations, to live better. As has been pointed out, of course, these are circumstances that one does not always encounter politically in one's life, so thank you all for making this possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 6, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "S"}, {"id": 1309, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The identification of the impact of industrial society on climate change is not recent. In 1957, oceanographer Roger Revelle pointed out that we are subjecting the planet to a large-scale geophysical experience never tested and impossible to repeat. Basically, industrial society began to release into the atmosphere, in a very short period of time, the carbon sequestered by forests for millions of years and which was the guarantor of life on the planet. Something very wrong was happening. But in a business-based society, the political discourse of denial has blocked the need for change.

Let us face it, Yemen is too much of a neglected, even forgotten, crisis. It is absolutely necessary that we devote attention to what has been described as a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions, surpassing all others when measured by the number of people in need of immediate assistance. In spite of repeated international condemnation, we are witnessing continuous disregard for the very basic principles of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Civilians and civilian infrastructures are being targeted by all parties to the conflict on an almost daily basis. We are particularly concerned by the recent attacks on Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Their facilities in Yemen have been attacked, leading to casualties which are yet another example of the violations of international law that occur during this war. The intensity of the humanitarian crisis is constantly on the rise. Humanitarian organisations estimate that 21.2 million Yemeni people – that is 82% of the total population – are in need of humanitarian assistance; 14.4 million are suffering from food insecurity; 14.1 million are in need of health care and 19.3 million lack access to water and sanitation.  The European Union has been actively contributing to efforts aimed at resolving the current conflict and restoring basic rights for ordinary Yemenis. We are doing so on several tracks. On the humanitarian front, the Commission increased its emergency assistance for Yemen by EUR 17 million in December, bringing the total amount of Commission support in the crisis to EUR 52 million for 2015. Some Member States already contribute to emergency and humanitarian assistance and more will follow. The funding benefits the most vulnerable people, including internally displaced persons, refugees, migrants trapped in Yemen and those affected by the pre-existing nutrition and food crisis, all of whose situations have deteriorated due to the conflict. The European Union will continue to call on all parties to allow access for delivery of humanitarian aid. However, the level of humanitarian funding is only one aspect of the problem. We know this. With a population dependent on imports for 90% of its basic needs, the lifting of all restrictions on commercial imports is equally important. In this respect the European Union is working very closely with the United Nations and other partners to expedite the implementation of the United Nations verification and inspection mechanism to allow the flow of humanitarian and commercial goods into Yemen, to which it is contributing EUR 2 million. The second track is political. The escalation of hostilities in the second half of 2014, and more prominently since March 2015, has gravely obstructed the achievements and the implementation of the Yemeni transition and have left the country on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. The European Union, as stated in the conclusions of 20 April and 16 November 2015, strongly believes that the solution to this crisis must be a political one. Achieving an inclusive political settlement, fully in line with the framework provided by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions is the only sustainable way to alleviate the plight of the Yemeni people. After United Nations facilitated talks in Geneva in June, a second round was held in Bern, Switzerland in December 2015. The European Union is closely coordinating with the United Nations to continue playing a helpful role with the parties to ensure that the third meeting can take place in the coming days.  The conflict has now involved a number of regional players. We encourage all relevant actors to play a positive role towards a lasting political solution of the crisis. One of the main concerns of the European Union remains the implementation of immediate steps leading to a durable ceasefire. Previous ceasefires have failed to take hold due to multiple violations by the parties and it is crucial that the parties implement confidence-building measures, including the full respect of international human rights and humanitarian law and the release of political prisoners. Permanent access for humanitarian and emergency assistance to reach the suffering population, in particular in the city of Taiz, but also in Saada and other affected regions, must be guaranteed.  In Yemen’s dramatic situation, ensuring accountability for violations is an important part of the process to achieve a lasting settlement in the current conflict. The United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a compromise resolution on 2 October 2015 on technical assistance and capacity building for Yemen in the field of human rights, which sets the conditions for a national commission of inquiry, which the EU expects to work independently. I reiterate our call for the independent investigation of all alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The European Union looks forward to the High Commissioner’s oral update at the Council’s 31st session and to a comprehensive written report during its 33rd session.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 1314, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Yemen is a threefold emergency: humanitarian, security and political. On the humanitarian front, first of all, the situation in Yemen, after less than a year of conflict, is almost worse than that of Syria after five years. It is one of the most serious humanitarian crises at present, according to the United Nations. The current political commitment, however, does not reflect this. We must call on Member States and the rest of the international community to contribute more to the revised humanitarian response plan. I would add that we must be careful that humanitarian aid is impartial towards civilians who are victims of this civil war. From a security point of view, we know that the threat is twofold. The vacuum left by a failed state and this civil war is already exploited by al-Qaeda and Daesh. Moreover, the real risk, as I have already said, is the extension and junction of several areas of instability and insecurity. Yemen is like a link between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. Let us anticipate this danger even further beyond the emergency humanitarian aid that the Union has provided to Somalia and Djibouti. Finally, politically, the European Union has a full role to play. I have two points: on the one hand, we must support the efforts of the United Nations to get the negotiations started, and do more to keep Yemen on the agenda. On the other hand, from a medium- and long-term perspective, let us invest even more in strengthening our political relations with the Gulf and Arab League countries to build a partnership.

The EU and its Member States have given much money in aid, with my own country, the UK, having invested some GBP 250 million in aid over the last five years.

Prime Minister Cameron this week said: ‘We are trying to do everything we can to make sure that the work done by Saudi Arabia is properly targeted’. Well, obviously this is not working. It is a disgrace that your proposals – and by this I mean those of the Dutch Government, to have an inquiry into the war crimes perpetrated in Yemen through the UN – were actively boycotted by Saudi Arabia, and also that France and the UK did not support the Netherlands. The EU, if it wants to be strong, needs a common position. In the Committee on Foreign Affairs you spoke of exporting stability which I believe is a noble goal, but it should start by the EU seeking to end the export of weapons to Saudi Arabia. I would like to ask you whether you are willing to work towards an embargo in the Council, at least of bombs, fighter jets and combat helicopters, and whether you are willing to pressure anyone who may be using cluster bombs, which are disproportionate and are allegedly used in Yemen. I want to ask whether you agree that the violence in Yemen underlines the need for the EU to review its relationship with Saudi Arabia and actually make it more even-handed with the relationship we have with the Islamic Republic of Iran. After the nuclear deal, there is room to engage that country also with regard to ending the violence in Yemen.

The Houthi rebels receive weapons from Iran. Saudi Arabia intervenes directly with its air force. Both camps violate international law.

I think this is a very important statement because we cannot be only observers, and we are not only observers. The present situation in Yemen – I think all of you have mentioned that this afternoon – is of very deep concern to all members of the Council, and I am very glad to speak on behalf of Federica Mogherini, the High Representative, on this issue. Let me just say on a personal note, I have been to Yemen a lot. Yemen was a country where we had a ‘pre-announced’ crisis: a high population growth rate, ecological disasters, a very difficult environment and bad governance, and that combination has led, especially in the region that Yemen finds itself in, to the crisis we are seeing now. It is a catastrophic situation. All the humanitarian actors have described the humanitarian situation as catastrophic – you did, and all of us are extremely concerned. So the question is then, are we observers or not? Let me say that the proactive role, also of the High Representative, is that we are one of the few actors who can speak to all parties and can engage. I think this is important specifically since the humanitarian crisis can only be resolved if it is also in line with progress on a political solution. I think many of you have said that this afternoon, and I can quote many of the people who have spoken this afternoon that this is actually the key issue that we are faced with. Of course, this also concerns issues of human rights. Now the United Nations Human Rights Council – and obviously I am not speaking here in a national position, I have my views as a member of the Dutch Government on this – adopted a compromise resolution – yes, a compromise resolution – on 2 October 2015 which sets out the conditions for a national commission of inquiry which the EU expects to work independently. I want to underline that again here today. I reiterate our call for the independent investigation of all alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and the European Union will therefore also actively follow and expect the High Commissioner’s update at the upcoming Council session, and obviously also a comprehensive written report on this in the future. That is very important. Many of you have raised not only the issue of the humanitarian situation, but also the respect for international humanitarian law. We are aware and concerned by what seems to be credible reports on the use of cluster munitions in populated areas. And we also note – and I think this is important, you asked about investigations – we note with satisfaction that the High Commissioner for Human Rights has seized this matter immediately and will closely follow OHCHR’s investigation into this matter. On the issue of arms, as you know at the moment an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia is not a response to the region’s current challenges, but it is important that the issue concerning common position 2008/944 of the CFSP will be discussed in the Council working group on conventional arms exports, chaired by the EEAS. Many of you asked, obviously, about the regional aspect of all these issues, including on the role of the tension with Saudi Arabia, and to what extent this spat has an impact on Yemen’s UN-facilitated talks. Well, first of all, it should not. It should not. All the international community and all the main regional actors are already actively working, including the High Representative, to support the talks regarding the situation in Yemen, and they must be maintained. Every effort should be made to avoid jeopardising these talks, and I hope also there will be some progress in the coming days. We expect that the process and the meetings can happen, although recent indications tell us that the timing may slip, and early February seems likely now. We fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, who has been relentlessly travelling to the region and to Yemen to ensure that this is possible. We are comforted by the declarations of the Government of Yemen and the Saudi authorities regarding their commitment – and this is important – to these negotiations, and expect that they will proceed with the aim of implementing a sustainable ceasefire and confidence-building steps leading to the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216. On the issue of Médecins Sans Frontières, this is also an issue that for very good reasons is being raised by the members of the European Parliament. We have seen more attacks on MSF in recent weeks and months in various places around the world, and of course that needs investigation. I also expect the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on this in the coming discussions that I have mentioned. The question was whether we are reaching out to Tehran: yes, we are. Iran has been politically supportive of the Houthi movement, and it is our hope that it will now positively use its privileged contacts with that group to promote a peaceful settlement. Iran is an important regional player – I could go into all the details, but we discussed this last night – but the EU encourages and is also in a position to talk to the parties, to encourage the Iranian authorities to play a constructive role towards lasting political settlement in the region, including in Yemen because this is absolutely crucial. Some of you mentioned, correctly, that if that does not happen then obviously it is only ISIS and other groups of an extremist nature that will profit from that. I would like to thank you very much, Madam President, for giving me the possibility to talk about Yemen. I feel that this is not only very urgent, if you look at the number of people who are in extreme distress, but it requires all the political attention that you have given it this afternoon. We have learned the hard way that instability in the wider Gulf and Middle East region can have a direct impact also on our own stability and security. This crisis will not only come to an end through an inclusive political settlement, but we will have a physical and social reconstruction of the country. If you go to Sana'a even today you will see the destruction of the old parts of the city. It is an enormous task which no government can bear alone, so I am sure that massive international support will be necessary. In any case, the European Union intends to continue engaging its Member States and partners in the region towards a concerted, coordinated and strategic approach by the international community and the Government of Yemen to the country’s reconstruction, and stands ready to play its part in efforts for the benefit of all Yemenis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1334, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "   Thank you, Minister, also for your detailed explanations.

The continued deterioration of the overall security situation in the south-east of Turkey is extremely disquieting. The EU has repeatedly expressed its concerns about the situation, including in its latest statements of 22 December and then recently on 16 January, and is following developments closely. Some of the political problems on both sides have also been exacerbated by the current crisis, including the threat from Daesh, as demonstrated by the latest attack in Istanbul on 12 January and the attacks last year in Suruç and Ankara. However, a stable south-east is important, not just for Turkey from a political, economic and security perspective, but for the European Union and the wider region as well. We absolutely need to preserve the political space which we have worked hard to create so that a transition can start in Syria. The only possible and effective response is to deal with the conflicts that we have in our region in a united way. This will be the best way to effectively counter and defeat Daesh on the ground. We must be very careful not to allow the breakdown of the Kurdish peace process and fuel further tensions in the southeast. In all our interactions with Turkey, we continue to urge all parties to guarantee the rule of law in the country and to call for an immediate ceasefire and an urgent return to the Kurdish peace process. The high-level political dialogue on 25 January 2016 will be another opportunity to raise these issues.  Important progress has been made over the past two years, and this should not be thrown away. The peace process remains the best opportunity in a generation to solve a conflict that has claimed far too many lives. We have also been clear that the PKK must cease its attacks against Turkey. It must stop declaring autonomous districts within the south-east and re-engage in political dialogue. Resuming talks and negotiations within the peace process is the only way forward.  We will continue to reassure Turkey that the European Union takes the PKK threat very seriously, and that the EU Member States have also acted robustly against the PKK. The PKK has been a listed organisation for the purposes of fuel sanctions since 2002. The Council unanimously endorsed this decision in March 2015, and it will remain so for the foreseeable future. However, while I recognise Turkey’s legitimate right to defend itself against the PKK, we have also emphasised –and will continue to emphasise – in our dialogue with the Turkish authorities, that measures taken against the PKK must be proportionate, targeted and should not endanger the democratic political dialogue. The measures currently being taken by security services in the south-east, which includes the use of long-lasting curfews, have resulted in extreme disruptions to essential services such as healthcare and means of communication. The proportionality and legality of such operations must be ensured, and should comply with international human rights standards. Some of the sensitivities have existed for decades, and it will require real courage from all parties to address these long-standing and deeply-felt issues.  The Commission will work with the new government on all reforms in the areas of the rule of law and fundamental rights, freedom of religion and expression. I look forward very much to hearing the views of the honourable Members of Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 1338, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has What is the reality in the Turkish south-east?

Since the fighting between the PKK and the state security forces restarted this summer, the situation on the ground is deteriorating still further. Imagine living in the Silopi, Cizre or Sur districts. Most people left their houses in a hurry when an open-ended, round-the-clock curfew was declared in early December. At that time, more than 200 000 people had to flee. Heavy fighting is going on day and night between the security forces and the PKK youth militias who have built barricades and dug trenches in the middle of these neighbourhoods. The anti-terrorism operations heavily affect the civilian population: not being able to leave your house for more than 40 days; so-called Esedullah forces who intimidate the local population; and an increasing number of civilian deaths, including of children and elderly people. How is it possible that a 16-year-old boy can bleed to death on the streets without receiving any medical aid? The attacks by the PKK last week killing police officers and their family members can in no way be justified, but why are there crackdowns on peaceful protesters? In this regard, I am also gravely concerned about the intimidation and prosecution of more than 1 000 academics who signed a petition calling for peace. How can reasonable people calling for the violence to stop be labelled traitors and promoters of terrorism? The right of Turkey to fight against terrorism is not questioned here today.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for The situation in south-eastern Turkey is terrible, as you have rightly described here, it really resembles a war zone. There is much that can be blamed on the Turkish Government in this context. What cannot be blamed on her is that she has started this conflict. On 22 July 2015, the PKK ended the ceasefire and the peace process by killing two Turkish policemen in their car. That was the beginning of the argument. What the PKK has completely misjudged is that the Turkish Government in Ankara and the Turkish armed forces were almost grateful for this opportunity to re-inflame a conflict which , and Here I fully agree with Mr Demesmaeker – is of course appropriate for an increasingly authoritarian style of government by Mr Erdogan. This attack on the two policemen took place between the two rounds of elections in Turkey last year, and the AKP wanted to regain its absolute majority, which it had lost in June, in the autumn. That is exactly what she has succeeded in doing. Since then, this conflict has entered the way it is now. Of course, the peace process must be revived and, of course, the PKK must realise that it can never defeat Turkey militarily. Their gains in Syria, along with the PYD, the Democratic Union Party, may underscore the illusion that it can achieve something in southeastern Turkey by military means. That is nonsense! It will only work politically. And it is high time for the PKK to understand exactly that. But also for Turkey, the government in Ankara. It must understand that autonomy, independence and cultural self-determination of the Kurdish areas in south-eastern Turkey must be more than just development aid, more than just economic measures.

For example, we had the peace call from the academics. It is really great that they are doing it – they are really heroes. But what happens is not that they get applauded by all sides, but rather they are being threatened by President Erdoğan and even threatened by a mafia boss. Their lives and their freedom are under threat, and we should do everything we can to support them. But while most of us probably agree about the problems in the south-east and all over Turkey, we might not all have the same ideas about what we ourselves, as the EU, contributed to these problems, and what we are going to do about that now. To my mind, it was a big mistake to have the accession negotiations with Turkey blocked by a couple of Member States, because that gave Erdoğan the possibility to instrumentalise the problems in the accession process at home in his internal policies. He did that well, and that is also our fault. So let us not repeat this mistake. As for what to do now, the European Union needs always to be strong on human rights, also with regard to Turkey.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Thank you for this discussion, which is also very important for consolidating our opinion. It has been pointed out on several occasions that the Vice-President, Commissioner Stylianidis and my little one will hold talks in Ankara on Monday, high-level political dialogue. Rest assured that we will raise this issue very intensively there. Although there has been a lot of talk today about the continuation of the accession negotiations, we are still at a very early stage here, for example in terms of Chapters 23 and 24, but we are in the preparatory phase. Anyone who deals with this matter to some extent knows quite clearly that the greatest lever in the preparation, but especially in the actual conduct of these accession negotiations, is to influence things. Then there is the litmus test for the Turkish Government to show how serious it is about the convictions of the rule of law in accordance with international European standards. This must then be examined and tested. Membership of the European Union is only possible if we follow our beliefs, principles and legal structures. Negotiations in this area are not negotiations, to converge, but rather to take over the European values and legal system, so to speak. That is the subject of the negotiations, and that is what the negotiations can do. In this respect, we certainly have the strongest lever at this stage. We should try that. I believe that there are no alternatives in this direction if we want to help the Kurdish population in Turkey, for example. With this in mind, I am also pleased that some Turkish mayors are here, who have had discussions with many of us today, have also taken advantage of the opportunity to provide us with first-hand information accordingly. This, too, is very important in order to have an appropriate opinion-forming system. In any case, thank you very much for the discussion.

The EU has very close ties with Turkey, but our cooperation and friendship shouldn’t stop us from openly criticising our partners when such criticism is due. Turkey has launched a high-risk offensive against the PKK. The scale of the military operations being carried out in towns and cities by police and military units is truly shocking. In southeast Turkey, civilians have been killed and several towns have been put under curfew for weeks on end. I’ve met with Ms Figen Yuksekdag, co-chair of the HDP, and I was deeply concerned with her account of the events in Turkey, including violent crackdowns on protests and rapidly shrinking space for political opposition.

For Ukraine, the DCFTA can bring significant economic benefits. Ukrainian businesses will now receive stable and predictable preferential access to the largest market in the world, with 500 million customers, and EU enterprises will be able to benefit from easier access to the Ukrainian market, so we must help Ukraine develop the right conditions to encourage new business and investment relationships. Over 20 meetings were held in trilateral format to address alleged Russian concerns about the DCFTA implementation. Now Ukraine faces a number of measures imposed by Russia impeding trade and transit and will need our support here too. In 2016 we will be stepping up our efforts to support Ukraine with more coordination with EU Member States and greater visibility for our work. Particularly on the implementation of the DCFTA, we will build on current support programmes to improve the business climate, provide support to small and medium-sized enterprises, and help Ukraine find new markets. Ukraine needs to show it is open for business by aligning with EU standards in key sectors and taking decisive action on the rule of law. The Support Group for Ukraine is playing a key role with the Commission in all these areas. Despite very challenging circumstances, the Ukrainian Government has made progress in implementing the Association Agreement. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the new national police force have started to work. The selection process for an anti-corruption prosecutor has been completed. The government has also adopted a law on the natural gas market, which aims at bringing the gas sector of Ukraine into line with the EU Third Energy Package. These developments were welcomed at the second Association Council in Brussels which was held on 7 December, but we should not underestimate the challenges ahead. The fight against corruption, reform of the judiciary and the public administration, as well as amendments to the constitution, particularly the second reading on decentralisation, will require courage and political will. Shortly before Christmas, we published our final report on Ukraine’s implementation of the visa liberalisation action plan which concluded that, since the necessary process has been made and the number of additional commitments undertaken by the Ukrainian leadership, a positive recommendation for visa-free travel could be made. We aim to present a legislative proposal to pave the way for visa liberalisation with Ukraine soon. Turning to Moldova, the country has made great strides in concluding and implementing the Association Agreement and DCFTA with the European Union. Since 1 January the region of Transnistria also has the possibility to trade preferentially under the DCFTA, making an important contribution to our conflict resolutions, but recent Moldovan governments have not implemented important reforms. We are currently witnessing a highly unstable political situation, which is also an obstacle to the effective implementation of the Association Agreement and making full use of opportunities. The country is in great need of stable leadership, with the determination and energy required to address a number of problematic issues, including high-level corruption. This is necessary before Moldova can proceed with other key reforms, in particular in the justice, financial and media sectors and the reform of the public administration. I have just received information that there was a positive vote on the new government and I hope this is now a stable one. I think we should support any government that is ready to undertake the necessary reforms, and it is also important to provide the necessary substantial support in terms of staff, human resources, but also, if needed, and this is definitely the case, in terms of money, provided that there is a positive assessment by the IMF. Finally, as regards Georgia, impressive efforts have been made to implement the Association Agreement and the results are already visible, with strong growth in foreign direct investment. Other indicators also show promising signs. The visa liberalisation action plan has proven to be an effective tool for promoting a range of reforms, but Georgia has gone beyond the action plan benchmarks and taken further steps to reform the judiciary as well as the Prosecutor’s Office. In this regard, we also closely monitor the authorities to ensure that there is no unlawful conduct targeting the constitutional court and its personnel. The result was our positive report last December and with Georgia, too, we will press ahead now with legislation to achieve full visa liberation as soon as possible. In summary, we can be happy that we have already come so far with our three Association Agreement partners, but we still have a long way to go and no room at all for complacency. I look forward to hearing the honourable Members’ views during this debate today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1384, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Andrej PLENKOVIĆ", "mepid": "112755", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam Vice-President, in my minute and 30 I will reflect a little more on the situation in Ukraine, and my colleagues Gahler and Harmna will talk more about Moldova and Georgia. Especially today about Moldova where there was a vote of confidence, but I also hear certain protests that are currently happening in the Moldovan parliament.  Today's \"Association Agreement\" theme is extremely pertinent and comes at a good time. The entry into force of the Ukraine-EU Free Trade Agreement has seen lengthy negotiations, but also insufficient assurances from Russia that this treaty will have some negative consequences for it. Unfortunately, we have seen countermeasures that Russia has taken and are damaging to trade. I think the EU should help Ukraine in this situation.  Also, I expect from the Commission a very soon concrete legislative proposal that will relate to further liberalization of the visa regime, when it comes to Ukrainian citizens, because that is exactly what our Ukrainian friends expect 2 years after Majdan.

With the Association Agreement, the EU offers its eastern neighbours a comprehensive offer of political cooperation and economic integration – even without EU membership. However, in order for our EU neighbours to fully benefit from this offer of cooperation, they need to implement more far-reaching reforms in the economy and trade, as well as in the approximation of legislation. The more reforms that are implemented, the greater the benefits these countries will have. I am pleased that today we have succeeded in electing a new government in Moldova. I wish the new Prime Minister and his team every success. We also expect a lot from them, because words are spoken enough – we must see concrete action.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I think we need to think again. The European Commission, with the support of the Council, has enforced free trade and association agreements with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, which have caused economic decline throughout the region. The agreements have destroyed the increased production and trade networks in the region in a very short space of time. The EU is not in a position to make up for the losses. Social hardship is getting worse every day, and corruption is eating up societies. Why are you letting things escalate like this? In Ukraine, more than 9,000 people have already died in an avoidable war. Moldova's government, which is still operating today, is now blocking the opposition's votes in dungeons, and the overall situation is deteriorating in Georgia as well. The GUE/NGL Group remains in the same vein: there is an urgent need to reassess and align the neighbourhood policy to the east and relations with the Russian Federation, including with the neighbours of the neighbours. This must include an end to the EU's confrontation with Russia and the Eurasian Union, as well as a willingness to work together – with all 28 EU Member States and the neighbourhood countries – to build a common area of peace and social and economic progress. This is what is needed in the current acute international situation, in view of the need to eliminate the causes of flight in full, what people long for in the face of the real situation in their countries. The people of the Netherlands will vote on it on 6 April. And my question to her is whether she thinks the agreement with Ukraine is right. Will you respect the result?

It is not very easy, and we have to give them all the support we can. That is why I believe we have to show them that parliamentary oversight of these processes is important. We can also show them how the best practices of our EU Member States have given Parliament a real say on EU integration processes and the transposition of EU legislation. That is what we are trying to do in the European Parliament right now. We can, perhaps, conclude that this parliamentary support has so far been the strongest in Ukraine, and perhaps we can learn from that and adopt the same kind of means and procedures for Moldova and Georgia. I believe that to go through the necessary reforms of the justice sector, media freedoms, etc., is the best guarantor of independence and sovereignty for these countries, and we all know that Russia casts a very long shadow over all three. We also need to make sure that there is a full monitoring of the reforms, that they are not just for show, and there I believe that the EU could do even better.

The European Union must not be involved in their internal process, but it must give them an additional impetus in the process of implementing the European idea. I've done it wrong so far.  Moldova is one of three states that is currently facing a difficult political situation and financial instability that has already become perpetual.

It is essential to reconfirm the Union's interest and support for Moldova, which also remains one of the key partners in maintaining balance in this area.  What do you do for them? The European Union must remain committed to Moldova and ensure that it remains in a area of stability, otherwise we cannot wait or demand reforms. What have you done so far? Moldovans have already made significant progress in terms of anti-discrimination, justice and free movement, and it should be stressed that in the implementations of free trade agreements, Moldova is at the forefront of increasing trade with the European Union, according to Eurostat data. Georgia, which received an economic supplement due to better implementation of reforms, accounted for almost half of the percentages of Moldovans; we continue to criticize moldovans.

Therefore, on the part of Chisinau, we expect a renewed political commitment to the reforms agreed with the European Union on the basis of the Association Agenda, but also from Europe for genuine support.

Deepening the link between these countries and the Union is not only a matter of pragmatism, but to a large extent our historical duty. Association and in-depth cooperation agreements are an important step towards closer integration and it is welcome that their implementation is successful.

Moldovan nationals can therefore go to this area without a visa. However, this violates international law prohibiting the de facto recognition of occupied areas.

On Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, these three partners have made a courageous choice to align themselves more closely with the European Union by undertaking ambitious and far-reaching reforms. They do this in the face of significant challenges coming both from within their countries and from the outside, and unlike some of their predecessors, they do this without the firm promise of EU membership at the end of the process.

We have every interest in ensuring that our partners succeed in these efforts, because their success will also be our success and their failure would be our failure. But ultimately, this process must be one that is owned by our partners and done because it is the right thing for them to do, not because we asked them to do it.

He is still the symbol of Kosovo independence, a symbol of nonviolent struggle, a great poet and leader of Kosovo-Albanians whom I would like to commemorate here at the start of this debate.  I now come to the EU-Kosovo Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). It was negotiated between October 2013 and May 2014; it was initialled in July 2014; the Council agreed to its signature on 22 October 2015 and then it was signed here in Strasbourg on 27 October by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and by Commissioner Johannes Hahn, on behalf of the EU, and also by the Republic of Kosovo’s Prime Minister Isa Mustafa and the Minister for European Integration Bekim Çollaku. The Kosovo Assembly ratified it on 2 November 2015. Now it is up to us here tomorrow to vote for this Stabilisation and Association Agreement of the European Union with Kosovo and afterwards it can enter into force.  This is a historic moment for Kosovo because for the first time the EU and Kosovo will have contractual relations. It is the first official formal step on the way to full EU integration and to becoming a member of the European Union. Yes, it has taken some time because of Kosovo being a new country, its independence was just eight years ago, and in the Council too it took some time, but let me express my welcome for the fact that the five Member States who still have not recognised Kosovo have also given their consent.  This is a big step forward and I would just like to urge them to move forward on that and go on to recognise Kosovo. Some of these countries have ministers visiting Kosovo, meeting with government officials, so please just go ahead and recognise Kosovo, this youngest republic in the European Union. I can tell you that it does not hurt. It would just help people.  So what is this SAA about? As I said, it introduces contractual relations for the first time. It provides for enhanced political dialogue, trade integration and new forms of cooperation. It covers numerous sectors, be they strengthening of democratic principles or human rights, but also a framework for cooperation on sectors such as education, energy, environment, justice and home affairs and many more. It also sets out rights and obligations and it provides a powerful incentive for the implementation and institutionalisation of reforms, because Kosovo still needs reforms and there the government has to move on.  It also creates opportunities for investment but at the same time good governance is required through the application of European standards and approximation to European Union laws. Furthermore it creates great opportunities for enhancing contacts between people, between experts, between citizens, in sectors such as education, environment and culture, but also of course on combating crime and trafficking, and it foresees further strengthening of relations and cooperation with neighbouring countries, thus contributing also to stability in the region.  But of course this exchange between people, between citizens, also needs both Kosovo and the European Union to move ahead with visa liberalisation. Kosovo is the only country in the region where citizens still cannot travel freely. They feel locked in. So this SAA is a very important step but visa liberalisation has to come.

I also want to thank the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Committees and rapporteurs – Ulrike Lunacek in particular – for their support. Tomorrow’s vote on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, renegotiated with Kosovo, is testament to this focus. The SAA is a milestone in EU-Kosovo relations and of critical importance for the future of Kosovo and the whole Western Balkans. The agreement is the first formal contractual relationship that ties the European Union and Kosovo together. It allows Kosovo to join the rest of the region, sharing the benefits of deepening political and economic interdependence and sharing in the common European perspectives that make peace, stability and prosperity our joint goal. The agreement will help Kosovo with much-needed economic reform underpinned by the rule of law. This should ensure a more predictable business environment, leading to much-needed growth and jobs. The agreement helps establish a stable legal framework and gradual approximation with EU laws and standards. It also promotes the free movement of goods, services and capital and envisages higher standards and increased choice and lower prices for Kosovo citizens. It should stimulate Kosovo’s progress in the area of transport and energy as it foresees the gradual integration into Europe’s energy markets and the development of quality infrastructure. The agreement should also strengthen regional cooperation. Under its terms, Kosovo commits itself to a visible and sustainable improvement in relations with Serbia. This is an essential principle of our agreement. The continuation of the EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia is therefore a legal obligation. Kosovo will need to implement the agreements it has reached and continue to work towards further agreements. As we have seen over the last few months, this sometimes involves taking difficult decisions and the need for compromise. Finally, I want to underline that the agreement includes provisions that commit Kosovo to high international standards in terms of respect for democratic principles. This is of particular relevance to the challenges Kosovo is facing at the moment. It means that the institutions set up to ensure democratic government and the rules that allow these institutions to do their work should be respected. It also means there can be no obstruction to free and transparent political discourse. Obstruction and violence have no place in a democratic system. Allow me to use this opportunity to call on Kosovo’s politicians to engage in a free political exchange to solve the differences in a way that is worthy of the country’s European perspective: without obstructions, without violence and without threats and intimidation.

That is why it is important that this Agreement is fully applied very ambitiously. It's not just an economic agreement, it's an agreement that includes building democratic institutions, building an entire society, strengthening the judiciary, so it's very important that these components of this agreement are used very ambitiously and very committedly.

Madam President, imperialist contrasts are dangerously exacerbated in the Balkans because of their geostrategic position next to areas torn by competition and wars and which are a passage of refugees and energy pipelines, being a field of great investment and a bridge of the European Union and NATO in areas of great interest to the Russian bourgeoisie. The European Union and NATO war intervention brought the break-up of Yugoslavia, set up protectorates and cultivated ethnic and religious divisions among the peoples to serve Euro-Nato interests and local urban classes. The association agreement under discussion de facto recognises such a protectorate, Kosovo. The Greek government, which is doing the same, has enormous responsibilities. It triggers nationalisms, altruisms, territorial claims and promotes border changes, such as the officially threatened union of Albania and Kosovo in a single state that will have aspirations against neighbouring countries such as the F.B.I. and Greece.

Let me first of all say that this debate touches on something that is particularly relevant and very much linked to other debates we held last night: the situation in the Middle East and sectarianism is one of the diseases of our age. For centuries, countless faiths and ethnicities have lived together in the Middle East – more than in any other parts of the world. Of course, sectarian conflicts have always existed, but the diversity of the Middle East has never ever been as vulnerable as it is today. For too long, too many actors have fostered sectarian divisions in a struggle for regional power and this is what we are seeing now. Today, we see the devastating effects of such behaviour. Daesh has turned sectarian strife into a core theme of its propaganda and of its actions. They have used it as a tool for recruitment and as an excuse for claiming oil rich lands – not much to do with religion, but a lot about power. Before I go into more detail on how to tackle the mass murder of minorities, let me be clear on one important thing: Daesh is not just a threat to minorities. A few days ago we learned that Daesh has allegedly killed more than 100 people and kidnapped hundreds in the Syrian city of Deir al—Zor. According to the first reports, all of them were Sunni Muslims. If you look at the numbers of victims in the current conflicts, the vast majority of them are Muslims. This is true in Syria and Iraq, as well as in Nigeria or in Pakistan, and also in Europe we have Muslim victims of terrorist attacks. All faiths, all peoples are victims and united in the fight against terror. This is I think the first duty we have: to send a signal, to send this message. We are all in this. We are all united in this.  Still, we cannot ignore that the plight of individuals belonging to religious minorities, including Christians, in Daesh-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq is dramatic. Christian communities, Kurdish cities, the enslavement of Yazidi women, Shabaks, Druze, Assyrians, we can forget none of them. Faced with terrible atrocities, we need more than condemnation. You can imagine my frustration every time that we come out with a statement condemning – we have to do that because it is a sign of constant attention, which these communities need. But on the other side, we all know very well that condemning is not enough. We need concrete support for these people, so let me focus on actions we have taken in defence of minorities in the Middle East.  First, financial support: we are providing very concrete financial support. The European Union and the Member States are the leading donors for Syria with over EUR 5 billion in assistance. We have been among the first to provide assistance to the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq – I visited some of them exactly last year at Christmas – and to the Kurds in Kobane.  The EU also remains the second largest donor to Iraq. Our funds are helping to bring life back to the regions liberated from Daesh, and we all know that this is central for making it possible for the pluralism of this society to survive. When we say that we must help minorities stay in their land, in the lands where they have lived for centuries, that is exactly what I mean. The European instrument for democracy and human rights supports civil society projects promoting freedom of religion or belief. This goes together with implementing legislation that safeguards the rights of persons belonging to minorities in both Syria and Iraq. As the war still goes on, it can be difficult to look at the future and work on a post-war Middle East. I know that very well. Still, we need to always keep in mind that our long-term goal is that of a peaceful and inclusive democracy. We need to start investing in a peaceful future today if we want tomorrow to be a better one. Let me be completely sincere on this: the resources we have invested, although very important ones, are far from sufficient. Humanitarian response plans for Syria and Iraq were under-funded in 2015. This needs to change under the new humanitarian response plans for 2016, and we have worked on this. The European Union continues to contribute to humanitarian aid, and let me say I count very much on this Parliament’s support for our action to be strengthened this year. It will be important to commit to a strong pledge at the upcoming London Conference of Donors for Syria that will be co-hosted by the UK, Germany, Norway, Kuwait and the United Nations on 4 February this year. Apart from financial support, we have other fields of action. The second one is guaranteeing that justice will be done – accountability. This is a crucial step towards peace and national reconciliation. This is why the European Union supports the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which collects evidence on the violations committed in view of future legal action. The EU also provides political and financial support to efforts from civil society to promote accountability in Syria. Our European Union has called for the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. As for Iraq, we are aware that minority groups, in particular the Yazidis, have demanded that the crimes committed against them by Daesh be considered genocide. Third field of action – we are seeking the broadest engagement of relevant regional actors and of international organisations. This is because we believe that it is, for sure, a task for the European Union – but not for the European Union alone – to protect minorities in the Middle East. Since the beginning of the crisis, we have sought to involve our Muslim partners first and foremost on the solution of it. We are part of the global coalition countering Daesh and contribute to its objectives with non-military means, as you know.  Let me also stress that our condemnation of the crimes of Daesh will never be as powerful as those of the Muslim religious authorities. They are our best allies in this fight. We have, in particular, cooperated with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation an engagement which led us to the consensual adoption of a UN resolution on fighting religious intolerance. I have, in particular, in the last months upgraded our cooperation with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The EU also supports the proposal by France and the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group that the Security Council develops a code of conduct whereby permanent members agree to refrain from using their veto with respect to those mass atrocities which the responsibility to protect seeks to prevent. We are happy to see that this proposal is gradually gaining more support within the larger UN membership. The fourth field of action, maybe the most urgent one: we are on the front line of all diplomatic efforts to find a political solution to the war in Syria and join forces against Daesh and, let me add, supporting the work of the Iraqi authorities towards national inclusion and reconciliation. We are finally getting to a stage in Syria where the Syrian parties can finally, hopefully, sit together and try to find their own way out of the war. After five years of bloodshed, reconciliation and peace will not be easy for sure, but is it possible – and more than possible, necessary. There is no other way to preserve the incredible diversity of the Middle East. Building up strong and inclusive societies – strong and inclusive democracies where all people have a say, where all rights are guaranteed, where living together is possible and it is safe and good for all. Despite the hardships, minorities in the Middle East have not lost hope. Just one month ago, the Catholic community in Aleppo celebrated the beginning of the Catholic jubilee of mercy. They did so by opening a holy door in the local church of Saint Francis. Life goes on, faith goes on, and it is a powerful symbol of forgiveness, of faith and confidence in a better future. In a recent interview, the Catholic Bishop of Aleppo quoted an Islamic proverb which goes this way: ‘Allah provides even for a black ant on a black rock crawling in a dark night,’ and he continued, ‘we are not alone and the bells of our churches will keep tolling’. These people have not lost hope. Personally, I am not a believer, but I am a strong believer in the rights of all to live in peace and respect. I am a strong believer in the value of diversity, in the richness of different communities sharing their identities, their stories, their wisdom, their past and their future, the hopes and aspirations, their lives. That is the strength of open societies: the capacity to live together, and this has been and is the strength of the European Union and of the Middle East. We cannot let them down, and the only way to make sure we do not let them down is to obstinately push for a political solution to the current crisis. We have discussed that yesterday night in this room – to reject all sectarianism, to keep working for a regional settlement of all disputes and for national reconciliation.  Our friends in the Middle East have not lost hope. If we care about them, we have to keep working for peace and let us not lose hope either.

It is impossible to understand the Middle East without the presence of the Jewish community, which has already disappeared, without the presence of the different Christian communities—Caldeas, Assyrian, Syrian, Catholic, Maronite. The problem is not simply what is happening with the Islamic State. Christians in Iraq began to leave massively after the U.S. invasion.  In Israel and occupied Palestine fewer and fewer Christians remain, so that Bethlehem, which was mostly Christian, now has a rigorous Christian minority. They're leaving. And they leave because life is impossible to live and because different communities need to protect themselves in enclosed spaces. And in this way we find how the Druze defend themselves from others; how Yazidi have to self-offend; how Shiites, how Sunnis, Alawites, Maronites, different communities become watertight islands. And this is a tragedy.  Because there is a need for Europe. If we don't have a spirit of solidarity, at least let's have healthy selfishness. Our need is that in the Middle East there is a powerful Christian community, because historically it has existed and because it means the best reference and the best bridge of communication.

They have destroyed over a hundred Christian cultural and religious cultural heritage, including in Nineveh and Palmyra. In Sweden there is today one of the world's largest diasporas of Assyrians, Syrians and Chaldeans, and it has grown rapidly as a result of Daesh ethnic cleansing in the Middle East. One hundred years after the genocide of 1915, we see history repeatwhen the same people are once again expelled and murdered. Syria's Christian population has fallen to less than a tenth and is therefore a religion that has existed in the region for over 2,000 years under serious threat.  It is therefore important that we call what is happening today as an ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity and it is extremely important that we act before they are completed.

The cause is ideological. Some say that ISIS represents a perversion of Islam. In fact, it represents a literalist interpretation of the Qur’an. The Qur’an speaks of making war on infidels, killing infidels and striking terror into the hearts of infidels. The Qur’an endorses beheadings, crucifixions and slavery. Even the systematic rape of non-Muslim women is justified by the verse that says: ‘Those you have taken with your right hand you may possess’. ISIS represents a revival of the original ethos of the Mohammedan cult that conquered its way up to France before being driven back in the 8th century. Thank God, not Allah, most Muslims do not follow this literalist interpretation.  How can ISIS be defeated? A military defeat needs a coalition between the West and those Islamic countries that do not want to live under the barbarism of ISIS. ISIS’s funding and supply lines must be terminated.

It was not through reticence that I did not address this issue in my opening remarks, but because a definition of genocide depends on very precise legal criteria. This work is ongoing in the competent institutions, namely in the United Nations in the appropriate framework. The only reference so far to genocide in UN documents is the one made on 13 March 2015 in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the human rights situation in Iraq and in the light of abuses committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and associated groups. This report compiles information about acts of violence perpetrated against civilians on account of their affiliation, or received affiliation, to an ethnic or religious group. This report concludes that some of this violence, considering the overall information, may constitute genocide in the case of the Yazidis, and other violence may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes in relation to Christians, Turkmen, Sabaean Mandaeans, Kaka’e, Kurds and Shia. This is – if we want to be precise and consistent with the legal framework we are dealing with, because many of you made reference to the fact that it is not just a word but has legal implications – this is the legal framework in which we are acting. You can be sure that we are working – as you know very well, the European Union as such does not have a seat in the United Nations, but we can open this debate next time if you want to – and following these developments within the appropriate frameworks, which are those of the United Nations. But let me also stress that, in parallel to that, we have to act concretely and not just take a principled approach: that is indeed extremely relevant because the region is looking to us and the minorities are looking to those who can defend them with words, which are important, but also with acts. Let me start with something that was mentioned in a very concrete way by one of you, namely the issue of justice and accountability. As I mentioned before, but let me underline it again, the European Union supports the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which collects evidence on the violations committed. This is extremely relevant in view of future legal actions, and the European Union – as was underlined by one of your interventions – has indeed called for the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Let me make these two points very clear. And let me also stress in conclusion – because I am also aware that we are running late, and I do not want to contribute too much to us being even later – that there are three or four things that are absolute a priorities for us to do in order to protect religious minorities in the Middle East. First, liberate the areas that have been occupied by Daesh in Iraq and Syria in particular, and make them safe, returning these areas to normal life. This is where our humanitarian assistance comes in – in Iraq because we have more access and we can support more access there and, hopefully more and more, in Syria. Second, create the conditions for inclusive communities and societies in these countries. I would say recreate the conditions, because we are talking, as many of you have underlined, of societies that for centuries, if not thousands of years, have been living together in peace and understanding, living together, finding their differences as a source of the richness of their societies. And this is a point that is particularly relevant to me, more so even than from a political point of view, but from a human point of view – and I am surprised this did not come up today in the debate because this is, as far as I have heard, for instance from the Christians in Erbil last year, the issue that they are debating the most – which is whether it is safer and better for us to stay in the Middle East or to leave, with all the debates about preserving or recreating the plurality in the societies of the Middle East. This is a debate that in particular the Christian communities in the regions that were occupied by Daesh in Iraq are posing themselves. This is a debate that I believe we have first of all to respect and to follow carefully in our own debate, but I believe that we also have the duty to offer them the possibility to have the option to create safe conditions to leave these areas. This goes back to what some of you have underlined, namely to support refugees – all refugees, including the ones from minority backgrounds – and to protect their rights, wherever they are, in whatever place in the region they are, and also to create the conditions for them to stay or to return to their communities if they wish to do so in order to preserve or restore the plurality of societies in the Middle East. I personally believe that this is in itself a value because that is one of the places in the world where different backgrounds, different religions, different communities and different ethnicities have been living and showing the world how it is possible to live together. Then we have to do the big thing: end the conflicts. Because at the end of the day that is what allows minorities to go back. An additional point concerns what comes afterwards, and sometimes also not in places where conflicts are but in places that are on the verge of major crises, which means investing in the openness of societies, in the democracy of the institutions, in the respect for human rights and the rule of law, and in pluralism and inclusiveness in countries all around the world , not only in the Middle East. Now we are talking about a specific case, that of Daesh, but, as many of you mentioned, this is something that is happening everywhere in the world – in Africa and Asia, and not forgetting Libya, where we had victims who were Christians of different origins, in Ethiopia and Egypt where people were killed only recently. We have to look at the bigger picture and act immediately with first of all our humanitarian support, work on the conditions for the respect of minorities and pluralism and inclusiveness in the immediate term and in the long term, and put all our diplomatic efforts into putting an end to the crisis and defeating what in this case is the great source of problems for the religious minorities in the Middle East , namely Daesh.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI", "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 1532, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Nous faisons face à des défis sans précédent. Nos citoyens nous demandent quel est le sens de notre Union. D'aucuns prétendent que l'Union à 28 est trop complexe et trop plurielle pour prendre de bonnes décisions au cours de cette époque difficile. Je pense que notre réponse, face aux horribles attentats de Paris, a surpris beaucoup d'observateurs. Certains d'entre eux avaient prédit qu'à l'heure la plus sombre, l'Europe aurait été divisée et déchirée par des luttes intestines. J'ai participé à tous les Conseils et à tous les sommets européens après le vendredi 13 novembre. Laissez-moi donc vous dire qu'à partir du premier jour, la réponse de l'Union européenne a été celle d'une vraie Union. Comme vous le savez, après les attaques terroristes de Paris, la France a demandé le soutien des autres États membres comme cela est prévu à l'article 42, paragraphe 7, du traité sur l'Union européenne. Lors du Conseil des ministres de la défense, le 17 novembre, les États membres ont envoyé un message très fort d'unité et de solidarité à la France. Beyond the political message, Article 42(7) of the Treaties contains concrete obligations for Member States. Indeed, the Member States have an obligation to – ‘shall’ – provide aid and assistance to the Member State under attack with all the means in their power. This formulation is usually understood as referring to the use of military means, but no doubt Article 42(7) also covers assistance through other instruments or means of support of a non-military nature. The article expresses a high level of commitment. It is up to each Member State to determine the exact nature of the aid and assistance it will ultimately provide, but the framework is European. The core principle is ‘unity in diversity’. France asked for the support of the European Union and the European Union replied in a united way. The French Minister of Defence presented two specific requests to the Ministers. First, to support any operations that France would be conducting against Daesh in Syria and Iraq, and second, to backfill any lack of resources that may occur in international military missions or operations as a result of French redeployments to fight Daesh. France has approached Member States bilaterally with specific requests, following the European Council in its defence composition, with the constant involvement also of the EU crisis management structures and my personal constant updates. There are no specific procedures, as you know, for the implementation of Article 42(7) and, as you know, the article has never before been invoked in our European history. The implementation can therefore be adapted to the specific circumstances. While Article 42(7) does not specifically provide for a role of the European Union structures, its instruments and mechanisms may be used in countering the threats to Member States. And as I said, even if this is not specifically provided for in the wording of the Article of the Treaty, we in the Council, at the request of France, agreed on involving the European Union structures all along the path towards the implementation of the provisions. At the Council meeting I offered EU support from the outset, including, for instance, in coordinating any request that might have had an impact on EU CSDP missions or operations. Accordingly, France provided information on the implementation process both in the Political and Security Committee as well as in the Military Committee. Let me add that until now, French engagement in the fight against Daesh has not had any consequences for the EU missions and operations where France is active. The flexibility of Article 42(7) would also allow any state invoking it to also have recourse to other complementary international security arrangements. The Article itself refers explicitly to the fact that, ‘commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for those states which are members of it.’ The mechanism to transform political solidarity into concrete, real action is strong and I think today we all realise that there is no nation state that can stand alone against the threats we face, and that it is our unity, also in this field, that is our strength. The diversity of our defence assets, the specific character of our foreign policies, is far from being a liability. It constitutes the strength of our Union. No other power in the world can mobilise such a variety of foreign policy and defence instruments all together. Unity in diversity, that is our strength. We can use it without being scared to use all the provisions of the Treaty if and when they serve a national and/or a collective interest. We often complain about our divisions. Let me say that it is also a case of being proud of our unity and strength where we find it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1536, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the France was the first country to apply the Article 42(7) assistance clause following the despicable attacks in Paris. We in Parliament and we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcome the unanimous support of all Member States in response. However, we are also aware that this article is also primarily a political matter and that the situation is not particularly convenient for the country that first set this precedent.  So France had to take care of itself to define what it needs, and then go from one Member State to another to get help. As a Parliament, we had already called on your predecessor, i believe it was in 2012, to propose practical measures and guidelines in the event that this article is applied, and also to examine how to react in concrete terms and who would be responsible for what.

Terrorism must, of course, be combated, but the most important thing is to prevent it and it is important that we use the right tools.  Today we are discussing a resolution with both good and bad elements, and it is, after all, a response to President Hollande's decision to invoke the so-called mutual assistance clause. Hollande called the attack on Paris an act of war and then declared war on terrorism, just like Georges W. Bush after 9/11. Bush's war on terrorism has been going on for many years, but with hindsight, we know that it has rather led to increased contradictions and more terrorism.  In Paris, the terrorist attack was perpetrated by EU citizens who had grown up here. The attack was a heinous crime but not an attack by a foreign state. Daesh is not a state and therefore the attack should be met with police methods. We believe that it is a dangerous development if we create a practice in which crimes are prosecuted by the military instead of the police and in a way that all Member States are drawn into this so-called war. Instead, we should have used Article 222, which is de facto about, among other things, terrorist attacks.

In the face of barbarism, in the face of abject crimes, in the face of the desire for death on our territory, European solidarity was the only response. Today, this solidarity is symbolized by Article 42, paragraph 7, of the Treaty on the European Union. Yes, France needs mutual assistance from Europe, because it is often alone to fight the very people who are attacking us. Many Member States very quickly responded positively to the invocation of this article. I welcome these decisions, their decisions. While you must communicate a new comprehensive foreign and security policy strategy for the European Union by June 2016, High Representative, it is important that This invocation by France of the mutual defence clause can take on an operational dimension. This is the first time a Member State has used this clause. So let's give the test shot a masterstroke, let's relaunch the European defence yard, as a number of colleagues have just indicated. We can no longer hide our faces. Europe has security challenges shared by all its Member States in its immediate vicinity: Sahel, The Near East, the Middle East. The conclusion is simple: our security is common, it is regional, it cannot be dispersed. Faced with this situation, only a true Defence Europe will be up to the task. Europe cannot rely solely on a country like France, and France will not be able to reasonably deal with the security of Europe alone. Let us not be afraid to tell those who always want less Europe that they are completely wrong and that, on the contrary, it is only by more Europe that we will be able to control and fight these terrorisms in this war that concerns us. This is the reality, this is our major political project that will restore Europe to the prestige it has lost in these years of crisis.  Thank you, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention.

Many misinterpret this part of the Lisbon Treaty as a kind of counterpart to Article 5 of the Lisbon Treaty. The North Atlantic Treaty Agreement, which, in the event of an attack on a member of the Alliance, obliges everyone else to come to her aid. The European partners are virtually unusable to reject the French application, as this would not stand in solidarity. And many have indeed answered yes. The truth is that France can be helped in different ways and it is not necessary for this support to be military. But again, many questions are being asked even more sharply about the internal security of the European Union that go beyond the protection of national states. The best answer would be if the common security and defence policy ceased to be the weakest link in European integration.  The proposal for a Joint Defence Force first went public in 2014 when we heard that the European Union could save between €21 billion and €60 billion through greater synergies between defence policies and the introduction of a single defence system.

Clearly the line between the external and the internal even only six years ago was much better defined than it is today. So this is the nature of the threats – and let me underline that this is also a reply to those of you, a couple if not more, who referred to the need to defend our borders. Let us remember that the attacks in Paris were unfortunately perpetrated by people who hold EU passports. So it is not just a matter of defending the territory from the outside, it is also a much more complex issue of how we secure our citizens, how we guarantee the safety of our citizens from a threat that is at the same time internal and external, and we have to put together different kinds of measures there. I think and hope that the global strategy we are working on will also help us to redefine a common direction on how to guarantee the security of our citizens in these times – times that are themselves new and different. Having said that, let me reply to some specific points that were raised. First of all, the use of Article 42(7) rather than Article 222. Obviously it is for single Member States to take the political decision as to which article they want to invoke in terms of asking for assistance from other Member States. But let me clearly compare the two articles in question. Article 42(7) refers to ‘armed aggression’ or ‘armed attack’ – we have different linguistic versions in different languages – on the territory of a Member State, while Article 222 refers to a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster. In terms of obligation, in both cases Member States have an obligation to act. In terms of contributions, in the case of Article 42(7) assistance comes from individual Member States while, as some of you have underlined, Article 222 also calls for mobilising EU instruments. In terms of implementation – and here comes what is I think the most interesting point for our debate in the future – Article 42(7) leaves the implementation process open. Here I observe that the guidelines you were somehow indicating would have been useful in 2012 were not produced. I believe that today we are seeing the implementation of this article, putting together all our resources, all our services and intelligence. This is something that we managed somehow between the decision that we shared with the French Government to use Article 42(7) and the moment when this decision was shared with the Member States in the Defence Council, a period of more of less 24 hours – it was certainly a quick reaction from the European Union services that we were able to gather at very short notice, but I believe the work that both our legal services and our structures that handle this level of assistance worked extremely well, as did the coordination between Member States. But coming back to implementation, Article 222 on the contrary foresees that the European Union has a coordinating role because of the potential involvement of European Union instruments. But let me say something that I underlined in my introductory remarks: even though the wording of Article 42(7) does not call for any kind of specific role for the European Union in terms of implementation, we decided jointly with France and all the Member States during the Council meeting of 17 December, if I remember correctly, to have all the relevant EU structures and institutions, including myself, directly involved at all stages of implementation. That was a political choice and I believe this political choice demonstrated the willingness of all of us to use this article as a way of strengthening the role of the European Union in this field. There is one element that might seem technical but is, I believe, important. Elmar Brok mentioned this, namely the location of the requested action is different when it comes to Article 42(7) compared with Article 222, because in the case of Article 222 assistance is in principle provided inside the territory of the Member State to reinforce its capacities during the crisis, while in the case of Article 42(7) France was clearly requesting assistance in external theatres. So I believe this was an element that was considered during those hours. Indeed, there were other articles that could have been used apart from these two, because you all know very well that we have Article 44 that has never been used and that would have implied EU-CSDP action – a military mission, with some Member States, the ‘willing’ Member States the article says if I remember correctly, taking the responsibility in conjunction with the Council to lead, on behalf of the European Union, a CSDP mission or operation. My political assessment has always been and still is, and I believe the Council strongly supports this vision, that it is not and it would not be appropriate for the European Union as such to have a military operation or mission against Daesh. This is a political choice. This is not a technical use of the treaties, and I believe that also in this House most of you would agree with me in saying that at the moment – and the situation might change or might have changed years from now – I would not see a CSDP role for the European Union for a military intervention against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Not while we have other forms of engagement of the European Union, such as the implementation phase of Article 42(7) in all stages, which is somehow an upgrade of the role of the European Union institutions and structures compared with the wording of the article, which is a political sign. And on the other side, as you know very well, we have the diplomatic and humanitarian work and the work of the European Union within the anti-Daesh coalition when it comes to our global commitment against Daesh and against terrorism. When it comes to the NATO issue, let me say that for those Member States who are also members of NATO, EU mutual assistance is a complementary element to NATO’s collective defence. This is clearly stated in Article 42(7) which says that commitment and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for those states which are members of it. So no overlapping, no competition, no distance or divergence, simply a complementary possibility. And let me also add in more general terms that in this first year and a couple of months that we have been together in office, in parallel, I as High Representative of the European Union and Jens Stoltenberg as Secretary General of NATO, we have strengthened the cooperation between NATO and the European Union in a very significant way. I would expect this to take even more concrete form as we develop our strategy from now until June, and as NATO prepares for the NATO summit at the beginning of July. The two processes run in parallel. Obviously we have completely different paths, but these are communicating paths, and we exchange views, especially on those fields where our cooperation can be complementary for the benefit of all – for instance, in those fields where the European Union has a clear and specific added value when it comes to cyber threats or cyber security. So there are fields of cooperation that are growing stronger and stronger. The French decision that the Council has shared to call for Article 42(7) was and is a clear sign, first that the European Union can and should be seen as an effective security provider, first and foremost by its Member States. Second, it is a sign that solidarity is indeed part of our Union. Third, that all articles of the Treaties can be used. And let me say on this that we do not need ideological debates or theoretical debates: first of all, we cannot afford theoretical debates at this time when the security of our continent is at stake; but we do not need ideological debates either, we need to put in place and use the instruments we already have, and we need to create the political conditions for doing this together, united, highlighting the added value of the European Union also in the security and defence dimension where it can be an increasingly precious and vital tool to serve national interests , in some cases in a more effective way than a purely national approach. The European Union has an added value in this respect. Let me mention the 17 missions and operations we already have around the world that are an instrument and a tool for all the Member States together to act in different theatres where, together, we work better than we would do alone or through other means. Because there are specific dimensions where the EU instruments work better than a NATO instrument or a UN peacekeeping mission or other kinds of missions. This is already something that the European Council unanimously recognises. Both the European Council conclusions, of December 2015 and June 2015, indicate clearly a sense of direction towards investing more in the dimension of CSDP, and I am confident that also with the help of this House the necessary work, the political work we need to prepare, is going to be done to achieve the implementation of the treaty provisions fully and successfully and , let me say, for the safety, the security and the benefit of all European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1571, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

The reference to Article 42(7) of the TOU is primarily a political act and the European Council and the European Parliament are places for political debate. Each first use of the clause requires the knowledge that it will be applied in different situations in the future. It is therefore essential that the current situation sets a precedent, but, on the other hand, that it sets procedures for its application on a case-by-case basis. Since no analysis or guidance was available at the time of the activation of Article 42(7) of the TOU by France, ad hoc action was necessary. However, it is clear that practical steps, guidelines and procedures are needed to ensure a common and effective response when a Member State invokes the mutual defence clause.  The role of the EU institutions in this procedure should be strengthened and include, in particular, the coordination of the assistance provided. To this end, the EU needs a permanent civilian-military headquarters at operational and strategic level, taking into account the existing capabilities of the Member States.

When they look at us, they immediately think of two things: our economic strengths – even after the crisis, hoping the crisis is actually passed – and our work for human rights. Let me take this debate not just as an opportunity to list the priorities we have at the UN Human Rights Council in 2016. Let me also say a few words on how we wish to promote human rights all around the world, and what human rights are to us.  I believe the main tools we have to support human rights worldwide are multilateralism and engagement with all the relevant actors and stakeholders. This is why the Human Rights Council is so central. It is the place where resolute action can be agreed against grave humanitarian rights violations, and it is also the UN central venue for forging new partnerships to advance human rights around the world. It is where we seek to promote justice and equality, as well as collaborative and inclusive approaches in the face of discrimination, repression and violence. As such, at HRC31 we will be prioritising two of the worst cases of human rights violations and abuses: the DPRK, which you will be discussing tomorrow in this hemicycle, and Syria, which we discussed yesterday. The DPRK continues to be one of – if not the – most oppressive States in the world. The freedoms of expression, religion and movement are almost non—existent. Hundreds of thousands of people remain detained in political prison camps and other detention facilities. Many of these people have not been convicted of any internationally recognised crime. At HRC31, we will be co-presenting with Japan a strong resolution addressing this grave human rights situation. The resolution will call for accountability and extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. It will also press for effective follow-up by the DPRK to the universal periodic review process and for a resumption of reporting to Treaty monitoring bodies.  Closer to us, Syria is by far the world’s largest humanitarian disaster, with no parallel in recent history. Our first priority in the current political talks is to allow humanitarian access to the largest part of the country. Such focus will be reflected in the resolution on Syria. The recent axis of aid in Madaya was a positive step, but it is just a first step that needs to be followed by many others, and relevant ones. In the long run, peace in Syria will require justice and accountability for all. Putting together the pieces of Syrian society will not be easy. Reconciliation will need, first of all, recognition of the immense suffering of the Syrian people. To this end, we will support further extension of the Commission of Inquiry’s mandate, which we also discussed in a previous debate this evening, as this remains the sole evidence—gathering tool in support of potential future justice mechanisms.  The Human Rights Council is also a place where positive developments can be recognised, so our other country-specific priority will be on Myanmar/Burma, whose historic elections in November are a much welcome step forward.  We still have ongoing concerns, in particular with regard to ethnic and religious minorities. We will then present a resolution which recommends to the new government that takes office in April to take swift and bold action to address these issues, and which ensures continuing UN scrutiny of the developments in the country. We will also be presenting two thematic resolutions: one on freedom of religion or belief to underline EU support to the fight against the religious intolerance in all forms and expressions – and again, we come back to an issue we discussed a few hours ago – and one jointly with a Latin America and Caribbean group on the rights of the child. On freedom of religion, we will also be organising a side—event where the Special Rapporteur will present the key findings in his report with the participation of civil society. This is in line with our belief that we could not discuss basic human rights without civil society representatives. Throughout the whole year, the European Union will keep working with partners to promote and protect the space of civil society and – let me stress this – the role of human rights defenders in UN proceedings and in all countries. Before closing, let me mention two further issues of particular importance for our work on human rights: the credibility of the UN Human Rights Forum, and our own credibility. The first lies primarily in the independence, integrity and effectiveness of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The EU has been, and will remain, an important partner in staving off attempts to place its activity under the scrutiny or guidance of UN Member States. This is essential to preserve its credibility.  The European Union has also extended concrete cooperation to help the Office of High Commissioner perform its vital task, that is, to service all the HRC-endorsed mechanisms and provide meaningful assistance for the implementation of international human rights agreements. This includes political backing and financial support under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.  Let us come to ourselves. Worldwide, we are perceived as a champion of human rights, and rightly so. Sometimes this is a good perception, while some other partners have some doubts about our role, but this does not stop us. On the contrary, this motivates us even more. Let me tell you that, over the past year, this perception has been challenged. The current events are putting us to the test. It is not just the refugee crisis, it is also the long-term effects of the economic crisis and the growing sense of instability for our citizens. They need to find a way out of the past crisis with a shift in policies that is significant and visible.  These are clearly not easy times, but if we lose sight of fundamental rights for all inside Europe, all can be lost before we even realise it. You, here in this Hemicycle, represent half a billion European citizens. There are very few of you right now, but still. Our entire political class faces a tough challenge: to make our politics reflect what is best in us – what is best in Europe – and we have a choice. We can focus on our fears, foster them and let them tear this Union apart, or we can bet on the values that made us strong, on our diversity, on our solidarity, and restart the engines of this European Union. It is clearly no easy task, but it is one we definitely cannot fail.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1577, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Andrzej GRZYB", "mepid": "23785", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by High Representative, I would like to thank you for your excellent work. Firstly, I would like to thank everyone involved in the negotiations of this year's resolution on the European Union's priorities for the United Nations Human Rights Council. Firstly, it is good news that this year we are adopting our resolution in time before the final priorities of the European Union are adopted, and at the same time I thank the High Representative here for her openness and willingness to debate with us, which I hope provides a broader view of the priorities identified by Parliament in the position with which the delegation will go to the session beginning at the end of February.  I would also like to emphasise what the High Representative said, that multilateralism and commitment to human rights are such an important element of this European commitment.  Secondly, in this year's position we meet a very wide catalogue of issues relevant to respect for human rights. These include, inter alia, improving the functioning of the Council itself, including the functioning of the International Criminal Court, civil and political rights, the question of the permanent point of abolition and reduction, or the moratorium on the execution of the death penalty, religious freedom, the situation of human rights defenders, social and economic rights and business and human rights relations, which play an increasingly important role in the world. Of course, the issue of the migration crisis, which is largely linked also to the humanitarian crisis, counter-terrorism and human rights in various aspects of the climate or in the context of sporting events.  Thirdly, we emphasise that religious freedom is a fundamental human right, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Thank you to the High Representative for a good speech that shows clear respect for human rights. I would also like to thank the colleagues who have been involved in the negotiations for producing this resolution and colleagues who have also shown, with great respect, the importance of this resolution. It is a very important resolution for the work on respect for human rights, on which we are to vote tomorrow. It is a resolution that the European Parliament will take with it to the UN Human Rights Council at its next meeting in Geneva in March. We demonstrated in this resolution that we are closely monitoring the situation of respect for human rights in the world and that human rights work is a top priority in our foreign policy. And it demonstrates the European Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council.  I would say that it is precisely in time of conflict and crisis that we must not waver, but it is particularly important that we maintain and stand up for human rights at that moment, both within the EUROPEAN Union and in our foreign policy. Human rights are the basis of a democratic society. In the resolution, we touch on several important areas: respect for human rights with regard to refugees and migrants, where humanitarian corridors and humanitarian visas are important for the protection of the human rights of those fleeing war and persecution. It also recalls the continued current work on the implementation of the Beijing Platform and the right to education and health as fundamental human rights and the importance of women's participation in peace and conflict resolution, as well as the equal representation of women at all levels of decision-making. The resolution also concerns children's rights, climate refugees and LGBTQ rights, where we are unfortunately seeing a worrying development of an increase in violations. The resolution also includes, as a priority, a selection of countries in which we draw attention to the human rights situation. In addition to these, we have also included the Conclusions of the European Council on peace processes in the Middle East, which is particularly important in view of the current situation. I am also pleased that here in the resolution we draw attention to the denial of the entry of the UN Special Representative for Human Rights into the occupied territories of Palestine, which imposes serious restrictions on the possibility of monitoring the situation and makes it impossible for the UN to work there.  The resolution also draws attention to the situation of human rights defenders, as we see that their room for manoeuvre is increasingly limited in several places in both Europe and the world. Despite death threats and reprisals, many activists work continuously for human rights.  I hope that tomorrow we will send a strong signal to those gathering in Geneva next month. It is more important than ever that the EU can show political leadership in respect for human rights.

Any citizen who hears this and finds that countries such as Venezuela or Saudi Arabia are part of the Council will most likely not give credit and wonder how it is possible for countries that systematically violate human rights to help other States meet their obligations in this regard. Will Venezuela teach other countries how to deal with freedom of expression, judicial independence or the rule of law, with seventy-four imprisoned political prisoners whose only crime is to think differently from that of Mr Maduro's government? Or is Saudi Arabia going to show the rest of the world the way to end the death penalty — one of the European Union's priorities, by the way — when in 2015 it has broken its record for executions over the past twenty years? The United Nations General Assembly has the right to suspend a member of the Council if it considers that it is committing human rights violations during its membership period. On this point, this citizen will surely wonder what the General Assembly expects to proceed with the suspension of Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. We cannot allow these countries to undermine the credibility of the institutions that monitor human rights in the world. The first step must be by us, the whole of the States of the European Union. How? For example, by not voting, in any case, in favour of the choice of countries that do not meet the fundamental requirement established and, of course, making their vote public.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1581, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Marie-Christine VERGIAT", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group.

Human rights need a stable environment and your immigration policy has destroyed that stable environment in Europe. We have seen this in a horrifying way in Cologne, where, for the first time, human rights have been massively violated on European soil.

Mr President, the European Union is one of the greatest players on the world chessboard with potential that has a significant impact on international developments. It must therefore work closely with the UN to deal with the serious issues of concern to the international community. One of them, the most serious and urgent, is immigration. In order to solve this problem we need to look at it with a pragmatic approach. We cannot try to accommodate migrants in Europe and at the same time not try to eliminate the causes of migration in order to stop it. We must not only care about the human rights of migrants and then allow them to have delinquent behaviour in the countries in which they are hosted. Moreover, we do not gain anything if we condemn the illegal movement and trafficking of human beings, but we leave illegal traffickers unchecked.

Therefore, it is very difficult for me to understand why we will, so soon after, vote for a text which is, to a certain extent, similar to the annual report. Indeed, in this resolution, which is supposed to express Parliament's position on the EU's priorities at the UN Human Rights Council, all subjects with any relationship to human rights are discussed: from women to drones, from sport to trade. I believe that, by this resolution, we are completely distorting the meaning of the term 'priority' and we are repeating a work already done. It is essential to me that next year Parliament's resolution on this issue be shorter and more in line with its objective. We could, for example, pick five priorities and stop there. For Parliament's positions on all other human rights issues, we have the annual report. The second point on which I would like to dwell concerns the second part of the text which theoretically covers the list of countries under universal periodic review, because there is a glaring inconsistency here, following the insistence of the left, which wanted, and this is not the first time, to target and stigmatize Israel. The respective list, I quote, is \"Middle East Peace Process\" in the respective list, which is paragraph 89. It goes without saying that this is not a country and that the universal periodic review has nothing to do with it.

As paragraph 28 of our resolution makes clear, this Parliament believes the European Union and its Member States should engage constructively in the intergovernmental working group on a legally-binding instrument. Previously the EU left the room after the first day, which I understand may be subject to some criticism in the report of the UN working group, which is due to be presented in March. Preventing and boycotting a human rights mechanism is not where Europe should be. Our resolution makes clear that taking part in what is an open-ended working group is not an alternative to the Accountability and Remedy Project of the High Commissioner on domestic law remedies, nor is it an alternative to promoting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to which the EU Member States could demonstrate their commitment by completing the process and agreeing national action plans. I understand the EU may even be considering a resolution in Geneva criticising the UN working group. This is the path of confrontation with which this Parliament cannot agree.  For my Group, I do not agree with all of the proposals being discussed in the working group. For example, I believe human rights should apply to all business and not just the transnational corporations. But surely Europe must be in the room to diplomatically express our disagreement and to demonstrate to others what we so often say to them: to be prepared to listen to different views. And the final part of what I want to say: I will respond to what my friend and colleague, Mr Preda, says about paragraph 89. He makes it a key vote, and his Group says they will vote against the resolution if it fails. What does that paragraph say? It supports compliance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law; it calls for the viability of the two-state solution; and it calls for support for the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. I say to him and his Group, in all truth: we have a consensus about moving forward on Middle East peace.

I will highlight here paragraph 9 of the resolution, which tosses on the increasingly frequent revisions of the constitution in developing countries, especially Africa, so that the ruling structures there circumvent the constitutional limits placed on the duration of the president's term. Such actions often result in civil uprisings, violence. We have discussed this several times in this house, e.g. when we had a resolution on Burundi. But this is not the only example.  Unfortunately, we can note that there is a trend of backslide in the democratisation process in many African countries, which unfortunately also leads to systematic human rights violations. It is true that elections are held in these states, but it is an insiaries in which the ruling party wins all elections with more than 80% of the vote. In addition to the European institutions, our European political groups should also take more account of this, in cooperation with such African parties and movements.

The recommendations contained in the review are also a signal to other countries and should translate into cooperation and effective solutions at national and regional level. Human rights should also be respected in the business world. Both the Union and the UN should make efforts to set standards for businesses and Member States in terms of decent working conditions and to promote the development of local communities.

I would just like to thank you all, especially those who stuck to the actual topic of our debate, which has shown a joint commitment of all Groups to our work on human rights. As many of you have said, this is not only a clear principle and value of the European Union, this is also our mission to protect and promote – neither one of these by itself is enough – to protect and promote human rights both inside and outside the Union. Let me say that, in this work, the support and also the guidance of the European Parliament is crucial. We try to do all that we can to use our external action instruments together, jointly, to fulfil this mandate, to be a relevant player on human rights, with some concrete results on the ground. Sometimes this is evident, sometimes this is less evident. In most cases this happens and in most cases around all our human rights priorities, whether it is concrete single cases of human rights defenders, or whether it is the big issues around which we mobilise our work, such as abolition of the death penalty or economic and social rights – the list is long – in all these cases either it is the European Union making the difference, with the European Parliament, with the Member States, with all our tools, or the situation is more difficult. So we know we have not only some values, some principles, but I would say also some interests, because defending and promoting human rights around the world is also responding to a direct interest in stability and security worldwide, because there is no possibility of a stable environment if there is no respect for human rights. This is something that, again, is not only a value and a principle, but also a clear responsibility that we have – inside our borders and outside them. I would like to thank this Parliament for the continued support it gives to our action in this respect, and also let me personally thank the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, who knows this Hemicycle very well, for the excellent work that he is doing to support this mission that we are all together taking forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1598, "date": "2016-01-20.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.
