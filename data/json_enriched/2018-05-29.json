They represent one of the most important files we will work on in the coming months. The file is considered a top priority by this Presidency, working in close cooperation with the future Austrian and Romanian Presidencies.  As agreed in February, once all the sectoral proposals are available, the European Council will return to the issue of the MFF and the timeline for the negotiation. This discussion will take place at the June European Council meeting. In the meantime, the Presidency started working at full speed on the MFF package. After a first political discussion at the level of Ministers on 14 May, experts now meet every week to review the proposals in detail. But work doesn’t stop in the Council. We are all very much aware that cooperation with Parliament will be essential to concluding this file in a timely manner.  For this reason, as soon as we receive the proposals from the Commission, my Prime Minister wrote to President Tajani to establish proper ways of communication. As you can see from the letter of Prime Minister Borissov, the Presidency and future presidencies are committed to keeping Parliament informed about the progress in the Council and to regular exchange of views between the two institutions. This will be key to making sure that we understand each other’s expectations and constraints. In that spirit, we have already met twice with Parliament’s negotiating team. It was very important for us to get the process off to a good start. We look forward to more frank and fruitful exchanges with your representatives in June on the margins of the next General Affairs Council. Before I conclude, I would like to add a word on the substance of the MFF debate. The discussion will seem to be about money, but in fact it will be about shared priorities. Behind the figures, the debate will be about our policy choices and where we expect the European Union to act in the next seven years. It is already clear that we will have to find the right balance between the new priorities and the traditional policies. The policy choices will determine the structure, the size and the resources of the next financial framework. The Presidency is fully committed to giving a dynamic start to the examination and the discussion of the proposals.  Expectations are high for this Multiannual Financial Framework. This is about the future of Europe. But challenges are equally high, and let us not forget the need to achieve unanimity in the Council. The first step will be to understand what the Commission proposals really mean. For that, we need clear information from the Commission. I gather that there were questions in Parliament about the figures presented by the Commission. We had similar questions, and I am confident that today Commissioner Oettinger will provide us with further information on it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " Member of the Commission. — Mr President, Representative of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Having drafted our proposal for the next decade's budget on 2 May, starting today until 14 June, we will finalise the wealth of sectoral implementing rules in the College and then forward it to you. This means that I can confirm today that we will have all the sectoral regulatory proposals on the table of your House and the Council on 14 June. Today, for example, the cohesion policy package and, later this week, the major agricultural policy package will be called for final consultation in the Commission. Since 2 May — taking the priorities, priorities, programmes and equipment with money — there has been a wealth of criticism. One says that the 1.114 frame is too small — others say: it is far too high. Some say that cuts in agriculture and cohesion are far too small — others say that cuts are unacceptable. We have proposed doubling Erasmus+. Some say: a tripling would be indicated. We are increasing research projects and digital innovation projects by up to 50% — some say that is far too little. I have also looked at the resonance in many Member States. I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to help me — because I need unanimity in the Council at the end of the day — and also where the Commission's proposal is considered too high on commitments of 1.14% in the dimension — Sweden, Denmark, perhaps Finland, the Netherlands, Austria. Because these are partly the countries in which your constituencies are. Only if we succeed together in achieving autonomy in the Council will the whole thing have a chance. The Commission's proposal is 1.14%. To put it ahead, I actually think both are moderate. Here I say very clearly: our European citizens generate EUR 100 through handwork, mental work and investment. Of this, we deduce €50 from them through levies, taxes, fees and contributions — that is the government ratio on the European average. Of the EUR 50, EUR 1 currently arrives in Europe and EUR 49 will remain in Paris, Warsaw, Berlin, Rome, Stuttgart, Linz, in rural areas and in social systems. That is why I say that the fabric of the European level — the European level, the national level, the regional level, the local level, the social level — does not go beyond. Nevertheless, we have to realise that — I am quite sure — we have no chance in the Council at 1.3. Secondly, with your March report, you called for a lot of what is included in our draft: new priorities, defence, migration, border management, increased investment in research, innovation, Erasmus+. This is exactly what we have achieved with our proposal. But they say no cuts in the CAP and cohesion. I tell you quite frankly: if a large net contributor — if the UK's large economy — leaves, then it's a game changer. You cannot pretend to keep all the programmes the same, tackle new tasks and want to add more investment to some new priorities. That is why we believe that moderate cuts, without damaging the programmes, are necessary in cohesion and in agriculture, the two largest programmes. I am convinced that everything else is lagged from realism. Now, over the past few weeks, we have had an intensive exchange on how to get these figures. First of all, the absolute numbers are indisputable. The annual proposed investments are set in euros and cents for the financial years 2014 to 2020 and for the next MFF — without any dispute. Dispute can arise if you want to evaluate cuts as a percentage. What does our calculation look like? We took the MFF 2014 to 2020, and we deducted from each programme what goes to the UK during these years — research projects with Oxford, Cambridge and London, second pillar: CAP for rural areas, direct payments for farmers in the UK; cohesion programmes or even the European Social Fund for regions in the United Kingdom. And so we came to a virtual EU-27 budgetary framework for 2014 to 2020, as farmers in Austria, Poland and Germany cannot expect to get more from the money that has gone to the UK so far to come to them. We have not cut for some programs. We didn't cut Galileo. After all, the investment in satellites for navigation technologies is the same for 27 countries as for 28 countries. Galileo will be more expensive, but it will remain important — so no cut here. Then we compared the last year in this MFR-2020 — and the first year in the next MFF. Because this is what our partners feel and people feel. What do we pay the farmer in 2020 for direct payments per hectare? And what can you pay the year after? And here — in 2020 and then in 2021 — we are coming to cuts in agricultural policy of exactly —4.6%. Since the proposal, if adopted this week, provides for slightly stronger cuts in the second pillar and lower cuts in the first pillar of direct payments, but proposes a little more flexibility for our Member States between the two pillars, we will see cuts of exactly -3.9% in direct payments in 2021. Cohesion is now about the implementing rules that are being discussed by the Commission today. There is a so-called Berlin model, which dates from 1999. This has been updated and modernised each time in the three MFF consultations. We're holding on to that. We wanted to ensure that cohesion policy is not too big winners and too many losers. But one thing can be said: the new Member States, in particular, have used cohesion policy correctly in 2005 to date, have significantly increased their GDP per capita, are coming up to the average. Countries such as Slovakia, the Baltic countries or Poland are getting less money in our MFF proposal for cohesion policy because they have become more competitive because they have grown economically. Others who have been in stagnation longer in recent years, such as Italy, are getting more money. We need a formula for this whole that still bears the idea of solidarity and the strengthening of the weak. I firmly believe that the new Member States will exceed the GDP per capita of the European average in the course of the next MFF — and indirectly can also become so-called net contributors. Cohesion policy has thus shown its success, I believe. They suggest that we abolish the discounts — we do that, but in stages. Even if colleagues in this House who are Members from the Netherlands would be frightened by cancelling the reimbursement of customs duties and discounts from now on tomorrow. This brings me to the final point. Member States' payments increase by more than 30% in nominal form. Why? If you set up a budget for 2019 and compare it to 2018, you have growth rates of 2%, 3% — no one cares. But if you compare the first year of the current MFF 2014 with the last year of the next year — 2027 — you will have 14 years of increase in research salaries, increase the cost of steel for gas pipelines, increase in construction costs for civil engineering, roads, railways and buildings, increase salaries for commissioners and deputies. Therefore, the disadvantage of a seven-year budgetary framework is that the figures are automatically significantly higher in nominal terms, not in real terms. Seven years means seven years of inflation. Makes 11% — 12% nominal increase without real increase in purchasing power. Seven years of GNI increase is +16%. This automatically brings us to a nominal increase of 27 — 28% in the next MFF at the current MFF, without any real increase in purchasing power. This means that +27% is automatically a prerequisite if Europe's budgetary framework is not to lose its relevance. Then comes the Brexit gap, which we want to close half by cuts in the CAP and cohesion areas and halfway through slightly higher payments. This is the third reason for a higher MFF. The fourth reason is the elimination of discounts, which is added for some Member States. And the fifth reason is new tasks. We propose to invest more than 13 billion in defence, to allocate far more for migration, and to increase Frontex to 10 000 employees for border management and control. And all of these reasons — an increase in BNE inflation, no more rebates, the Brexit gap and new challenges — mean that the next budgetary framework will rise nominally — not real — by at least 30% for Member States, and even more than 40% for some. So far a few words of clarification. I am grateful to the House for your work — rapporteurs and other Members of the Committee on Budgets, in all the committees — to address the issue. I want to tell you that farmers and research, mayors and regions, as well as our partners in development aid, want clarity as soon as possible. That is why I will continue to maintain the ambitious timetable from now until Easter next year, when this Parliament completes its work. With the goodwill of Parliament — it is there — and in the European Council, we have a chance to show in March next year that the British are leaving, and yet Europe is showing its will to act and its ability to act on a highly complex issue. I would ask you to help to show this sign of good governance, of European capacity for action, using the example of the multiannual financial framework from now until March next year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Jan OLBRYCHT", "mepid": "28288", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President! Commissioner! The debate on the multiannual financial framework is one of the key debates on the future of the European Union for Parliament. When discussing the longstanding financial perspective, we ask ourselves, which scenario of President Juncker do you want to implement with your proposal? That's the question we ask ourselves today when we wonder not about the numbers, but wonder about what's behind those numbers. Are we facing a widening of priorities at the moment, or are we facing a change in priorities, essentially a change in the priorities of the European Union? At the moment we look at the numbers that come to us, it is clearly apparent that there is a change in priorities, that some of the priorities are being replaced by other priorities. Little of that, there is a change in policies. What we will see today will probably show that there is no reduction in cohesion policy, but there is also a change in cohesion policy, as Commissioner Crețu confirmed yesterday. This is just a different policy. We therefore expect a serious debate from the Council on what Union we expect, what policies are to rely on in the future, not just as much money in the budget, only what European policy is to rely on in the future and how we will carry out some of our tasks. I would like to say at the end, Commissioner, you are calling for our rational behaviour. We uphold one three as a basis for conversation.

You need to be bold, because the eurozone has been suffering with deep divergences for many years. Look to the situation we now have in Italy. We are on the brink of a disaster – an economic, social, political disaster. Some call for leaving the eurozone in order to leave austerity. They are wrong. Others are calling to accept to stay in the eurozone, as it deals with austerity. They are also wrong. The solution we need to have is to reform the eurozone to make it a space where people can invest in the future and have again confidence in the future, and we Social Democrats have a full plan for this, and will be criticising all those who are opposing this necessary reform.

Commissioner! After your speech today, you can note that there is really little left from the optimism with which you presented the draft financial framework for 2021-27. Firstly, because very nervously the increase in the burden was reacted by net payers, I will not be naming prime ministers of countries that have taken a decidedly voice on this issue. In turn, the constraints on expenditure in cohesion policy and in the common agricultural policy have been very badly received in the newly adopted countries into the European Union. If this information is confirmed and all points to the fact that these cuts to Central and Eastern European countries in cohesion policy will be higher than 20%, clearly such a constructed budget will not be able to be adopted. I will just remind you that the original idea of the contributions of wealthy countries to the Cohesion Fund was access to the markets of the newly adopted countries. With this access, these countries have received improbable benefits, these benefits continue so far. Consequently, the proposed constraints on cohesion policy are unsimilar to this original idea.

Economic recovery, although uneven, is there as are growing challenges and new priorities. The urgent need to counter euroscepticism by showing that the EU matters and delivers is there and even some of the most influential Member States said that they were ready to put more money into the budget to fill, and even go beyond, the Brexit hole.  Instead of that, and with the exception of some limited improvements, we have a budget proposal that cuts spending in crucial EU policies and falls short of ambition both in volume and in content. I ask myself: where is the road map and what is the framework for this budget? What is the rationale behind the numbers? If we want the European Union to be the frontrunner in implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, why is there no clear commitment to that end in the MFF proposal? If we want the EU to lead the energy transition and the fight against climate change, why don’t we set priorities and have spending goals that are more ambitious? If we actually agree that the EU should be an instrument to fight against growing social inequalities, why then reduce the European Social Fund by 6% and have more spending in military research, but less in social justice?

The EUR 40 billion that Ms May has agreed to pay over the course of the next few years must help and, of course, as we speak she is desperately scrambling to get us back into a whole series of EU programmes in your next budgetary period and, no doubt, will pay more for that. Perhaps what is even better news, Commissioner, is that the Prime Minister now wants a two-year extension of the transition phase. I can only assume that, if that effectively means full membership for a further two years, that EUR 40 billion would now become EUR 60 billion. I would like your confirmation that extended transition will mean a bigger bill. But perhaps the reality is that Brexit is not the biggest problem that the European Union now faces. Italy, of course, has been mentioned, and they are net contributors to this budget; they pay in about EUR 4 billion every single year. There are signs that in Italy, voters are tiring of paying that money. They question what the euro has done to their economy, they feel they are a victim of the European Union’s immigration policies and, as a result of all this, they voted in a new government, only to find that bullying and hectoring from the European Commission has been listened to by the Italian President. In the last 48 hours their democracy has been traduced. In the past, you managed to bully the Danes, you bullied the Irish, you bullied the Greeks into submission.

First of all, I think this proposal is missing a story, a strategy. What do we want to achieve with this financial framework? What is the message we want to send to Europeans? And above all, how are we going to respond to the challenges and ensure that we are going to fulfil our commitments? I remember Mr Juncker in the last debate saying that the wind was already blowing in favour of the European Union and that it had to be exploited. And after seeing this proposal, another phrase is coming to my mind that “There is no favorable wind if you do not know where it is going.” And we don't have to invent any direction. We have the sustainable development goals, seventeen goals common to the whole planet. And I would like the proposal for a financial framework to have reflected this strategy. Because how are we going to promote responsible production or combat desertification if we reduce agricultural funds by 16%? Or how are we going to reduce inequalities if we reduce cohesion funds by 12%? Or how are we going to end poverty or promote decent work if we reduce the European Social Fund? Or how are we going to achieve equality if we do not have budgets that tell us what the impact of our policies is on the promotion of gender equality or on the empowerment of women and girls? There is none of this in this proposal. I believe that they have limited themselves to balancing the Brexit accounts with some reinforcement in Erasmus and innovation, introducing security as a new priority and cutting the pillars of European policies. We already know that there is reluctance on the part of certain governments. We already know that, in addition to will, resources are needed, and that is why we have made a revolutionary proposal for the European Union's revenues: let companies pay more, let speculators pay and make countries pay for their wealth.

The differences between East and West, between North and South, these differences are not settled, which are bought off. Cleaning up doesn't seem to be possible either. Yes, there are new and important priorities in the European Union: stopping migration, for example, and security. Let us start funding these new priorities effectively — even heavily financed — but in a sensible way, by removing outdated priorities first, by really shifting resources within the European budget. But no, the European Union does not dare to make a strong choice either. There is one choice that Europe dares to make, and that is to ask for more money from its citizens and even introduce new European taxes. Colleagues, that's not how it works.

What works well must continue: cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy and, in particular, rural development. A cut also of 25% is incomprehensible. No one will be able to explain to voters, for example, that the poorest Member States will have higher cuts than the richer Member States. We need solidarity to be a de facto solidarity.

The resolution on which we are going to vote is the reaffirmation of Parliament's demands on the means necessary to meet our future challenges and therefore finance the Union's future programme. It also recalls our intention to negotiate the next multiannual financial framework right now. Finally, it recalls the MFF's unwavering link with own resources because, indeed, money does not grow on trees. I start with a warning: there is no time to waste. But I regret the play of fooling the Commission in presenting its proposal: figures presented in their best light abusively, hidden cuts, elements of language, which are certainly sharpened, but which have not deceived anyone. Let us be serious and responsible, compare what is comparable and validate one method, one, with inflation and without the UK. Faced with Parliament's redemonstrations, the Commission has decided to publish calculations with the real figures. What are they? Less 15% for the CAP, minus 10% for cohesion — the first investment policy — minus 27% for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, minus 6% for the European Social Fund — a priority — and up to minus 45% for the Cohesion Fund. Your real proposal is therefore at 1.08%, which is a share of the European budget in the Union's GDP which, compared to the current situation, is less than 1.13% in the EU27. And of course, solidarity policies sacrificed. I conclude by summarizing Parliament's resolution: on the one hand, who does not see the new challenges facing the European Union? Ecological transition, investment, migration, unemployment, defence, security. Commissioner, let us not lie to the Europeans that Europe will be able to provide solutions without increasing the European budget. Europe is dying of this hypocrisy and this makes the bed of nationalisms. Parliament is clear: let us invest in European ambition.

Common agricultural policy is not just for farmers. Consumers benefit from it too — all of us. Thanks to the CAP, there's cheaper food. Its quality and availability is ensured.

It provides raw materials for industry. Finally, agriculture is food. Food is food and food is health. Agriculture also has an environmental and climate dimension. So it can be said that this is an agri-environmental-food policy. So the funds allocated to the CAP serve a number of purposes. On the other hand, you have to remember the lack of young farmers and the aging of the countryside. How could it be proposed to reduce the CAP budget by up to 15% in this situation? The share of the CAP in the entire budget is expected to decrease from the current 37% to 28% at the end of the period 2021 to 2027.

I would particularly like to highlight the problem of demographic decline, that is, low birth rate and population ageing. We must also face this very serious challenge from the European Union. Throughout Europe, the fertility rate is already below 2% per woman, which does not ensure generational relay. In Galicia — in Spain — for example, it is a very serious problem. Therefore, when setting the criteria for the allocation of funds between regions, I believe that the criterion of regional GDP per capita should be complemented by others, such as demographic decline. Also with the unemployment.

Together with my staff, I have included your speeches, your expectations, your suggestions. We will evaluate them over the next few days and they will certainly be a complementary basis for the Commission's position and the work of the Commission. There has been praise from very few Members for our proposal — thank you very much for that. There has been criticism by many from all directions — from all directions. And when I analyse this criticism, I come to the conclusion: in the middle of the criticism is the Commission's proposal that the Commission's proposal is in the middle of your critical speeches, disappointments, expectations or statements that it is unfair. If I were to imagine now that 26 other ministers of finance or Europe would sit here and have their say, then — I say — the picture would be even more colorful. The criticism would be even more diverse, and again the Commission's proposal would be at the centre of all critical expectations. I will briefly turn to the rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen, we as the Commission, in all programmes, investments and incentives, are committed to keeping an eye on the interests of our citizens and taxpayers and to prevent fraud, infidelity and corruption in the budget — through OLAF, through EPPO, through our own controls, through close cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control and with the European Court of Auditors. And if then there can be a dispute and you have to reclaim funds because of incorrect settlements or fraud or because a project has been misdescribed, then one is dependent on the independence of the courts, on an independent third party. And if this should not be respected in Member States or regions, if the independence of the judiciary from legislation or government is not ensured, then we would have a lack of confidence in fair decisions. That is why the rule of law is inextricably linked to a European budget and the aim of preventing corruption, fraud and infidelity to European taxpayers' money. That is why we are advertising the proposal for conditionality in the rule of law. Secondly, some of your speeches emerged what is much more emphasised in the Council: I want my money back — the issue of so-called net contributors. This may have been a comprehensible policy budget at a time in previous budgetary frameworks, when agriculture and cohesion accounted for more than 80% of all expenditure, where the return of funds to farmers, rural areas, structural programmes, regions, municipalities could be relatively clearly traced. With our proposal, however, cohesion and agriculture account for just under 60% of the budget framework. Tasks such as border management, such as development aid, such as migration, such as research, are collectively larger than agriculture or cohesion alone. But if I operate border guards in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus, no money will go back to Paris and Berlin. But external border management is in the common European interest. If I strengthen development aid to Africa by financing human dignity to people in need in Turkey, no penny will go back, but I believe we have taken into account our Christian commitments, human dignity and perhaps also the number of people who come to us through smugglers or even alone want to diminish. That is why this so-called net payer bill is increasingly fake. I therefore firmly reject them. Or if a research project is taking place for Philips, Siemens or Bosch, and they have their research center in Budapest, and not in Amsterdam or in Munich or Stuttgart — is this money a return to Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands? It is no longer possible for these global players to show whether the money for research returns to the Member State where the company has its registered office. It often goes to other locations within the European Union. Thirdly, we focused on only proposing programs to support projects only finance to spend money only when there is added value. For example, defense. We do not want more military, we want to use the taxpayer's money more efficiently for our external security. We can show that some tenders for a gun, a tank, a drone to maintain our external security are better European than 27 times in individual silos. This means that the billions we are proposing in the European budget can reduce the burden on national budgets. So the proposal is: give us a euro from your budget, we put together the 27 amounts, write down together, have economies of scale, save in the interests of the taxpayer. It is not about more military, it is about more efficient investment in defence at European level. Then, on the question of ambition raised by Mr Arthuis, not 1.3%, 1.14%, but 2% or 3%, which was also supported by Mrs Grossetête, Mr Rübig and Mrs Trüpel. I'm not far from this. Just in concrete terms, Mr Arthuis: France was the toughest representative of cuts in the budget discussions for 2018, it was France that fought for every euro and every million cuts. My request is therefore: let us not only talk about an ambitious budget in Strasbourg, let us fight for the corresponding revenue within the limits of our limited possibilities in Paris and Berlin. This also applies to Mr Rübig and the ÖVP-led government in Austria. What I dislike is that you perform strongly here and either do not perceive your authority or have no authority at home. I am addressing the German Government. A new departure for Europe, co-formulated by Martin Schulz. I very much welcome that. But my friend Olaf Scholz says publicly: “Germany does not give more than 1.0 of GNI.” And to deal with this in Berlin, as a Social Democrat, as a member of the SPD, as an S&D member, I consider it imperative. In part, we distinguish worlds between this House and our authority in Berlin, Paris or Vienna, in the capitals of the European Union. Mrs Gardiazabal Rubial asked me: what are the guidelines of the draft budget? Finally, I would like to mention four: economic strength and competitiveness. Secondly, when you are economically strong, it is about solidarity. Because the one who is economically strong can also share, must also share, must show solidarity with weaker people in Europe, with weaker Member States and citizens. Thirdly, it is about sustainability and, fourthly, it is about internal and external security. Economic strength and competitiveness, solidarity, sustainability and security are for me four guidelines which I believe does justice to this draft.

I have taken good note of them. I have received three questions from my former respected colleague, Mr Geier, and I will try to be very brief. He had three questions concerning the communication with Parliament and the Council concerning the system of own resources and also the timeline regarding the forthcoming negotiations. As I already said during my intervention, I can assure you that the Bulgarian Presidency, as well as the future Presidencies, are committed to regular and frank talks with Parliament. The Bulgarian, Austrian and Romanian Presidencies have a clear mandate to meet and brief the representatives of Parliament before and after each session of the General Affairs Council (GAC) when the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is discussed, in line with the Treaty provisions. We have already had such meetings on 14 May, before the start of the General Affairs Council (GAC) meeting at high political level, and afterwards with a follow-up meeting at ambassador level on 22 May. Furthermore, when the Multiannual Financial Framework is on the agenda of the European Council, the President of the European Parliament also will be given the opportunity to contribute to the discussion by addressing the Heads of State or Government at the beginning of their meeting, as is actually the case generally. After each meeting of the European Council, its President will present a report also for your kind attention. Concerning the question about the system of own resources, I have to say that the discussions in the Council’s Working Party are beginning today, so you will understand that the work at technical level is just beginning. It would therefore be premature from the side of the Presidency to express itself on this issue. Concerning the timeline, I have to underline that the leaders discussed the calendar of negotiations at their informal meeting in February. They decided that we would advance as fast as possible with this file, but it was also clear from the discussion that the possibility of an early agreement was very much dependent on the proposals put forward. They will return to the issue of timing once again, at the earliest in June. In this context, the Presidency has started work immediately on the Commission proposal so as to advance work as much as possible, and the next Presidencies are committed to working intensively as well.

Moreover, the decision on the MFF will undeniably need to provide the Union with the funding necessary to meet its most important challenges and to implement its policy priorities over the next seven-year period. In this context, I consider it fundamental to uphold the EP's hard position on the necessary level of funding for key EU policy strategies to enable them to achieve their objectives.

At the political time in which the European Union (EU) is experiencing, with positive economic indicators and worrying political signals, it is crucial that the multiannual financial framework translates a mobilising and proximity vision capable of fostering convergence, strengthening cohesion and increasing competitiveness in markets global.

To come to the conclusion of this work that was so difficult, it was for me for a long time, for twenty-seven months, a dream. It was an impossible mission and, together, we made it possible. At least that is what I want us to do today. We wanted to put in place a very clear political line: for equal work, equal pay, in the same place of work. Finally, it is this equality between European citizens, this European justice that we wanted to achieve. It is the result of unprecedented collaboration between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. I would like to greet my co-rapporteur, my friend, Agnes Jongerius. We worked together, hand in hand, and sometimes squeezing our teeth to get there. We wanted this agreement! However, this determination has been accompanied by a method of listening, dialogue and respect for each other's positions, because I know how many different positions exist in the spans of this Chamber. There are the positions of the political groups, there are the different positions of the Member States, but between us here, and that is the role of the European Parliament, we must be able to reach consensus, find a way of agreement, and we have respected all shadow rapporteurs to achieve this. We were leaving from afar, from a fracture, downright. East-West fracture. Is that what we wanted? We were starting from a divide of eleven Member States which refused to reopen the revision of this directive. Were we going to stay with our arms and do nothing? No, we had to give a new scope to the free movement of services, to put an end to all the speeches that, little or less, want both of us to retreat into a national space. It was necessary to build a balance. This is what we have done here in the European Parliament, by proposing to the Council and, always with your presence, Commissioner, as with the presence of Minister Rousinova, who has always been extremely committed, as with the Estonian Presidency which preceded you, this profound commitment, because we wanted, for the citizens of Estonia. Europeans, emerge from an unhealthy situation politically, economically unhealthy and socially unhealthy. Social dumping is not our goal, unfair competition between companies is not our goal. Our goal is to strengthen a social Europe, a healthy, strong economic Europe with fundamental values. That is what we came to in this agreement.

Up to this day, we see colleagues on construction sites, in agriculture, in shipyards, and many more sectors, being turned into competitors, not because they want to be, but because some are less expensive for their employers than others. With this new posting directive this will change. We will put an end to both the undercutting of wages and the inhumane situations we sometimes see when it comes to lodging, and we can put an end to unfair competition between those companies that play by the rules and those who bend the rules to their own benefit.  Therefore, I am grateful for the courage and the political will of so many, because otherwise we would not have ended up here today.  First of all, I want to mention Commissioner Thyssen. I think she feels in her bones that the situation that workers are currently facing is unfair. Secondly, I would like to thank all ministers of the Member States who really aimed at reaching a fair compromise during the concluding negotiations under the Bulgarian Presidency, and if you allow me, I would like to single out my colleague and former Dutch Social Affairs Minister Lodewijk Asscher.  But without the good cooperation of Elisabeth Morin-Chartier, without the shadow rapporteurs, without the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, without all the MEPs involved, and of course without all the staff, we would not have made these steps towards a fairer European labour market. It is only together that we can curb the race to the bottom when it comes to wages, working conditions and social security systems. Undercutting wages and unfair competition leads to resentment from citizens, and this has to stop. I think the revision is beneficial not only to all European workers and to all honest companies, but it is also good for the European project as a whole. The freedom of movement of workers should become a right of workers again, and with this new directive we accomplish this. Workers’ rights are explicitly protected. So instead of being competitors, colleagues can become colleagues again when today we vote in favour. We can ensure a fairer labour market and we can turn the slogan ‘Equal pay for equal work at the same workplace’ into reality. With this step I think we are also taking a big leap towards a social Europe, to which we are committed under the social pillar.

The revision of the Posting of Workers Directive goes to the heart of the internal market. The European project has been built around the internal market, which is the European Union’s major achievement. But the internal market is not only about goods and services but also about Europe’s work force. In order for the European project to be successful, the internal market has to be fair and also perceived as fair by our citizens. Fairness means equal rules for workers when moving across borders and fair competition between companies. Following the commitments made by President Juncker to this House, we came in March 2016 with a proposal implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work at the same place. I would like today to pay tribute to the two co-rapporteurs, Elisabeth Morin-Chartier and Agnes Jongerius. With their clear understanding of the challenges, their determination and their spirit of compromise, they made it possible to reach an agreement with the Council on our proposal. Also, thanks to the shadows and to the Employment Committee, its Chair and staff. The text you adopt today is a substantive improvement of the rules set out in the 1996 Directive, both for posted workers and for companies. Posted workers will be guaranteed equal pay for equal work carried out at the same place. Companies will benefit from a level playing field that will stop a race to the bottom on working conditions. The revised Directive will tackle fraud and abuses. I will be very clear: this Directive is indeed protecting workers’ rights, but it does so without introducing any discrimination of cross-border service providers. The Directive ensures that undertakings provide services in another Member State under the same conditions as imposed by that state on its own nationals. To dissipate all doubts, I tell you that this Directive is not protectionist; its aim is to preserve fairness on the internal market, in order to preserve our citizens’ confidence in the internal market. That is why the importance of this Directive should not be underestimated. We need it to prevent Member States from having recourse to protectionist measures that would undermine our internal market and, finally, our welfare. This is the reason why in the Council this text has gained support from a large majority of Member States across Europe, from east to west and from north to south.

My Group felt that we should wait until the Enforcement Directive was fully implemented before bringing further legislation. Nevertheless, we have tried to be constructive, and our priorities have been clear: we must avoid dividing Europe between east and west, we must strike a good balance between the freedom to provide services across the EU and the protection of workers, and we must avoid creating legal ambiguity and uncertainty. Unfortunately, the trilogue agreement has failed in these areas. Even all references to Rome I, the law applicable to contractual obligations, have been removed, so we are in danger of undermining the competitive position of companies, especially SMEs, providing services in EU Member States other than their own. Some provisions in the final text exceed the scope of the Directive and cause legal uncertainty, so the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) Group has tabled an amendment to try and bring some clarity to businesses who are lawfully trying to provide a cross-border service.

The popular slogan “equal pay for equal work in the same place,” which made the directive visible across the states, was suddenly, from day to day, to straighten everything out. Does anyone really think that by this procedure we will miraculously solve any problems in the labour market? I don't think so. For over two years now, we have been discussing whether a truck driver or a construction worker sent abroad will have a wage such or poppy. But wages are not at the heart of the problem at all. This is about the future of Europe and its values. It's a debate about what kind of Europe we actually want. I now ask you: Do we want to maintain the free movement of people, goods and services in Europe? Or do we want to allow Europe to become a protective market where it will only be possible to move in one way? The new rules will severely restrict cross-border service delivery and undermine one of the fundamental values of the European Union. My stance certainly doesn't mean that I don't want to indulge our workers with a better wage, and that I defend the unfair practices of companies. Precisely the opposite. But try, at least for a moment, to look at the real situation in the labour market through the eyes of those who are real job creators. What do they really need? Are these other regulations that will tie their hands even more? Or simple and effective solutions that will simply be applied in practice? We must, after all, take into account the economic possibilities and consider the impact of our decisions on all, that is, businesses, on employers that are the backbone of the European labour market. Particularly in the transport sector, the situation is really critical and I am sincerely sorry that some colleagues very quickly forgot about the promise about setting the specific rules of transport on which we are in of the trialogue clearly agreed. From the beginning, my aim as shadow rapporteur of this report was to achieve the necessary balance between maintaining free movement of services and protecting the rights of workers. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. For these reasons, I personally cannot support the directive.

Before assessing the outcome of the trilogue negotiations, we should put ourselves in the position of workers in the EU. Imagine that you have been training for years, imagine doing a good job, but your salary is stagnating. But you need more money because your rent has become more expensive. Imagine then sitting with your boss in the salary negotiation, and he says to you: I won't pay you any more wages, and in case of doubt, I'll just get posted workers, they'll do that down for a third. Or imagine working on a construction site, you did the same training as your colleagues, you work as hard as those, but still you get a third less pay. That can't be true! So we wonder that there is creaking in the European Union? We are therefore surprised that the most voted for Brexit in the UK, particularly in the regions where the negative effects of globalisation are most felt are felt? We have made the use of workers far too easy in recent years. We have made it far too easy for the right to stirred up hatred and resentment. And, damn it, it is our duty as legislators in the European Union to finally put a stop to this! That is why we need good and fair minimum standards, and this result is a breakthrough in this area.

Let me start by saying quite clearly: does the new directive solve the issue of social dumping? No. Does the new directive ensure equal pay for equal work in the same workplace? No, neither does it. We have to be completely honest with the citizens. A labour market where workers and employers negotiate agreements voluntarily on the one hand, and on the other, a single market where employers move workers around and use pay as a competitive element — the two things fit together really badly. That is why it is a question of whether you want to support the single market, or you want to support workers and solidarity and equality. The new directive is still based on the internal market and freedom of movement, which is why we do not get far enough. However, there are also good elements of the directive: we have some of the worst timelines removed from the old directive, we will have better opportunities to create equal pay, we will have better opportunities for trade unions and for Member States to fight for a level playing field for all workers.

There are some good initiatives that we support: equal pay and pay or, even, supervision of duration. But, unfortunately, you are complicit in this unfair competition: there is no specific provision on the hourly rate — posted workers will therefore be paid on the basis of 35 hours, even if they make 60 hours. There is no provision on subcontracting and temporary employment who recruit all over the world, like those Ecuadorians engaged in Spain to work in France. Similarly, there is no provision on the liability of contracting companies in the event of fraud. However, these frauds are numerous, not to mention the problems of cascading detachment.

And now my call is to the UK Government to stop dragging its feet and to ensure that these rules are implemented as quickly as possible, to ensure that British workers and their foreign co-workers can benefit from a fairer single market as colleagues and not as competitors.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 122, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "— Madam President, the Posting of Workers Directive in the context of the provision of services has been used in substance to legalise social dumping.

I told you that this Directive is necessary to preserve the internal market. This is not about needless administrative burden for companies. Nothing in the revised rules requires companies to change their treatment of business trips. It is about ensuring equal pay for work carried out when companies provide a service cross-border, so that posted workers are paid according to the same rules as local workers and companies benefit from a level playing field. Dear Members of Parliament, labour mobility is a good thing. Free movement is the right that European citizens cherish most, but it must be organised.

The idea is for them to be treated no worse than locals and not to be exploited by both the posting and host party as a result of their hiring at the lowest hourly rates. Poland has already introduced the same principle for workers from Ukraine, i.e. the principle of equality between them in rights and obligations with Polish workers. Undoubtedly, the introduction of new regulations on delegated workers will return some of the many half million people of citizens to a country where they are guilty of quickly finding a fair job for a similar wage as in the country.

You are, Mr President, the third African leader to address this House within a year. Your visit is part of a framework of bringing together and strengthening our partnership with, on the one hand, the African Union and its member states on the other. First of all, I would like to commend the extraordinary work you have done in your country over the last few years: the emergence of “the worst health crisis in the modern world”, as defined by WHO in reference to Ebola, democratic consolidation and human rights, including the abolition of the death penalty, economic development, with a growth rate of over 6%, making Guinea one of the most dynamic economies on the African continent. However, many challenges remain: the fight against corruption, the lack of infrastructure, the improvement of the business climate, youth unemployment, which drives many Guineans to emigrate to Europe. The European Union has a role to play here, because insecurity, climate change, unemployment and migration are common challenges. We must therefore give ourselves the means of our ambitions. That is why we are advocating for economic diplomacy, for more private sector investment. In the next multiannual financial framework, the European Parliament is asking for more funds in order to have a real plan for Africa, a new 'Marshall Plan'. This should contribute to economic diversification and the creation of a manufacturing base to enable the absorption of newcomers into the labour market. We therefore support a real national development plan in this direction. I would also like to thank you for the outstanding work you have done at the head of the African Union. Important and concrete successes marked your presidency: Morocco's return to the African Union, the impetus for the creation of an African free trade zone, an indispensable pillar for the integration of the continent, and the organization of the Abidjan Summit, which marked a decisive turning point in our relations.

At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude for your honour in welcoming me on an official visit to your prestigious institution, where I came for the first time to receive the passport of freedoms. Over the years and investments of the European Union, your Assembly has established itself as a legislative body capable of effectively responding to the legitimate concerns of European citizens and contributing to the search for solutions to the challenges facing the world. In this regard, I am pleased to express our gratitude for your continued support for the efforts of developing countries, including strengthening the rule of law, good governance, as well as in combating irregular migration and climate change. Excellencies, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, since my accession to the supreme judiciary of my country in December 2010, Guinea has strengthened its democratic process, notably through the establishment of the regalian institutions such as the National Assembly, the Constitutional Court , the Court of Auditors, the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, the Economic and Social Council and the High Communication Authority. These institutions, now fully operational, operate independently and with strict respect for democratic principles and values. We have also established a constant political dialogue, with the participation of all political parties, civil society, administration and development partners. This climate of dialogue has greatly contributed to the calming of the socio-political space and to the construction of peace and stability. All this contributes to the preservation of Guinea's many democratic achievements in recent years. We also maintain a permanent relationship with the European Union, in accordance with Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, to which my country is a party. For example, the second session of the framework for consultation held in Conakry in March 2017 addressed issues related to the preservation of democracy, the fight against corruption and impunity, migration and official development assistance that the European Union provides to our country. We welcome this framework for exchanges between our country and the European Union, which promotes mutual understanding in our political, economic and social cooperation. It facilitates the definition of common priorities and principles and strengthens the links between the various areas of cooperation enshrined in the Cotonou Agreement. Excellencies, Mr President, Members, ladies and gentlemen, during my tenure at the head of the African Union in 2017, our continental organization has worked to address challenges ranging from issues of peace and security on the continent, to institutional reform and financing of the organization, with a view to ensuring that the African Union was in 2017. strengthen our credibility and dignity in dealing with international problems. The ongoing reform should allow us, in the long term, to make our organization more efficient, to promote and consolidate our financial autonomy, whether for the functioning of the institution or for the financing of projects and programmes included in the 10-year plan for the implementation of Agenda 2063. I remain convinced that Africa is stronger when it speaks with one voice. I have therefore appointed Champion Heads of State to serve as spokespersons for our Union on all specific issues of continental concern. Furthermore, African integration, which is at the heart of our Union's Agenda 2063, has taken on an irreversible momentum with the launch of the single air transport market in Africa and, more recently, the launch of the agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area. Indeed, in the long term, we want to build a stable, peaceful and secure Africa, composed of states with inclusive, efficient and competitive economies on the global market and whose growth benefits all citizens. We want to make Africa an emerging continent, with a single market with efficient structures while avoiding competition between its states. To do this, we necessarily want to invest substantially in infrastructure, particularly in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors, in order to accelerate the transformation of our economies. That is why we launched the African Renewable Energy Initiative at COP21 in 2015, with the objective of providing our continent with 300 gigawatts of energy generation capacity by 2030 and significantly increasing the use of renewable energy. I would like to thank the European Union for the valuable support it continues to give us in making this initiative a reality, which I have the honour to coordinate on behalf of Africa and of which I chair the Governing Body. Excellencies, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a strategic partner for Africa, not only because of its geographical proximity to our continent, but also because of its security, economic and humanitarian cooperation with Africa. The close cooperation between the African Union and the European Union deserve to be emphasized. The third African Union-European Union Summit, held in Abidjan in November 2017, under my co-chairmanship, on the theme “Investing in Youth for Accelerated Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development”, marked the willingness of the leaders of our continents to move further towards harmonizing youth relations. This summit not only allowed us to thoroughly review our partnership, but also set our common priorities in the four strategic areas: peace and security, cooperation in the field of governance, mobility and migration, and economic prospects for young Africans and Europeans. Our cooperation with Europe on migration and mobility will be strengthened by focusing on tackling the root causes of irregular migration, namely development issues and trafficking in human beings. We welcome the adoption, at the Valletta Summit in November 2015, of the initial $1.800 billion Emergency Trust Fund to support our States' efforts to stabilize our young people on the African continent. In particular, we welcome the launch of the Marshall Plan by Mrs Merkel at our last meeting in Berlin, and are confident that the Marshall Plan will promote win-win cooperation. Of course, we have said that if there is a genuine Marshall plan, the European Union must devote a share of its GDP comparable to that which the United States once devoted to Europe. The European Union's new external investment plan, set up and adopted by the European Parliament in 2017 and with €44 billion mobilizable resources by 2020, will support our sustainable development efforts and the creation of new opportunities for youth. In the same vein, I welcome the European Union's contribution to the financing of the Integra programme in Guinea amounting to EUR 65 million through the resources of the Trust Fund to Combat the Root Causes of Irregular Migration. This programme will support the Guinean Government's efforts to integrate young people into the various economic sectors of Guinea through the creation of new employment opportunities. Excellencies, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea in recent years has accelerated and diversified in various fields, which has contributed to improving governance, the development of infrastructure and human capital, preserving the environment or improving the management of the fisheries sector. This assistance has already enabled us to meet the major challenges in terms of economic and social development and the strengthening of the rule of law, including reform of the justice sector and defence and security efforts, as well as the transformation of our administration to make it more efficient, modern and efficient. I cannot ignore the valuable assistance that the different States of the European Union have given us during the terrible ordeal we have had to go through with the Ebola epidemic. I would like to thank the European Parliament and all the Member States for this assistance. Through you, I would like to express to the European Union and its institutions our deep gratitude for the valuable and constant support given to our country. I remain convinced that the partnership between the European Union and Guinea will strengthen and diversify, particularly in favour of the implementation of the National Economic and Social Development Plan PNDES 2007-2020, which was presented to all our development partners last November in Paris at the consultative group meeting. The programme, which is the unique framework for our partners, is based on four pillars: promoting good governance for sustainable development, sustainable and inclusive economic transformation, inclusive human capital development, and sustainable management of natural capital. Despite the undeniable progress on the ground of democracy, my country remains a victim of the image of its past. We again count on the support of the European Union to enable us to achieve the objectives contained in our PNDES, which aims to put Guinea permanently on the path to sustainable development. Long live cooperation between Guinea and the European Union, long live cooperation between the African Union and the European Union, long live international cooperation!

When defending the interests of artisanal fisheries, in fact, optimization of the fish supply chain represents a crucial battle. The general concentration of the market and the rise of supermarkets, which are the most widely used distribution systems by consumers, have a negative impact on artisanal fishing which — let's remember — employs nearly 78 000 fishermen across Europe, more than half of them in Italy alone. Artisanal fishermen are increasingly victims of the appreciation of first-selling fish and the rising cost of fuel, but also not always uniform and regular fishing, in the face of fierce competition from foreign fish companies. Therefore, in order to fit into the new market segments, they need forms of aid and financial support. They need to speed up the time of the allocation process of funds: for example, if the fisheries operator is enabled to carry out the activity for the Member State, it should be automatically eligible to access funds without having to prove it every time.

It allows a timely and effectively response to labour market needs, it stimulates innovation and development and is a vehicle for transferring and upgrading skills. To properly function it needs public support. This is why it is so important to address legitimate concerns and to tackle abuse, but this can also be done without falling into the trap of simplistic slogans, creating red tape, shocking cost competition and jeopardising the single market.

Well over a hundred Palestinians have been killed since March, including several minors, several thousands have been injured, and hundreds will suffer life-long disabilities. Today, we have seen heavy mortar fire from Gaza that reached an Israeli kibbutz. No one can be indifferent to this tragedy. We need a political solution that stops the violence. Israel has the right to defend its legitimate security interests and its sovereignty. But every response should be proportionate and the High Representative has called on the Israelis to avoid the use of live fire against unarmed protesters unless there is a real and immediate threat to life. The Palestinians have the full right to protest peacefully. At the same time, we have also stressed that Hamas and those leading demonstrations in Gaza must ensure that they remain strictly non—violent, and they must not exploit the protests for other means. In five public statements we have urged all parties to refrain from actions that would lead to the loss of life. We have also engaged through our diplomatic channels. We heard different versions of the facts and different narratives about what was happening from Israelis and Palestinians. Our judgment should always be defined by facts, not emotions. That is why we have said since the beginning that an independent and transparent investigation is needed to shed light on events and possible violations by all parties. The priority right now is for all parties to avoid any action that could spark new violence and lead to further loss of life. The first step to reduce tensions is to mitigate the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where there is record unemployment and an economy on the brink of collapse. Gaza’s health system is under extreme pressure in treating the injured. Humanitarian access to Gaza and medical referrals to hospitals elsewhere must be allowed to save lives. The Commission has allocated an additional EUR 3 million for an emergency aid package for Gaza and the health, water and sanitation sectors. Second, we must speed up investments in infrastructure and job creation, as discussed in the two recent meetings of the ad hoc liaison committee. This is key to countering despair and frustration. There has not yet been the progress we had wanted and hoped to see in Gaza. Israel has to do its part. Real progress requires progress on movement and access and the possibility of trading. Removing Israeli restrictions would be more helpful than any increase in aid. The Paris Protocol agreed between the parties should be fully implemented, indeed updated. The Palestinian Authority must also play its part and fully live up to its responsibilities for the people in Gaza. This means working actively for reconciliation, under Egyptian auspices, to reunite Gaza and the West Bank under one legitimate Palestinian authority. The only realistic perspective for peace, security and growth in the region remains the two—state solution. and the two states can only be achieved through meaningful negotiations on the basis of the 1967 borders, with West Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel and East Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Palestine. No one can deny the historic ties of the Jewish people to Jerusalem, and the same is true for the ties of the Palestinian people to the city. Precisely because of Jerusalem’s unique history, its status can only be solved through negotiations between the parties. This is what we have repeated to our American counterparts since President Trump’s decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem. No one but the two parties can take Jerusalem off the table. We in the European Union have also said that we will continue to respect the international consensus on Jerusalem embodied in UN Security Council Resolution 478, including on the location of diplomatic representations, until the status of Jerusalem is agreed by the parties. What has happened near the Gaza fence and in Jerusalem in the past weeks reminds us that what we urgently need is to reopen a path that may eventually lead to peace and security for all people in the region.

Indeed, the violence instigated by Hamas cannot be attributed to the decision of the United States to inaugurate its embassy in Jerusalem. In our resolution last month, we clearly recognised that the protests that started on 30 March were orchestrated by Hamas, a terrorist organisation recognised as such by Europe. Even today, thirty rockets have targeted Israel from Gaza, and it is still Hamas. Of the people who were killed in the protests two weeks ago, fifty were recognized by Hamas as its agents and rewards were offered for participation in these violent protests. In our resolution, however, we have clearly rejected terrorist acts and incitement to violence as incompatible with progress towards the two-State solution. On the question of Jerusalem, we should not seek clarity in the East of Europe, in Romania's position. We had, not one, but two different answers from the authorities. Consequently, the internal conflict over the location of our embassy has disappointed both Israelis and Palestinians. Romania — I recall — was one of the seven Member States to recognise the Palestinian State. There was an expectation for us to continue to look at Jerusalem as the capital of both states.

It murders its political opponents and abducts, tortures and kills those it defines as collaborators. The only media allowed is under Hamas control.

In this context, we also strongly condemn the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Their act is a flagrant violation of international law, serves to perpetuate occupation, circumvents efforts to reach a two-state solution, and, worse, sparks a new cycle of bloodshed against the Palestinian civilian people. Israeli state terrorism, with inhumane violence against peaceful demonstrators, murdered 117 and severely injured thousands of Palestinian civilians, including children. 128 states of the UN General Assembly have condemned the transfer of the US Embassy to Jerusalem and ask to be canceled. We believe that the European Union's statement, which rejected President Trump's decision, was positive. However, we stress that the European Union must cease its policy of equal distance and equating the perpetrator with the victim.

The strong blame aroused, even at a diplomatic level, by the inauguration of the US embassy was dutiful, but it is reductive to relegate the Israeli-Palestinian issue to all this. In fact, the US move to Jerusalem is just one reason that has reignited the clashes. One cannot forget the effects of Israel's decade-long embargo to the Gaza Strip, but above all the desire for homecoming that Palestinians have been waiting for seventy years. Finally, it serves to frame the issue into a broader geopolitical exchequer. My impression is that Netanyahu, the Saudi king and Trump constitute a truly dangerous miscellany for that whole region. It is therefore important that the European Union stands firm in opposing these drifts, continuing to make its own pressure felt and exploit its relations, including economic ones, with Israel to push Netanyahu to embark on a path of peace. In this context, I also take this opportunity to forcefully ask the Israeli Supreme Court to review its ruling and not to proceed with the forcible transfer of the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar and to demolition of the school of Gomme, realized by the Italian NGO “Vento di terra”, which has 160 children from 5 communities.

The basic stance that a two-state solution is the only possible one, with Jerusalem as the capital of both Palestine and Israel, because Jerusalem belongs to Christians, Muslims and Jews and thus both Palestinians and Israelis. We can't step off from that grounding. In contrast, we need to start asking critical questions about what we can actually accomplish and what we can do. What difference can we make? For example, we have the EU's association agreement with Israel. It has been seen as saying it would be a step towards a just peace. Has it really been? Have we seen any of that? Has it perhaps even been just the opposite, that it has favored expansive settler policy? All EU association agreements are conditional for human rights to be respected. Have we really been able to claim that in a clear way? Chapter Two of the agreement with Israel clearly states that human rights must be respected. If that doesn't happen, the deal could be lifted by the EU. Maybe we'd get a little tougher, even if we don't let go of our grounding stance. The European Union is one of the largest aid donors to the Palestinians. We invest; Israel destroys these investments all the time. It can be about water supply, it can be about roads, it can be about anything possible.

From this debate, I have concluded that we all share a common interest in using EU diplomatic power and EU instruments to their full potential in support of the Middle East peace process and with the objective of a negotiated two-state solution. Our priority at the moment is for all sides to avoid any actions that could lead to further violence or loss of life. Further escalation of an already tense and complex situation would only cause more suffering and will make the prospects for peace and security even more remote. It would be a gift to the extremists and to those who are not interested in peace and security and living together but are, in fact, opposed to it.  Ensuring humanitarian access to Gaza is also urgent in order to avoid the number of casualties rising further. Certainly, there is a need for an independent and transparent investigation into the incidents, not least focused on the use of live ammunition, so that we can understand what has happened and why.  Finally, it remains essential to restore a political horizon and hope for people on the ground. Wisdom and courage are needed in order to go back to the negotiations for a lasting political solution for the sake of both Israelis and Palestinians.

What is needed to start again is a genuine dialogue: this is the only way to see peace and prosperity in this country. It has been over a month since the announced reform of the social security system, the first protests and the first violence against protesters. Tens of people have been killed since then, many of them students. Let me start by conveying again our sincere condolences to the families of the victims, and expressing hopes for a quick recovery to all those who were injured.  Immediately after the unrest began, we reacted publicly and condemned the violence. The people of Nicaragua have the full right to protest peacefully and to freely express their disagreement. It is vital that the police forces act with maximum restraint, that armed groups are reined in, and that all perpetuators of violence are brought to justice.  Over the last weekend, violence unfortunately escalated again: we have seen reports of more casualties among peaceful protesters, resulting from attacks by armed and organised mobs. Yesterday two universities were attacked, as well as a pro—government radio station. Participants in the national dialogue – be they students, private sector representatives or bishops – continue to endure threats and intimidation. These threats must immediately stop, as must violence in the country. The Nicaraguan authorities agreed to invite the Inter—American Commission on Human Rights to the country, and this was a really positive development. It is now essential that the 15 recommendations by the Commission are followed up. Yesterday’s meeting of the ‘three plus three’ mixed commission, with government and opposition representatives, has agreed to start implementing the first three recommendations: first, a halt to repression and arbitrary detentions; second, respect for the right to protest peacefully; and, third, an independent, international investigation into the violence to guarantee truth and justice. This is an important first step and we hope this decision will be implemented with no delay. We also consider it important that the government authorises a visit by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the country. Meanwhile, all efforts must be made to push the national dialogue forward, and let me thank the Conference of Bishops for the important and crucial role it played in these very difficult circumstances.  After three sessions, last week the dialogue was unfortunately suspended due to a lack of progress. Yesterday’s meeting of the mixed commission has agreed to restart the dialogue later this week, and this is another positive sign and surely very positive news. We very much hope that dialogue will indeed restart as announced: it is the best hope to find a way out of the current crisis. To achieve this objective, several guarantees should be provided to build trust among participants in the dialogue. The first step should be to ensure the necessary security to all those who take part in this dialogue.  On another front, the European Union is also following very closely the dialogue between the Organisation of American States and Nicaragua on political and electoral reforms, which was initiated after the 2017 municipal elections. This process should take into account the demands presented by civil society at the national dialogue, as well as the latest recommendations issued by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  The people of Nicaragua are asking for greater social justice and increased political accountability, and they have the right to have their voice heard. On our side, as the European Union, we are ready to support a broad dialogue on democracy and justice between all sectors of society and the Government in Nicaragua. We care about Nicaragua and its people and we are already engaged in the country in support of human rights, education, economic growth and in the fight against climate change. Our Latin American friends know we are a partner for peace and for reconciliation, and we have already accompanied several peace dialogues in the continent. If our help is requested, we are ready to step up our engagement to help overcome the crisis. Let us help Nicaragua end this crisis through dialogue and mediation, before more blood is unfortunately spilt.

There was a need to protest and the village has gone out into the streets.

Security forces that hurt their citizens are not the legitimate protectors of a nation. A president who violates the human rights of his people is not his representative. Any country that murders unarmed protesters is a dictatorship. While many abroad are surprised by the sudden turn of events in the brutal repression seen in the news, let us be clear: Nicaragua has not been a democracy for a long time. Repression in the past month is the culmination of years of authoritarianism, repression and fragmentation of democratic processes and institutions. The authorities must immediately cease any form of violence against demonstrators and release all prisoners arbitrarily detained. Negotiations must bring about real change; a change that all Nicaraguans yearn for; a change that will only be achieved through free and fair elections.

We are very concerned from the Commission side about the US unilateral initiatives that are undermining the multilateral trading system. The temporary exemption for the EU from US measures on steel and aluminium runs until 31 May. In the absence of a new decision by the President of the United States, tariffs of 25% for steel and 10% for aluminium will apply to EU exports as from 1 June. That is on Friday.  I have stayed in regular contact with the US Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross. We have spoken numerous times over the phone and we will meet in Paris later this week – tomorrow, in fact – on the margins of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Ministerial Council Meeting. This will be an important moment, but it is clear that the final decision will be made by President Trump himself.  The Commission has continued to argue for a full, permanent and unconditional exemption from these tariffs while the US has sought to use the threat of trade restrictions as leverage to obtain not only a cap on future EU exports on steel and aluminium but also assurances on the content and goals of a future bilateral agenda to address market access irritants.  As you know, in their meeting in Sofia last week, EU leaders gave clear guidance saying that if there was an unlimited exemption for the EU from the US Section 232 measures on steel and aluminium, the Commission would be encouraged to explore a potential positive agenda with the US. Such an agenda would be based on four tracks: first, a deeper relationship on energy issues, notably in the field of trade in liquefied natural gas; second, voluntary regulatory cooperation between selected regulatory authorities on an ad hoc basis; third, joint work towards World Trade Organisation (WTO) reform to level the playing field and towards mutually acceptable solutions to lift the current blockage of the WTO upload body nomination; and fourth, discussions for reciprocal improvements in market access for industrial products, including cars and car parts, and liberalisation of goods in public procurement. This is the positive agenda that we are offering the United States.  Realistically, if the US decides to refrain from applying duties, I expect them, nonetheless, to want impose some sort of cap on EU exports. The question is whether that would be a hard cap, meaning volume limits above which no further EU exports would be possible, or a soft cap, under which further exports would be possible, but under duties. A soft cap of this nature would be less damaging than a strict hard cap. The volume of any tradable immigration quotas (TIQs) as well as their management and administration are also very important aspects to take into consideration.  Our future course of action will depend on the nature and the severity of the measures imposed on our exports by the United States and on the harm that they cause our industry. If the United States imposes restrictive quotas, the Commission will prepare a fresh implementing regulation that will include some immediate rebalancing on imports from the US, based on the list that you are familiar with it, but still at a level significantly lower than would be the case if they were to impose duties rather than quotas. We are also ready to launch a WTO settlement case.  The Commission is ready to take an appropriate safeguard action to protect our own steel market if it is shown to be justified by the investigation that is underway already. We have put in a prior surveillance system in place on aluminium so that we have a strong information basis in case action becomes called for in that section too.  I would like to thank the European Parliament for the strong support you have given to the Commission so far. The importance of your outreach vis—à—vis US counterparts through legislative dialogue is not to be underestimated. With midterm elections approaching, I wish to encourage you to continue to meet with and to convey our concerns on US trade policy to our US interlocutors. It is important at this moment that the European Union stands united and, I think, so far we have done so, and I’ll be looking forward to coming back and reporting to you the outcome of the coming days. Hopefully, it will be a positive agenda that we can see, with no tariffs or quotas but, realistically, I don’t think we can expect that.

In principle, the EPP supports the Commission's approach of insisting the EU on a permanent exemption from import restrictions on steel and aluminium before the EU may then take a second step towards possible trade talks at the negotiating table. At the same time, despite all the current political upheavals, it should be clear to everyone that the reduction of tariffs and other barriers to transatlantic trade must continue to be the overall objective of all negotiations. Donald Trump's protectionist strategy cannot work, because, as many years of experience shows, tariffs only help inefficient producers. They are de facto delaying and aggravating the problems, threatening jobs in their own country, as we have seen several times. The real problem in the international steel market is not de facto in Europe, but it is in Asia, whose overcapacity is destroying prices.

The main pressures arise from overcapacity that is rooted in market distortive practices. Therefore it is not fair that our industries pay the price for something that they have not created, and it is important that the US recognises this and grants the EU a permanent exception. I reiterate that it is important to avoid a trade conflict, and the EU is prepared to exercise its rights within the framework of the WTO. We must use the multilateral trading system and dispute settlement as a vehicle to ensure third-country compliance with international commitments. We have heard about negotiations on trade concessions in order to secure a permanent exemption from these tariffs.

He’s attacking a rules-based system. That’s what it’s about and that’s what is really making the danger in this situation. I think this is what we as the EU need to fight to preserve. We need to preserve the multilateral system. It has imperfections, sure, and needs to be reformed, but it’s there and it needs to be safeguarded. That’s why we should bring this case to the WTO. It’s very laudable that we join China in the case, but we also need to be a bit more proactive on that matter. That doesn’t mean we need to sit idle while the WTO decides in a couple of years or longer about what to do. We can act now. But of course, trade measures are only part of the answer. The other thing that we need to look at is how we become more independent from the moods of a US president or the moods of someone else. For that, I think the question to ask is, why it is so threatening to our European economy – or should I rather say economies? Because that’s one of the problems: that we have 28, soon 27, different European economies that are trying to out-compete one another. That is part of the problem. We miss a strategy for economy and industry that goes beyond export, export, export. It cannot work like this. We are really, really independent. So we need to have a common European industrial policy that looks to protect our workers but that also supports a move to a low-carbon economy. Then we can also really outshine others.

Reduced duties on certain products, but not only: increases in imported beef quotas, facilitated access to our public procurement, with no guarantee for our entrepreneurs in America, export of shale gas, regulatory cooperation on various sectors decided from time to time, that is to let our standards be challenged on sectors affecting large industries and to American lobbies.

Madam Commissioner, I understand that it is not easy to find a way out and I understand that some concessions are not avoidable, but I would like to make it clear that we will not accept that TTIP comes back through the door on the back, and above all we will not accept compromises on the skin of European citizens and their health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 262, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Nicolas BAY", "mepid": "124760", "text": " on behalf of the ENF Group. — (FR) Mr President, since Donald Trump's election, there has been a wind of primary anti-Americanism on this Parliament.

It would be a very serious mistake for the EU to respond by appeasing this global bully.  Trump’s reaction is ignorant and indiscriminate, but it offers us an opportunity to rethink our trade policy in a situation where the EU imports around 24% of its steel. If we import steel from countries that flout human rights and climate commitments, then we are destroying jobs at home while colluding in a race to the bottom. The Greens fought hard for the inclusion of social and environmental standards in the modernisation of the anti-dumping instruments, and we urge the Commission to make use of these instruments. To respond to Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, we need to make progress on the idea of an import tariff on climate-busting steel. This can ensure that taking action on the climate does not damage energy-intensive industries here, but it must be balanced by a meaningful and rising carbon price floor across the EU.

Indeed, it was recently admitted by the German think-tank, the IFO Centre for International Economics, that the EU has a significantly worse record on tariff barriers than does the US. The EU unweighted customs duty is on average 5.2%, while in the US it is just 3.5%. President Trump sees that America is running a USD 90 billion trade deficit with the EU and thinks he can force a better deal, so he is exerting leverage in the area of steel and aluminium, protecting his own producers. It will be interesting to see whether ultimately the EU takes a kinder stance towards him than it has so far taken towards Theresa May, who presides over a much larger UK trade deficit with the EU but who has bent over backwards to be accommodating in Brexit negotiations, not only begging for a frictionless trade deal in such circumstances, but she is also paying up 40 billion of UK taxpayers’ money to further sweeten things. She not only says she won’t have a hard border in Ireland, but she seems to be saying she must avoid doing anything that leads you to think you must impose a hard border in Ireland either, yet still you kick sand in her face. In such circumstances, can anyone blame Mr Trump for believing that the way to get a better deal for his country with the EU is to put the thumbscrews on you?

It is one of the few debates since I’ve been here that I can speak from the perspective of pure personal experience. I was in the steel industry, stainless steel and aluminium, for twenty years. I worked in the service and stock-holding sector during that time. I started off with British Steel Stainless and then moved on to a variety of companies across Europe, Avesta and Thyssenkrupp being most notable amongst them. What I noticed during that time was the importance of the variety of areas you can import from to be able to service your customers correctly. Tariffs and a trade war with the United States would be absolutely devastating to this market sector. What we have to think about is that it would not just make it difficult to import – sometimes – qualities of steel that you can’t always get domestically or from within the EU, but also the situation is that domestic mills will grow in power and grow in size. Now you might think that that’s a good thing, but when competition is beaten away by a huge giant then you lose price competition, you lose quality competition, you lose many of the aspects that made steel stock-holding and service centres such an integral part of the manufacturing economy in the UK and across Europe. When you look at the tariff and counter-tariff argument, all the end result will be is an endless spiral of unemployment and of industry crashing down. I understand what President Trump is doing. There are cases of dumping on the market, most notably from China, which is tantamount to trade war. It’s an effort to destroy domestic production: wipe them out so that they can then control the market. It’s obvious. There must be measures against dumping, I think many of us would agree. But to take it on to a tariff war would be a catastrophic error. This is not just me speaking. This is coming from voices within the steel industry. We are concerned – many people – about the devastating and paralysing impact of these tariffs because all it would seem you’re hearing is the lobby voice of the big manufacturer, the big mill. Think about the service sector, the stock-holder, the medium-sized business who actually look after the end users, who are the people who have to provide the skill and the technological information that goes into it. We must be fighting hard for tariff-free trade across the world, and certainly with the USA. I hope an independent UK will be able to do a tariff-free trade deal with the United States of America. But also, for the sake of the world economy, I hope the EU can do the same because I don’t want to see people losing their jobs and their livelihoods anywhere.

We need to use and protect our own workers our own industries against unfair trade practices vis-à-vis China or the US, as is the case now with Trump.

And because we believe that we want to develop these rules further — especially with the trading partners with whom we work closely — we also started talks on TTIP a few years ago, which were abandoned by none other than our current American counterpart, and that is why we should focus on ensure that we do not abandon our openness to develop international trade and keep the internal market open. Secondly, I share the assessment that has been made here that the punitive tariffs now unilaterally applied to us by the Americans are not compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. If we want to defend the international rules, then we must also say here that we cannot accept the American approach at this point. I would like, Commissioner, to succeed in resolving this dispute constructively, and perhaps in the end, as George Bush did a few decades ago.

But the EU is not the source of this. On the contrary, we have also suffered – our own, notably steel, but also aluminium, have suffered from this. We have put in place a lot of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy issues, we have reformed our trade defence instrument, and we should seek to address this problem globally with partners such as the US in the WTO, in the Global Forum on Steel and continuing the tri—party cooperation that we have started with Japan and the US. The EU and the United States are strategic allies and partners. We should work together to address this and other issues in the global trading system. But it has to be done within the rules. The WTO is not perfect, but it is the best system we have. The 164 members have set up global rules that have served us well – us and the United States. Today we offer a positive agenda to the United States: a positive agenda where we can discuss issues such as liquid gas; where we can discuss voluntary regulatory cooperation, where appropriate; where we can discuss issues related to WTO, including ending the blockage of the Appellate Body system; and where we could start to exploit and discuss a mutually-beneficial agreement addressing issues in industrial goods. It would have to be mutually beneficial and it would have to be explored – and, of course, were we to enter negotiations, it would have to be on a mandate given to the Commission by the Council. There are no secret negotiations going on on this. This would be a positive agenda, a mutually beneficial agenda. If this were rejected in the coming days, we would have no other choice than to go to the WTO to show that we must respect the global trading system and the rules we have set up together. We will take rebalancing measures in a proportionate way in full compliance with the WTO, and we will continue the safeguard actions on steel and aluminium, as we have already prepared. In the meantime, we will also continue to work for an open rule-based trade system in the world, together with allies, through free trade agreements and through the reform efforts that we are doing in the WTO.

The willingness to pursue the objective of stabilizing the country I think can be a common objective, an ambitious objective, and I think that can be more achieved if you work within a framework unitary European, the only one that can ensure a successful success to the project. Because common sense is important, but alone it is not enough to solve the problems we have before. Unfortunately, the situation in Libya is still marked by factors of severe instability, not least because the continued influence of armed groups on politics and the economy is dangerous, and if it is not now opposed some endurance, it's likely to increase. Moreover, it should be clear to everyone that, without political and institutional stabilisation, many of the problems we would like to address will not be solved, starting with migratory ones. That is why I have no doubt, even if I know there is an open debate on the subject of election, whether we must have a constitutional basis first or if you can vote before the constitutional basis. I think that one of the key milestones in the project, of the action plan, is the organisation of the forthcoming electoral consultations, which can ensure the full and shared participation of all the Libyan components. It arose, this assumption, from the Paris summit on 10 December. This appointment constitutes an indispensable step to overcome the deadlock and to reach minimum conditions of governability and security of the country, setting the stage for a subsequent gradual stability. The recommendation we are proposing has these objectives. It is the result of a thorough discussion, not simple, not only because Libya calls upon itself a very high interest, but also because there are somewhat different views on the strategies to be adopted to provide a contribution to the stabilisation and democratisation of the country. In drawing up the recommendation, we followed some political criteria. First of all, to provide a coherence with the European foreign policy interpreted by the High Representative. The second is to support the UN action, represented by Salamé, which today appears, albeit among many difficulties, the only road to Libya. The third is to guarantee support for all those Libyan forces interested in finding a political solution for Libya, with an operation of genuine national conciliation. The fourth principle is to listen to the demands and exhortations coming from the Member States overlooking the Mediterranean — especially Italy — suffering from the consequences of a failure to stability of the country. And finally, to deal with realistic determination the issue of migrants, framing it in a broader strategy that is capable of involving multiple subjects and that allows us to respond to themes for we are very important, concerning people's rights and human rights. So, the objective of the recommendation seems quite clear: to put in place all the necessary initiatives so that the widest consensus is achieved around UN action for the purpose of the United Nations to ensure a future of stability for Libya in its political, institutional and constitutional arrangements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 309, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   vicepresidente della Commissione/alto rappresentante dell'Unione per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza. – Signor Presidente, onorevoli deputati, vorrei iniziare con un ringraziamento a Pier Antonio Panzeri, al vicepresidente Castaldo, alla presidente della delegazione per il Maghreb Ayala Sender e al presidente della commissione LIBE Claude Moraes per aver condotto questa importante visita a Tunisi e a Tripoli la scorsa settimana.  Per la prima volta da più di sei anni, il Parlamento europeo è tornato in Libia, e questo è un segno importantissimo dell'unità, di cui parlava l'onorevole Panzeri, dell'unità degli europei e delle istituzioni europee, innanzitutto nell'attenzione che prestiamo a ciò che succede in Libia e alla volontà di farlo, questo lavoro di sostegno e di attenzione alla Libia, innanzitutto con un ascolto a ciò che i nostri interlocutori libici stanno facendo e ci stanno dicendo e con una volontà di unire gli sforzi europei e dare un quadro unitario coerente dell'azione dell'Unione europea, dei propri Stati membri, delle proprie istituzioni a sostegno di un processo di transizione in Libia. C'è questa determinazione forte e io vengo proprio in questo momento da Parigi, dove ho partecipato alla conferenza internazionale ospitata dal Presidente Macron e dove ho potuto portare questo impegno, questa determinazione europea di tutti gli europei e di tutte le istituzioni europee ad accompagnare questo momento particolarmente importante per un paese così vicino a noi come la Libia. I believe both the recommendations and your visit are inspired by this attitude towards Libya, recognising that Libya is first of all, an important, vital, crucial country, not only for Africa and not only for the Mediterranean, but for Europe as well, and also that Libya is a rich country that would not need any help if it had not been transitioning for so long. It is a rich country not only in terms of national resources, but, first and foremost, of human capital. It is home to millions of smart, diverse people who have had enough of the current instability and of this endless transition. So we cannot make – and I am happy to say that we are not making – the mistake of looking at Libya and focusing on one issue only, be it migration or even security. Because the first duty we have – the first responsibility and even the first interest we have as Europeans – is to support Libya with Libyans and for the Libyans. Because there would be no other way to have a successful end to this instability in the country. Libya needs reconciliation, it needs a clear, legitimate framework and it needs inclusive dialogue. It also needs economic investments, nationwide, strong legitimate institutions and job opportunities for the people. This is the spirit of the work you are currently doing, looking at the broad spectrum of issues that are on the table, dealing with the country. And this has always been our approach to Libya. This was also the spirit of our meeting in Paris this morning. Hosted by President Macron, as I said, together with all the major Libyan players, for the first time gathered together we pledged, and they committed, to support a constitutional process leading to elections ideally during this year – you mentioned the date we agreed today of mid—December – and to unite Libya’s security forces, another aspect that is not at all irrelevant. So we need to contribute now, in a united manner – Europeans, Arabs, Africans and neighbouring countries, under the umbrella of the United Nations – to this process, helping Libya to come out of this long transition. This is what the Libyans want, it is what they are asking for and what they deserve. I would add that it is also the responsibility of the Libyan leaders to respond and to deliver on this demand from the Libyan people. The security situation in the country is improving slightly. The number of those killed in political violence has decreased sharply. There is a precarious, but real, calm in most of the country including Tripoli, even if in recent hours we have seen worrying events in Derna. Terrorism has not been defeated yet. Last week, a car bomb killed seven people and injured 20 in Benghazi and at the beginning of the month terrorists struck the High National Elections Commission in Tripoli, killing 13 people, and it was an attack against all the Libyans committed to the democratic process. We have to make sure that this does not become an attack on the democratic process itself. And here international European support is essential because we have been working with the Libyan authorities to prepare and to accompany this democratic process. We have been working with the Libyan authorities to help, first and foremost, to ensure that their security forces unite under civilian control and that they fully respect human rights. We have a long way to go, but I see the commitment there and I see some movement happening. Some militias will have to be integrated in the security forces through a proper vetting process. Others will have to lay down their weapons and Special Representative Salamé will soon present a strategy to this end to the UN Security Council. We, as the European Union, can and must continue to support the United Nations in this respect, including through our civilian border assistance mission – EUBAM – that is now permanently established in Tripoli so is best placed to work with the Libyans on law enforcement, criminal justice and border management. I heard today from our Libyan interlocutors – all of them – words of gratitude and praise for the work the European Union is doing in this sector and others. Uniting the security apparatus is not enough. Bolder action is also needed to enforce the UN arms and oil embargo and, as you know, Operation Sofia also plays an important role in this sector. The mandate of the operation is currently under review. By the end of this year we hope to reach a Council decision to extend and strengthen this mandate, where necessary. But security is only one part of the picture, and our cooperation with the Libyans goes beyond that. The political process is probably priority number one and is also what we discussed in more depth this morning in Paris. As the European Union, we are currently working with the High National Elections Commission to prepare the electoral process. It is thanks to the EU—UN partnership that the steps of preparing this process have been put in place so far and we intend to continue in this way. Technical preparations are ongoing. Voter registration has been completed with 2.5 million registered voters out of four, if I am not wrong, so it is a very encouraging starting point. Libyans want – and deserve – to exercise their fundamental rights and choose their country’s future, but there are two points I also raised very clearly today in Paris with our Libyan interlocutors, all of them. First of all, the Libyans have to know what they are voting for. The powers of all institutions will have to be clarified in time. A president elected in a legal vacuum could be dangerous, and also because it is the first time the Libyans will elect a president. So its powers and its relations with the other branches of the power, including and first of all, the executive branch, have to be defined. This is why adopting the Constitution before the elections is essential to give clarity to the electoral process. I know that in your visit to Tripoli you conveyed these messages to both the High Council of State and the House of Representatives and I know that you received assurances about the strong commitment. I have today heard encouraging voices in this respect. The other thing that I made very clear today – and I know this is also a reflection of your work – is that elections need to take place in an environment that ensures and guarantees that the day after the election all those involved recognise the result. Elections that might be contested or disputed the day after might be counterproductive or, in any case and the best case, not let the country to move forward. This is why today – this morning in Paris – I asked all four Libyan leaders present to commit and engage in an electoral process, but also taking the responsibility of accepting the electoral results the day afterwards. I believe that this is the basis for a transparent, open and credible electoral process. Libyans want an end to the transition. They made this very clear. They had more than 40 town hall meetings all over the country. We supported the organisation of these meetings. This is part of the work towards a national conference that should meet after the end of Ramadan. The initiative has come from the United Nations, the process is led on the ground by some NGOs, and the European Union is supporting – including financially – this process. For the first time since the revolution, Libyans from all walks of life, all backgrounds and all different parts of the country have the opportunity to discuss their aspirations and the future of their country. We also support mediation activities between the tribes at community level, for example to ease the return home. I know that your delegation met, for instance, with the Mayor of Tawergha, who expressed his gratitude to the European Union. As these processes move on, the economy is also slowing picking up, this was also confirmed by our Libyan interlocutors today. But conditions for ordinary people in Libya remain dire. Public services such as health care have been badly affected, and we have to make sure that the benefits of an economy that might restart, starting from the oil production, gets to the Libyan people on the ground. So, in parallel to the work on security and for reconciliation, we are also engaged on the ground to revive local economies and create good jobs. We are working with the World Bank in particular to improve public finance management and with Expertise France to create new business opportunities. We are also supporting 22 municipalities across the country – I believe municipalities are key in this process – to help them rebuild their infrastructure and deliver better services. A new and ambitious project with EUR 50 million dedicated to it is under preparation in coordination with the Italian Cooperation. We care about Libya, as you said, because we care about the people of Libya, but also because we know that caring about Libya is also the best investment in our own security and stability. I know that I taken too long, so I will probably stop here and leave other comments for the other parts of our debates. I thank you very much, but, first and foremost, thank you for the excellent work you have been doing together with other colleagues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 310, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Jaromír ŠTĚTINA", "mepid": "124702", "text": " for the PPE Group. — Madam President, Libya is a challenge. It is a test for maximum coordination of various European policy instruments. This includes development, security, migration policy, humanitarian aid or counter-terrorism. The European Union is the biggest donor in the area. For example, it is financially involved in all projects carried out by the UNHCR in the territory. But both the real influence and awareness of our efforts is small in ordinary Libyans and our citizens. This situation needs to be changed. One step that would help this is in the report recommended moving the European Union delegation towards Libya itself. The European Union should continue to support the efforts of the United Nations Special Representative Ghassan Salamé in his efforts to stabilize the country and the process of national reconciliation. However, the real dynamics in the country should be taken far more into account. For the stability of Libya, it is necessary to continue supporting the missions and operations of the common foreign and security policy.

The Panzeri report underlines that jointly, the Libya Political Agreement and the UN action plan remain the only credible solution to this crisis. Elections by the end of this year lie at the heart of those plans, and I welcome that this will be the key point under discussion in Paris. Ensuring that these elections are accepted by all in advance will be vital to preventing a repeat of the 2012 elections, which resulted bizarrely in rival competing administrations. We need now to reach a point whereby an internationally recognised government reflects the situation on the ground, and not merely western aspirations. In this regard, we must take account of voter registration, which remains sadly at around only 50%, a figure that in my mind is insufficient to deliver a true legitimacy and credibility to any elected government. Providing a lateral support and assistance, therefore, is a practical EU measure that could be taken to ensure that the provisions are in place for any political solution that is eventually reached.

I would recommend that any Member of this Parliament try to walk from the seat of presidency in Fayez al-Sarrach, for example, to al-Baladia Street in Tripoli: he will surely have the opportunity to be kidnapped ten times every hundred metres by any of the militias. I would also recommend, for example, that you travel at night, without guardian, without protection, between Tobruk and Benghazi, and you will find that there is no problem, because you can do it. I did it without problems, without difficulty. What have we done in the European Parliament? We have recognized those who do not know in Libya — who is Fayez al-Sarrach — and we have made him our only actor. And, of course, when you try to solve a serious problem — because it's dead — simply thinking that legality and metaphysics are what matters, reality is much more important than our own ideas. There is a phrase in Spanish that says: “If reality contradicts our ideas, so much worse for reality.” The problem is that the reality is dead. And when I hear that there is a Government in Libya, I say: and what happened to the Tauerga agreement, where the Libyan Africans who lived there could not return, despite the agreement of the Fayez al-Sarrach Government with their own militias, who say they obey him and, in fact, do not obey him — the Misrata militias — and that cannot be done. And what are they telling us about the battle of Sebha among the Aulad Suleiman tribes, supported by battalions of the Misrata militias, against the Tubús nothing ago, a few weeks ago?

Necessary because in our neighbourhood there is a country that has been completely destabilized since 2011, that is a harbinger of threats that touch us directly. Complicated not only because of the dysfunctional institutional framework and the many internal and external actors present, but also because the context is constantly becoming. That is why I want to express my concerns about both the form and content of the Paris Summit, wanted by President Macron, a reinforced retort of the one held, with poor results, in July 2017. I firmly believe that no country, not even among the most geopolitically influential, can have the presumption and arrogate itself the right to impose a solution for a crisis through unilateral initiatives. Rather than new plans and proposals, I believe that a balanced and negotiated position is needed more than ever, a particularly European position, which gives impetus to a road map that already exists, namely that of United Nations. And this message, my colleagues and I gave it when we went to Tripoli. Forward leaks of individual countries are only likely to further complicate the situation by fragilizing the already precarious existing balances. Reintegrating, as far as possible, individual militiamen and not militias into a single army and unifying the executive is the priority, but on whether new elections are made by 2018, I agree with what is said by the Italian Ambassador to Libya and above all also repeated by many NGOs: before any consultation it is essential that there is the approval of a new electoral law and a shared Constitution, as well as better security conditions and legal certainty, if we do not want such elections to multiply tensions more than help the country. The stakes are sky-high: in the last month alone there have been two bombings, one in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. And as we speak, a new threat is emerging, that of the radical Salafist group of Madkhalists, increasingly powerful and transversely rooted in the territory.

It is above all the action plan that points the way to political national reconciliation involving all the major players in the country. Secondly, we, as the European Union, should continue to honour our humanitarian obligations. In February of this year, we in the European Union adopted three new programmes to improve the situation of migrants, particularly in Libya. They have a budget of 150 million euros. This is an important step, albeit only a small step by many, to improve the lives of the people of Libya and to stabilise the country. Dear Federica Mogherini, I believe that all of us here are delighted with the results of the meeting today in Paris, the fact that the influential political forces in the country have agreed on the first necessary steps of reform, and above all on the parliamentary elections which, according to my information, took place on 10 December. should take place.

We heard repeatedly in our visit that people must accept the eventual outcome of those elections, and it really focuses on what everyone is saying and our colleagues from the Committee on Foreign Affairs have been working on – this holistic approach. Of course, the dominant media images and suffering that we saw in the Tariq al-Sika detention camps were very disturbing, but it is very, very obvious that there is a holistic approach required to solving many of these problems, and I wish everyone involved in this the very best. I want to say from my committee very quickly that the question of arbitrary detention and human rights abuses are very obvious and detention must end. The whole question of the Libyan coast guard was one that we investigated very thoroughly: the question of the ‘do not harm’ principles; the question of access to services for migrant women and children; the question of Libyan authorities facilitating the regularisation of migrants living and working in Libya. This dominant issue is not going away. Yes, security is improving – I agree with what the High Commissioner has said. But this is a long-term battle and this element must be absolutely central.

There are many different illicit trafficking in this huge territory, where efficient State structures are so scarce, and these traffics are then projected beyond Libya. The European Union must contribute as much as possible to find solutions. We must continue to support the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Salamé.

There are also some successful local elections such as Zawiya, the fourth city in the country, which will be followed by consultations in other municipalities.

Second, some of you referred to the role of the militias. As I said, but I want to underline this, it is clear to all that some of the members of the militias will need to be disarmed. This is an effort that is always complicated at the end of a transition of a conflict. It is also an aspect in which the European Union and the Member States have relevant know-how and competence. We have been working on this with several different conflict areas and crisis areas in the world. Tomorrow this chamber will be listening to President Santos, and he might tell us something interesting about how a disarmament process can be conducted, and we have also supported and helped there, so there is a way of doing this. It is not easy. It is never easy. On top of that, we are talking about Libya, which I hope everybody understands is different to talking about Norway. It is a different kind of country. Some of the militia members will need to be integrated in one security force under civilian responsibility. This is also what has been discussed in Paris and this is mainly what the UN Special Representative is working on with our active accompanying role and support because, as I said, we have a specific competence and know-how in this. The third point that was mentioned and that I intentionally didn’t touch upon in my opening remarks is the issue of migration. I didn’t touch upon this because we have discussed several times the situation of migrants inside Libya, and I believe that for once Libya deserved a discussion on Libya and Libyans, and not purely focused on the situation of migrants in the country. Even if we know very well that solving the Libyan crisis would also be the best possible way to fight the traffickers’ networks, to save lives, and to guarantee a sustainable, manageable, humane approach to this. But as many of you said, we have now established, for the first time ever, a good pattern of work. Thanks to the task force we – the European Union, the African Union and, the United Nations – established last November, the three of us have managed in a few months, working on the ground, to help save 26 000 people from the detention centres. They have been able to return to their home countries voluntarily in an accompanied manner through the IOM, with European Union support. And another 1 600 people who were in the detention centres and who have been assessed as in need of international protection, with the status of refugees, through the UNHCR, have been evacuated with a view to their resettlement. And as you know, we have also been providing resettlement opportunities inside the European Union and helping the UNHCR to find other resettlement opportunities around the world. It is the first time ever that work like this has accomplished, and this has been possible over the last few months thanks to an unprecedented partnership between the European Union, the United Nations and the African Union. And just last week in Brussels, when we had the college-to-college meeting between the European Commission and the African Union Commission, we decided to extend the work of this task force, so we will continue working together on the ground in Libya. And this is something we also discussed today with our Libyan interlocutors in Paris. Last but not least, two points, one on the elections. It is clear, first of all, as Mr Castaldo mentioned, that elections need to take place in the context of a constitution and constitutional clarity under electoral law. I made it very clear not only in Paris, but also in my opening remarks here. And the EU is now already providing supporting for the elections. It is the European Union that is supporting the UN’s work on the ground to prepare this road. As you know better than anyone else, we have a certain experience in accompanying countries in difficult situations to build up their way to credible elections. We have also committed to increasing our support for the organisation of the elections and, eventually, if the conditions are in place, we will contribute by sending an electoral observation mission to Libya. The last point but not the least, the most important one. Some of you referred to a Paris agenda: let me be very clear on this. The reason for the meeting this morning in Paris – very clearly specified and laid down by President Macron – is to support the UN work and to support the UN road map. There is no competition between agendas here. It’s a matter of uniting forces for a coherent, regional and international accompanying work to the UN, because we realised that if the regional organisations, the neighbouring countries, starting from the European Union, the African Union, the Arab League, all the neighbouring countries in Africa but also in Europe, do not join forces to accompany every single step of the work done by the UN and by the Libyans, the entire agenda of the UN road map risks slowing down. And Libyan partners risk referring to one interlocutor or the other to take a slightly different path. So the unity of the international forces and the unity of the regional actors – starting from the European Union, the Arab League and the African Union – is essential to support the work of Salamé of and of the United Nations. This is the sense of the meeting that I had this morning and this road map leading to elections hopefully – inshallah as we would say – on 10 December, can work only if there is: commitment and responsibility by the Libyans and their country’s various institutions and leaders; unity of international and regional actors to accompany and support this work; and all of this converging under the UN umbrella and leadership. If we have these three conditions in place, I believe that commitments can turn into concrete steps that would help lift the country out of the crisis. In all of this, the role of the European Parliament will continue to be essential, so the praise for the excellent report and recommendations of Mr Panzeri should turn into a plea to continue the work actively supporting this process, especially as Libya heads, hopefully, towards elections. The role of the European Parliament in accompanying this process will continue to be key, it will actually become even more essential, so we count on you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 335, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Pier Antonio PANZERI", "mepid": "28365", "text": " Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the High Representative Federica Mogherini and I completely agree with his conclusions. I stop only briefly on three considerations. I confess that I always find suggestive the narratives of Mr Nart and this his recall to reality on the field I always consider it important and to share, but I think he agrees with me that this is precisely this reality requires us to accelerate the process of reconciliation and quickly set up a road map capable of facilitating a stabilization of the country, and that is what we indicate in some way in this recommendation. Second consideration on the election, I tell Castaldo, let's not get lost around whether the egg or hen was born first. I agree that absolutely an electoral law is needed without which it is difficult to have a basis, but on the Constitution we can also work to have only a first general reading and then have a confirmation later. Voting and acknowledging the outcome is, as far as I am concerned, essential to ensuring minimum conditions of governability for Libya. Finally, the migration issue is a very serious problem which has also been ascertained by the visit of the European Parliament delegation, and I know that there is this debate around the Coast Guard and the European Union mission, among other things there is a strategic review commitment within the year of the EUBAM and Sophia mission, and there we will actually discuss what needs to be updated and changed. Some amendments have been accepted on immigration, although, and I say this very seriously, we cannot charge Libya and the Mediterranean countries, especially Italy, the absence of a Common European immigration policy, which I hope the next Council of 28 and 29 will be adequately addressed.

In addition, Hungary believes that the protection of Libya's southern borders should be given considerable attention. However, as regards migration, I consider it a crucial point that the report sees the long-term solution to irregular migration through and from Libya in that the Council, the Commission and Mrs Mogherini define the international migration processes based on direct resettlement legal basis.

Later President of the European Parliament, Pieter Dankert, asked who forty years ago could have imagined that France, Germany, almost reunified, and the Benelux would sign an agreement here in Schengen. Allow me to adapt these historic words to the present day. Who would have thought twenty years ago that the area of free movement would include twenty-six countries, four hundred million people and fifty thousand kilometres of external borders? Who would have thought that the European Parliament would be debating its report on Schengen for the first time today? In 1990, Pieter Dankert answered his question with a resolute 'We did it'. Today, however, we know that Schengen is never completed, nor guaranteed. The full entry of Bulgaria and Romania remains unfulfilled. It is unacceptable that, seven years after meeting all the requirements to benefit from freedom of movement, Bulgarians and Romanians continue to be treated by the Council as second-rate citizens. I hope that tomorrow the European Parliament will reaffirm once again that Bulgaria and Romania should be full members of Schengen. Ladies and gentlemen, Schengen is never completed or guaranteed, in fact, and thirty-three years after the signing of the Schengen Agreement we face new dangers and challenges. The last three years have been dramatic. An apparent new normality has emerged. Internal border controls have once again been part of the daily lives of millions of Europeans. National governments, along with the most populist fringes of our political spectrum, have turned Schengen into the scapegoat for the shortcomings in security policies and the weaknesses of the common European asylum system. They put Schengen in a coma, carrying evils that aren't their own. In order to spy on guilt and win elections, Member States are using the Schengen atomic bomb lightly and are doing so illegally. The maximum period agreed by the Member States themselves has been far exceeded and the vague and contradictory reasons are not reflected in reality. If Schengen perishes, the economic impact could reach EUR 50 billion, but above all, the greatest expression of a citizens' Europe disappears. Mr President, the Schengen Information System is the largest European system in combating crime and controlling our borders. However, there are Member States that continue to disregard the rules on their use. The United Kingdom, being not the only one, is particularly serious in this area. Already after the adoption of this Commission report, the Schengen Working Group over which I chair was informed of the serious problems in the United Kingdom's use of SIS. The access of this State is temporary because it is not a member of Schengen and is therefore independent of its withdrawal process. This evaluation is no longer the first with serious results. However, it is of particular concern at the moment, because the United Kingdom is in the process of leaving but wants to maintain a relationship with the Union also in the area of security. Here too, the Council and the Commission must work with Parliament to find a solution. Mr Avramapoulos, we need to give Schengen back to the citizens. The Commission cannot fear using all the instruments at its disposal and can count on the support of this Parliament. With this report, we take a significant step in the exercise of democratic scrutiny in Schengen, we increase transparency and, with this, a more serious discussion and, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of combating terrorism is not resolved with more frontiers, it is solved with more cooperation.

We all know. I would like to express my thanks to the Members of the Schengen Working Group for their continuous work and in particular the European Parliament’s ‘Mr Schengen’, Mr Carlos Coelho. Thank you for your report and this very timely debate. It comes at the moment where we are reflecting a lot on the future of our common external border management but also on how to enhance our internal security and free movement in the Schengen Area. The thing is, we need to be pragmatic but without ever forsaking our values and fundamental principles. This is why one of our concerns is how to better make use of the existing tools at our disposal to fully implement the legislative measures we have recently adopted and to conclude pending legislation. But we also look to the future. How do we see the future as regards borders management but also as regards the free movement of European citizens in an area without border controls? My answer to this is clear and simple. We need to take joint responsibility for the management of our common external borders but also ensure mutual trust among Member States and everything that is implied by this. During the last three years, as we all know, we have been working together intensively in order to safeguard Schengen. During the last three years Schengen has been confronted with the most important challenges since its conception. Several Member States have reintroduced temporary internal border controls to address irregular migration flows and secondary movements and also in reaction to the multiple terrorist attacks. But temporary internal border controls cannot and should not become permanent ones. That is why it is so important to preserve the right balance between ensuring mobility, on the one hand, whilst guaranteeing security on the other hand. It is important to use, but also to improve, all the tools we have at our disposal to ensure high standards of security. It is precisely to maintain this balance that the Commission has proposed, among others, to amend the Schengen Borders Code, which is also one of our priorities. Member States retain the main responsibility when it comes to security. The temporary reintroduction of border controls is a legitimate measure available to Member States confronted with a serious threat to internal security or public policy in exceptional cases. We should never forget this essential point: that internal border controls are, and should indeed remain, exceptional. Our proposal does not intend to make controls at internal borders easier or permanent. On the contrary, we have proposed reinforcing the procedural safeguards. The reintroduction of border controls should only be a measure of last resort, with the Council having the last word. And the views of the other Member States affected by such decisions must be duly taken into account. Alternative solutions, such as police checks and cross-border cooperation must always take priority. I would also like to stress the Schengen Borders Code amendment, which aims to adapt the rules for the reintroduction of temporary internal border controls to the current needs to respond to evolving and persistent serious threats to public policy or internal security. In the meantime, the Commission is in contact with the Member States concerned on lifting internal border controls as soon as possible, allowing them to maintain the same level of security by using other tools, such as reinforced police checks and increased cross-border cooperation. We all agree that we should return to the full, normal functioning of the Schengen Area as soon as possible. I made this very clear in all my recent contacts with the countries that have done it. Mobility inside our Schengen Area requires secure external borders. This is exactly why since 2015 we have made significant progress in our external borders management. A key element has been the establishment of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, bringing together the national border guard authorities of the Member State and the European Borders and Coast Guard Agency, which now operates along the European borders. As part of our proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework which we put forward on 2 May 2018, we proposed to almost triple the expenditure for external borders management, migration and asylum, which could fund 10 000 border guards by 2027 for the European Borders and Coast Guard Agency. The EU budget for the management of external borders, migration and asylum would reach more than EUR 34.9 billion overall, compared to EUR 13 billion for the period 2014-2020. A new integrated border management fund will help to guarantee a high level of security in the European Union by ensuring strong and effective border management, while safeguarding the free movement of persons. If adopted, it will reinforce financial and operational support given to Member States in securing the European Union’s common external borders. We equally need to know who is crossing our borders and be able to stop those who pose a threat whilst ensuring mobility for bona fide travellers. We have already made substantial progress. The development of the entry/exit system is starting. We have also reached a political agreement on the European travel information and authorisation system (ETIAS). I would like to thank you for your work on this file too. We also have proposals on the table to strengthen existing systems, such as the Schengen Information System where negotiations are about to close, and the European Criminal Records Information System in respect to third country nationals convicted in the European Union by creating this centralised system on third-country nationals. Again, we need to reach swift agreements on these files. We also aim to improve the exchange of information and to make our systems interoperable to help us counter terrorism and serious crime and secure our borders, with full respect for data protection. Our proposal on interoperability will be a game-changer in this respect, and we need to complete the work on it by the end of this year. As you can see, we have many building blocks in place to strengthen our external borders, but we need to make yet further efforts to preserve Schengen, to make it even stronger and more resilient. Finally, let me repeat: the absence of internal border controls constitutes the very essence of Schengen, but in a common area without border controls, security concerns are common too. This is why we must do everything to preserve the careful balance between free movement and mobility, on the one hand, and security on the other. This is also what our citizens expect from us, and we can only achieve this through a coordinated and united Schengen framework, which brings me to my last point. Schengen should include Romania and Bulgaria too, because a more inclusive Schengen is a more secure Schengen. We call on the Council to finally decide on Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen family and Croatia too, once all criteria are met.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 342, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA", "mepid": "28397", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Madam President, Commissioner, I congratulate Mr Coelho on his work and on his commitment. The Schengen area and the free movement of persons are under threat. The restoration of internal borders by some Member States has undermined the principles of solidarity, cooperation and mutual trust. Restoring internal border controls has proved to be easier than removing them. New controls to regulate the movements of nationals have been the response of some States to the arrival of asylum-seekers and refugees and terrorism. The causes do not refer to the essence of Schengen, but to related areas such as the deficiencies of the SECA. It is therefore very necessary to continue working on the migration and asylum package presented in 2016. We must make full use of existing systems and continue to promote police and judicial cooperation between States and with Europol, Eurojust and Frontex. The ongoing reform of SIS II is also essential. In addition, SIS and VIS systems must always be operational at border crossings.

This phrase, which testifies to the pride of the progress made, also resonates as a banality to which one would almost have become accustomed to. But we must land and pinch ourselves to believe that this is still true and that it is still the strength of the European Union in the world. Yet it all started so well when, in 1995, European citizens from 22 Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland were given the opportunity to move freely from one country to another, which greatly improved social, cultural and economic exchanges. To guarantee this, our predecessors have adopted a common rule, finally quite simple in its elaboration: harmonised controls at external borders in exchange for freedom of movement within the space thus created. I speak in the present, but a lot has changed in the last few years. It is because we do not resign ourselves to this slow deterioration that the European Parliament affirms in this first annual report its commitment to the Schengen area and to free movement. It highlights the shortcomings in the implementation of Schengen policies and makes recommendations. The most important of them is shared by the vast majority of Parliament. While several Member States have re-established controls at their national borders, sometimes for more than two years, and although these controls are authorised by the rules of the Schengen Border Code, they are contrary to the spirit of free movement. They must therefore be limited in time and justified, for example, because of security risks. However, while legislation to strengthen security at our external borders — Frontex reform, systematic verification of Europeans and third-country nationals, new databases — are being stacked, the Schengen counterpart no longer exists and several Member States continue to carry out these controls at their national borders, sometimes in contravention of the rules. We denounce this non-compliance with the common rules. As shadow rapporteur for the Socialists and Democrats on this text, I also wanted to insist that other recommendations be included in it, because the Schengen area interacts with other common policies, including the management of migration flows. I must cite only two examples. Welcoming people who try to join the Schengen area. Too many migrants have lost their lives in the Mediterranean. At sea search and rescue operations must be increased with Frontex, which is obliged to participate fully in these operations, and Member States can agree on a strong European asylum system, legal access routes to the Union and solidarity and shared reception of asylum seekers between Member States. At a time when asylum negotiations are blocked in the Council, we want a courageous and progressive policy to help strengthen the management of reception at the external borders and the stability of the Schengen area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 344, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Anders Primdahl VISTISEN", "mepid": "124875", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — Mr President, The whole Schengen project has greatly lost the confidence of Europeans, and it is for good reason, because the Schengen project has failed in all that which is the essence of a border.

The biggest tragedy in the fallacious history of the Schengen system has been the implementation of a European prestige project once again without having the underlying structures in place. It simply removed internal borders without having a sufficiently robust and complete system of external border controls in order, and this has been shown to have absolutely fatal consequences for the security of citizens in European countries. That is why it is clear that we must do two things: first, the external border must be much more robust, much more secure and much more impervious to people trying to get to Europe. Secondly, we must say that as long as there is no completely fundamental control of external borders, external security in the European Union, it is the prerogative of every Member State to maintain internal border controls and ensure that the citizens of our Member States are as safe as possible.

Although the situation looks different today, member countries continue to extend controls, citing threats of terrorism and security. I would suggest that it is the perceived sense of intimidation of the Member States rather than the actual existence of threats that govern in this case. The answer that we in Europe usually give to the sense of insecurity is that we should strengthen our external borders and prevent people from coming here, both migrants and potential terrorists, despite the latter being raised in the vast majority of cases in our countries. I think it is a shame that today's report too much gets into this line of thought, but I will be talking about what is most important to me in the report, that is, Parliament's strong criticism that Member States continue to impose internal controls, in particular because several of them are not in line with the existing rules in terms of scope, need and proportionality.

This left many, at least in my country Sweden, choosing to vote for EU membership. Think how smooth to be able to go around Europe without having to pass passport or border checks. In order for this to work and be possible, it was provided that the EU's external border protection would work.

More recently, we have also assisted Libya with help to stop migrant flows to Italy. During this time, we have also threefold appropriations for Frontex to monitor and secure our external borders. The result is, on the whole, a larger mission for them to search and rescue people offshore that they then transport to Greece and Italy. Approximately 80 percent of their operations consist of this mission. With facit in hand, and with the change we see today, it no longer holds. We've seen an illegal migration without its like.

The European Parliament has a duty to protect citizens' rights by actively fighting for the protection of the Schengen area. Unfortunately, however, it cannot be said that the functioning of Schengen today gives optimal results. The reintroduction of border controls seriously undermines citizens' confidence in European integration. It is therefore necessary to take measures to restore benefits to citizens so that the basic idea of free movement does not suffer. The European Union has new challenges — threats of attacks and terrorism. All these threats require better exchange of information, better coordination, closer cooperation and more European solidarity. The effective functioning of the Schengen area depends on how much the countries will be united and in solidarity with each other. It is this solidarity that requires Bulgaria and Romania to be admitted immediately into Schengen.

It is a concept that is out of time. If an external border is porous – as it has been with the EU for many years – then the absence of internal borders becomes still more critical. When Ms Merkel invited everyone in who claimed to be displaced by wars in the Middle East, she invited them in not just on behalf of Germany, but on behalf of 25 other Schengen members and, to a large extent, on behalf of the EU’s six non—Schengen members too. So no wonder internal border checks are creeping back within Schengen – in the case of France, for wholly understandable security reasons, and for some other countries, to cope with the sheer volume of Merkel migrants. Social and cultural cohesion is a precious and fragile thing. When it exists, it enhances the life of almost everyone in a community, but allow the pace of population change to run too fast or be careless as to the character of people moving from one country to another and you will ignite the indignation of indigenous populations. Italians want to control their own borders; Hungarians wants control their own borders; one of the big reasons for Brexit was the desire of the British to control their own borders again. The European political class is insulated from the downsides of uncontrolled mass migration. Instead of empathising with European populations who feel overrun, far too many European politicians show contempt for their electorates – even branding them as racist just for wanting a degree of social stability.

But there is a acquis on which mutual trust is based, from which the area of freedom, security and justice should be developed.

Moreover, instead of sanctioning them, the European Commission is trying to legalise their practices. All this time, since 2011, Romania has been applying the provisions of the Schengen acquis and acts as a de facto member by managing more than 2 000 kilometres of the European Union's external border, without benefiting from the benefits of free movement.

That is exactly why, when Schengen enters into crisis, as a result of what was called the migration crisis, the pressure on the external borders, and Schengen's effectiveness was suspended for almost three years, the European Parliament, through the Committee on Civil Liberties, did the right thing by establishing a working group, informing in order to assess how we can be more effective and guarantors of fair cooperation and solidarity in the management of external borders while maintaining the free movement of persons within the Union.

We share the will to return to a fully-fledged Schengen area, but also a unified one, including all the Member States from the moment they are, or will be, technically ready. We should continue turning the crisis of the last three years into opportunities for stronger and more effective cooperation. We should keep on learning from our experiences, fully follow up on our joint evaluations and use the tools at our disposal to the maximum. As I said, I took good note of all your interventions that are feeding the current reflection about the future of our border management, and I am sure that we will soon have more opportunities to follow up on this debate. We have to continue working together on all parts of our comprehensive approach on migration, security and border management, in a spirit of solidarity, joint responsibility and trust. Yes, Schengen is the greatest achievement of all times, and we have to uphold and defend it. And this is what we share in this room today. Together we have to strengthen and preserve this great achievement as the core symbol of our unity. Europe can only exist if it is united: united politically, economically, socially and geographically. And Schengen is the guarantee and also the symbol of a geographically united Europe, ensuring the unity of our nations and of all European citizens.

I want to tell you that we are not just giving the words here, I want to give you facts too, because this directive defends all the victims and also the victims of terrorism. I would also like to thank the co-rapporteur, Mrs Mlinar, for her work, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and the Secretariat who have worked with us. Since I came to this Parliament, I found the lack of laws on victims and encouraged the Commission to present a directive on support, law and protection of victims of crime. Today, seven years later, I am here again to discuss how we can improve that directive, because what we have now is not enough. The 2011 Directive paved the way for harmonisation of victims' rights, but not all Member States have done their duties well: some countries have not implemented it well. That is why we are making recommendations in this new report to States to comply with what we said in 2012. In addition, we introduced new guidelines to improve the lives of victims. Some relevant issues are the role of victims during criminal proceedings, particularly witnesses, because they often suffer secondary victimization. We have also stressed the importance of the Istanbul Convention in the fight against gender-based violence. For example, it is important to harmonize the crime of harassment because there are still many countries that do not have harassment. We also wanted to point out that, regardless of the State where the crime is committed, the victim is guaranteed his rights. Another important part of this report is the protection of children. In most cases, children are victims of gender-based violence and are the most vulnerable. One of the main failures we have seen in the implementation of this directive is that neither professionals, nor judges nor policemen have received sufficient training and training to explain to victims that they had these rights. We have also included in the report the importance of awareness-raising campaigns to inform victims and society on how to enjoy these rights. Perhaps the most significant achievement of the Directive, for which I was rapporteur in 2012, was what was called the 'individual assessment' and, unfortunately, not all Member States have been able to carry it out: an individual assessment is essential to know the specific needs of a victim. The lack of implementation of article 22 has created many problems, for example, for victims of terrorism. That is why I worked to ensure that they were represented, because they were not represented in the 2012 Directive — there was only a small reference. The latest attacks by Europe — Paris, Brussels, Nice, Berlin, Barcelona, Liège — have caused many casualties. Those victims have not received the rights and aid mentioned in the 2012 Directive. At various hearings we have organised in this Parliament, they complained about how they were dealt with, and in this report we pointed out the needs that these victims of terrorism have told us during these months. We should guarantee them not only their economic rights, but also their right to memory, justice and dignity. This report also urges States to establish legal mechanisms to criminalize the glorification of an act of terrorism if this humiliates victims, because it may cause a second victimization. And finally, I end up, Mr President, by calling for a regulation or directive for the victims of terrorism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 394, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Angelika MLINAR", "mepid": "125026", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking my co-rapporteur, Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, and all the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent cooperation on this report. By assessing the implementation of the Victims’ Directive, we focused on the many areas that still needs to be improved in order to fully protect and support victims of crime. By strengthening these areas, we want to make sure that any victim, no matter where in the European Union, receives the same level of rights, support and access to justice. We should leave no one behind. We welcome that some Member States have successfully implemented certain actions, but much more needs to be done. We must give visibility to the victims. The justice systems in the Member States must give priority to those who suffered, give them a voice and provide them with the support in order for them to rebuild their lives, such as access to shelters and to justice. We must build trust and help victims to report the crime. Too many crimes go unreported, and this is very much linked to fear, embarrassment and social stigma. This is, of course, especially in cases of crimes related to domestic and gender-based violence, trafficking and forced labour. This report is one step forward in our commitment to fight gender-based violence. Therefore, I call on the Member States to set up specific support programmes targeting, in particular, some of the most vulnerable victims of gender-based violence, such as refugees and migrants, people with disabilities, Roma, persons belonging to national ethnic or religious minorities, LGBTQI, elderly women and homeless women. We all know that we have to do much more to respond to the cries for justice of women who have suffered violence. We have to do much more to end these horrible abuses and the impunity that allows these human rights violations to continue. The effects of violence can remain with women and girls for a lifetime and can pass from one generation to the next. This violence against women has tremendous costs to communities, nations and societies for public wellbeing, health and safety, law enforcement and public programmes and budgets. For an effective response to these crimes, a holistic approach is necessary. All of society has to join forces and work together. Police officers, lawyers, medical practitioners and social workers must be trained to address the needs of victims in an adequate manner. We must remember that these professionals are often the first point of contact for vulnerable victims. Finally, this speech could not be held without stressing the importance of the Istanbul Convention, as already mentioned by my co-rapporteur. A crucial tool to prevent and to combat violence against women: a wave of opposition to the so-called gender ideology has emerged, and I urge the remaining ten Member States who have not yet ratified the Convention to do so.

We stand by them, the city, and the Belgian police that lost two policewomen on duty. The Commission welcomes this discussion on the correct implementation of the Victims’ Rights Directive. I would therefore like to thank you for putting this point on the agenda of the plenary today. The Victims’ Rights Directive is the core EU instrument for our policy on victims’ rights across the board, ranging from women who are victims of violence, to victims of terrorism, to victims of hate crime, and children suffering sexual abuse. We all have a duty to do more to protect their rights. Where specific EU rules are in place in these policy areas, the Victims’ Rights Directive applies in tandem and complements them. Where no specific EU rules apply, it is this directive that fills the gap. It is this directive that ensures that all victims of crime in Europe, regardless of nationality and their family members, must receive proper support, protection and access to justice. First and foremost, they must be treated with dignity and respect. This directive is also about how we strengthen victims’ procedural rights in criminal proceedings and about how we ensure that EU countries provide training on victims’ needs to officials that come into contact with them. It is therefore crucial that Member States transpose and apply this instrument fully and correctly. As you know, we have already initiated infringement proceedings against those Member States which have not notified the transposition of this important instrument, and next year we will publish a report assessing whether the Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with the Victims’ Rights Directive. We are continuing to raise awareness of the Victims’ Rights Directive through a constructive dialogue with our Member States. Cooperation among our Member States is facilitated by our funding for the European Network of Victims’ Rights.

Of course, this Parliament always has to be on the side of the victims and families who are currently suffering a really difficult situation to sustain. I therefore join those condolences, and also in a debate like the one we have now on the implementation of the 2012 Victim Protection Directive. I think it is important, first of all, to put on the table the importance of the directive itself and the impetus given to the fact that in Europe we need to be aware that citizens need to establish such a legal framework for victim protection throughout the European Union. And I would also like to point out that, at the time this Parliament discussed the content of this directive, it did very important work to mainstream a gender perspective and to incorporate victims of gender-based violence within victims. This is a fundamental issue, because we are arguably talking about the greatest scourge that exists at the moment in Europe and in the world. And therefore, the gender perspective could not be forgotten. We also need to take into account now how this directive is being implemented and implemented through judicial transposition in each of the States. And indeed, six years later, it is worrying to see how not all countries, not all Member States have legally transposed this directive. And therefore, we cannot say that today in Europe protection for victims is being guaranteed in each and every territory of the European Union. It is an issue on which you have to act on. There has also been talk here about the importance — and the report refers to it — of the Istanbul Convention, where this reference is also made to victims of gender-based violence; to victims and their sons and daughters, whom we cannot forget. And therefore, I think it is essential to bear in mind that this report refers to how the current situation can be improved and this report refers to the need to support judicial systems with more means so that they can advance work on raising awareness of victims of gender-based violence. We are talking about this report on the directive, but this same week, Mrs Guteland's report on the indicators of justice, also refers to this: the need for justice to have sufficient resources to advance this gender perspective, which is essential in the training of judges and which is fundamental to ensure that women victims of violence feel protected. We must therefore continue to work, we must continue to insist and this Parliament will continue to defend the victims of gender-based violence and to defend the need to end the greatest social scourge that Europe is currently having.

However, I cannot agree with the provisions on pro bono assistance. The resolution seems to want to extend the system and places the emphasis on financial assistance and legal assistance to illegal immigrants. For information, the total cost of the pro bono system in Belgium amounted to EUR 73 million in 2016. Up to a third of all pro-bono procedures involved Aliens cases, or 21 million, to assist people who are illegally residing in the country. At national level, my government dealt with the abuse of asylum applications. Successive asylum applications were made more difficult and a new point system was introduced for pro-bono lawyers.

So I beg you, Commissioner, put maximum pressure on the Member States to fulfil the commitments they made eight years ago and to help the fact that victims of crime will have throughout Europe the same legal standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 416, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Costas MAVRIDES", "mepid": "124691", "text": "Mr President, first of all, my warmest congratulations to the two rapporteurs, Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Angelika Mlinar.

Back in 2006, when Peter Mandelson first presented his green paper, I started writing my first report on behalf of this House on how to reform the trade defence instrument. That wasn’t really a success, either for me or for Peter Mandelson, I must say. But here we are now, just about to vote on the ghost proposal that we have been working on and waiting for a vote on for more than five years now. This is actually the first major reform of European trade defence instruments in 25 years. A lot has changed in the world during those 25 years – global supply chains, the rise of China – so this is long overdue, and it feels good to be able to close the books on this thing. I would like to start by thanking all my shadows, who have worked on this for all this time, and I’d like to thank the Commission and both the Maltese and Estonian presidencies in the Council for their hard work finding a compromise, because this is truly a compromise. This is what needs to be a compromise, in what might be one of the most controversial areas of trade policy, where different interests so clearly stand against each other: European producers on the one hand, who want tariff protection from what they see as unfair trading practices; on the other hand, importers and consumers who, in the end, have to bear the cost of these tariffs. For every job protected by anti-dumping duties, we always run the risk of potentially threatening some job in another part of the economy. But we have to recognise that these instruments are the second best option when we don’t have international rules for competition. They should be a safety valve for us, giving us the possibility to push for further trade liberalisation, and not – as the US is using these tools today – as a tool for protectionism to stop liberalisation.  The three important things that we have done in this report involve trying to give something to all stakeholders. The first is to see to it that it’s possible to have higher tariffs under certain circumstances – something I know that producers appreciate. We also added predictability as the second point: we guarantee that you get prior notice three weeks before tariffs are introduced, so that anybody that imports something knows it won’t be more expensive when it arrives compared to when they bought it, and that’s important for importers. Third – something that’s important for all stakeholders – is that the investigation periods are shorter, because the mere threat of tariffs will affect trade and cost money.  Now we leave this in the hands of the Commission, and you will have to implement this. I will just make some pleas: first, obey the WTO rules in every detail when implementing this, because we cannot, at a time when others don’t respect the WTO, follow that example. We have to play by the rules. Second, don’t target the environment with these tools: too many duties today are targeted at environmentally friendly goods such as biodiesel, ethanol, solar panels and, soon, electrical bicycles. Third, don’t target value-added goods produced in Europe. Think about the global value chains. Sometimes we might earn more with ‘designed in Europe’ than with ‘made in Europe’. Last but not least, think about the overall interests of the European economy: it might be more important to do a good Union interests test to see that everyone wins than to do just one thing. Finally, I have never met anybody that has claimed to be a protectionist in this process, but I have met a lot of people that want to protect XYZ. Be careful: don’t listen to the sirens; never use these tools for protectionism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 428, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Fjellner very much for his kind advice.

Also, thanks to the European Parliament, workers can now be represented by their trade unions in investigations and the position of SMEs has been strengthened. I see three key messages in this modernisation. First, it will be more economically effective. The primary purpose of TDI measures is to remove the injury that the EU industry encounters due to unfair trade. The new rules enable us to do that better because we can factor in elements such as necessary investment, research and development. Moreover, there will be a minimum target profit of 6% and this ensures that the calculations reflect economic reality. The EU will take a more assertive stance against trade distortive measures by our trading partners. If they maintain raw material distortions or provide subsidies that go against the WTO, we can respond with higher duties – and I fully agree that the European Union has a specific responsibility always to follow WTO rules, not least in times like now. The EU industry should have access to trade defence instruments without fear of retaliation in other markets. In such special circumstances, with a threat of retaliation, the Commission can start an investigation on its own initiative. However, according to the new rules, the industry is then requested to cooperate with the proceeding.  Secondly, this is good for EU business. The modernisation has significantly increased transparency and predictability. From now on, the Commission will announce duties three weeks before they enter into force. This gives the markets time to adapt to the new situation, and at the same time the law ensures that this possibility to adapt cannot be abused for stockpiling. The new anti—dumping investigations will indeed, as the rapporteur said, be faster. Provisional measures will normally apply seven months after initiation, and that is two months earlier than today. We will facilitate the access of SMEs in the form of a TDI helpdesk that provides information but also addresses language barriers and we will reimburse importers where they have paid duties during an expiry review that results in terminating the measures. Third, thanks to the modernisation, we have strengthened our EU values in our trade defence. We are committed, as you know, to an open rule—based trading system. Trade has to be fair; the role of TDI is to ensure this. Trade defence measures are not a punishment, but they should re—establish fair competition. At the same time, such measures should be balanced and proportionate. I think this has all been strengthened in our proposal. We have in the European Union high environmental and social standards and we are committed to further improvement. The TDI modernisation ensures that the potential higher costs which EU business incurs by applying these high standards are fully taken into account, and this includes future costs that will occur during the lifetime of measures such as the one resulting from our strengthened emission trading system. The Commission will consider third countries’ action on multilateral environmental agreements and core ILO Conventions before accepting undertakings by exporting producers. Unfair trade is threatening jobs in the European Union. Trade unions representing these workers now have full access to the investigation as interested parties and can prepare complaints jointly with our industry.  All these elements are concrete improvements of our current TDI system. Together with the new calculation methodology, we have done our homework. We stand united to defend our common interests at all levels in the light of external challenges, and we can do so thanks very much to the work that you have done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 429, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Tokia SAÏFI", "mepid": "4345", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Christofer Fjellner for his work on this extremely important subject.

The Union's trade defence system is based on WTO rules, which enable its members to respond to unfair practices of exporting countries, restoring the level playing field and avoiding market distortions they produce. But the world — indeed — has changed a lot and time has shown that current rules are insufficient and ineffective. After years of blockade by the Council, the truth is that it is excellent news that the European Union modernizes its trade defence instruments, although honestly, we Socialists would have liked to go further. But it is true, it was never so necessary to have effective instruments to deal with unfair commercial practices that threaten our industry and cause significant job losses that are not justified by less competitiveness, but by unfair practices that exist — let us not forget — because they are consented. And politics is there to change things. That is why the reform that we will adopt tomorrow is so important and which will enable us to have more effective instruments, by imposing higher anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties, incorporating the minimum profit margin of 6% — which I think is a very important element — and streamlining procedures, although I think this should be get further progress. What the Commissioner said is also important: to strengthen transparency and predictability. And I very welcome the fact that, thanks to the position we have advocated in our Group and which has been supported by all and defended by the Commission, the higher social, environmental and labour costs borne by our companies — or which we fortunately have in them — are incorporated into the new regulations and that they are taken into account time of calculating dumping.

Moreover, we can see that the pace can be even higher. That is certainly the case. In a number of authoritarianically controlled regimes with expansion, you see that the pace of production can still be increased artificially. So it's really naive to think that everyone respects the rules of the game. That is why we need to arm ourselves against these global challenges. And how, then, is the question. I see two ways. One, by recovering foreign direct investment in sensitive sectors. We voted on this yesterday in the Committee on International Trade.

This is a huge win for the Greens and our supporters after years of campaigning and a historic step by the EU as the first member of the WTO to do this. This will now mean that goods produced with low labour standards or those that are harmful to the environment, such as the mining industry, will face investigation of their environmental impacts. If they have cut standards to cut costs, this will affect their ability to export. The next step is for the Commission to adopt a clear and transparent method for measuring these impacts so that the anti-dumping policy can come into effect.

Thank you, Christofer! I believe that with our anti-dumping instruments we have really achieved an important new breakthrough in EU legislation. The European Union is now the first major player in the world to take into account social and environmental costs when setting a fair price level by international standards. Certainly a compromise, not everything worked out, but a decisive step has been taken. This means that social dumping and environmental dumping can finally be tackled. Originally, this was a key requirement of the left and trade unionists. In today's globalized economy, however, this has also become the number one demand in the corporate world — I think it is an important experience. Now, as the European Union, we need to actively and vigorously approach our international partners to successfully bring this issue to the multilateral fora. The task remains to develop the regulatory framework in world trade to prevent labour exploitation and depletion of nature and our climate. This also requires the transparency and predictability of positions and international rules that we have already mentioned.

International trade contributes to growth and job creation. In this sense, European trade policy is central, and we must work to improve it. This report provides a mid-term review of the implementation of the European Union's trade strategy, which dates back to 2015. The international trade context continues to evolve. The Asian continent continues to rise. Donald Trump's irresponsibility, even aggressiveness, creates uncertainty, even towards his allies. Online commerce is growing at a very fast pace and the British voted for Brexit without having a clear vision of their future. These are examples that demonstrate that it is fundamental for the Union to show responsiveness and firmness on its principles. We advocate fair, balanced and rules-based trade. That is why negotiations must be conducted in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit, that European standards cannot be changed, that the sensitivity of certain products, in particular agricultural products, must be taken into account and public services must be excluded. In parallel with these negotiations, we support the multilateral system and are concerned about the failure of Buenos Aires and the United States blocking the renewal of the Appellate Body. Beyond negotiating principles, concrete implementation of agreements and legislation must be an integral part of our trade strategy. European companies use only 70% of the trade preferences available in trade agreements, while companies in partner countries do so by 90%. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes of this imbalance as quickly as possible and remedy them so that our companies benefit fully from these agreements. As for SMEs, public procurement and geographical indications, these are priorities for our trade policy. The Union must continue to negotiate specific provisions for our SMEs, which account for 90% of jobs in Europe. With regard to public procurement, the Commission estimates that more than half of world markets are currently closed due to protectionist measures, while European public procurement is open. Greater reciprocity must be required. At the same time, a real communication strategy is needed: we need to make more use of digital tools. I would also like to highlight a more technical but no less important point: the current rules of origin are too complex. The Union must modernize them in order to make them easier to use. With regard to trade and the promotion of European values, tools exist, such as the GSP systems and the chapters on sustainable development in the agreements. We must continue to work with business and civil society, including responsible management of global value chains. Finally, we call for more transparency. It is this transparency that will contribute to the development of a public debate that provides concrete answers to citizens, takes into account their concerns and does not only feed their fears. In this context, we recall our request for the publication of negotiating mandates.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 454, "date": "2018-05-29.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank the rapporteur for the very important work that you have done on the implementation of the Common Commercial Policy. We welcome the very detailed look that the European Parliament has taken at the Trade for All Communication and the implementation of our Free Trade Agreement (FTA) reports. I appreciate in particular, Madam Rapporteur, the way that you also highlighted the fact that you share our assessment of the quick-changing environment for EU trade policy, protectionism, changing positions on the US and China, on what open, free and fair global trade based on WTO obligations actually means in practice, as well as the growing economic political weight of Asia, the digital economy and Brexit.  The report highlights the importance of revitalising the multilateral trading system, boosting trade in services, protecting and promoting EU values and standards, and the need for transparency in our negotiations. In this regard, the report recognises the Commission’s efforts to ensure that our trade policy meets our overarching economic and political objectives, as was seen in the package of proposals aiming for a balanced and progressive EU trade policy that we presented here in 2017.  We would like to underline the importance of implementing free trade agreements. All the institutions, business, stakeholders and the Member States need to work together to make sure that EU operators and consumers can fully benefit from the opportunities offered by our trade agreements. Parliament’s orientation will be important here when it comes to guiding the work on the Enhanced Partnership on Implementation. This is, as I said, a shared responsibility. We are working with Member States and all stakeholders to forge a strong network of implementation to improve the coordination of outreach activities and the information flows. This is crucial. The Enhanced Partnership will also allow us to represent the EU’s interests more effectively, to spot problems at an early stage and to identify possible solutions.  We are working on several items mentioned in the report to make sure that our free trade agreements deliver benefits. For instance, we are conducting comprehensive implementation studies on partner countries’ legal and administrative frameworks to ensure that the FTAs function properly. We are also working together with the External Action Service to deploy EU economic diplomacy that aims at improving the way we promote our economic interests abroad with regard to trade agreements, in cooperation with our Member States’ embassies and business organisations.  We are also working to extend the Market Access Database and looking to create tools to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to benefit more from our trade agreements. In the latest agreements with Japan and Mexico, there is a specific chapter for SMEs to help them to take advantage of the agreement. As suggested in the report, we are also working to improve data availability. We take note of the requests to place figures in context and provide additional explanations to help Parliament to assess the impact of our FTAs. The implementation of the trade and sustainable development chapters is one of our top priorities. We will be working on the 15-point action plan and, here, stepping up the support to civil society groups and reinforcing cooperation with international bodies such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other civil societies.  Thank you very much to Madam Rapporteur, Ms Saïfi, and the different shadow rapporteurs for this very important report.

That at a time when more and more people are turning towards protectionism, we are not following that path; that Europe stands firm on free trade and stands firm to play in accordance with international trade rules. We don't challenge, we don't break, as for example the US does. We probably need to use this vacuum in the world — which the United States leaves behind when they withdraw from global trade — and fill it with valuable European content. Then I have four things that I want to point to. The first is that it takes too long with our free trade agreements. The free trade agreements with Canada and Singapore have taken eight years! That's how we can't have it in the future. Secondly, we need to have a trade policy for the new economy, for the digital economy, and then we have to have trade agreements with data flows, not without. Thirdly, global value chains must be a central part of our trade policy, to enable them, and then we cannot have crass rules of origin but we must have flexible rules of origin that allow our companies to use globalisation. And last but not least: investment policy. We need protection for European investment and need to restore European investment policy.

In recent years EU trade policy has been challenged like never before, and I think that we are united in this House in the objective to rebuild public trust. This means that we need to be honest about what’s working and what isn’t, and I welcome, in this spirit, the publication of the Commission’s first implementation report on the EU’s common commercial policy. Now it’s our turn as Parliament to do our job and hold the Commission to account. There are many things missing from the Commission’s report, but most importantly, an honest analysis of what our trade policy does for our people and planet. I suspect the answer is actually not very much so far. Although now the tone is changing around EU trade policy, with recognition of the negative consequences of globalisation and the need for a values-based trade policy, there’s still little interest in concrete measures to address the shortcomings. The toolbox to address these consequences is inadequate, and the Commission’s implementation report offered little analysis of how those limited tools have been used in practice. The Commission simply can’t go on without giving us a detailed assessment of the impact of labour and environmental provisions in EU trade deals in particular. I’d like to emphasise the importance of enforcement in terms of labour and environmental protections. Rightly, we’re critical of the unilateral closure of the Commission’s consultation on the use of sanctions to enforce these provisions. In other Parliament reports, notably on the EU-Korea Agreement, Parliament’s shown in detail why the current approach is inadequate. The Commission has closed down debate far too early, and it reminds me of the debate about investment protection just a few years ago, in which the Commission resisted change until the public opposition to the EU’s approach threatened whole Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). I would encourage the Commission to heed this criticism in this report and engage on enforcement of trade and sustainable development chapters in a more constructive manner. We also need to take an honest look at what our free trade deals deliver concretely on the ground. The Commission report is full of success stories, but what about the losers – the regions and the sectors? One thing is clear from the report: our companies, unlike our partners, do not take the most advantage of EU trade deals, and we need to know why this is. I suspect that one of the reasons may be austerity policies and cuts in national trade promotion budgets, which have played a big part in that. That’s why I think that a values-based trade policy cannot only be about talk. We also need to walk the walk.

Just think of how much has changed in global trade since the Trade for All strategy was published. I am happy that, despite setbacks to global trade today, the EU is moving forward and not letting itself be tempted by protectionist tendencies in the world. But we still need to deliver: we need to speed up the processes of negotiating quality agreements and make sure they work in practice. We need to make sure that European businesses – in particular our SMEs and consumers – can take full advantage of the benefits from these agreements. We need an EU that takes delight in cementing a free and rules-based system on a global level. Effective implementation and monitoring of trade agreements is key to achieving all of this: it is key to making sure that all European actors have the information and assistance they need to thrive via our trade relations, and it is key to identifying areas where we have potential, and we should focus on these areas. As I mentioned at the beginning, a lot has changed in three years.

Nonetheless, a few comments have been made: the public debate has shown that the so-called modern trade agreements restrict our democratic rights. Worse still, however, human rights play less and less important. For example, the so-called Mercosur Agreement, which is currently being negotiated, is intended to stimulate the import of chicken meat. This chicken meat is produced with the help of 160 000 slaves — I repeat, you have not interrogated: with the help of 160 000 slaves. Is this compatible with human rights? Another example: Morocco occupies the economically interesting part of Western Sahara. The European Court of Justice has therefore ruled that trade agreements with Morocco must not relate to products in these areas. The European Commission has frankly stated that it wants to circumvent this ruling. Human rights are also being violated here.

Well, I remember Mr Juncker in 2015, who said, “There is no democratic choice against trade treaties”. Today, when Italy has chosen a new policy, Brussels, through its European Budget Commissioner, said: “Markets will teach Italians to vote fairly”. It is a direct threat to Italians, it is a direct threat to democracy. The Commission is clearly choosing to govern this Europe against the peoples, for the benefit of the financial powers which now lead us.

As the Commissioner and other Members have stressed, obviously the circumstances under which the Trade for All strategy was adopted differ substantially from those present both in the internal dimension — with the UK's decision to abandon our project, which will have significant commercial implications — and in the external projection — due to the withdrawal of the United States and the rise of other powers. More than in this analysis, I am interested in focusing on the rapporteur's proposal for the future and, in that regard, I think that the important thing — as we have done in the debate on the protection measures adopted by the United States — is to encourage the Commission to deepen the network of trade agreements, to stop itself from demagogies and defend the interests of companies and our citizens. I think we must place the emphasis on principles — as the report clearly points out — on trade that is fair, fair and principle-based. I also think it is important to underline one of the data in the report, and that is the fact that our companies benefit to a much lesser extent than our partners' companies. We must put an end to this situation and also emphasize the principles which must really be an instrument, which should serve our trade policy.

We need to identify the issues that come with the implementation and find solutions. Strong monitoring is therefore needed after the entry into force of the Treaties. In this context, it is also essential to strengthen and enhance the development of civil society and Domestic Advisory Groups in the implementation of trade agreements and to better allocate their resources.

Trade within the global value chains opens markets, creates growth and jobs and strengthens our relations with third countries, illustrated by various of our Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) worldwide. However, we want to have a values— and principles—based trade policy. That is why we need more than TDAs, in order to prevent unfair trading practices in our markets and an increase in transparency within the processes of global value chain instruments. For example, bilateral investment agreements (BIAs) are very effective instruments to protect our investors against unfair practices. That is why I am calling on the Commission to complete the preparatory work and to start negotiations with Taiwan on an EU—Taiwan BIA, including an impact assessment. Taiwan could serve as an ideal springboard to the Chinese market as we, of course, want a level playing field with China, which still imposes unjustified non—tariff measures and technical barriers.  Furthermore, one should not overlook our economic relationships and the positive advances that have been made with FTAs conducted by the EU so far, and should speed up progress in the ongoing negotiations, especially our economic cooperation under the European Neighbourhood policy. Our DCFTAs under implementation help to create a stable, democratic and prosperous EU neighbourhood.  Finally, we should actively reach out to our partners, pursuing an ambitious trade agenda in a global context, especially keeping up the framework of the WTO for free and fair trade on a global basis and in compliance with all WTO obligations.  Finally, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Ms Saïfi, for her work.

It is therefore extra important that we follow up on the policies pursued and see what can be done better. Actually, a pre-negotiated agreement is just the beginning. We need to get better at ensuring that our companies can take note of the benefits that the agreements actually offer. We need to get better at increasing the participation of civil society and the social partners. To achieve the UN agenda in 2030, we must also be even better at promoting fundamental values such as human rights in trade policy. The implementation of the sustainability chapter is important, and also not to stop evaluating how this is best done.

We have in recent years focused very much on trying to bring trade policy into line with these changes age by making it much more efficient, making sure that it responds to the demands of our consumers, of our companies, and making sure that it includes digital trade services, that it is efficient and that it is implemented.  We have increased transparency considerably; you can now find information on all on—going and concluded trade negotiations and detailed – sometimes regional – examples of how it works in practice. There really is a lot of information on our website. It has become even more value—based, emphasising the values of the European Union when it comes to labour rights, the environment and human rights, but also to the value of open rule—based trade. We are doing this through our trade agreements, which are mutually beneficial, sustainable and fully in line with multilateral global rules. It is true that they sometimes take time – and there are some examples that have been absolutely too lengthy – but we are trying to do our best. The Mexican agreement was concluded in two years. I think that is quite an achievement. But also, all the time, we have to take substance into account vis—à—vis speed, and you and many other stakeholders are putting increasing demands on what should be in a modern trade agreement and that of course also makes it take a lot of time, as we have listened carefully to these as well. Implementation is key. We need to do much more there. We have focused on working with Member States, on working with business associations, on working with civil society, on working with Chambers of Commerce and what have you, and on trying to reach out and to explain the benefits of a trade agreement, but it is simply not good enough yet, and we need to do much more to reach out to SMEs. Lots has been done, but we can do more here as well.  The same goes for evaluation and for enforcement, especially on the sustainable development chapters where we have this 15—point action programme where we will focus on much stronger enforcement and cooperation with the different stakeholders.  We will be discussing with you this year’s edition of the annual FTA implementation report. We will try to cover important developments, both when it comes to hard data and qualitative assessment, and also give analysis of our major FTAs, our deep and comprehensive trade agreements and our economic partnership agreements, and take a closer look at some of the areas and sectors you are raising. Free trade agreements cannot solve all the problems of the world, that is important to underline, but they are a very important tool, not only to contribute to growth, jobs and investment, but also as a way to promote our values and to connect with our partners – on a personal level as well – building bridges and not walls.
