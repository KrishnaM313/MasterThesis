The European Commission launched its final legislative proposal in April 2016, after preparing the ground in 2013 in complementary fields of study, pilot projects, budget projections and studies of different alternatives, such as biometric data or the architecture of the system. The legislative task is addressed because technical gaps have been detected in the management of the Union's external borders. Currently, the external borders are controlled by border guards who verify the authenticity of passports and visas for those nationals of third countries who want to enter the European Union for 90 days in a period of 180, but there is no procedure to control those who, once the authorized period has expired, remain in European territory irregularly. Thus, our Regulation establishes a centralized management and control system, through which the authenticity of the travel documents of third-country nationals is verified with the registration of alphanumeric data, biometric data and information on the date , the time and place of entry and exit. A calculator is also created for the actual calculation of the 90 days authorized. The objectives of the Regulation are twofold: first, to improve the management of external borders and prevent irregular immigration and facilitate the management of migratory flows; and, secondly, to contribute to the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist crimes and other serious criminal offenses. This second objective is also crucial, since it will help to detect criminals with multiple false identities, as was the case of the terrorist who attacked the Berlin Christmas market, which had entered and left our borders with fifteen different identities. But access to information on entries and exits by the police authorities of the Member States and Europol will be under strictly defined conditions. This is essential because the Interinstitutional Agreement guarantees full respect for human rights, such as those related to privacy, the protection of personal data and the principles of necessity, proportionality and legality. To guarantee this, the European Data Protection Supervisor will be responsible for supervising the data processing activities of the system. In addition, the central entry and exit access is created, which is the technical support of the eu-LISA Agency - its manager - under the supervision of the European Data Protection Supervisor. And, in addition, there will be a website where passengers can check their period of stay. The data retention period will be three years for those passengers in good faith and five years for those who have exceeded the legal period of stay. I would also like to highlight the territorial scope of the system, which are the external borders of the Member States that apply the Schengen acquis and also those countries that, although they do not apply it, have passed the assessment. I am referring specifically to Bulgaria and Romania: this Parliament has defended from the beginning the need to include these two countries. And I want to point out that, of course, as soon as possible, there will also be Croatia. For this, it was necessary to give passive access to the VIS to Bulgaria and Romania, and it was voted by an overwhelming majority in the last plenary session. Ladies and gentlemen, interoperability between the SES and the VIS is also necessary so that the system can verify that the visa with which you are trying to enter the European Union is a legal and authentic visa. Three years after using the system, the Commission will make an assessment of its use. Finally, I want to emphasize that the Regulation will enter into force in 2020 and, to reach that date, many procedures are necessary that from the point of view of implementation must be fulfilled - we are talking about tenders, contracts, program development, tests, etc. . In conclusion, I believe that it is essential that we approve the Entry / Exit System today and not later. Why? Because it will improve the identification and authenticity of travel documents and, therefore, we will more easily identify criminals with false identities; will replace the sealing; we will know in real time who has remained at our borders irregularly; we will better protect freedom of transit in the Schengen area; it will improve the facilitation of entry and exit - that is, fewer queues - and will contribute to more protection and better management of the Union's external borders. In conclusion, it will enter faster and safer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, our debate today, ahead of the vote, is inevitably on an important priority, for, as we all know, it is linked to Schengen. Preserving and strengthening Schengen is one of the Commission’s – and my personal – priorities. Schengen is a great achievement of European integration. As Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra said – and as I have repeatedly said many times in this Chamber – we need a unified Schengen, which should include Bulgaria and Romania and, soon, Croatia too. In order to ensure that the Schengen area of free movement is sustainable and secure, it is essential that we manage, protect and secure our external borders effectively and that we have full knowledge of who is coming in. It is in this spirit that we have proposed the Entry/Exit System. Its overall objectives are to improve the management of external borders, to prevent irregular migration and to facilitate the management of migration flows. It will enhance cooperation and facilitate information exchange between our Member States. I would like to express my thanks to Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra and the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work and for the agreement reached with the Council. This new instrument will bring several urgently needed improvements. First of all, it will enable us to monitor better the rules on short stays. The Entry/Exit System will calculate the duration of third country nationals’ authorisation for short stays in the European Union. It will alert border officials if a third country national is about to exceed 90 days in any 100-day period – for example, if someone makes several trips to the European Union. The Entry/Exit System will also check that the duration of the stay corresponds to the visa issued. Second, the Entry/Exit System will reduce the time needed to cross the border and will reduce the workload of border guards. The Entry/Exit System will allow Member States to automate most data and information—capturing steps as well as data verifications. Visitors to the European Union will benefit from process accelerators and self-service systems. For the border guards it will mean more time to focus on the most important parts of the border-check assessments. That is also why the Schengen Borders Code had to be amended. In addition, Member States may also create national facilitation programmes on a voluntary basis to further facilitate border crossings of pre—vetted frequent travellers. The compromise proposed describes the conditions these programmes must meet.  Third, as the Entry/Exit System will record travel document identity data, including biometrics, this will improve the detection of document and identity fraud and therefore increase security. Fourth, this system will support the competent authorities in combating terrorism and serious crimes. When necessary, these authorities will be able to access data in the system if all strict conditions are met. Lastly, the provisions on data protection are aligned to the new data protection framework and to the rulings of the Court of Justice. The current text includes all the necessary data protection safeguards. The coming into force of the legislation will be timely, so we can rapidly start to develop the system and get it up and running by 2020 at the latest. I am looking forward to the debate and I thank the honourable Members for their continued constructive shaping of European legislation in the area of border management.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Barbara KUDRYCKA", "mepid": "28284", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President! Commissioner! We all know how important it is to return to the full functioning of the Schengen area. I often say it - it is one of the key symbols of common Europe and the great success of integration, our success. We cannot miss it. That is why today I congratulate Agustín Díaz de Mera on his report, which is another building block in the so-called Smart Borders Package. By ensuring the registration of every crossing of the EU border by third-country nationals, as well as the registration of their biometric data, we are eliminating the pre-existing gap in ensuring better protection of the Union's external borders and ensuring our security. This is a huge step forward. Importantly, the entry and exit system allows access to the visa database and vice versa, and this will reduce duplication of information and ensure the consistency of data on people crossing our borders. This will also help shorten border procedures. Our European openness and hospitality have been abused by people entering the European Union with malicious intentions, including members of criminal or terrorist organizations. The new system will allow us to protect against it more effectively. Systematic registration of entries and exits will also facilitate the identification of such persons and their manner of movement. What is extremely important, this system does not force us to give up the values ​​and freedoms that constitute the essence of the Union, above all a secure Europe, a Europe without borders. Of course, our joint work on strengthening Schengen continues, we are continuing our work on ETIAS, strengthening the mandate of eu-LISA and waiting for the European Commission's proposals on the interoperability of databases. The effectiveness of the new databases, including the reliable operation of the Entry and Exit System, will depend on their maximum use and full integration, including by being able to search them simultaneously.

We have more than four years of hard negotiations, exchanges of views and field visits behind us. We have before us one of the most difficult, technically and politically sensitive dossiers as well as one of the most financially difficult projects that we will introduce in the European Union in 2020. Border management is thus Europeanized and adapted to the needs of the 21st century. The journey has been very long and we did not agree with the rapporteur in many respects. I am still deeply concerned that the main purpose of the new technology will not be to manage and facilitate border crossings. Increasingly, the fight against terrorism seems to have become the main purpose. The talks were mostly held on the basic premise that any passenger traveling to Europe is a potential criminal or terrorist that we must prevent from entering. Despite the often difficult situation in speeches, we in the group of socialists and democrats managed to prevent the worst in the text of the regulation. Shorten ... We managed to establish an important dividing line between categories of passengers, shorten data retention time, we managed to further restrict access for law enforcement and cut costs. However, despite Parliament's calls, there was little understanding for greater protection of the privacy of individuals, for a single system for non-Schengen countries and for the abolition of separate visa agreements, which turn the basic purpose of recalculating residence in the Union upside down. Under great political pressure from the Member States, we are introducing the Schengen acquis into this system, I can say, which is also considerable chaos. I am sorry that the power of argument and reason in the current situation in Europe and the rise of populism has largely been replaced by the argument of misunderstanding and power. We run the risk to some extent that the quality of legislation is also replaced by quantity. Unfortunately, there was no ear in Parliament for further consideration. What particularly burdens me these days, and I honestly admit, is the July decision European Court of Justice that the agreement between Canada and the Union on the transfer of passenger data infringes fundamental rights.Under the agreement, the information would be kept for five years, which is no longer in line with the needs of the fight against terrorism.Unfortunately, we did not remove the doubts about data retention in this compromise, which is on the table.Therefore, the Socialists and Democrats propose with the amendment that we shorten the data retention period for bona fide passengers to 178 days.This is a sensible move and I urge colleagues to support it in the vote at noon.Smart borders, colleagues, will only be smart if the measures are proportionate, workable and, above all, passenger-friendly.(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question) (Rule 162 (8))", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Milan ZVER", "mepid": "96933", "text": "Question asked by raising a blue card.- I would just like to ask my colleague, my dear colleague Fajon, whether this is a relatively negative view of her personally, or whether this is the position of the Socialist and Democrat parliamentary group.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Tanja FAJON", "mepid": "96911", "text": "The answer to the question posed by raising a blue card.- As I mentioned in my speech, my parliamentary group has always supported the introduction of an entry / exit system, entry / exit from the European Union.We have managed to provide some positive elements, but the introduction of this system is to some extent a risk, because it is becoming primarily a system, a mechanism in the fight against terrorism.Above all, I want us to be reasonable, to have proportionate technology that is primarily aimed at the goal.This makes it easier for passengers entering and exiting the European Union (the President cut off the rostrum) and at the same time safer borders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Jussi HALLA-AHO", "mepid": "124727", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, there are no internal border checks in the Schengen area. Therefore, the external border is a common concern for all Member States. We must have an effective way to monitor who comes in and who goes out if we want to prevent illegal immigration, cross-border crime and terrorism.  At the same time, the number of legitimate travellers into the European Union keeps growing. With the tools that we have now, more security means longer queues and more waiting for the bona fide traveller. The Entry/Exit System (EES) is one answer to this challenge.  The EES is not a political project. It does not change the rules that concern entry, immigration, asylum or repatriation. This must be made clear. It is a technological update, something that brings our border management into the 21st century. It is a tool that helps us to enforce the rules that we already have. The EES should have been in place before, and as a precondition to, the abolition of internal border checks.  There has been much political opposition to the EES over the years, very often based on misconceptions. I truly hope that those who want Schengen to survive in the long term, who want a safe Europe and smooth travel flows, support the outcome of the interinstitutional negotiations. For the ECR, it was particularly important that law—enforcement authorities have reasonable access to the data stored in the EES and that data retention periods are sufficient for the system to benefit legitimate travellers on the one hand, and to make life harder for those who do not respect the rules on the other.

Initially, these texts were intended to facilitate border crossings for the 50 million third-country nationals who travel to the European Union each year. In the end, it is first and foremost, as the French authorities have just written to us, a tool to identify people in an irregular situation, via an automatic alert system signaling any exceeding of the authorized stay. It is about promoting returns and therefore expulsions. I am not satisfied with the way we worked on this text which, under very technical appearances, hides a heavy political reality. Under the guise of a legitimate right to security, we are going to increase the access of law enforcement forces to sensitive data, including in cooperation with third countries, and perhaps with Sudan, as we have just learned. of the French government.

But what do we have to do for that? We have to check their passports, and that is exactly what we are doing. We have a system, the Schengen Information System (SIS), in which – if it worked perfectly – we would have information about every suspicious person, every risky person, and at the outer borders of our common Schengen Area there would be checks against every traveller, and everyone would be checked. We would know who is coming in. If this system worked, no doubt we would have a better, more secure environment in our European Union. What are we doing? We are not fixing the system, which is not working because some of the Member States’ authorities are not thoroughly working with the system and feeding information into it. At some of the outer borders the checks are perhaps not working, yet we are building a completely new database – a database which does not focus, like the Schengen Information System, on risky persons or on suspicious persons, but one which just retains the data of completely irrelevant and innocent travellers – travellers like businesspeople, travellers or tourists who are coming to the European Union. We are welcoming them, and now are registering them for up to four years along with their sensitive personal data, their biometrical data, but without any suspicion and without any risk. Not only is that unnecessary because of the Schengen Information System, it is also not necessary to check visa over-stayers. If you really want to keep track of visa over-stayers, you need to know not only that there is a visa over-stayer, but also where the visa over—stayer is. But with this system you do not keep track of any visa over-stayer in the European Union. You just know that they have not left. There is no added value in this system. It will cost EUR one billion – that is the estimation of a study of this House. It will be an unnecessary collection of much information about travellers who are completely innocent. In July, the Court of Justice ruled that the Canadian authorities, in the case of PNR data, are not allowed to retain the data of travellers longer than the time of their travels in Canada. They have to delete the data after the exit, unless there is a risk or a suspicion. What we expect from the Canadian authorities with regard to our citizens, we should also respect with regard to citizens of third—countries like Canada. We propose to limit the collection to 181 days, which is the longest any non-EU national can stay in the European Union, and after that only on risk or suspicion.

This proposal is for the Schengen area, of which Britain is not a member, so technically it will not affect us – but in reality it will. When Britain leaves the European Union – when that happy day arrives – then we will actually be a third country. Biometric data on our citizens will be gathered and will be shared with the EU’s Member States and its crime agencies. This biometric data can be accessed by all EU countries, as well as by those crime agencies. Some of those countries are deeply and institutionally corrupt and untrustworthy. The EU has been building its legal institutions and crime agencies for some years, and a few years ago I published a short study which explained how that could easily develop into an EU police state. UKIP is not opposed to countries having biometric data systems, but they should be under the control of national governments, and they should only be shared with foreign states where we can be reasonably assured that that information will not be misused.

In my LIBE Committee you see the future of the EU appear: a litany of laws that undermine the sovereignty of member states and emphasize the sanctity of the EU. The national parliaments will no longer be about anything at all: not about monetary policy, not about social policy, not about privacy, not about criminal legislation, not about migration, nor about who can and cannot be in their country. The entry-exit system now presented is a very good example of this: Member States will lose their freedom to control the external borders and a system of scanners and databases will be introduced instead. Several goals have been formulated, including combating terrorism and serious crime. Did that not go well before Schengen? In the new system, although tourists' passports are scanned before they are allowed into the EU, terrorists who arrive illegally by boats can pass through. So how does this help? Moreover, the perpetrators of the attack always turn out to be known to the secret services, but they were simply not arrested, because yes, we also fail to figure out how to deal with Islam. And crime, yes, in the Netherlands is increasingly the result of itinerant gangs that are given all the space they need due to the lack of internal borders. So why is this better? Who wants this? The new system should also help against illegality, because the computer knows at some point when someone has stayed longer than is allowed. But illegal immigrants do not leave at all. They are also not expelled. We have no solution for that either. So why then this system? Madam President, this system is not going to help against terrorism. Nor does it help with crime. It does not help against illegality. It does cost a lot of money.

For example, visa holders who stay longer in the EU than allowed are more likely to be caught off guard. The EES is also important in the fight against terrorism. The system will allow identification of foreigners who have destroyed their documents or whose passports have been stolen.

It will help us to at least contain the crime and illegal migration that reaches us across the external borders. In my view, however, that is not enough to save the Schengen system.

The EU member states should be given the right to request biometric identification of all foreigners who are on their territory - and by that I also mean EU citizens in another country.

But there are also concerns. If we are to maintain this achievement of free travel within Europe, we will have to jointly improve the management and management of our external borders. We do this through the joint border and coast guard. We do this through the control of EU citizens at the external borders. We will soon do that via ETIAS. And we do that today with an important step: via the entry-exit system. Finally, we are taking EU border management into the 21st century, from medieval stamps to computers and scans. I congratulate colleague Díaz de Mera with this great result. It is an efficient and effective way to control who is really entering Europe and for how long they want to stay. We are reducing the time it takes to cross that border, making it easier for well-intentioned travelers to come to Europe, and by using fingerprints and facial scans, we are making it much more difficult to commit identity fraud.

For my country, Bulgaria - as a guardian of one of the most difficult European external borders - this dossier is extremely important because it will inevitably support the work of the Bulgarian border guards. I consider a great success the fact that the new system will be effectively used on Bulgarian territory, despite the lack of full membership of the country in Schengen. The inclusion of Bulgaria in the geographical scope of the system, the introduction of a uniform calculation of the permitted stay throughout the European Union, not only in the Schengen area, and gaining passive access to the Visa Information System will contribute to increasing the security of all European citizens. Let us not forget, however, that secure external borders such as Bulgaria's mean more security inside Europe.

Member States located at the external borders of the European Union are more exposed to security threats due to their long external border and their openness to threats coming from third countries. I therefore believe that special attention should be paid to them within the regulation establishing the entry and exit system for the registration of data on the entry and exit of third-country nationals crossing the external borders of the European Union. Although this Proposal for a Regulation aimed to establish an effective mechanism for further strengthening security within the European Union, from its aspect of implementation there are certain shortcomings that could seriously jeopardize the security of the European Union.

The application of this regulation in non-Schengen Member States may affect the impossibility of registering the residence of third-country nationals, and thus possible omissions could pose a threat to countries at the external borders, their citizens, but also to everyone else.

We on the Commission side have highlighted the seriousness of the problems with statistics and studies. We know that at least one in every three women has been a victim of some sort of physical or sexual violence. But these statistics do not tell enough personal stories, and the reason we are debating this today is because of the global ‘Me Too’ movement. Real stories have exploded in social media and other communication forums during recent weeks, stories that have been kept locked in in the memories and the hearts and minds of millions of women across the world, who have been suffering, who have been silently trying to forget or cope with this or ignore the pain. Women who have been in some form or other harassed by their boss, by their colleague, by their teacher, their neighbour or a stranger in the street. These stories shout to us. It is a feminist outcry from all across the world from women who say: ‘enough! This is enough! We refuse to be silent, we refuse to accept this.’ This is an impressive movement, and we can only listen to those stories and try to reach from the stories to some action. We must continue to work towards eradicating this problem. Workplaces all over the world, including in the European Union and EU institutions must look at how we can address this. Are we doing enough? Are there enough tools to listen to their signals, to catch those stories, to act in an appropriate way? This is work that needs to be done by men and women together. Since the creation of the Daphne funding programme in the 1990s, the EU has supported the work of NGOs at grassroots level and of national local authorities, because this debate is much broader. We need to empower volunteers and professionals to work with victims and perpetrators when it comes to sexual violence. Local actors are best placed to tackle the problem on the ground. Without them, victims would be all alone. We set aside EUR 6 million last year and have set aside EUR 12.7 million this year, and projects across the EU have been a lifeline for many organisations who would otherwise not be able to do their work. In September, in partnership with the United Nations, the EU launched a major spotlight initiative, with an initial investment of half a billion euros, to eliminate all kinds of violence against women and girls around the world. Thanks to the budget that you have advocated, we will come up with an EU survey on gender-based violence, to be carried out by national statistics institutes and led and coordinated by Eurostat. Together, we have dedicated this year to focused actions to combat violence against women. Many things happened this year and are still happening. The Commission, for example, launched a campaign which is engaging and supporting professionals, Member States and NGOs in combating the problem. Under that campaign, we set aside EUR 4 million for national campaigns and selected 10 different national projects that are now kicking off. To give an example, we are funding a campaign in association with the Italian football league, focused on passing the message to football fans that violence against women and girls is not acceptable. From a regulatory perspective, as you know, the EU’s accession to the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) is an important step forward. This convention brings binding rules on a wide aspect of the types of violence, including sexual harassment and abuse. Sexual harassment is already sanctioned in EU legislation, but victims – as we have seen lately – do not come forward or cases are not reported or not brought to court. And here we must look at how we can work with national equality bodies to address this problem, so that we contribute, in time, to the support given to those victims. The model structures of the Istanbul Convention and the EU Victims Directive, with a strong focus on victim support and on the training of police, can make a difference here. We need to keep an eye on implementation, and that is why, under the Victims’ Rights Directive, we have already launched an infringement case for non-transposition of this Directive. We are continuing our compliance check and looking at how the Directive is actually applied on the ground in Member States. Today you have raised a broad problem that has got legitimate attention through the recent ‘Me Too’ movement. Here we need to go forward, hand-in-hand, we need to work – everybody, especially men – to say no to harassment, no to violence against women.

Sexual harassment is a type of violence against women - many laws and international agreements say it. The phenomenon is so common that we hardly notice it. It's hard to find a woman who hasn't experienced harassment, insulting jokes, unsolicited text messages, unwanted workplace proposals, and sometimes worse things. Since this phenomenon is so common and so old, we may wonder why we are talking about it today and why yesterday, today and probably tomorrow all the media and the Internet are writing about it. After all, no new law has entered into force, and there has been no breakthrough in procedures. The goblet just overflowed, the silence was broken. Victims of harassment began to speak anonymously in the crowd, simultaneously, and this synergy made the voice heard again. Thanks to this, all institutions dealing with the problem of harassment saw the light of day. We learn that they exist, how they are structured, how they are financed, how they operate, how effective they are, which is the biggest obstacle in reporting harassment. We learn that it is possible to maintain privacy and confidentiality. We also learn that most of the cases reported in the media have never and nowhere been reported for fear of shame and job loss, and if the situation took place in an important institution such as parliament, there are other barriers: fear of being accused of disloyalty. , about damaging the company, about lowering its prestige. Thus, we analyze the behavior, opportunities and barriers faced by victims of harassment. Again, as is usual with violence, our focus is on the victims. Meanwhile, we are missing an important aspect of the external context in which acts of violence and harassment occur. We talk little about the perpetrators and little about the witnesses of violence. In a recent interview, the French finance minister was asked if he would have reported on his colleague if he had he knew he was a harasser, and without hesitation replied no, of course not.The answer of the French minister should not surprise anyone, because everyone does - they close their eyes and it is the first thing to stop.Today I am not satisfied that we are paying so little attention to the perpetrators of harassment, and I am not satisfied that we are also talking today about the European Parliament, where laws are made and social justice is mentioned.After all, we have procedures, regulations and tools, so I think they should be finally used.(The speaker agreed to answer the blue card question (Rule 162 (8))", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 73, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Gerard BATTEN", "mepid": "28497", "text": "  blue-card question. – You spoke a great deal, madam, about cases not being brought to court and cases being blocked.

Hence, sexual harassment is born. And, unfortunately, this reality does not escape from any place or space, not even from public institutions, not even from this Parliament. We could put a blindfold on ourselves and think that it has nothing to do with us and that it is not necessary to make any problems about it; or on the contrary, we can give visibility to this situation and try to put solutions on the table. Today Parliament itself has instruments to respond to this type of situation, but it is evident that they are not working, and that is why we ask in the Resolution that we reinforce them, with external advice, to assess how it can improve and be really useful to the victims. We must be in solidarity and stand on the side of the victims. Do not feel ashamed. Do not be afraid of losing your jobs.

Many of you were outraged by the news spread by the newspapers, by this veil of silence that fell on the institution to which we belong. Many others have found the courage to denounce small and large events related to sexual abuse, which without this journalistic investigation would have remained in silence and oblivion. Jumping in the chair in front of accusations of this kind is an understandable reaction, just as it is understandable, on the part of the institution, to clarify and clean up immediately so as not to risk seeing one's authority and honor damaged by infamous actions carried out by individual characters . But let's try not to be hypocrites and not to do, as often happens, a series A and a series B justice.

In how many offices, including public ones, are the employees the object of special attention from their managers?

However, as horrific as these acts may be, they cannot justify the public pillorying of alleged perpetrators. It is crucial, now more than ever, to call for respect for the rule of law. Women must be able to bring complaints without fear and defendants must defend themselves in court. The famous \"#balancetonporc\" is indicative of the mistake we must not make: confusing media lynching and justice.

So to date, the most effective tool for combating harassment and sexual abuse is the Istanbul Convention. The latter introduces the criminalization of violence against women, psychological violence, stalking, physical violence, sexual violence, including rape and harassment. There is still no legislation in all of Europe, which is why today I still want to insist on the Istanbul Convention. The criminal laws of the Member States counter violence in principle, but there are still many obstacles and therefore, consequently, there is no homogeneous protection of victims.

But we can do more to help the victims and punish the perpetrators of sexual harassment and violence in this House.

The convention begins with these words: \"Violence against women must be understood as a violation of human rights.\" This is serious and must be firmly punished. What is no longer tolerable is the impunity of the perpetrators. Article 40 of the convention specifically provides for criminal penalties for sexual harassment. In our report voted on last September, we urge Member States to speed up negotiations so that the European Union can ratify this convention faster, in order to act now and more effectively for women's rights. I also ask the States which have not yet done so - and I salute Estonia, which has just done so - to ratify this Istanbul Convention, because the Union's membership does not exempt them from their obligations. .

As we have seen, the public, the media and advertising have a huge role to play in ending the abuse of women, which is why we need to support all Member States so that they can take concrete action in cooperation with the civil society.

This is not new. It didn’t start with the ‘Me Too’ movement. It has been going on for decades, for centuries, but the novelty this time is that there is a global movement of women crying out: ‘this is not acceptable’. Many men as well. This is not something we will continue to accept. We do not accept that this is hidden – the shame and the silence around this phenomena – and that is so powerful. That is why I thank you for this debate. There are a lot of laws in the European Union. There are projects, there are directives and there are codes of conduct. These are important. The arsenal of legal and policy measures at the EU level covers most of the actions to support Member States in their work in fighting all kinds of violence against women and girls. Now we need to focus on implementation, and here there is work to do. We also need to dedicate all our efforts to complete the accession of the Istanbul Convention.  We also need to look at ourselves. What are we doing? The Commission has a helpline. We have strong rules to protect whistle—blowers who come and alert us on this. We have a network of confidential counsellors who can support women and girls – and men – who are victims of this. We have internal campaigns and courses and formal action. We will subject all this to external evaluation. Possibly we can do more. I am sure that in the European Parliament you have your own rules and you are looking at them. Possibly you can do more on a formal basis. But the most important thing, as this campaign signals, is to support the victims, to say that what they have experienced is not OK and that we will go with them. The majority of the men in this House and elsewhere, who would never dream of harassing a woman, you need to speak out. You need to support this woman and say that what their colleague did is not OK and that they will walk with her and support her in making sure that justice is brought on this. So let’s support each other. Let’s encourage the network to function in this regard. Let’s make sure that not only is this ‘Me Too’ campaign heard all across the world, but also that it is also transformed into action, where hopefully this will eventually lead to the eradication of this violence. The problem is much broader, as we have discussed. We will do what we can from the Commission side.

It is basically concerned with peace and stability, something I think this House should be supportive of. It is highly concerned with the rise of instability and uncertainty, both within and outside the Union, and insists on the need for a renewed focus on the Union’s approach to cohesion, integration, peace, sustainable development and human rights. It calls upon the Commission and the Member States to connect and boost efforts towards further sustaining peace and conflict prevention, and recalls the worldwide inspiration brought about by the Good Friday Agreement, while acknowledging the unprecedented challenges and pressures in the aftermath of the United Kingdom 2016 referendum.

gentlemen, I am speaking to the Commission, I am speaking to this crowded Chamber: there are 26 of us, I do not know if they are following us from home, so obviously the subject of illegal immigration warms the hearts of fellow MEPs. I will try to repeat what we as a Lega and as Italian MEPs have been repeating for some years, with little success: these absent and unsuccessful policies on illegal immigration are doing the harm of the European peoples and the evil of the African peoples. Whoever is governing Europe, with the complicity of some governments - including the Italian one - is serving the interests of the mafias, smugglers, slaveholders and multinational exploiters. Let's talk about numbers: in the last three years at least 15,000 people have died in the Mediterranean, more than 600,000 alleged refugees have landed in Italy alone, who are not refugees, 30,000 children have disappeared feeding a prostitution market that now knows no rules , and after three years we find ourselves talking about what we should do. What should we do? Europe does not do it, national governments will do it, including the Italian one, if the League wins the elections: protect the borders; cut off contacts between NGO vessels - which this European institution continues to finance - with smugglers; guaranteeing legal and positive immigration quotas for those men and women who really bring added value to our societies, as it works in Canada, Australia, Switzerland and developed countries. For the moment we are importing slaves, slackers or thugs. In Tunisia in 2017 more than 4 000 offenders were released from prison thanks to the prizes and pardons of the Tunisian authorities. Well, these are all arriving in Italy. Italy has the record of Tunisian prisoners: 67% of Tunisian prisoners from all over Europe are in Italy. So beyond the Mediterranean the galleys open and we in Italy open the doors of our house. I hope that this Commission will wake up, I am not so convinced, and at this point we will do it, facilitating the arrival of women and children who really flee from war - women and children, who around Italy and Europe they are not seen, or are seen too little - and, above all, by facilitating the arrival of legal immigration from the countries closest to our values, and I am thinking of countries with a Christian culture. Here everyone's rights are guaranteed, even today Roma rights have been dealt with, because if every month in Strasbourg, Roma rights are not dealt with, someone is not happy. I remember that Islamic countries adopt a declaration of Islamic human rights which provides that justice is applied only on the basis of what the Islamic law provides, which provides that freedom of thought is applied only within the limits of what is provided for by Islamic law , that with regard to gender equality, about which so much is rightly written, in marriage, in article 19 of the Islamic declaration of human rights, it is said that men have a certain supremacy over women. So: I'll put you in jail if Islamic law allows me, you can say what you want if Islamic law allows it, man and woman have the same rights but the man is worth a little more. I think the time has come to re-establish the rules for those who want to enter Europe: he must do it legally, he must do it positively. For the rest there is the rule of expulsion, refoulement, defense of borders. If the European Commission or the European Union do not want to do it because they respond to the interests and logic of multinationals, the peoples will do it, who wake up and vote in Germany, Holland, France, Austria and soon also in Italy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 179, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, speaking in this very room yesterday, the President of the European Council, President Tusk, said that protecting our external border is the cornerstone of resolving the migration crisis. There are many aspects to this, but the fight against irregular migration and people smuggling has been at the forefront of agendas of both the European Council and the Council for a while now.  It remains at the top of our agenda even though we have seen a dramatic reduction of almost 70% in the number of irregular migrants since spring 2016. Our aim is to ensure the effective control of our external borders and stem illegal flows into the EU. We are determined to break the business model of smugglers and reduce the high number of human beings losing their lives while crossing the Mediterranean Sea in unseaworthy boats and flimsy dinghies. To achieve these aims, we reaffirm our commitment to strong cooperation with international partners, as well as with countries of origin, transit and destination. On both the central and the eastern Mediterranean migratory routes, the EU and its Member States have taken decisive action to reach these objectives. Since spring 2016, we have implemented the EU—Turkey statement to address the flows from Turkey into Greece. We have taken a number of measures to reduce the irregular migratory flows, to break the business model of smugglers and human traffickers, and to advance the effectiveness of returns.  At the peak of the crisis, in October 2015, 216 000 arrivals from Turkey to the EU were registered over a period of one month. Subsequently, average monthly arrivals into the EU in the period from April 2016 to September 2017 were reduced to 2 465. On the central Mediterranean route, we commend the significant contribution made by Italy, including on a bilateral level. Over the summer, a number of initiatives were taken by the Presidency, the Member States and the Commission to complement the bilateral actions taken by Italy. I refer here in particular to the Commission’s Action Plan of 4 July and the respective Presidency implementation plan.  Let me highlight some of the achievements so far. We have intensified efforts to train the Libyan coastguard so that the Government of National Accord can improve the control of its territorial waters. The extension of the mandate of EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia until 31 August 2018 enables us to continue this task in a sustainable way. In the EUR 46 million EU Trust Fund programme for border and migration management in Libya, adopted in July this year, about EUR 30 million are dedicated to the training, equipment and maintenance needs of the coastguard. We continue to promote the development of local communities across the migratory routes in Libya. Under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, projects worth EUR 42 million have been contracted for this purpose. Since last year, we have more than doubled our financial support for the work carried out by UNHCR and IOM to provide adequate reception conditions for migrants and persons falling under the international protection mandate in Libya, and to coordinate assisted voluntary returns from Libya and Niger to countries of origin. We wish to reinforce our support to the most vulnerable groups by setting up a voluntary resettlement scheme, as presented by the Commission in September in its recommendation on enhancing legal pathways for persons in need of international protection.  Six countries along the central Mediterranean route are among priority countries for resettlement, including Libya. Some Member States have already submitted ambitious pledges. There are many more strands that we are working on. I think it is important to bear in mind that they are nearly all medium- to long—term measures, for which patience and resilience by the EU are required.  Another limitation we should take into account is the unstable political and security situation in Libya, preventing our full presence in the EU delegation and EU Border Assistance Mission in Tripoli and in the field. We are working very closely with our Libyan interlocutors to bring about change in this country. In addition, our aim is to intensify our cooperation and, based on the European Council conclusions from 19 October this year, to rapidly establish a permanent EU presence in Libya.  Let me mention some of the actions to fight people smuggling. In the framework of the Malta Declaration of 3 February 2017, we now have a very efficient system for the monitoring of departure points in third countries. Furthermore, the identification, detection and tracking of suspicious vessels has improved. Frontex complements the EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia, to which it provides solid intelligence.  Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre focuses its activities on the central Mediterranean route in order to target and disrupt supplies to smugglers. In an effort to further disrupt the business model of people smugglers and human traffickers, the Council introduced restrictions on the export and supply to Libya of inflatable boats, also known as dinghies, and outboard motors. Finally, the Council adopted the EU’s priorities for the fight against organised and serious international crime between 2018 and 2021. This was done in May 2017. They will include the fight against the facilitation of irregular immigration.  In conclusion, despite the encouraging developments mentioned, the EU remains vigilant on all migration routes and continues a comprehensive, pragmatic and resolute approach by using all the relevant EU policies, instruments and tools.

As outlined in the mid—term review of the European Agenda on Migration, the implementation of the Action Plan on Smuggling adopted in May 2015 and of the measures to address illegal immigration remains a priority. We all know that while the irregular flows towards Europe are decreasing overall, we have to remain vigilant. This is why we will pursue our actions to build a proper management of migratory flows to the EU to prevent irregular immigration and fight smugglers. To tackle illegal immigration along the central Mediterranean, cooperation with the Libyan authorities remains an important element. The training and equipment of the Libyan coastguard prevents illegal immigration and helps save lives at sea. This year alone, the Libyan coastguard brought back to the Libyan shores more than 16 000 migrants. The EU has also engaged with the Libyan authorities to allow international organisations, mainly the IOM and the UNHCR, to assist vulnerable migrants in Libya before they embark to Europe. As a result, this year the IOM has assisted 8438 migrants to return safely to their countries of origin. The Commission also supports the UNHCR’s plan to evacuate vulnerable migrants out of Libya for onward resettlement.  We also continue to help Sahel countries to better manage the borders and enforce their capacities in relation to the fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking of human beings. The Niger Project is very encouraging. More than 100 offenders have been arrested and brought to justice in the first half of 2017. More generally, in the first quarter of this year, we proposed a revision of Immigration Liaison Officers Regulation to support actions to counter migrant smuggling in third countries. This will allow exploiting the full potential of the network of European immigration liaison officers, who have been deployed in 12 priority countries to coordinate closely the work of Member States on the ground. To prevent smuggling and illegal immigration, we also have to use all our leverage to improve the readmission rates of countries of origin and show more solidarity with Africa to address the root causes of migration. To this effect, EUR 2.85 billion has been made available by the EU Trust Fund for Africa. The refugees who need protection will be offered alternative solutions to smuggling. By enhancing safe and legal pathways, persons in need of protection will no longer have to rely on smugglers and risk their lives to find protection in the EU. This is why the Commission recommends that Member States increase their resettlement efforts by at least 50 000 persons over the next two years. We are also exploring how we could enhance the legal pathways for migrants who are not in need of protection. The Commission is ready to coordinate pilot projects with select third countries in 2018. Moreover, to clamp down on migrant smuggling networks, Member States need to increase their capacity to investigate this crime, for which timely and practical information sharing is key. National investigators must talk to each other and fully use the resources provided by the European Migrant Smuggling Centre at Europol. Indeed, the European Migrant Smuggling Centre at Europol, launched in 2016, has shown substantial added value in providing operational support to Member States in fighting smuggling. It has provided support and conducted proactive high—profile investigations against criminal networks, with 68 cases reported this year so far, and 93 cases in its first year of operation leading to 147 arrests in 2016, and over 167 so far. Finally, we must address all the factors in our system that fuel irregular immigration, such as undeclared labour, by better enforcing the Employers Sanctions Directive. To conclude, let me stress that we will continue to fight this ruthless business in order to save lives, to prevent irregular immigration, and to provide protection for those in need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 181, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Elissavet VOZEMBERG-VRIONIDI", "mepid": "125065", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, trafficking in human beings in the Mediterranean continues to be a highly lucrative organized crime business, with a turnover of between € 5 billion and € 6 billion a year, and plays a catalytic role in . It is tragic that the Mediterranean has in recent years become a place of exploitation of human misery in the worst possible way. There are 22.5 thousand deaths and disappearances of migrants worldwide from the beginning of 2014 to June 2017, while most deaths are recorded in the Mediterranean. Last year they even reached 5,143, the largest number recorded annually since 2000 until today. My country, Greece, due to its geographical location is a crossroads in the smuggling of people and, despite the initiatives that have been taken, which are important, we have not yet managed to control the phenomenon. In August, September and October alone, more than 10,000 people arrived on the Greek islands. It is worth noting that traffickers are rapidly changing routes while organizing and advertising on the Internet. That is why the fight against the crime of human trafficking is achieved mainly by limiting the demand from the migrants themselves. The development of legal routes to Europe is the only appropriate way to achieve this and we strongly support this effort. Strengthening cooperation with third countries of origin and transit, renegotiating Dublin and promoting a European refugee resettlement framework are at the heart of our efforts.

By the way, pushbacks were possible in the Mediterranean before 2012, but in 2012 the European Court of Human Rights put an end to that. This is how the dogma of the right to asylum in Europe arose. This makes it almost impossible for Frontex to guard European borders and stop the influx. In addition, the European Parliament recently decided to oblige member states to transfer 200,000 refugees from the Middle East each year. It was also decided that no pressure should be put in exchange to conclude a take-back agreement. This means that illegal immigrants and / or criminals cannot be returned. The vote on this in the Committee on Home Affairs was not quite according to the rules - thanks to the left, which otherwise always insists on respect for those rules. And while there are voices in Germany and Austria to impose an absolute maximum limit on the reception of refugees - something the N-VA has been advocating for years and also an idea that is invariably dismissed as impossible by left-wing politicians, but now nevertheless makes its appearance, albeit only in national politics for the time being.

First of all, despite all problems and challenges in Europe, we are on the best continent – one of the best places – on the planet in which to live. This is naturally why a lot of people from all around the world would like to make our continent their home, in order to enjoy the freedom and prosperity that we all enjoy and that exist here. Let us also be clear that this has not always been the situation. From the mid-1800s until 1920, about 1.5 million people from my country, Sweden, or at that time one third of the population, left for the USA in order to escape difficulties such as religious persecution and poverty. Secondly, human beings are migratory to the very core of our nature. If we see no prospect for the future where we are, we move. Nevertheless, in the EU, we must obviously have a policy of regulated migration for the foreseeable future. Anything else would be irresponsible, but it would be equally irresponsible to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world: we all live in a globalised village today. The right to asylum and international protection is an individual human right that every Member State of the Union has signed up to defend. The only way to find out if a person qualifies for international protection is for them to go through the asylum process. Everyone that asks for asylum has the right to apply, but not everyone has the right to obtain international protection (asylum). Public support for the asylum system will depend on our ability to complete the ongoing work on the common European asylum system, so as to put the EU’s house in order and make sure that the procedures are fair and efficient throughout all the Member States. We must also do much better in returning those who do not qualify for international protection in a dignified manner. That would restore the credibility of the system. The most important measure to discourage people from dangerous trips across the Mediterranean would be to say that it is difficult to obtain international protection. There are no shortcuts here: only hard work.

The first concerns the priority fight against smugglers, agreed with Libya, Niger and Chad. We begin to know the outcome: frightened by the Nigerian authorities, the smugglers dump migrants in the desert or lead them on roads where there is no water. The result is that the deaths in the desert increase exponentially, they do not reach the Mediterranean. According to Danziger, IOM responsible for Central West Africa, there are now double the deaths at sea, about 30,000 in four years. The second question concerns the Libyan coast, where gang warfare reigns. How to distinguish the smuggler from the militias or coast guards that the Union and Italy form and pay? According to the UN High Commissioner, the abuses in detention centers are appalling. The third question concerns the guarantees on UNHCR assistance in Libya. According to the High Commissioner in Tripoli, assistance is more than precarious. Libya has not signed the Geneva Convention, nor does it have a memorandum with the UNHCR.

I just checked: in a supermarket in the Netherlands a can of peeled tomatoes costs 39 cents. But it can be even cheaper. A small tin of tomato paste to make the sauce really tasty costs 18 cents. And why am I telling you this? Because last week, a prosecutor in Italy sentenced a farmer in southern Italy to the manslaughter of a migrant worker, a man from Sudan, Mr. Abdullah Mohammed, who had a heart attack while picking tomatoes. He picked those tomatoes under terrible conditions, seven days a week, twelve hours a day, in the sun. If you know that, and you know that there is no real labor inspection in agriculture in Italy, and we all only pay 39 cents a can of tomatoes, then I think the real problem in fighting irregular migration and smuggling is the fact that we are not want to pay for our products, that we do not check them. The only way to keep those products cheap is to exploit people. And you nod. I'm glad about that. But it is your profit and it is your labor inspectors who do not come to see it.

The purpose of this text is to modify the famous Dublin regulation, currently \"Dublin III\", which provides, in particular, for asylum seekers to be taken care of by the first country in which they arrive. So today, if an illegal immigrant arrives, for example, in Italy, it is Italy that processes his request. If the same illegal immigrant subsequently arrives in France, the latter has the right to request his deportation to Italy. With this report, the regulation would turn into an automatic mechanism for distributing illegal immigrants. This \"Dublin IV\" would thus provide that a candidate for asylum is offered four countries in which he could settle while awaiting the processing of his application. The mere fact that asylum seekers can choose the state in which their claim will be processed is, strictly speaking, ludicrous. Are they really fleeing war on a transitional basis as claimed or do they simply want to choose the most advantageous social system? Ms Wikström’s report ultimately aims to establish a real right of asylum à la carte.

Today we are talking about fighting smugglers, destroying boats, breaking down smugglers' nets. After more than one and a half years of operation of the European Center for the Fight against Migrant Smuggling, we can congratulate Europol, Frontex and the national border services on the results of their joint work. However, smuggling is not the source of the problem, but a result of the previous lack of a comprehensive approach to the issue of migration, especially in terms of effective treatment of the causes of mass departures from the country of origin. Therefore, it is good that a lot has started to change in this matter. There is also no doubt that the migratory pressure has decreased significantly in the last year. So it is clear that European migration management is starting to show success. It's a good sign. It is most important, however, that we continue our joint efforts in those areas where we all agree - that is, the effective protection of the Union's external borders: financial as well as personal and professional support for border countries, the implementation of return programs and the European strategy for Africa. The latter is especially important. According to UNHCR, many sub-Saharan Africans would not have embarked on the extremely dangerous journey to Libya and further to Europe if they had known the magnitude of the risks and available protection programs. That is why all measures based on the Trust Fund for Africa are so badly needed. Above all, the Trust Fund for Africa should also help to improve conditions in the Libyan camps, which are indeed dramatic. We cannot be deaf to reported cases of violence, rape, torture, and repeated violations of human rights.

The first step that we must undertake is to ask why this happens. Firstly, we must acknowledge the phenomenon of economic migration. European nations are wealthier and generally more stable and enjoy greater social benefits. By contrast, many African nations are poor, some politically unstable, many with lower health-care standards, and little chance of social benefits. Secondly, there are vast amounts of money to be made by people smuggling. Indeed, the last Europol report estimated that turnover in this area was between EUR three and six billion per annum. This has led to an increase in modern slavery. Something has to be done. With no effective control over our borders we remain vulnerable to terrorism. Also, we must address the increasing detrimental health issues, such as the fact that in 2014, 80% of tuberculosis sufferers in London were born abroad and a third of London boroughs were in that year’s World Health Organisation high incidence threshold. This necessarily contributes to the greater pressure on our own health services. Secondly, we must ensure that people smuggling is halted, the perpetrators’ vehicles confiscated and destroyed, and any NGOs found to have assisted in this despicable trade must lose all public funding and, like the people caught people smuggling, also face prosecution. Illegal immigrants are something very different to refugees. They should be turned away at the borders as a measure to send a message back to their homeland that such a journey will not be rewarded.

However, the migration policy of the Union, and of its member countries, must not, in any way, involve the risk of a squeezing of the fundamental rights of all those people, and among them many minors, who try to arrive on European coasts to escape to serious conflicts, persecutions or discrimination, but on the contrary, it must be aimed at increasingly effectively combating human trafficking and the criminal organizations that manage it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 242, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Ilhan KYUCHYUK", "mepid": "124866", "text": "  in writing. – Unfortunately, recent reports from international organisations and NGOs have stressed the unpleasant fact that African migrants who are trying to reach Europe through the Mediterranean are being sold like commodities by militants/smugglers in modern-day slave markets in Libya.

Stability needs a dynamic economy in Europe. If we are to have stable societies and stable social development, we need to have a more dynamic economy that fosters growth. But a dynamic economy also requires stability in terms of public finances, legal certainty and opportunities for new enterprises, innovation and investment.  It is important that, when raising the European Union growth targets, we improve people’s living and social conditions. We will secure stability on the financial markets, but we will also lay the ground for the future competitiveness of the European economy, because if we cannot be in the lead, and if we cannot have the investments we need, then we will lose.  We have an economic recovery going on in the European Union, but it is slow and it is not enough. Investments are not catching up, although it is very much based on a unique monetary policy. We have lower unemployment than back in the days of 2008 before the crisis, but on the other hand, the GDP per capita is not very much above what we had before the crisis.  It is important to note that we have lower deficits, lower debts, more growth and lower unemployment. We should know first of all that this is not enough, but also that there are huge differences between the Member States. Some are still suffering from very high unemployment. Some are still dealing with major deficits. We have very different performances in the economies of the European Union. This proves one thing, and that is the good news. The good news is that we are not doing as well as we can. It would have been depressing if this was the best we could do. But we can do better. We see that through the differences, the fact that some Member States are developing better as regards labour markets, employment and investment. For me and for us behind the report, this illustrates the need to have a look not only on the aggregated level, but also at each Member State.  We need to have cohesion in economic growth, and therefore we need to have cohesion in structural reforms. We need to have a target of potential growth of 3% for every Member State in order to achieve 1% higher growth. We need to reform labour markets. We need to reform other markets, meaning more competition. We need to have budgetary reforms opening up for lower taxes, especially on jobs and investments, and we need to ensure that we in the European Union can achieve an internal market fostering an economy that can be a global leader.  We can achieve a lot if we look at the reality now and at the need for structural reforms and stability at the same time, then we will deliver splendid economic development for the citizens of the European Union, but we need to take action.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, and all the shadow rapporteurs for the report. As you rightly point out in the report, economic recovery in the euro area is continuing and strengthening. It has become increasingly broad-based across countries. All 28 Member States are back to growth. We are witnessing steady employment growth with unemployment at its lowest level in eight years and improving business sentiment, with confidence at its highest in a decade. We see that our economic policy priorities of supporting investment, structural reforms and responsible fiscal policies are delivering results. But, despite this robust recovery, we still see subdued core inflation, wage growth that does not reflect labour market developments, large current account surpluses in some euro area Member States, high debt levels and persistent investment gaps. Most importantly, we see persistent economic and social divergences in the euro area. These make it harder to manage our economy and mean that the recovery is not benefiting all European citizens equally. The years prior to the crisis saw a trend of real convergence within the euro area. However, it partly masked the boom phase of the boom-bust cycle that unravelled later. But this convergence trend was brought to a halt by the crisis, and since then we have been witnessing persistent divergences. I agree with you that the euro area harbours untapped economic potential and that we have to deploy all our efforts to increase potential growth, while making growth more inclusive. Achieving sustainable and inclusive growth is the ultimate aim of everything we do in the European Semester. This must be done by taking into account and tackling the individual structural weaknesses of our Member States. We see positive tendencies in the EU economy, but there is no time to relax. We should aim at strengthening the resilience of our economies, boosting productivity, growth and inclusiveness. Reforms must combine the goals of creating efficiency and stability with a strong focus on fairness and empowering people over their lifetime by making them ready to face changes. As you know, in November the Commission will issue the Annual Growth Survey and a proposal for a recommendation for economic policy in the  euro area. The recommendation aims to identify common challenges in the euro area, and this will serve as guidance for consequent country—specific recommendations. At the same time, we must continue to work on deepening and strengthening our economic and monetary union. This is precisely about addressing the current lack of convergence in the Union. A well—functioning economic and monetary union should become our main tool for renewed convergence in the euro area. Future reforms should make sure that economic and monetary union delivers on its original objectives: growth and jobs, as well as economic, social and territorial cohesion. The new architecture should create stronger incentives for reforms and support national policies with new instruments at European level. In all, it must be able to deliver on the initiatives for a deeper and fairer EMU, as announced by President Juncker in his State of the Union speech and in the Commission’s work programme. The forthcoming EMU package, which we will present on 6 December, will comprise a number of these initiatives. We will propose to bring the European Stability Mechanism into the European Union legal framework in order to make it more democratically accountable and, at the same time, to strengthen its role and improve decision—making procedures. We will propose the creation of a dedicated euro area budget line within the future EU budget in order to provide for four functions: structural reform assistance, stabilisation function, a backstop for a banking union and a convergence instrument to give pre—accession assistance for Member States on their way to euro membership. We will also propose incorporating the substance of the Treaty of Stability, Coordination and Governance in the EMU into the EU framework, as was initially agreed in 2012.  With a view to 2025, the Commission will also set out views on the possible creation of a permanent European Minister of Economy and Finance and present exploratory work for the possible development of the euro area safe asset. We will also continue our work towards completing the banking union and capital markets union. Our economic and monetary union will only become stronger if solidarity and responsibility go hand in hand. So we need to work closely together towards this ambitious and important objective of deepening the EMU and making it more resilient. I look forward to hearing your views on this very topical report.

But we cannot lower our arms. Despite the improvements, there are still 14 million young Europeans out of work, who neither study nor are in training. This is terrible and unacceptable. In addition to the tremendous social impact, it costs EUR 153 billion for the European Union, knowing that the wider application of the Youth Guarantee across the Union would cost us much less. We need to be more decisive with its implementation, strengthening it at national, regional and local levels, aware of the importance that this guarantee has in preparing young people for the job market. On the other hand, there is also an urgent need to reinforce its monitoring in order to avoid mechanisms that falsify employment numbers using internships and other training programs, creating the illusion of a recovery that, in fact, is too fragile, without guarantees of sustainability. We must be prepared for the future. We must be demanding in investing in education and training, especially in the development of digital skills, to face the new challenges. This is an essential condition for the defense of the European social model, which includes the sustainability of our social security systems. It is precisely in the defense of this European social model, in balance with economic sustainability, that the European Semester must be based.

In fact, through the report that we are discussing today, the European Parliament, directly elected by the citizens, commented on the direction of the economic policy of the euro area. I want to greet the rapporteur, Gunnar Hökmark, because, despite our political differences - which are, of course, many - we have once again had the opportunity to continue constructive work for a balanced and globally positive report. I believe that is what we have before us today: a balanced and globally positive report. It is important to start by recognizing the signs of economic recovery that we have been seeing in the euro area. Today we have more growth, less unemployment, less deficit and more controlled public debts. But the first message from this Parliament is a warning message. The European economic recovery we have is still insufficient, too fragile and uneven. Despite the Juncker Plan and the turning point of austerity in some countries, this economic recovery is still too much supported by an expansionary monetary policy by the European Central Bank that cannot last forever. That is why the second message of this report and this Parliament is that we urgently need to overcome the investment deficit that still exists in the European economy. There are, of course, many structural changes to correct the architecture of the eurozone and defend our economies from speculation in the sovereign debt markets, but the priority for investment is unavoidable. We need a reinforcement of the Juncker Plan, with a more just geographical distribution, but we also need a different fiscal policy, which makes full use of the flexibility clauses, and this is a central issue.

Every year we invest a lot of time in analyzing our economy and trying to determine how we can do it better. The main result is the country-specific recommendations. I would therefore ask the Member States to implement them. Of course you can have different views on many measures, but a high debt burden is a risk and a mortgage on the future. We must make sure that our children and grandchildren do not have to pay the bill for this. We shouldn't spend less, but different. We must invest more in research and innovation in order to maintain our competitiveness. Modernize the economy, reduce administrative burdens and reduce taxes on labor, to attract more investment, which will stimulate growth. Investing in innovation will ensure employment and prosperity for the future.

And financing for businesses and SMEs needs to be improved. On the other hand, Member States that do well should certainly not be punished.

Even though we had too many divergences to have an agreement on that particular file, the spirit was constructive, and I would like to thank you for that.  We are very critical of the assessment that we will do in the Semester. We believe that, in a way, we are supporting the implementation of a policy mix that is failing; one that basically says ‘cut public expenditure, implement supply-side structural reforms, and everything will be fine’. We believe that the flaws and problems of the European economy are still very big, and we need to correct that. Once the action of the ECB diminishes, our economies are probably still not ready to continue in a sustainable path for growth.  We are, in that sense, too complacent with the report regarding the current state of the euro area economy, and we remain too silent on the institutional reforms required for its future at the current juncture. Furthermore, the environmental and sustainability angle is missing, as the need to increase resource efficiency and to adapt the economy to the fight against climate change is not mentioned in the report. We also have, in the text, a strongly productivist narrative insisting on the need to achieve high GDP growth rates and to increase, as a priority, price competitiveness. There is no mention, as Mr Papadimoulis was saying, of the issue of macroeconomic and financial imbalances inside the eurozone, and we know that the macroeconomic imbalances procedure should be used by the Commission in a much more decisive way, taking into account the imbalances that we have inside the euro area. Finally, there is also no mention of the issues related to taxation and no mention of the CCCTB or the need to advance in other fields regarding taxation. So my Group remains very critical both on the process of the Semester and on the report of its assessment this year, and that is why we cannot support the report this time.

The austerity, the rigid budgetary rules that were introduced in the Eurozone, were meant to reengineer growth and prosperity. Meanwhile, established centrist parties – especially on the left – lost huge amounts of votes. They expected to get them back when growth reappeared.  This semester’s premises seem to show that it has done so. Growth has reappeared. But the political situation remains bleak.

Following the German, the Austrian and the Czech elections, matters look murkier. Is it that voters disbelieve that growth is back, or is there something within the present growth that they do not like? Are social disparities decreasing, or are they widening?

As I mentioned, in November we will issue the proposal for a recommendation on economic policy of the euro area. Indeed, this recommendation, as a number of you have noted, will aim to identify common challenges for the euro area and will serve as a guidance for the subsequent formulation of country-specific recommendations.  One of the key messages from the debate is that cyclical conditions are improving and the economic upswing is strengthening. There are still significant economic and social challenges, and there is no time for complacency.  So, let me reiterate that we must create the conditions to support inclusive and balanced growth, further reduce unemployment and promote investment. We must strengthen the resilience of our economies and restart the process of economic and social convergence in the euro area. For this, the better use of our existing tools of economic policy coordination is essential, but not sufficient. The euro area is now much better equipped to face challenges than it was before the crisis, but we have to make sure that we address the remaining important gaps in our economic governance and the institutional state of the Economic and Monetary Union.

I think there are mainly two lines that have been presented here. Some think that we can solve the problems by spending more and ignoring the fact that sometimes there is no more money to spend. Some underlined the need for fiscal stability and structural reforms. This goes rather broad, because in the agreement in the report we see the need for balancing some of those. But I would like to warn against those who always say that someone else has the responsibility when it does not go well in a certain Member State. It is not about good luck. It is about good reforms, good management and good governance. Sometimes, I would like not least the friends over there, but maybe also the friends over there, to think whether we are doing as well as we can.  Commissioner, I think that some of the good news that we can take from this debate is the fact that we are not doing as well as we can. We can do much better. We can set the targets for higher growth. Each Member State should have the target of a potential growth of at least three percent and make the reforms that can provide the jobs, the growth and the investment that can give Europe a lead.

And the question is: has a toxic product turned into a medicine for the European economy? That is the question we have to ask ourselves and our voters – our public. I dare to say yes, in the realisation that any medicine can be toxic if it is taken in excess. A medicine can be toxic if it is taken in an uncontrolled manner, meaning that you have to take control. I will come back to that.  I am happy to have had the debate not only now, but also on many occasions in this House. It is an extremely important topic if only because of its history. We know that the financial crisis started with toxic products – mortgages – in the USA and then almost blew up the entire system. This was a major blow to the financial sector, the economy and people’s everyday lives. I am happy that we have had this debate, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the people that worked on this, and of course the shadows, especially Othmar Karas – who you could say is my co-rapporteur – as well as the people from the Commission and the Council. I ask forgiveness for having sometimes been strong-headed and a bit stubborn, but I hope I have never been narrow-minded.  The start of this discussion, which was almost two years ago, was with a proposal from the Commission and also the proposal from the Commission tried to draw lessons from the crisis, for example by defining clear responsibilities for issuers and investors. The issuers have to disclose information and the investors have to do due diligence. No longer can someone say ‘I didn’t know what I was selling’, or ‘I didn’t know what I was buying’.  But another question we had in the debate in Parliament was ‘are these all the lessons that we need to learn from a financial crisis?’ Put differently – more technically – what you want is a deep and liquid market at all times, in good times and in bad times. The European Parliament has added some of these lessons.  Firstly, an issue that is not at the core of our discussion: sustainability. We added sustainability by including characteristics of houses and cars. This also shows that we have to do this more consistently as legislators – both the Commission and the Parliament. I know that the Commissioner is working on that, and I very much support it. More at the core of this file was the prudential framework and strong supervision, giving clear roles to the ESRB and to the ESMA. This is important when you want to control the market.  The second was transparency: data repositories now giving a role to European Data Warehouse. There was also a discussion on the retention rates – the skin in the game. As I learnt, through discussions in this House and outside this House, it was not just about the rate, it was about the method.  There is still an important difference between a horizontal and a vertical method, because it is not about the rate, it is about the incentive. The European Parliament has taken a good position by differentiating between the two, but we also know that we will have a review later. This is the part that the European Parliament has to take a very close look at.  Finally, let me say that this is also for the supervisors. They have an important role to monitor and control this market.

The new rules for securitisations are an important step on the way to creating a European capital markets union, good news for Europe as a financial and business location and a success for the European Parliament. By converting receivables into tradable securities, securitization spreads risk so that it can be borne by those who are best placed to do so. It creates new investment opportunities and it improves household and business lending. Regarding regulation, there were two things that had to be reconciled: on the one hand, we want to learn an important lesson from the financial crisis and ensure financial stability; on the other hand, we want to revive the European market and address the 42% decline in emissions compared to the pre-crisis level. We have achieved the goals for which the European Parliament has worked so hard from the start, and I should like to thank Mr Tang and the other colleagues in committee very warmly. We create simple, transparent and uniform rules - a safe vehicle that helps to finance the real economy and to restore trust in the European securitization market, both between banks and other financial instruments. The two jointly negotiated legal acts - I am the rapporteur and EPP rapporteur - work hand in hand to achieve these goals. If we think of it as a car, then the new framework for all securitisations would probably be the body and the revision of the Capital Adequacy Ordinance its engine. In order to keep the engine running, we in Parliament have ensured that we encourage the spending of high-quality products with risk-based capital treatment for STS securitisations, that we deviate from Basel in the hierarchy of approaches under certain conditions Enabling the prerequisites for taking European peculiarities into account, that we are expanding incentives for SME securitisations and that we are forbidding re-securitisations so that credit risks can no longer be concealed from investors. For a robust body, we have set the risk deductible at 5% in line with global standards, created a securitization register for more transparency, ensured that car securitisations are carried out and enforced comprehensive monitoring of the securitization market. With this legislative package - illustrated in the body and engine - we show that we are serious about drawing clearer, more transparent and stricter rules together and regaining confidence in the market so that poison can become medicine and we can earn up to EUR 150 billion mobilize additional financial resources for the European economy, which we urgently need alongside the reforms in order to make growth and employment in Europe a permanent achievement again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 282, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, today’s debate and your vote tomorrow concern one of the first proposals put forward as part of our capital markets union, and it is an important one. By defining criteria for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation (STS), we can revitalise European capital markets’ securitisation in a sustainable way. There is a broad consensus among regulators, supervisors and companies that this would benefit the European economy. It would free up more lending for investment and help manage risk in the banking sector. Securitisation allows banks to convert pools of individual loans into bonds, which are then sold to other institutions or long—term investors. This helps banks free up capital set aside for existing loans and, in this way, securitisation supports more lending to the wider economy and gives investors access to more investment instruments. Securitisation is believed by many to have been the trigger for the financial crisis in the US. While EU securitisation has performed well overall during the crisis, the crisis still reveals flaws in the way securitisation was regulated and supervised. At the moment securitisation in the EU is very low. Last year, issuance of securitised products in Europe was not even at half of its 2007 level. Given its important role in financing the real economy, in 2015 the Commission put forward a framework for revitalising the market in a prudent way. By rebuilding issuance back to the pre-crisis levels, we could generate an additional EUR 115 billion of yearly funding for households and companies.  After two years of discussions, I am happy to say that the final result is both balanced and ambitious. It will help restore an important funding channel for the EU economy, while learning from the mistakes of the past. The new regulation sets out specific criteria for securitisations to help investors understand the nature and the risk of what they are investing in. The qualifying securitisations would be simple. For example, only comparable loans can be brought together in one product, and the repackaging of other securitisations would generally not be allowed.  They would also be transparent, meaning that the right information is available for investors to assess risk and for supervisors to properly monitor markets. Building on the Parliament’s proposal, the package now includes an ESMA-supervised data repository to ensure the transparency of STS securitisations. Securitisations would be standardised to make them easy to identify and understand.  Our proposals contain appropriate safeguards. The issuer would need to retain at least 5% of the securitised asset. This is to ensure that their incentives are aligned with those of the investor. Underlying assets would also need to be creditworthy according to existing EU rules.  Finally, we are introducing new capital requirement rules for those banks that invest in securitisation in order to promote a stable and resilient banking sector. These requirements build on global standards and will fully reflect the lower risks associated with the STS securitisation.  So we have done important work to agree on the final text. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Roberto Gualtieri, the rapporteurs, Paul Tang and Othmar Karas, and the shadow rapporteurs.

Many times the citizens with whom I meet in Asturias, in Spain, ask me what we do in this Chamber. Even the public that is here with us today asks us what is this about securitisations, or what we work on every day. And I have to say that it is sometimes very difficult to explain what our job is, how the regulations, the directives that we adopt and debate in this Parliament affect your day-to-day lives. I believe that today we approved two very important regulations, because many families are thinking, for example, of buying a car that they probably want to finance. Or many small businesses are having problems getting their banks to advance the collection of bills or allow them to place commercial paper. And these two Regulations come to help those people. These two Regulations will allow small companies that, in the large organized markets, do not have shares, that cannot issue bonds in the international capital markets, can more easily place this commercial paper through their own banking entities, Because they will be able to securitize it, they will be able to place it later in those international markets. They will also allow those households that are thinking of buying cars or buying another series of goods that they need to finance to be financed with better interest rates, with better treatment. Therefore, today we are taking a very important step, because we believe that we need to activate that financing capacity to the real economy and we do so. And we do it with prudence, because we have managed to get the European Systemic Risk Board to analyze capital markets to avoid bubbles like the one we experienced in the past crisis. And the We also achieve that the capital requirements or the cost for banks of carrying out this type of operations are a little lower, but always subject to very restrictive quality criteria on this type of loans: important qualities, high qualities so as not to commit againthe mistakes of the past crisis.Furthermore, with these two Regulations we help to create that European capital market.Because we defend that rating agencies, which always discriminate based on the quality of the sovereign, play a lesser role and international investors focus exclusively on the risk of small loans.Look at exactly what the risk is to avoid discrimination between the countries of the North and the countries of the South.So we are going to approve those two reports, and I think that, starting tomorrow, European citizens will notice this on a day-to-day basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 285, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Kay SWINBURNE", "mepid": "96920", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs Mr Tang and Mr Karas on their reports. Securitised products can be incredibly complicated financial products, yet in the past they had an overly simplified reputation and consequently enjoyed widespread use.  Post-financial crisis, the use of securitisation has severely diminished across Europe, however. I therefore commend the effort shown by this Parliament to encourage understanding and rebuild trust and confidence in these instruments. I am pleased that we have managed to bring this report closer to international standards and ensure that the EU is not placed at a competitive disadvantage globally. However, I personally believe that we could have been even more ambitious in this proposal and, indeed, with the Capital Markets Union project as a whole, as this is an area in which our level of achievement does not so far seem to match up to our rhetoric.  For CMU to work, it needs decisive action, not purely discussion and then compromise. We need an overhaul of national tax laws that favour debt over equity-financing, a reaffirmation of a commitment to global, supervisory cooperation and standards globally. Furthermore, a cultural shift here in Europe from savings to investment is critical.  The aims of CMU need to guide our hand in all ongoing legislation. We need consistency across all legislative files. The EMIR review, for example, needs to be very specifically about finding solutions to the unintended consequences and burdens that we have placed upon non-financial companies. Therefore, the classification of securitisation special purpose entities as financial counterparties, for example, as recently released in the Commission draft report, seems to contradict and threaten what we have achieved in the securitisation legislation.

I believe that carefully monitored, high—quality securitisation can serve to benefit business across Europe. In the EU as a whole, we are too reliant on loans and other forms of funding from banks. Capital markets give businesses a new avenue for funding for their activities. The diversification of funding is important to help deliver more growth for the European economy.  During our negotiations on this regulation, we tried to find the right balance between the lessons learned from the financial crisis and having a framework which ensured that we did not stifle the potential of the securitisation market. We have agreed to have a sensible level of skin in the game, with the risk retention rate for banks of 5%. We have recognised the specificities of the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, particularly as regards pools of car loans and leases. We have enhanced the transparency of securitisation markets, notably through the establishment of data repositories which will enable competent authorities to have a full overview of the products in the market. We have ensured that those who are responsible for originating securitisation products take full responsibility for the products’ place in the marketplace. They will not be able to shift responsibility to empty shelves such as special—purpose vehicles. In the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) file we have adjusted the prudential requirements by adding a new hierarchy approach and a more risk-sensitive prudential treatment of STS securitisation.

At the heart of that crisis was the process of repackaging debt to turn it into new assets, a highly lucrative business, but one that created risks to our financial system when unscrupulous traders bundled bad debts with good, kept the profits and socialised the risks. Today we are debating an attempt by the European institutions to restart this process of securitisation and to give it a seal of approval as STS: simple, transparent securitisation. Sadly, most in the Parliament and Council of Ministers who have agreed on this new legislation seem not to have learned the lessons of the crisis. Greens attempted to limit the damage securitisation might do by proposing that banks share much more of the risk of the loans that they sell off to ensure that they keep adequate skin in the game. They should be discouraged from investing in each other securitisations and should ensure that the products are as simple as possible. This would mean that investors can access the highest-quality information about what is actually in the box, including to what extent the securitisation contributes to sustainability goals. Rather than strengthening standards against a repetition of past problems, the already unsatisfactory proposal from the Commission was watered down in favour of banks and other lenders of specific kinds of loans, specifically car loans, which many have warned may represent a subprime—style bubble. Negotiations with the Council, where Member States demonstrated even less concern for the safety of the financial system, delivered a result that represents a bad deal for ordinary citizens.  This legislation is the latest example of political amnesia and regulatory rollback with the EU’s political leadership favouring the narrow interests of an oversized financial system over the need to promote financial stability, funding to entrepreneurs and small businesses and quality jobs in the real economy.

It also annoys him that loan amounts have to be hedged when they are securitized and bundled as if they were listed individually on bank balance sheets. Europe is taking a different path here. In September 2015, the Commission first published the proposal for STS securitisations, i.e. securitisations that are simple, transparent and standardized. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have now agreed on the framework data for a new securitization regulation, which consists of two sets of rules that are being discussed today. These are the Securitization Ordinance - the criteria for all securitisations, in particular STS securitisations, requirements for due diligence and risk retention - and secondly the adjustments to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CRR) to implement the revised Basel securitization rules for institutions.

The regulatory package that we will approve tomorrow establishes common standards for all securitisations and constitutes a framework so that securitization products are, despite the doubts of some, safe, simple and transparent, and are standardized and sufficiently supervised. These new rules will help investors better assess the risks related to securitization, both in the products themselves and in the different product categories. In 2014 we saw the securitization market shrink by almost 50% from its peak in 2007, and this led to many SMEs not getting the funding they requested. This agreement helps to create new investment opportunities throughout the Union and offers an additional source of financing for the economy, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Thanks to the reactivation of the securitization market, we will achieve more diversified sources of financing and less dependent on the banking sector, thus contributing to the overall stability and resilience of the financial system. The Commission's projections show that if the volume of securitization in the European Union were to reach the pre-crisis average level, it could generate between € 100 and € 150 billion more in funding. The main ones favored would be small and medium-sized companies, which are the engine of the European economy.

This goes beyond what the Council wanted and I believe it is a good approach not to get lost in endless conflicts. The second step forward that I want to underline - it is also the result of our determination - is to ensure that this securitization cannot be based in tax havens, in particular those appearing in the list of countries identified by the FATF. as not contributing to the fight against tax evasion, within the framework of the OECD conventions.

What kind of transparency - Ladies and Gentlemen - are we talking about? The second major risk is that banks may manipulate the ranking of these artificially generated instruments, again without external control.

In this way, asset-backed securities deepen the liquidity or financial markets and increase the capacity of banks to extend more credit. Moreover, they allow the risk and term structure of available marketable financial instruments to better adjust to the different risk preferences of individual investors. In this sense, securitisation is able to contribute to financial stability and the more efficient allocation of resources across the economy. However, securitisation may carry also risks. Investors may not have access to full information about the underlying assets and their quality. Securitisation may also involve deals that are overly complex and even opaque. This may result in excessive risk taking by investors and may lead to accumulation of systemic risk in the entire financial sector. The idea behind the two legislative measures we are discussing today is to reduce these risks and to promote a safe and liquid market for securitisation in the EU. Firstly, the regulation strengthens requirements for due diligence and imposes minimal risk-retention standards to ensure that banks retain a net material interest in asset-backed securities they issue. Secondly, there is a ban on re-securitisation. Thirdly, all underlying documentation relevant for any transaction is made readily available to investors. Fourthly, the crucial amendment to the CRR ensures that the capital treatment of securitisation for banks better reflects the risks involved.  Mr. President, I would like to express my thanks to both rapporteurs and to the European Commission for their work. When adopted, this package will not only help us establish a clear set of criteria to identify simple, transparent and standardised securitisations, but it will also contribute to building the Capital Markets Union in Europe.

At the same time, I had proposed the creation of a rescue fund for borrowers so that the Greeks could save their homes from the \"crows\", in order to put a full stop in the electronic auctions. Thus, 4.5 billion euros out of the 25 billion euros left over from the third loan package of 86 billion can finance the borrowers' rescue fund so that no house passes into the hands of a banker.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 300, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, first of all, I’m grateful for your engagement and support in the whole process that gets us to the positive result, and I hope that tomorrow’s vote will confirm this.

It is interesting to hear that we still have a difference of opinion, and I think that these proposals – with good work from Othmar Karas – that we have brought together have been able to unite Parliament, but not entirely. Let that also be a warning that there are still some doubts that have been part of the debate.  There are opportunities that are emphasised: it could be an opportunity for refinancing the European economy, especially when the policy of cheap money will end one day. Securitisation will then be an important way of financing, but there are not only opportunities – there are also threats. I would like to call also on the supervisors that have been given an important role in this piece of legislation to take on the duty of closely monitoring and following the market, especially when the market starts – it is crucial that it starts in the right way, and that the market gets functioning. This is what I would like to see: if you want to develop a strong market, you also need a strong government and strong supervision. This is what I hope for, because we will see these markets start – maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow, when opportunities to finance become scarcer and securitisation becomes more attractive.  Finally, I would like to say that this debate will continue. We have a review, issues have been addressed in the debate, and the European Parliament should follow this market closely at the appropriate times – and I am sure that we will.

As you know, they are friends, allies and partners of the European Union. We share a lot with them – our norms, our values, different approaches – and strengthening that relationship is a priority. The EU has signed political framework agreements with both countries to further strengthen the partnership on the basis of these values: respect for democratic principles, human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, promotion together of international peace and security, and also our joint work to strengthen the multilateral system and global rule—based trade. The EU has a healthy and mature trade and investment relationship with both these countries. We are one of the biggest partners of Australia and New Zealand in the trade of goods, services and foreign direct investment.  Australia and New Zealand have concluded foreign trade agreements with China, with ASEAN, with Japan and with Korea. They are part of the Trans—Pacific Partnership with 11 countries, and they are moving ahead. These developments have put European exporters of goods, services and investors in a comparatively less favourable situation compared to their competitors in other countries. The Commission has carried out an impact assessment, clearly showing the benefits of these agreements for European producers and consumers. The already considerable EU exports to both countries, on a par with our exports to Canada, could increase by a third in the long term.  The submission to the public consultation and the Commission’s impact assessment paid particular attention to some significant sensitive sectors in European agriculture in the context of these free trade agreements, and also what we do on our broad agenda: dairy, beef, sheep meat and sugar. The Commission made it absolutely clear to our partners in Australia and New Zealand that agricultural sensitivities must be taken into account in these negotiations. No full liberalisation can be imagined. The Commission has therefore proposed that the negotiating directives specifically include this aspect to ensure that the future agreement will not cause any disruption in the EU, including in our outermost regions.  On 13 September, as you recall, the Commission adopted recommendations for negotiating authorisations and directives for free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand. An important difference with our recent practice is that these recommendations do not cover investment protection. That does not mean that we will not negotiate investment protection agreements with Australia and New Zealand, but it does not have to be right now. We are reflecting, following the opinion of the Court of Justice on the Singapore Free Trade Agreement, and we are engaged in a discussion with Member States about the future architecture of the EU trade and investment agreement. We have also taken into account what some Member States said, namely that if investment protection is proposed additionally, then Parliament should of course be consulted on that aspect as well.  I just want to end with a few words on transparency. This is something that you, this Chamber, often – and very rightly so – demand of the Commission. As I strongly support transparency as well, we have made these recommendations public to the world. We invited Member States to engage early with their national parliaments so that there could be an early discussion on these two negotiations and of course also to facilitate your work on this and to give the general public an idea what trade negotiations are about and what is in this agreement. This is to strengthen, not to undermine, the important work that you do in this regard. These proposed directives are now under discussion in the Council. I hope that they will soon give us the authorisation to launch these negotiations without delay. In this context, we in the Commission very much welcome your contribution – the debate tonight and the votes you will have tomorrow on this – which contribute to giving us a clear steer of the priorities of Parliament in the upcoming negotiations. We will of course, as always, keep you closely informed about developments as we take these initiatives forward.  The free trade agreements will help EU companies to have better access to the markets in Australia and New Zealand. These trade agreements can create jobs, bring about benefits to consumers and also support workers’ rights and environmental and climate change objectives. This initiative is framed by our strategy to promote openness based on values and standards with like—minded partners committed to progressive rules for global trade. This is another part of our work to build bridges, not walls, with a circle of friends who share our values and this is also very much a political message, as well as an economic and trade policy question.  I very much look forward to the debate tonight.

I'm sorry I ran in here at the last moment. But we were having a discussion on this dossier in our group at the same time. I see that two representatives of the Agriculture Committee will speak here after me, and there was a heat between trade and agriculture. That's why I forgot the time a bit. On behalf of the rapporteur Daniel Caspary, I would like to ask for support for the recommendations to the Council on the mandate for the EU's trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. It is an old demand from the EPP Group, but also from Parliament, to start free trade negotiations with these states. We all know that now that the United States has withdrawn from TTIP, we have a very different geopolitical situation and it is the right moment for the EU to show that we are for free trade. But mind you - and I am also addressing my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee - for free trade also for the benefit of our agriculture. We have already started negotiations or concluded agreements with several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. So it is logical that we should do it with these two now. The rapporteur would like to highlight three points in particular. Firstly, on 13 September the Commission presented mandates that relate exclusively to trade and investment liberalization agreements. The mandates only include content that is within the competence of the European Union. That is the approach that the political group and also Parliament should support, as it ensures that European trade policy is able to act. With this in mind, the political groups have also agreed to exclude the subject of investment protection from the reports to let. However, should either the Council add the subject of investment protection to the mandate or the Commission submit a proposal for a second agreement, including investment protection, Parliament will then definitely take a position on this. I add here: must position. Agriculture is a sensitive issue in trade with Australia and New Zealand. The political groups have accordingly agreed on a compromise that takes this sensitive issue into account. Third: enforcement mechanism in the sustainability chapter. This is a contentious issue between the two big groups - all the other groups have different opinions on this. S&D calls for a sanctions-based mechanism, the EPP is critical of such an approach. As a compromise, we agreed on a formulation between the two large groups, as we have already adopted in other resolutions, for example in the resolution for the negotiations with Chile. I hope the other groups will follow us. Here, too, on behalf of the rapporteur, I would like to make it very clear to colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture, but also to all colleagues who fear that globalization and free trade could change our continent too much: we in the Committee on Trade will ensure that our standards are met social standards, environmental standards and consumer protection standards are guaranteed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 307, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Momchil NEKOV", "mepid": "125013", "text": "rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Malmström, New Zealand and Australia are our traditional partners and we have the potential to find common ground.

I support the report on New Zealand, so that products such as sheepmeat, dairy products and, I would add, honey are considered sensitive and have a more specific approach to them, for example through quotas or transitional periods. High European animal welfare standards and European geographical indications must also find a worthy place in the negotiations. I call on European producers concerned about Brexit and its effects. Existing import quotas for products traditionally sold on the British market now need to be reviewed and reduced reasonably on the basis of market presence, for example by almost 40% for sheepmeat.

However, any deal must respect the sensitivities of European agriculture, and I welcome the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has the opportunity to come forward with this opinion. Producers across Europe are not anti-free trade. All they ask is a level playing field, treating as sensitive products that would be exposed by EU producers to excessive unsustainable pressure. For instance, by introducing transitional periods, appropriate quotas and factoring in respect for seasonal cycles, which we expect to see particularly for the lamb sector. Can I also say that agriculture cannot be made the bargaining chip of these negotiations. The Commission needs to keep the European agri-foods sector and MEPs informed of all aspects of negotiations, and I thank my shadow rapporteurs for Australia and New Zealand and Mr Andrieu for putting forward these opinions.

I am optimistic: as the Commissioner said, it was the first time that the draft mandates were published. I also appeal to the Council to comply with this and to publish the negotiating mandates once they have been adopted. In addition, the European Parliament must continue to be strengthened and involved in the negotiation process, from the adoption of the mandates to the conclusion of the negotiations. A fundamental pillar of trade policy is also a strong, enforceable sustainability chapter that serves to protect workers, consumers and the environment.

I would not advise calling an Australian a New Zealander, nor a New Zealander an Australian, especially not if they play rugby for the All Blacks, but I do welcome doing free trade agreements with both these great, independent and democratic trading nations. It is well overdue. Now existing bilateral arrangements and regulatory cooperation make the case for a deeper agreement to be negotiated relatively easily. I note that the New Zealand deal may be based on around 80% of the recent Canada or CETA trade deal, which is considered to be a gold standard. My group does take issue with two key points in the report though. Firstly, the inclusion of a sanctions-based mechanism on the trade and sustainable development – or TSD – chapter. This is an ineffective approach which discourages goodwill and damages engagement in negotiations. Secondly, the exclusion of the so-called ‘sensitive’ agricultural sectors from the report. Australia and New Zealand have the right to promote their agricultural exports, and it is a sorry state of affairs when the EU embraces protectionism.

Should this apple come from New Zealand in the future? Then he has more air miles behind him than some ministers. The EU wants to sign new free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand. Tomorrow we will discuss this in plenary and also vote. The question arises: Do we even need these agreements? Our industry certainly wants to export machines, cars, etc. For example, Australia wants to export sheep meat, coal, uranium and ores, New Zealand meat, dairy products and other agricultural products. Does it really make sense to e.g. B. To transport milk or agricultural products halfway around the world, when we ourselves have so much of it? We have a milk lake, we have enough sheep meat. We don't need these products. But in these countries production is cheaper than in ours because they have lower animal welfare standards. That means our agriculture will lose jobs. It is not true that we are creating new jobs through these agricultural products - at least at all levels. On the contrary. Let's see how things went with NAFTA, the agreement between the USA, Canada and Mexico. 800,000 jobs have been lost there - mainly in agriculture. Besides, these agreements are not just about trade; it could be regulated more easily if the tariffs were abolished and the same standards were created. We don't need these agreements for that. Modern free trade agreements contain very different things: They restrict - at least to some extent - our legislation. The wording in the CETA agreement still melts in my mouth. There it is explicitly stated that unnecessary barriers to trade and investment must be dismantled or that no new ones may appear.

And so that we do not have situations like we did with CETA, there must be transparency in the negotiation and it must be made clear that, as this is a mixed agreement, we must have the involvement and involvement of national parliaments and it must this agreement, to be ratified by the national parliaments, not to go through a process like we went to CETA with supposedly temporary implementation of the agreement without being ratified by the national parliaments.

And in this world today that is not negligible: we need friends like that. Our current exports to these countries are more than our exports to Canada, and they can be much bigger. We have done very thorough preparatory work with both Australia and New Zealand: they are aware of the debate here in Europe; they are aware of our sensitivities; they are aware of the political discussions in some of the countries relating to trade. Of course we cannot exclude the whole agricultural sector – that makes absolutely no sense – but we are aware of the sensitive parts of this. But it needs to be put in perspective: it is worth noting that New Zealand and Australia already today benefit from preferential access to the EU for sensitive products because of WTO quotas. And while for beef the small country-specific quotas are almost entirely used, the use of quotas for sheep meat and dairy have declined the past years – and that means that Australia and New Zealand have found new, other, more attractive markets for their exports, and have diverted their exports increasingly to other countries in Asia, where they have trade agreements. In the case of New Zealand, about two—thirds of our imports are agricultural goods. Sheep meat makes one—third of EU agricultural imports from New Zealand, and it already today enters duty—free as a result of a historical and very large tariff—rate quota. In the case of Australia, agriculture is less than one—sixth of our total imports, and the biggest import is oilseed – canola – mostly used for biodiesel production in the EU. We actually have a growing surplus in agricultural trade, and especially in high-value added processed agricultural products. So we do have sensitive products – absolutely – and there are ways to deal with that, with tariff rate quotas, phasing—ins, etc. But we also have offensive interest, and not least if we can get New Zealand and Australia to accept the geographical indications which mean so much for our agricultural sector. On transparency: yes, you can rely on the Commission – we will do this in utmost transparency, continuing the tradition to publish documents and to liaise with you in different areas. We sent the draft mandates from the Commission directly to the national parliaments so that they can start yesterday looking into them, setting up the different committees or sectors, etc., to be able to follow closely these relations and these negotiations. Of course they should be involved. They don’t necessarily have to vote in the end, but they should be involved, much more than in the past – that is a national responsibility as well. And, as you know, we are setting up a permanent advisory group for all our trade agreements where businesses, trade unions, environmental organisations and consumer organisations will be involved, because we do want to listen to their advice, and that is part of the new, more inclusive trade policy. New Zealand and Australia are, of course, two different countries: different traditions, different politics. We started the process at the same time. We have finished the scoping. We finished the Commission’s work of proposing the mandate at the same time, and I guess – but I’m not sure – that the Council will allow us to start the negotiations at the same time, as you have chosen to deal with the report at the same time. But each country will have their own path of negotiation. If we are ready with one country then we will conclude with that country; it will not have to wait for the other one. And, as I said, in this process rest assured that the European Parliament will be fully aware.

We import around EUR 1.9 billion worth of agricultural products from Australia, but we export EUR 3.1 billion worth of agriculture products.

I am taking the floor on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Bulc, who unfortunately has had to return to Brussels. There are three important questions being asked in relation to ticket distribution in the airline sector and the charges that can be incurred by the travelling public. These questions address concerns about the consumer’s access to unbiased travel information and the possibility to freely compare and use different distribution channels. The Commission is aware that the Lufthansa Group has added a so—called ‘distribution cost charge’ on tickets purchased through computerised reservation systems, while allowing travel agencies to book tickets for several cooperating airlines directly on the airline group’s own platform without any surcharge being added. We also know that other airlines have announced that they intend to do the same.  The Commission has received four complaints against the introduction of these distribution cost charges. The complainants consider the airline’s own platform to be a CRS (central reservation system) and claim that, as such, it should comply with Regulation No 80/2009. This is a complex case and the Commission investigations are still ongoing on the basis of the regulation.  In the Aviation Strategy adopted in December 2015 at the initiative of Commissioner Bulc, the Commission considered that the EU rules governing airline ticket distribution might no longer entirely reflect market reality and that several evolutions should be taken into account when considering whether the legislation remains appropriate: first, the engagement of airline ownership in the CRS; second, increased access to the internet; third, the development of alternative distribution channels; fourth, the regulation of CRS in other geographical markets. The Commission is carrying out a comprehensive evaluation of a regulation on common rules for the operation of air services in the EU. The regulation includes provisions on price transparency. We have also launched an evaluation of the regulation establishing a code of conduct for CRS systems. The results of those two evaluations are expected next year. They will not only assess the performance and effects of its provision, but also pay specific attention to the technological changes and challenges in the market. These evaluations will allow the Commission to determine whether EU action is needed to continue to guarantee that EU consumers have adequate access to travel services and unbiased travel information.  Thank you once again for your questions, and I look forward to your follow—up remarks.

I thought that we have an internal market, that we want to foster the internal market, and that we want transparency and neutrality. However, at the same time we have one carrier that will introduce a EUR 16 surcharge, which in reality means EUR 32, and I wonder why? Extra costs since it goes via different web portal? What does it mean? I, as a consumer, will pay EUR 32 more. Is there any justification? Secondly, if I am a well-informed consumer of course I will not choose any other than the Lufthansa website. So this is a serious issue that we have known about for two years. For one year it has been under investigation by the Commission with zero results, and I need to say, Commissioner, that unfortunately your reply is completely dissatisfactory.  I really wonder whether there is a lack of cooperation among the stakeholders of the company which means that we don’t have a decision yet. If so, which are the ones that are not cooperating? Is it because you know there is no case at all? We should know; there should be a decision if there is no case at all after one year and if the rules are insufficient. What is it that doesn't really work? What are the rules?  Or is it maybe, without any disrespect, is it because it’s Lufthansa? We really need other carriers to do the same so that we can really investigate and pursue the issue of the case. We’ve been discussing in this plenary with a good understanding with the Commission; we want to proceed with integrated ticketing, which means dismantling barriers, but this is exactly the opposite.

The companies must also not be allowed to charge unreasonable fees for fictitious costs. The climate can also benefit from more information. What do I mean by that? Well, information about the effect of air travel on the climate is an important complement to economic instruments for the customer to be able to make wise decisions about their travel.

Many people have lost their lives. Portugal and Spain have been among the most affected countries. On behalf of the Council, I would like to express my deepest condolences and sympathy to the relatives of the victims, to thank the countries which have provided assistance and also to thank the Commission for its coordination efforts. Last but not least, let me warmly thank all the firefighters for their huge commitment and effort. As honourable Members are aware, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, which we jointly adopted in 2013, provides for a number of measures to prevent, prepare for and respond to disasters. This includes the European Emergency Response Capacity, which is a voluntary pool of Member States’ assets pre—committed for immediate deployment inside or outside the EU. Several Member States have registered their forest fire fighting capacities in this pool. These resources have been deployed a number of times to provide assistance in combating forest fires across southern Europe. However, despite significant efforts at national and EU level to prevent forest fires, we have to stay prepared and ready to respond in a more efficient manner to these catastrophes. At the same time, a swift and efficient response is dependent on costly, and therefore limited, resources. EU solidarity might prove its limits when similar disasters occur simultaneously in a number of countries. Of course, when the Commission proposes the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, the Council will examine such a proposal as a matter of utmost urgency.  Finally, the Council has attentively examined the Commission’s recent interim evaluation report on the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. It includes a number of recommendations for further application of the mechanism. Some of them are particularly relevant for the prevention of, and response to, forest fires. This evaluation has marked the starting point of reflections on the future framework of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism which the Council will continue in the coming months. In this context, the Presidency has taken note with interest of the recent announcement, reiterated yesterday by President Juncker, of an upcoming Commission proposal to revise the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. We look forward to bringing debates on this matter forward.

Also, to those who have lost their homes in Portugal and Spain. It is unfortunately not the first time this year that this region has been affected by deadly forest fires. I also wish to pay tribute to the heroic firefighters – brave men and women – and ordinary citizens that stepped in to help. In 2017, the forest fire season has been one of the worst in the last decade; southern Europe has been very exposed. Helping Member States affected to fight forest fires has been a priority for the European Union. The truth is that national capacities alone are not enough. Climate change makes weather conditions more extreme in natural disasters more often. This is the harsh reality.  The European Union civil protection mechanism was activated 16 times because of forest fires in Europe since mid-June. We have never seen so many activations in so little time. Capacities such as firefighting aircraft, firefighters and vehicles were deployed on nine occasions. As Commissioner for crisis management, I warmly thank all the EU Member States that offered assistance through the mechanism. This is a true example of European solidarity.  We did our best to provide support with the means at our disposal, but let me be clear: the mechanism has specific legal and practical limitations. Our role, our mandate, is to coordinate – as my dear colleagues already said – and help with the transport costs only. We don’t have our own means, therefore we have to admit that sometimes our contribution is not sufficient. I would like to be very sincere: sometimes it was too little and too late. This is why we have already been exploring in the previous months ways to strengthen the mechanism. It was one of my top priorities.  President Juncker mandated me – and I want to thank him for this – to come forward with concrete proposals next month on how, together with our Member States, we can do more to better respond, prevent disasters and be better prepared for them.  This is not only – I would like to clarify this – about forest fires: just days ago, we had hurricanes hit Ireland and the UK. Floods have struck eastern and northern European Member States in the recent past, and earthquakes have consistently shaken Italy and Greece and other countries. So we owe this initiative to our citizens, to the European citizens.  It is now a priority of the Commission work programme, which we adopted yesterday. The proposals will be on the table before the end of November. There are three areas that I want to explore. First, through additional financial support we must increase capacities to act rapidly and effectively. Second, prevention and preparedness need to be at the core of the initiative: enhanced prevention and preparedness should be a precondition for additional support. Finally, we must improve the efficiency of the mechanism to enable a faster deployment of assistance during emergencies. In order to do this, I will need your support. Time is of the essence. The beginning of the next flood season has already started. The forest fire season has been dramatically extended this year, and the next one is in a few months from now. It is therefore crucial that we act fast, in a spirit of solidarity and efficiency. I know I can count on the European Parliament to be a strong ally to support our proposals, because we must rapidly offer solutions to our citizens. They expect more from us as European institutions.  In addition to the EU actions in the field of civil protection, let me also mention another important tool: the European solidarity fund. As you know, the European solidarity fund can provide valuable financial assistance to help cover a part of the cost created by disasters. Support is subject to fulfilling two conditions. First, total direct damage should exist as a threshold which is specific for each Member State or region; second, national authorities have to submit an application within 12 weeks of the start of the disaster.  Portugal has already submitted an application covering the forest fires that occurred between June and August. The Commission will soon finalise its assessment; we are working on the basis of significant support from the solidarity fund. In parallel, we are currently discussing with Portugal the possibility to extend their application to also include the most recent fires of October. For the recent fires in Spain, notably in Galicia, the damage has not been fully assessed yet. The Commission stands ready to provide guidance and support to the Spanish authorities, should they intend submitting an application. In terms of operational programmes, the Commission also rapidly adopted the proposal from Portugal to modify the original 2014-2020 central operational programme through internal relocation of the European regional development fund, ERDF.  We added two new actions. First, the replacement of the productive capacity of the SMEs that were lost during the fires, with a total ERDF budget of EUR 25 million. Second, the replacement of public municipal infrastructure equipment with a maximum budget of EUR 20 million. In addition, in Portugal, the operational programme for sustainability and resource efficiency provides the possibility to finance a range of investments to strengthen disaster resilience, prevention and preparedness. In Spain, the operational programme Galicia provides the possibility to finance investments in early detections, prevention and civil protection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 367, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "Paulo RANGEL", "mepid": "96903", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, first of all, I would naturally like to express my deep dismay at the fatalities of both the June fires and, in particular, the fires of the weekend of 15 October in Portugal and Spain, as well as all the material damage that obviously damages the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of families. Secondly, I would like to thank the European solidarity that is being demonstrated in this quick and efficient way that the Commissioner made clear here, which is also being demonstrated by the desire to reform the civil protection mechanism and which is also being demonstrated for the will that, eventually, all the measures that we will take to reorder the forest - because there is, here, a structural problem - may have an accounting in terms of deficit that could favor the Portuguese situation in European terms. However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that here, in this same House, in the State of the Union speech, I was the only person who asked for the creation of a European Civil Protection Force, following the 2006 Barnier report, and that, in Portugal, during these months, I drew attention to the fact that the Portuguese State and the Portuguese Government have divested in civil protection and are neglecting the situation and, naturally, as shown in the technical reports presented in the meantime, there were failures also serious from the Portuguese Government, which are to be regretted and which could have avoided some of the most harmful effects of this situation - and this cannot be left out.

I would like to thank, on behalf of Portugal and the Portuguese, for the profoundly symbolic gesture of donating to victims of the Princess of Asturias da Concórdia prize, attributed to the European Union. We are facing a systemic challenge. We need to respond to forest management, combating desertification of territories, strengthening prevention and updating prevention and relief mechanisms.

Eventually, Commissioner, the joint application of Portugal and Spain may help to speed up the response of the solidarity fund. It is obvious that the failure to account for recovery and prevention investment for the purposes of structural deficit is an appropriate, intelligent and must be applied measure.

Let's be clear: Spain and Portugal do not burn spontaneously, in the Spanish northwest, for criminal or cultural reasons, up to 70% of the fires are intentional. Furthermore, we have abandoned Mt. Today development rhymes with depopulation, lack of preventive management and spatial planning, and the Iberian Peninsula is currently suffering the worst drought in the last twenty years (extremely high temperatures and the first hurricane ever recorded so far east in the Atlantic). What can we do? The drama of hyperfires can only be ended with the persecution of those responsible, prevention policies, public awareness and long-term territorial planning. Let us dedicate more resources to environmental prosecutors so that those who set fire to the forest can be identified and sentenced. Let us prioritize investments in high fire risk areas and greater prevention through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. Let's recover the pre-crisis budgets, because, like it or not, we will have to extend the high-risk campaign and the fire operation to the entire year. Let us ban eucalyptus and other flammable species in the surroundings of nuclei and cities to reduce the risk for local populations. Let us implement a landscape management policy through prescribed burning, sustainable forestry or extensive ranching. Let us finally approve a climate change law in Spain, at the height of the challenge of climate change.

I want to start by expressing my feeling of regret to our Portuguese neighbors for the high number of fatalities suffered. Also in Galicia, my land, we have had to mourn four deaths: my deepest condolences to their families. And I want to add some information about Galicia. The fires were the result of intentional arson activity, not the result of chance. The security forces and the justice system are now investigating the responsibility of these fires. Some criminal hands took advantage of the extreme weather conditions on Sunday the 15th: extremely high temperatures for October preceded by a prolonged drought and very strong winds due to the effect of Hurricane Ofelia. That day there were many fires —125—, tripling the number of those that appear the most risky days of the worst months of August. In addition, most ignited in the afternoon and at night, so that the aerial means of extinction could not be used. Even so, many fires were put out, but some difficult circumstances, especially the wind, made it impossible to put them all out. Commissioner, Galician forests do not burn by chance, they are burned by criminal hands. It was not a problem of lack of resources, there were never as many operational resources as this month of October: 5,600 people, 350 brigades, 220 motor-pump trucks and 40 large shovels or bulldozers, in addition to a score of aerial resources. To this must be added the important troops of the Military Emergency Unit. Nor is it a problem arising from the type of tree species. For example, Orense, the province of Galicia most affected these days, has practically no eucalyptus trees. We are essentially facing a problem of criminal delinquency, which took advantage of extreme weather circumstances.I end by expressing my gratitude to President Juncker for his commitment expressed yesterday in this chamber to study as soon as possible the application of the Solidarity Fund to these serious fires.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 373, "date": "2017-10-25.json", "name": "José BLANCO LÓPEZ", "mepid": "125044", "text": "- Madam President, just ten days ago Galicia was burned again.

The easy thing now is to talk about plots that burn the forest, of arsonists that must be punished, but that is not the underlying problem. Galicia has serious problems that its Government does not face: depopulation and abandonment of rural areas, lack of territorial planning, erroneous forestry policy, lack of prevention. What happened in the terrible wave of fires of 2006 is that we came from several years of government that looked the other way in terms of spatial planning and forest policy. And now the same thing happened. It is therefore urgent that governments take comprehensive measures to combat and prevent fires seriously and it is urgent that measures be taken and that inaction be abandoned in the face of climate change. The European Union must also be more belligerent to face the challenge of climate change, to reorient its policies. The Solidarity Fund must be reoriented so that it is effective in alleviating the consequences of the disaster caused by climate change.

I therefore think that if we provide aid - and of course we should do that, a fine proposal, Commissioner - then we should also ask for a report from the Member State on how they work in that balance between prevention, between assistance and recovery. You also said that we have created the opportunity to release 95% of European funds from the European Regional Development Fund. Part of it is already being used. We can do more, there is more space. But now I also want to know how that rural policy, that rural recovery, how that is done. That is not just short-term assistance. These are structural measures to indeed make the countryside safe for people again, and we must reclaim that. Not just offering, but also seeking a balance, as it were. Second, you say that a plan has been put forward for those first fires - we discussed that here. Now they certainly cross that threshold. Do you want to deal with this quickly and indeed finish it as soon as possible.

We are perfectly aware that what is there is not enough. As you said, national capabilities alone are not enough and this is demonstrated, as you recalled, by the 16 times in which the mechanism had to intervene this summer only for fires. We need to improve our ability to react, prevention and preparation must be our priorities. The European citizens are on our side, they are with us, they ask us this, they want to see more Europe here, much more Europe. I too believe that it would be a nice thing, perhaps, to have a real European civil protection mechanism, but we also know that the primary responsibility for responding to these disasters lies with the Member States, so much so that in the last legislature subsidiarity has it had to be our North Star to be able to deploy this mechanism.

I have taken very careful note of your suggestions and your proposals, which will definitely feed into my reflections and proposals to the College next month. Thank you so much for your support and your encouragement in reaching this very critical objective, namely to give to our citizens a real European response to these unprecedented natural disasters inside Europe. I would like to respond to some of your observations. First of all, as I said, we need to take a comprehensive approach. I want to come forward with proposals, not only in response to the forest fires – as I said – but also to hurricanes, earthquakes and floods. This is quite important for me. To do this we need – as I said – at least three things. I would like to stress this because it is a sort of strategic plan. First, additional financial support, to be better equipped to respond to disasters. I am sure that we all agree on this. Second, we need to put more emphasis on prevention and preparedness, with better links to the structural funds. I thank you because I saw again that we agree on this. For me, increased prevention and preparedness should be a precondition for any extra support. Finally, the third point is that we of course need to improve the efficiency of the mechanism, so that we can deploy assistance more rapidly during emergencies. This is quite important, and this why I accepted that sometimes our response was not as fast as the emergency required. My dear friends, we are not starting from zero in terms of coordinating the civil protection activities of our Member States. In my contact with the Council and our Member States through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, some Member States are now already pre—committing capacities, such as firefighters, for rapid deployment. This is quite important. We certainly need to be able to deploy more firefighting teams when requested. This will be an important element of our work. I would also like to respond to the idea of new planes. We all agree that there are not enough planes and capacities to deal with the increasing number of forest fires. One of the objectives of the revision is to address this gap and develop additional operational capacities. We will look at all options in order to find the most efficient solution. The mandate that I received from the College, President Juncker and the Council is very clear. We must provide better support to our citizens at times of crisis and emergency, with maximum efficiency and minimum bureaucracy. As I said, we are not starting from zero in terms of coordination. The experience of the Civil Protection Mechanism is positive, but it has its shortcomings. We will therefore come forward with concrete proposals in order to deliver these rapid and tangible results on the ground, and tangible European solidarity to our citizens. So we need to be better prepared for future natural disasters and to have more capacity to respond to the next natural disaster. Time is of the essence. We should be in place to help our citizens practically. At least this is our duty as representatives of the European people.

This year alone, 750,000 hectares have been burned in the Union and more than 100 people have died from this cause. I would like to acknowledge the symbolic initiative of the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, to donate the 50,000 euros of the last Princess of Asturias concord award to the victims of the fires. I also endorse the proposals of my colleagues in Parliament to improve our civil protection mechanism against fires and to ensure that the European solidarity fund does its job more effectively. A vertebrate and united Europe cannot afford to have weak links that test its natural and human heritage so dramatically. The challenges of climate change and interested crime that have such an impact on the environment, especially in the rural world, demand not to leave the States and citizens alone.

Furthermore, 2017 will be the warmest year on record, due to the undeniable greenhouse effect increased by our lifestyle dependent on fossil fuels. The abandonment of the land, low environmental awareness and the negative effects of fire as a destructive instrument do the rest. To this we add a forestry model, lacking adequate planning and based on monocultures of pyrophytes such as eucalyptus, and the disastrous regional management of means of prevention. Unconcerned about an autumn with temperatures of up to 35 ºC, and criticized by the unions, the Xunta de Galicia fired 465 brigade members who finished their contracts, just 15 days before the gloomy weekend. The environment is not perceived as a source of wealth, and this pedagogical task is an essential task for administrations. In Spain, it is the responsibility of the regional government, with full transferred environmental competencies, to assume the obligation of planning, conservation and prevention with a long-term horizon.

In addition, they inflicted a severe blow on the Portuguese forest. In this regard, it is worth mentioning the vast burnt area, equivalent to the total recorded in Portugal in many of the previous years. These unfortunate events call for a deep discussion about the reasons, the immediate response, but also what we can do to prevent tragedies like this from recurring in the future. The possibility of establishing a European civil protection force has been increasingly suggested. Such reflection should, from now on, be welcomed, as it would be an efficient way of guaranteeing a quick and adequate response to the emergency support needs of Member States. In addition, this force is, in essence, embodying one of the Union's founding principles: solidarity. Of course, other measures must be taken. Especially because, we know, it is not enough to regret tragedies, we must avoid them. And, in the Portuguese case, this involves an effort to reorganize the forest, which will only succeed if it starts with a broad national political consensus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
