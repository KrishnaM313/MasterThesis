It was in 2013 that this Parliament positioned the European Commission's proposal on the representation of women on the board of directors to incorporate mandatory quotas for women's representation in the business spheres, so that we too in the field of economics have equal representation.  It's been five years. They have passed the presidency after presidency with a blockade on the Council, where national governments have been unable to sit at the table and understand that moving forward in a more equal Europe is also advancing in a Europe where women's representation is a reality in all areas.  And there had to be a change in the Spanish Government to also drive change in the Council and to try to ensure that there is finally an agreement in this regard.  I would like to thank Mrs Jourová for the impetus she is giving me to, from the Commission and together with the Council and Parliament, to enable us to end this parliamentary term with an equality initiative which is essential.  Because we can't resign ourselves to women's rights remaining in reverse. Because we need women to be represented on equal opportunities and that is why this Parliament has to position itself in a very clear way and ask the Romanian presidency to make one last effort, that we have the possibility, that we have the capacity, that there are governments, such as Spain, which have decided to promote this initiative, that women want to be part of decision-making and that it is essential to move forward in a more equal Europe and fairer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-01-31.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  author. – Mr President, this is a very important moment: it is time to conclude that there is no reason whatsoever not to adopt the directive of 2012 which would make it an obligation for listed companies to reach the minimum 40% share of persons of either sex among their non—executive board members. I’m very surprised that some Member States should still be referring to subsidiarity. How can they do that? We have European companies that operate not only in Europe but also beyond it, so this should definitely be an issue for European Union competence. Secondly, we know very well that diversity in all its dimensions – and gender is an important dimension of diversity – expands companies’ views and perspectives in terms of understanding what’s going on in the world and reacting to it in their business strategies. Thirdly, there’s no reason whatsoever to say that there are no competent women. That is an excuse for a male—dominated corporate culture in which women are not visible because, perhaps, they do not always share this male—dominated corporate culture and its behaviour patterns. However, it is certain that the competence of women to respond to today’s challenges is at least the same as that of men. There has been ample time for Member States to proceed, in voluntary ways, with measures for diversity and for women on company boards, but still we were in a situation where, in 2017 and 2018, women accounted only for 26.3% of board members in the largest publicly listed companies registered in the EU. There is a huge discrepancy – from 7.4% to 43% – and this discrepancy shows that we need measures at European level to advance towards harmonisation of this important aspect. I would like to thank the Spanish Government for finally taking a second look at this question. And maybe, with the Romanian Presidency of the Council, we can now finally conclude this matter and can declare, before the European elections, that the European Union is actively promoting a modern cooperate culture which includes contributions from both women and men.

I want to begin by saying that gender equality lies at the heart of the Council’s vision of social Europe. The Council’s commitment to equality between women and men has been strongly affirmed in many declarations, as well as in the legislation that we have developed over the years together with Parliament.  I would also like to recall the European pillar of social rights, which was jointly proclaimed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission in November 2017. Gender equality has pride of place in this document, and I quote ‘equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men must be ensured and fostered in all areas, including regarding participation in the labour market, terms and conditions of employment and career progression. Women and men have the right to equal pay for work of equal value’. This commitment of course echoes the EU Treaties and our existing legislation but this issue should not be left aside.  Despite the enormous progress that has been made over the past half century and more, equality in practice continues to elude us. Let me give you an example. There is still a large gender pay gap in Europe. The average gender pay gap is 16.2% according to Eurostat and women’s gross hourly pay is still lower than men’s. This of course is not equality. We will address the gender pay gap in a set of Council conclusions that we hope to see adopted at the EPSCO Council in June.  In order to deliver on the promise contained in the pillar of social rights, we need continued and determined action on the part of the Commission, the co—legislators and the Member States. Honourable Members, today you have asked us to comment more specifically on the Commission’s proposal for a directive on improving the gender balance on company boards. I regret to say that – as of course you know – there is still a blocking minority in the Council. The most recent meeting on the file took place under the Maltese Presidency in 2017, and the proposal has not been formally discussed by the Council since. As things stand right now, the file remains blocked. Nevertheless, there is broad consensus in Europe on the need to improve the gender balance on company boards. Although the Member States have different approaches the principle is not contested. In this vein, the Romanian Presidency aims to facilitate discussions at the Council level in order to explore possible ways forward.  I would also like to mention the proposal for a directive on work—life balance for parents and caretakers. Here we have better news. Indeed, I’m glad to say that negotiations between the Council and Parliament led to a provisional agreement at the sixth trilogue, which took place on 24 January. This success was made possible also by the excellent progress that was achieved under both the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies.  Facilitating work—life balance is a vital part of social and employment policies. We must do all we can to help our citizens reconcile work and private life. This is all the more important in the context of the demographic situation and labour market changes. On the one hand, we need to make sure that Europe’s highly educated, highly skilled women are able to take advantage of labour market opportunities. This makes obvious economic sense. It is also a matter of equal rights. On the other hand, European women and men should be able to have children without having to choose between being a parent and having a job. I would like to point out that, more often than not, women are the ones faced with this decision. This is only feasible if workers with families have adequate leave rights and if those rights are extended to both women and men.  Meanwhile, it is also necessary to respect the diversity of the national systems in place. In Europe, it is never the case that one size fits all – least of all in the field of employment and family policy where traditions, economic realities and social assistance vary very greatly between the Member States. We must respect the principle of subsidiarity.  These were some of the considerations we had to address in the negotiations on the work—life balance directive. It was not easy, but I am pleased that we found a solution that raised the minimum standards in Europe, yet gives the Member States the necessary flexibility. I thank Parliament for its cooperation on this file.

I am very grateful for your overwhelming support for the Commission’s proposal aiming to improve gender balance on the corporate boards of the largest EU listed companies.  I have now been Commissioner for Gender Equality for almost five years. While I am proud of our collective work, in particular about the recent finalisation of the work—life balance package, I remain concerned, as the European Institute for Gender Equality states in its largest and latest Gender Equality Index, that in some areas we are moving at a snail’s pace. When we were publishing the latest figures I didn’t hide my big disappointment about this slow development, in spite of all the efforts we are investing. The Gender Equality Index shows that gender equality in decision—making continues to have the lowest score of all domains evaluated in the index, and this despite some national legislation which have been adopted in the meantime. We are all aware of the studies, which clearly show the benefits of diversity on boards – benefits for business and for society alike, of course. The Commission remains committed to the proposed Women on Boards Directive. Despite their capabilities and educational achievements, women continue to struggle against long—held and systemic entry barriers onto corporate boards and leadership positions.  The proposed directive will enable us to decisively widen the access of talented women to decision—making positions and to accelerate economic growth. With women in power, a snowball effect will be created towards more gender equality.  I would like to recall that this is a flexible and proportionate proposal. It is a good example of subsidiarity—friendly legislation, which offers Member States considerable flexibility in how to achieve the progress. It is also legislation that is gender neutral; it deals with adjustments regarding the under—represented sex in the case of similar levels of qualification, be they men or women. It deals with an overall objective and Member States are free to keep and apply their own existing effective measures aimed at improving gender balance in corporate boards.  According to our figures the states which have the legislation make progress; those states which do not have any legislation are just stagnating.  So we see the positive impact of legislation in many examples. The Commission’s proposal enjoys wide support from the European Parliament, and I want to thank you for this support once again. It also enjoys the support of a majority of the Member States.  In my view, a general approach is within reach. I can only repeat what has been said here also, that there is an important development, which was done by the Spanish Government. I was in Spain recently and there is very strong determination among the members of the government, including the Prime Minister, to move on and to convince also the states which are still opposing this piece of legislation.  Of course, I also rely very much on the Romanian Presidency, which is very determined as well.  I am ready to engage, in the run—up to the March EPSCO Council, with the Member States to try to unblock the negotiations in the Council. The Minister also mentioned here the June Council and, well, we have to have a serious debate about how to tackle the – I would say shameful – issue of the gender pay gap, which is also still very high in Europe. So the Commission trusts the Romanian Presidency will invest substantial efforts in this important dossier and actively pursue the discussions with a view to a possible compromise solution.

Moreover, in fact, no Member State disputes the purpose of this directive, so one can ask ourselves: why is it not yet present and why in some Member States the presence of women on boards, in the highest boards of listed companies of large companies is only 7%? If the argument for subsidiarity were true and sincere, member states would put in place solutions that would eliminate this disparity. After all, no one in their right mind thinks that such a disparity as 7% – 93% or 3% – 97%, as in the case of a CEO, is due to a difference in talent or competence. It is clear that there are other mechanisms in place to respond to, and apparently, because there are no effects at Member State level, this response must come out of the European Union level. I strongly support this directive – the excellent directive by Commissioner Viviane Reding – and it is high time that it was the competences, not the other factors, that decided the appointment of people to the highest positions. I would remind you that this directive speaks of transparent recruitment rules, that vacancies for such high positions have clearly defined criteria, that we know how this process is taking place, and that this should not be done on the basis of the selection of school year calendar colleagues, but that it is transparent and clear to all procedures. Finally, I would like to add one more thing: as a representative of the EPP, I would like to emphasise that, because for women the main obstacle to being present on the labour market and in promotion is the issue of childcare, the issue of work-life balance is absolutely crucial in this matter, which does not mean that this directive is not a necessary, important additional impetus that can be fixed.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We need capable, intelligent and capable men and women at the top of companies, on supervisory boards as well as on boards. Seven years ago, the Commission put forward a proposal on this. The European Parliament has acted very quickly. We have said that we need objective selection criteria, and we also want to be practical. We look at what the individual countries are looking like: which country has already adopted appropriate legal measures here? What has perhaps been the progress made at voluntary level? In other words, we in the European Parliament have voted very practically on the need for objective criteria, which must then be implemented, and that we do not get far with voluntary action. We need binding, and we also need a sanction mechanism so that something can finally be done here.  Equality, equality – this is something that is in the DNA of the European Union. It is only through the European Union that we have made so much progress in a great many countries, country by country. In other words, it is something wonderful for businesses, for the economy, it is a wonderful thing for men too, and that is something wonderful for women. So, and what has happened now? A great many countries are hiding behind the legal basis. What does that mean? The legal basis is absolute, because only those countries that ultimately have no progress in their own countries are hiding.  I therefore call on the Romanian Presidency, whose initiative I very much welcome, to finally turn the spotlight back on the issue of bringing those Member States that are hiding behind the curtain. Which Member States are they? These are countries like Hungary. We have now looked at what progress is going to look like: there is even a step backwards in the companies. In other words, I call on the Presidency to finally put these countries before the curtain and say what they have actually done and, if necessary, to have them voted on in a Council.

When we look at the gender equality index, we see that women are indeed underrepresented on company boards, underrepresented in senior positions. And then there is reflection: why is this happening? After all, women are competent, educated, hardworking, ambitious. They are definitely neither weaker nor less talented than men. So why are there so few women in senior positions? Well, in my opinion, one of the main reasons is that women build their career paths more slowly because they want to be not only great employees, but also want to be mothers. And this time when they fall out of their working lives to fulfill their maternal dreams is one of the main reasons for building a career path more slowly. So we should think about what we should do to make sure that there are indeed more women in senior positions, but not to introduce women there artificially, not mechanically, not through directives, but to propose solutions that will allow you to combine work and family life. Indeed, we need solutions that will enable us to achieve a work-life balance. And I think that such a solution and looking for such a compromise will give definitely good results.  Eurostat reports that the wage gap in the Member States varies. There are countries where this pay gap between men and women is very significant.

Consistency, because here we are filled with talking about smart growth, of a talent-based economy, but we do our best to ensure that half of the talent available, the one we bring women, does not go where it can be most useful. To the advice. To the decision-making centers. Where, as all studies show, it is more profitable. Where it is a success, as certified by all the experiences put in place in some Member States. Dare to look at this proposal from a profitability perspective. Because they are afraid to do so from the perspective of equality, justice and equal opportunities. Vision for the future, because Europe is one of the most sensitive and active areas of the world in equality policies. Let's take advantage of this competitive advantage. While in other spaces they begin to think of some ideas that we have been groping for years, let us bet on bringing them to their last consequences. Because, as we have said, besides fair and democratic, it is profitable. All the advantage we take from others in this talent-adding operation will make us more competitive.  And finally, bravery. There are too many men thinking about masculine at the forefront of this blockade. Shake your fear. Win. Take on what you miss: to reconcile, to take care of children, to the elderly, to share the magical task of transforming a mortgage into a home, an opportunity.

We come from a fairly standing mandate on gender equality, and it would be excellent if we could reach the end of the mandate between the Commission and the Romanian Presidency with good prospects for this directive, which has been blocked since it was introduced in 2012.  Establishing 40% of women's quotas on board of directors is essential. It is essential because economic power is central to gender equality, and also because it is a model that has worked. In Norway it has worked indisputably. It hasn't solved everything, but in today's listed companies there are 40% of women.  And it is not an issue that one can hide behind subsidiarity, as many Member States do. For two reasons: first, because gender equality is an objective set out in the Treaties and economic power is a central element in advancing equality. And secondly, because the disparity in the European Union is from 7.4 in some countries with women's presence on the board of directors to 43%. The disparity is enormous, and we therefore need a legal framework at European Union level to harmonise and promote this measure. As I said, in Norway this has been a measure that is absolutely a success. That's unquestionable. He hasn't solved everything. And we must also learn. There are two central issues. First, it is one thing to establish equality on the board of directors and the other is to achieve it in executive positions. And there we have to do work too, because a measure of these does not solve the second part, on which we must also work. And secondly, what we have learned from the Norwegian experience is that there are implementation challenges, of course, and that is why in 2013 Parliament called for a very important sanctions regime for those companies that did not meet that objective, for example by excluding them from public competitions if they did not comply with the 40% set by the Directive.  It is therefore a central legislative part of advancing equality.

Internationally, the balance sheet is hardly better: of the 500 largest companies in the world, only 3% are managed by a woman as a member of the Executive Board. The fact that we still have to discuss this issue in 2019 is shameful and makes me seriously doubt our much-vaunted progress.

Quotas signal to women that we are inferior and incapable of achieving success. What about women working at lower levels of companies?

These rights, piece by piece, take away personal freedom, take away economic freedom from entrepreneurs, take away independence from states. These resolutions, which the European Parliament here creates in the thousands – usually nonsensical or unspealing – have one common denominator: it must be concluded that immigrants, homosexuals and, of course, feminist movements are better than European citizens. It must be contained, it is really some kind of disease. It is high time we left this Union, i.e. it is impossible to reform it. Here I appeal to other countries: in the footsteps of the United Kingdom, leave this Union, to the Members, to prepare it. Let us create a new union, as was the case in the dreams of the founders of this, unfortunately, present one. Let it be a union just as borderless, but one that does not interfere with families does not ridicule women raising children by saying that they are domestic chickens, as I have heard here recently. One that does not interfere with the economy. Where the European Commission is obedient officials, not all of us. Such a union needs to be re-established, there is no other way out.

Men, for example, are occupying it because they live shorter lives. How are you going to repair the losses of men, level the case in this aspect?

The European average is 23%, and in some countries, such as the Czech Republic, it is only 9%. Although women achieve the same education, even today more than half of university graduates are women, they certainly have the same ambitions, they are equally capable, so women are still absent from these crucial bodies. This is also due to the fact that women have an irreplaceable role as mothers and carers. They enter their professional careers later. No quota alone will allow women to speed up their careers. It will help women to improve their conditions to be mothers while developing their professional careers.

According to the European Institute for Gender Equality, in 2017, women accounted for only a quarter of all board members in the largest publicly listed companies registered in the EU. In fact, in 2015, there were more CEOs of Fortune 500 companies named John than there were women. Nothing wrong with John – my own name is Seán, which is the Gaelic form of John. This proposed directive is not simply about making up a gender balance on corporate boards of directors and non—executive directors; it’s about the trickle—down effect this has on the entire company and the economy. One will often find women working in the human resources or communication side of a company, while men are more often in general management as this is seen as more senior. There must be a gender—balanced model of decision making at all levels within the company concerned. If people running the company are primarily comprised of men, how can we expect the company as a whole to represent the whole spectrum of opinions and perspectives? Furthermore, inadequate recruitment practices for board members contribute to perpetually hiring those with similar profiles, i.e., we as humans tend to hire who we are familiar with, so if the board is comprised primarily of men, this leads to more men being hired. This does not make sense. According to the International Monetary Fund, women’s economic empowerment boosts productivity, and increases economic diversification and income equality.

I am also grateful for the interest of the media in this topic. Let me conclude by saying a few words. Next to the clear support which I have already expressed from the Commission side for this piece of legislation, I wanted to tell you that we are not waiting for this to be unblocked in the Council because there is still a lot of work which can be done to support higher or better diversity, and not only in in the world of business.  I would like to mention again several statistics. In our society more than 50% are women. We have 62% of university graduates who are women. So one would say that it would be normal if we had at least such an adequate position and representation of women in various spheres of life, but let’s just compare these figures. We have 22% of women on boards. We have only 6% of chief executives. Coming a little bit further, to the political sphere, we have only 20% of women in national parliaments. We have some governments in the Member States where there are only one or two women. Recently there was one government where there were no women.  Let’s come to a positive example now. I am happy to say that in the Commission we are already tackling the 40% in managerial positions, which is thanks to the continuous strong push and very smart procedure which is guaranteeing fair competition, free of any kind of bias or barriers which we see in many other places. To react to what Mr Żółtek said here – he is no longer here – believe me, from my position as a woman in the Commission, I still feel very strongly as a woman that I didn’t have to become a man to be in such a position and to contribute to the decision—making of the Commission. It’s a coincidence that Jean—Claude Juncker is here, but he said very clearly ‘at least nine women for the Commission’ and I think that all my women colleagues are doing the right job by bringing the perspective of women into decision—making. So when we compare those figures, we have to say that there is something unhealthy and abnormal in other European societies, and that’s why we are working hard to change this. As I said, we are not only waiting for the unblocking of the directive on women on boards. By the way, I would like to ask Ms Parker to read the current version of the directive because you will not find anything there which would indicate that gender itself – to be a woman only – is the qualification. We are inviting fair competition and cooperation. It’s good to pay attention to the current version, which we are promoting.  At this moment, half of the Member States already have the legislation so, if we move on with the legislation, we will help the remaining Member States. It’s true that the Member States can act themselves. They do not have to wait for the unblocking of this directive because it’s up to them to move on this. In the meantime, the Commission is not waiting. We are doing a lot of non—legislative work. We are supporting the Diversity Charter, where there are now already 10 000 institutions, including the biggest companies. I will name a few of them: Sodexo, IKEA, IBM, Siemens. These are the multinationals which are promoting the idea of diversity, which is advantageous for business in many Member States, including the states where there is no legislation. So in fact they are exporting and spreading this positive corporate culture. We are also funding a lot of projects which promote diversity. So we are doing a lot of things in the meantime. It’s something which I call Plan B – not to wait for the adoption of the legislation, but to do a lot of other things.

As I said in my opening remarks, the Council commitment to gender equality is real and unwavering. The Romanian Presidency has been organising bilateral talks with the blocking minority in order to seek a possible solution. We have also scheduled meetings at working—party level on the file, but we must not forget that the Presidency is in the hands of the Member States. Under the ordinary legislative procedure, an agreement among Member States requires a qualified majority.  In addition to the work we have undertaken in cooperation with Parliament to advance European legislation, we are also – as I mentioned – preparing a set of conclusions on the gender pay gap and policies to improve the reconciliation of work, family and private life. We hope to see these conclusions adopted at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council on 13 June.  Allow me, also, to take this opportunity to inform you that the Romanian Presidency will be hosting the High—Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming in Bucharest in February. We are also looking forward to discussing the topic of gender equality at the informal meeting of the EPSCO ministers in Bucharest in April.  Thank you very much for this opportunity to discuss these important topics here today.

I was in the northern part of Finland, where I live, last weekend, and there was minus 30° and about a metre of snow – a real winter! It’s a pleasure to be here today. The European Parliament has done excellent work in the recent very challenging circumstances. Forward-looking discussions about the European Union are essential for two reasons. In order to realise the vision of the Rome Declaration we need to discuss how we achieve sufficient unity to make decisions and implement them. Secondly, we must debate to discover each other’s priorities in relation to the EU’s action and budget. EU countries became familiar to me as an entrepreneur through sister companies around Europe. I remember, in my thirties, travelling to meet the CEO of a big French company. On the plane, I read a guidebook my wife had borrowed from the library for me. It said that you should never ask anything about family when you are in a business meeting with a Frenchman. When I arrived, there was a dinner meeting and the CEO was there with wife and daughter. The first question to me was ‘Tell me about your family.’ So I understood that we Europeans get along and we have more in common than we may think.  As long ago as the 1920s, a founder of the Finnish Centre Party, Santeri Alkio, wrote that, for the sake of peace in Europe, the continent should consider shifting its politics towards a United States of Europe. He even mentioned a common currency. He was a pioneer in many respects, including this one. Choosing international cooperation and generating peace and economic development have been guiding threads for Finland. Friends, in recent years we have been given a lesson in populism in Europe. We have seen where it leads to when the solutions for complex issues are provided by simplifying matters. In the end, nobody takes responsibility. There has been such a case in the United Kingdom and the result is there for all to see. Not only Brexit but also populism hit the EU from several fronts. Setbacks on the rule of law, freedom of the press and women’s rights are news we would not expect to hear in 21st century Europe. How can the EU promote its common values in its external policies if it can’t do so within the Union? Common values such as democracy and the rule of law have been the foundation of Europe’s freedom, security and prosperity. They should unite the Member States. It is essential to bridge Europeans’ internal divisions. At the same time, there cannot be any compromise on the rule of law. Finland warmly welcomes the Commission’s rule-of-law proposal in respect of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF). I am convinced that there is a way to establish a well-balanced mechanism to that end. Mr President, honourable Members, the cornerstone in terms of Finland’s position towards a developing EU, as well as monetary union, is to respect what has been agreed and to ensure efficient implementation. We strongly support the kind of European Union that achieves its credibility throughout concrete action. In 2015, my Government started with a situation where our public deficit was nearly 3.5% relative to GDP. We made 2% painful savings. We implemented reforms, improving public finances, including social and healthcare reform and pension reform. An internal devaluation of 4% was made for the purpose of boosting employment and growth. We agreed with the unions on a salary freeze and cuts, an extension of 24 hours in annual working time and a decrease in employees’ social security contributions, to name but a few aspects. As you might guess, this list was not very popular. However, now, after three years, the public deficit is covered, the state budget is in balance and the employment rate is the highest in 30 years. With that said, the idea of solving problems of this kind through permanent fiscal transfers is unacceptable for us. The best insurance against economic shocks is a balanced budget and a low debt ratio. Many times over these years, I have come back to a quote from Jean Claude Juncker – ‘We all know what to do, we just don’t know how to get re-elected after we have done it.’ For my part, I am testing this in practice in the upcoming elections in April. Let’s see! My point is that, despite the risk, the Member States must be capable of making decisions and implementing them. Efficient implementation is absolutely the best method of responding to current and future challenges. We need implementation of the single market and R&amp;D and innovations, implementation of the internal and external security policies, implementation of migration policies, implementation of climate policies. Better implementation is the best tool in fighting populism and in increasing citizens’ confidence in the European Union. Honourable Members, Finland holds the EU Presidency in the second half of this year, so next I will point out some areas that will be on the agenda during our Presidency. These are also topics on which the EU must be able to work more closely together and to ‘walk the talk’ efficiently. I’ll start with the MFF, which is a key implementation tool for future EU policy. In Finland’s view, the overall level of the MFF should be as close as possible to current relative share. The focus needs to be in the areas where the EU is best placed to deliver, such as migration, security, the single market, innovation, digitalisation and climate. We also see a need to reallocate funding for rural development within the budget. The common agriculture policy helps to provide affordable and safe food to our citizens. It ensures that farmers can make a reasonable living and it promotes jobs in the farming and food industry. At the same time, cohesion policy creates more balanced development between and inside the Member States. I am confident that we will be able to find a balanced compromise between traditional policy areas and new challenges. I am also confident that we can do it during the Finnish Presidency. Secondly, we need a migration policy with a comprehensive approach. To begin with, the root causes of migration must be addressed more efficiently. In addition to development cooperation and humanitarian aid, trade and investments are needed to create jobs and sustainable development. We must also work hard to develop a more effective return policy. The internal aspect of migration is in our own hands. We should manage migration increasingly throughout direct resettlements from the refugee camps. This would mean less pressure on the EU’s external borders and less smuggling. At the same time, management of our external borders should be reinforced. There is also a need to proceed with the most complicated political issues, including a mechanism on solidarity during crises. It’s crucial that we agree on this in advance, not in the middle of a crisis – as we did in 2015. Thirdly, security and defence cooperation is important and needs to be intensified. Finland has been actively calling for ambitious progress on security and defence cooperation, together too with France. Now we welcome the progress made: the creation of a European defence fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) have been steps in the right direction. Now we should take concrete action on implementation and achieving results.  The EU has also strengthened its capacity for countering hybrid threats. The European Centre for Countering Hybrid Threats, in Helsinki, contributes to the preparedness of NATO and EU countries against these threats. I want to thank the 19 participating countries, of which 16 are EU Member States, for their strong commitment. I would also welcome all the remaining Member States joining the centre. Fourth, we must improve the single market. We are the best single market in the world. Alongside innovation and trade, this is our best way to create new jobs. A lot of potential exists, especially in services and digital products. Improving the situation is entirely in our own hands. I urge you to find a common mindset in order to pass those 35 proposals which are still under negotiation.  Looking ahead, I hope that the future Commission will take a more holistic approach, within which the single market, digitalisation, industrial policy and external competitiveness are better interlinked. We should aim at forward-looking growth strategy, including, inter alia, data mobility and artificial intelligence. It’s also important to enhance competitiveness by implementing the principles of the EU social pillar. For instance, it is crucial to promote equality in working life and to enhance the education level of all citizens. Fifth, trade policy is also crucial for the EU’s competitiveness and new jobs. In respect of free trade agreements, I am pleased with the latest achievements vis-à-vis Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Mexico and Canada, and with the rapid progress in ongoing negotiations. However, it’s harmful if the big players continue to build trade walls. We must do everything we can to prevent the erection of, or tear down, such walls. This is especially the view from smaller countries, to which the damage would be fatal. We must respect and obey the common rules on trade. And lastly, the EU must take a lead on climate change action. The report by the International Panel on Climate Change again reminded us of the threat posed by climate change to life on Earth. We can’t walk away from science. Besides a threat, I see many possibilities in this global challenge. As an engineer, I tend to think in a solution-based and technology-based way. I am sure that, as the world moves towards low-carbon development, we are in the front line in developing new technologies, and ambitious climate policy will also support job creation here in Europe. We need measures on three fronts: CO2 emissions, carbon sinks and new technologies. Last week, Finland hosted a Nordic climate meeting in Helsinki. Nordic countries gave a promise to raise the level of their climate ambition by 2020. The Nordic countries want to catalyse mitigation efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Also in the round-table discussions in the Finnish Parliament, eight Finnish parties set an objective that the EU should achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. That requires tightening the emission reduction obligation for 2030 to at least 55% of the 1990 levels. The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the most cost-efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finland aims to renew the system so that the price of the emission allowances guides operators towards emission reductions more quickly and efficiently. We have proposed that new sectors, such as heating and cooling of buildings, be integrated into the ETS. Furthermore, we have accelerated the transition towards a circular economy and the bio-economy. The Bio-economy Action Plan should be implemented without delay. As a small detail, my Government decided not to give any EU Presidency gifts: instead we used the money to offset the emissions caused by air travel during the Presidency. (Applause) Second, we need to increase carbon sinks. We have four billion hectares of forest and five billion hectares of fields. It has surprised me to learn how much more agricultural fields could bind CO2 if we made some changes in farming practices. We have 100 so-called carbon farmers testing new practices in Finland. Oceans and carbonate minerals too can lock down carbon dioxide, and we also need to plant more forests. In Africa alone, two million hectares of forest are lost every year. That is equivalent to Slovenia’s total land area. As the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s report on the state of the world’s forests says, the world response to climate change must focus more on forest. One concrete step we should take in relation to the EU’s external funding is to increase global carbon sinks. Finland has proposed an EU-African forest fund. Forest investments would maximise the impact on climate and rural jobs in Africa. Third, new technology must be adapted. Even now, we have the technical capacity to capture CO2 from the air and convert it into other products. The EU needs to invest in research and development and to exploit the huge potential of science, technology and innovation in this area more effectively. We also have to think of innovative ways – new incentives and market driven methods – to ensure carbon sinks will be increased. My strong message is that we have to do more and faster. We must reduce emissions, increase carbon sinks and adapt new technologies to capture CO2 from the air or directly from the emission sources. Fellow Europeans, after the European Parliament elections, the European Council needs to agree on an ambitious and comprehensive agenda. Besides climate change, our focus should be on growth and security, while rule-of-law issues will also remain central. This is my call for a more united European Union, capable of concrete action and implementation, and of bearing responsibility. This means responsibility for ourselves, for people and their surroundings close to us, for the economy and for the planet. Let’s remember that we are all here to safeguard a better future for youth and the generations to come. For our sake and for our common future, we all need a determined, efficient and united European Union. I cannot highlight more the importance of getting things done. That is why I have underlined the word ‘implementation’ in this speech so many times. The democratic forces of Europe will win back the trust of the people by making decisions and implementing them, at home and also here in Brussels.

La Finlande est devenue membre de l'Union européenne en 1995. Le hasard a voulu que je sois devenu Premier ministre le m me jour, et depuis lors, l'Europe fonctionne parfois. J'ai toujours noté que la Finlande, d's le premier jour de son adhésion, se comportait comme un état membre fondateur, comme si elle avait toujours été l, et certains états membres fondateurs gagneraient prendre exemple sur elle et (Applaudissements) La Finlande, depuis qu'elle est membre, a toujours fait preuve d'une grande faculté d'écoute. La Finlande et ses gouvernements respectifs savent écouter, et la Finlande entend ce qu'elle écoute et traduit en politiques ce qu'elle a appris en écoutant les autres. Tel fut le cas de tous les Premiers ministres. J'ai commencé avec Paavo Lipponen, j'étais avec mon ami Jyrki, je suis avec toi maintenant, et je verrai Paavo ce soir. Aujourd'hui, j'ai une journée finlandaise. Trois Premiers ministres qui s'adressent a la Commission, c'est rare, mais c'est utile. La troisi me présidence finlandaise point l'horizon, et ce sera une présidence particuli re puisqu'elle interviendra apr s les élections européennes, avant la nomination de nouveaux présidents de la Commission et du Conseil, avant la nomination du président de la Banque centrale, et ce sera donc une période qui demandera beaucoup de doigté, lorsqu'il s'agit de présider l'Union européenne, comme la Finlande l'a fait lors de ses deux premi' When it comes to relations between Finland and the Commission, the relations couldn't be better. We are working in full confidence. That was the case when we were establishing the security and defense mechanism. That is the case when it comes to energy and climate, and this is the case when it comes to developing connectivity infrastructure in the border region of Finland.  I would, in the name of the Commission, like to make use of the Finnish Presidency in order to develop the Arctic dimension. This is an important issue because the Arctic region is warming at twice the global average rate of temperature increase. Finland is holding, for the time being, the Presidency of the Arctic Council. I was discussing with my friend Juha when I was in Finland in November the idea of calling during the Finnish Presidency a Summit of the Arctic Council because I think that we have to make sure that the Arctic region is moving to the top of the European agenda.  But the Finnish Presidency must also do a great deal. I would like – and I would like this – to make progress during the Finnish Presidency on deepening the Economic and Monetary Union, to complete the Banking Union and to put the Capital Markets Union on a definitive path. At the heart of what will happen under the Finnish Presidency, of course, is medium-term financial planning. That's a hard piece of work, that's drilling thick boards. And the Finnish Presidency can fully rely on the Commission to make the progress it needs during the Finnish Presidency to conclude at the European Council in October this year. We need to finalise this medium-term financial framework this year. Otherwise, we will lose the valuable time we need to design, develop and implement the programmes. I would also be grateful to the Finnish Presidency if, within the framework of the multiannual financial framework, but also in terms of deepening economic and monetary union, it kept on the table the Commission's proposals, which are: an instrument for strengthening structural reforms and a stabilisation instrument to make the European Economic and Monetary Union weatherproof against external shocks. The last European Council approached this issue cautiously like a hedgehog. But people are waiting for us to equip the Economic and Monetary Union in such a way that it can respond better to the next crisis than it did in the last crisis. And then I would also like to thank the Finnish Government for being one of those who have paid the greatest attention in Europe to the Jyrki investment plan and to me. So far, EUR 8 billion of investment has been implemented in Finland as a result of this plan. It would be good if everyone did so. I wish you, Juha, all the best in April, all the best for the Finnish Presidency. Keep it up!

Prime Minister, you are here at a crucial moment in time. The people have the say for the future of your country in April, and Europe in May, so it is a democratic competition in the next weeks ahead of us.  I start with this because your capital, Helsinki, is for my party, for the European People’s Party (EPP), and also for myself, a special place of democracy. We had our Congress there when I was nominated as candidate for my party and practised there what people expect from us – to have competition, to have lively discussions about the future, to present candidates, and then people can choose. People decide about the future, in which direction we should go. The principles of nationalism and European democracy will be at the centre of developments in the upcoming months.  I want to share some points you mentioned in your speech; some considerations on this. First, from the EPP point of view, I fully support what you said on financial discipline. It sounds technical, it sounds market—orientated, it sounds euro—business orientated. But it is absolutely in the interests of our children. Sustainability is the key word when we talk about financial discipline, and the EU will always have the EPP on a national level, and on a European level with us as the EPP, and Jyrki is also working on this on your side. Then it is about this sustainability, because that means future.  The second point I want to mention is an answer to your speeches about the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). There, let me be a little bit critical because you started in your paragraph on speaking about the MFF, you started with saying first of all the amount of money must be fixed. That is what we always hear from the national leaders. I think that’s the wrong question. A good question is: what are the tasks ahead of us? What is the demand we have in the European Union? Because we hear from a lot of leaders that say we should fix the money but then additionally we need a strong border control, we have to do something on cybersecurity and we have to build up more innovation in the European Union. So if this is a demand for Europe, then the Member States must also be fair with the contribution to the budget. Then we have to put the money on the table we need for giving an answer on the demands on the table. So the starting point is to speak about the demands.  The third point I want to mention in my short contribution today is about, probably the most challenging for all of us, and is what 35 000 school kids told us when there was demonstrating in the last weeks in Europe – Pope Francis is calling it the illness of the earth – and that is climate change. Thank you for your statement on this specific point. I want to only underline the approach towards the climate change challenge, some of the principles we, as the EPP, believe in. One principle is that the solution on climate change, to give an answer is not to forbid things, is not to prohibit things, is not to ban things. It’s not to say to the citizen that they cannot go any more on their holidays to Majorca because the CO2 footprint is too intense. That’s not our answer. Our answer is that in the future people will fly to Majorca in a clean airplane. Innovation is the key to give an answer on this. That is what we have to do. We cannot say to the developing countries or to the emerging economies in the world that they have to stop to grow. That they cannot develop anymore. That is not the answer. The answer is that we as Europeans can provide the developing countries with the technologies to have growth without climate impact. That is our answer. So innovation is, for us, a key principle.  The second point I want to underline in the CO2 field is that we have to do it together with the people. The people must follow the changes. In the car industry we have a lot of people who are concerned about the changes. You see the demonstrations of the Yellow Vests in France, for example. A lot of people here in this room can finance higher energy prices, but outside there are a lot of people who cannot finance higher energy prices. So we have to do the changes in a way that people accept the changes and follow our approach. We have to create winners and not losers in this regard.  Finally on CO2 and climate change: together, we are strong. We made the Paris Agreement possible. We made the steps already with the CO2 car emission reduction for example. We are ambitious. We are the owner of this fight against CO2 on a global level and we can show to our citizens that together we can achieve a lot.

I think Transparency International only this week named Finland as the third least corrupt country in the world and let us not forget last year’s World Happiness Report, according to which Finns are now the happiest people in the world. Coming from Denmark I am a little bit disappointed that you took over our place at that point. Congratulations on this impressive record. Finland clearly demonstrates that small countries can be on top of the world, not only in geographical terms. But, Prime Minister, in your speech today, besides better implementation, I missed this ambition to be a champion and driver for positive social change in Europe. Where is your ambition to make Europe the world leader in a transformation to a sustainable development model in a just way where all people are included? Where is your ambition to make the lives of Europeans better? What you presented to us today sounded a little bit more like yesterday’s neoliberal slogans that led to the deep economic and social crisis in Europe. Prime Minister, we Socialists and Democrats have an ambitious vision for Europe. We live in times when our Earth and our sources of life are under attack from climate change and pollution. You rightly mentioned that. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil our crops are grown in are the future of our children and it is our duty to protect them. But our citizens and our workers are also tired of being the only ones paying for the transformation to a more sustainable way of production. They are outraged to see multinationals polluting our planet and reaping huge benefit, but not paying their fair taxes. This must change, Prime Minister. We need to change the Stability and Growth Pact to become a true sustainability pact for Europe. Therefore we have drawn up a plan to shift towards more sustainable ways of working, producing, living which go hand in hand with social progress for the people – a just transition – with the United Nations Development Goals as our signpost. Today I call on Finland to join us in this very important battle. We Europeans need to shape globalisation our way, not fall victim to destructive forces. We must be rule—makers, not rule—takers, because we live in times with growing inequality caused by the greediness of some elites and uncontrolled globalisation. The only way to address this is by finally fixing taxation and ensuring good salaries and working conditions for all, based on the Social Pillar. I didn’t hear you mention the Social Pillar some of us fought so hard to adopt in the European Union. Prime Minister, fair taxation is the foundation for European welfare states like the Nordic ones, which we come from, and citizens’ trust in democratic government. But are you willing to join us in this battle for fair taxation? Professor Richard Murphy showed in a study last week that the tax gap in Europe is EUR 825 billion, a gigantic amount of money. Our group has been in the forefront in the fight against money laundering and tax crimes. We call for a minimum corporate effective tax in Europe to stop the race to the bottom on corporate taxation. We call for stricter criteria and a for true tax haven list, which also calls out tax havens right here in the European Union. What do the people not understand is that while we as citizens have to pay high taxes, internet giants like Google and Facebook pay less than 1% in tax on what they earn in Europe? That is not fair. We need to protect our welfare states. We need to fight, not only for free, but also for fair, competition and for fairness for European citizens who today pay the price of multinationals’ tax dodging and we can achieve that. If we achieved that, Prime Minister, your recent project in Finland, – as I understand, the privatisation of hospitals and health care – could not just had been avoided, but public health care could have been strengthened in Finland, for example. So the status quo is not an option. It’s time for radical change to shape Europe for all people and leave nobody behind. Prime Minister, we see forces that are tearing our societies apart, but we need this radical change to social democracy and to more sustainable equality. We are campaigning for that as social democrats in Europe and we hope that liberals and other progressives will also join this fight.

Our common objective in the European Union must be to increase European prosperity. That is why I would now like to raise concrete issues, particularly immigration, the security of citizens, the prevention of tax evasion and the improvement of protection for whistleblowers. Prime Minister Sipilä, in autumn 2015 you publicly offered your unabashed nine-bedroom detached house to asylum seekers. News of this also spread to arab media, which further increased the number of people coming. Many young Iraqi men have said that the Prime Minister's offer prompted them to come specifically to Finland. In addition to the invitation made by the Prime Minister, those thinking about going to Europe were able to read descriptions of free education and medical services, clean and beautiful nature and beautiful young women with \"blond hair, blue eyes and teeth like pearls\" in the newspapers, quoting al-Arabia media. The Prime Minister's heartfelt invitation as such was an attraction factor, the adverse effects of which we are now facing in the form of high costs, as well as sexual offences against women and even children. In addition, the public's sense of security has deteriorated. Prime Minister Sipilä, do you recognise that, as a result of your generous offer, many people have come to Finland who have no grounds for asylum and who should never have been allowed into our country. The problems of the countries of origin will not be solved by relocating their populations to Europe, but must be solved at source. Europe's welfare states cannot function as a social agency for the whole world. There has been a lot of talk in Finland about the state of care for the elderly. Private companies providing housing and care services for the elderly have been particularly on the agenda. One of them has saved too much in personnel costs in its money-making process, while neglecting patient safety. Many companies have also avoided taxes through interest rate arrangements and by investing most of their holdings in tax haven islands. In addition to care for the elderly, the cases remind us that we need more effective means of combating tax evasion. It is good that the grievances that have been brewing under the surface for a long time come to light. It would be important to create a culture of action in which all crimes and infractions, such as serious neglect of care for the elderly, as well as tax evasion and environmental crimes, are dared to inform the supervisory authorities as soon as they are detected. Those who report abuses should not be punished, but should be seen as defenders of the public interest. Easy-to-use and confidential channels must be created for them to make notifications. I hope that effective protection of whistleblowers will be brought into legislation quickly in all EU countries, including Finland.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 46, "date": "2019-01-31.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, well Prime Minister, as per Jean-Claude Juncker, my start as Prime Minister was also in Finland. You remember that my first Summit was in Tampere. I remember two things from Tampere in 1999: first of all, the reindeer on the menu for the Summit, and secondly that we decided there to have a common European migration and asylum policy. We are still struggling with the Member States to have one.  I am pleased that in your intervention, you started with Santeri Alkio who said – and I have a quote from him, it was Nils who helped me naturally, as he is from Finland – ‘the people’s idea of the League of Nations should be urgently taken by Europe to build a United States of Europe’. Whether it was in the 1920s or the 1930s, I don’t know. It was in the 1920s. It is a fantastic project that needs to be built, and certainly in your intervention, and I want to take three points that in my opinion are necessary for that.  First of all, on the eurozone and the governance of the eurozone. I agree with you, we don’t need a reform of the eurozone to replace the homework that Member States have to do with new instruments. They have to do their homework. That’s not at stake. What is at stake is that a single currency, at world level, needs fiscal capacity; needs, based on the official capacity, euro safe assets to be used at world level in order to have more harmonious growth inside the eurozone and an instrument against what we call ‘asymmetric shocks’. All this cannot be done through the homework of the Member States alone. There is something common that needs to be tackled. So I agree with you, but the one doesn’t contradict the other, in my opinion.  My second point is on the single market. You said ‘yes, we have the best single market in the world’. I will rectify it a little bit. We could maybe have the best single market in the world when we also have a single market in the markets of the future – digital, energy, capital. I think there is one good solution: create one regulator at European level and, automatically, we shall see the emerging single digital, energy and capital markets.  My third point is on defence. I think the biggest waste of money for the moment in the European Union is the lack and the non-existence of a real European Defence Union. We are spending half the amount of the Americans on military. We have a budget in Europe on military that is three times bigger than the Russians’ budget, but we are not capable, I think, to do our defence alone and that’s because we have 28 times duplication and that’s why I hope, also, that the European Defence Union will be one of the key priorities of the Finnish Presidency.

And while we’re speaking, there are tens of thousands of school students outside in the streets here in Brussels. They’ve also been marching in Finland. And they show us what really matters – to put people and planet before profit. We should really take them seriously. So I want to ask you today Prime Minister to commit to the future, to listen to those young people and to invest in the future when it comes to climate protection, to education and to working together as Europeans. On climate protection, the EU has a huge responsibility and every Member State has to play its role. I’m very happy that you mentioned that you are very committed to that – that you want to go ahead; that you want to have more ambitious climate targets, fantastic! And you’ve mentioned the important role of carbon sinks as well, and Finland is in the lucky position to have a very large carbon sink at hand. The beautiful Finnish forests are an important natural heritage for your country and also largely due to its forests Finland has become the welfare state that it is today. But they are also an important factor indeed in the EU climate policy. The Finnish forests capture 27 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. So it is in our common interest to preserve them, and to manage them sustainably but different from what you said – your government actually plans logging of the Finnish forests, which are not sustainable, which are absolutely excessive, and they will put the huge asset that you have in fighting the climate crisis at risk. So I hope that after your very good speech today, your government will reverse that position to save the great natural heritage that you have, but also to preserve the carbon sinks, because if we wanted to achieve a net zero carbon economy in Europe by 2050 then we need more forests and not less. And rather than telling other countries that they should grow more forests, it is important that we do something in order to keep our own forests. So I’m very happy that you’ve mentioned that you want to have more ambitious targets. We are very much on your side and I am glad to see that you’ve been doing that in the Nordic Council but I hope that you can also bring that to the EU Council, to your fellow Prime Ministers, to make sure that this goes ahead in Europe. That would be an efficient implementation. And the young people that I’ve mentioned – they are also the ones that will run our countries, societies, economies, in the Member States, in the EU, in the not too distant future and I think it is better sooner than later. And education is a big part of preparing them for the task, and Finland is famous for its education system. Everyone came to Finland to copy Finland’s famous school system. But I am sad to see that the current government has been ready to give up its position by cutting almost EUR 1 billion from educational research. But we need more investment into the future, not less. This is also something that we need to talk about, when it comes to the MFF at European level. The European Union must strengthen the social cohesion in Europe and contribute to the welfare of all its citizens and not just those who have good connections to state or businesses. So we need to invest in that. We need to invest in the future and there are so many more tasks that the European Union is given all the time and for that we need adequate resources. So we will not accept a shrinking budget and the Finnish Presidency will be key in order to ensure sufficient finances for the European Union because only then it can efficiently implement its tasks. Mr Prime Minister you also said in your speech how important common values, our rule of law and a united Europe are and you’ve mentioned the danger of populism. I very much agree with that. However, you have experience in working together with a right-wing populist party – this is news to some of your former allies – and I think you’re fully aware of the common challenges that our continent is currently facing. Nationalists and far right movements all across Europe are gaining support by spreading fear and disinformation and pro-European speeches are wonderful; we need them; they’re necessary. But it is by our actions that we truly show where our heart stands and how much our words mean. That’s where we show that we are serious, that we are committed to building that better future together. As Finland’s EU presidency takes place this summer, I hope to see that your country will then be on the progressive side leading the way forward for a united, fair and climate-friendly European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 48, "date": "2019-01-31.json", "name": "Neoklis SYLIKIOTIS", "mepid": "124689", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

How much louder do the peoples of the Union need to say that there needs to be a break with neoliberal austerity policies, a break with policies at the expense of the environment, a break with the policies of the social state? Just last week tens of thousands of students and workers took to the streets of Brussels to change the course of climate policies. In France and elsewhere, workers express their anger and indignation at the policies that make them poor. Even in Finland, which has been an example of a state of social solidarity, society is watching icy scandals resulting from privatisation and deregulation in the health sector: under-staffing on the roofs of elderly people due to privatisation, inappropriate medicines for the elderly, increasing the profit of care companies.  Two years ago from this step President Juncker was forced to admit that the European Union is losing its social character and is in danger of becoming the 'Wild West' of social dumping. But he did not admit what policies led here: policies that produce youth unemployment, poverty, regional and social inequalities, while at the same time smoothing the way for the rise of the far right, racism and xenophobia. Those who do not recognize the cause will obviously continue with the same recipes and on the same path.  Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, what Europe needs today is social justice and social solidarity. The wealth generated for social justice needs to be redistributed fairly, not for banks and multinationals. It needs another way of developing, creating permanent decent jobs and full employment rights; How can the citizens of the Union not be asked why there is EUR 38.5 billion for the new Defence Fund while nursing homes are closing in Finland?  The Union needs a bold policy to tackle climate change. Today, industry defines climate policies according to its own needs. But the peoples demand real solutions. They require political decisions that put a stop to the uncontrolled and unaclyssed action of multinational companies and binding targets to protect the environment and tackle climate change – even more ambitious targets than the Paris Agreement.  Finally, Europe needs an asylum and immigration policy based on international law, humanitarian solidarity with refugees and solidarity between Member States. There is a need to create a permanent mechanism for hosting all refugees in all Member States according to the possibilities of each. Prime Minister, in order to do this we need another Europe, the Europe for which the Left is fighting, the Europe of peace, real solidarity, social justice, the Europe of the peoples.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 49, "date": "2019-01-31.json", "name": "Rosa D'AMATO", "mepid": "124835", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear Prime Minister, the future of the European Union must move from a radical and profound process of change that the citizens of Europe are increasingly demanding. The signs are all there: establishment parties that identify with the political families of the Socialists and The People's Party lose everywhere in Europe and will also lose in the next European elections. Italy is at the head of this process of change. Citizens are fed up with austerity, corruption, injustice, privilege and waste. Thanks to the resources made available by the network, they have united and, from the bottom up, peacefully conquered the government of the country in a few years and sent home a political caste deaf to the needs of the citizens. Let me give you an example of what this change entails: in Italy, in the past, economic manoeuvres were synonymous with social butchery in the name of the stability of public accounts. Today, however, we are giving back resources and dignity to our citizens, focusing on development and employment. With the Italian manoeuvre, we are reducing debt through growth driven by investment and cuts in waste, we have taken away politicians' annuities and financed citizenship income – which Finland knows very well. The income of citizens is in fact an economic manoeuvre in its own right, aimed not at welfare but at the conversion of the labour force. Our goal is to reduce poverty, in Italy there are over 5 million poor people; to enable those outside the labour market to acquire new skills and thus create jobs. Entrepreneurs will have qualified human resources functional to their needs, they will also have recruitment relief; income will relaunch domestic consumption. We want to make Italy stronger in a United Europe of solidarity but also in the world.  Dear President, Europe must be attentive to the false prophets of change, but those who bow before lobbyists. Macron, for example, today lifts the ban on the use of glyphosate in agriculture. This was supposed to start in 2021. The citizens are not stupid, though. Macron backtracks just days before the Aachen summit with Merkel and gives a big gift to Germany's Bayer, which bought Monsanto, in 2018. It changes its mind instead of applying the precautionary principle enshrined in the European Treaties. Do we really want to relaunch Europe? So let us stop hypocrisy and change it, really! The citizens want action. Europe must be a leading player on the world stage and speak with a strong and unique voice. For example, we need a seat for the European Union on the UN Security Council. Instead, with the signing of the Treaty of Aachen, Merkel and Macron are designing their Union of the future; a superpower in which, however, the accounts are paid for by 27 and the decisions, but 2 are taken, excluding, with all the peace of the democratic treaties, 500 million European citizens from the decision-making process. I would remind you that two weaknesses do not make a force; a Europe remote-controlled by Berlin and Paris is exactly the opposite of the demands that citizens are demanding of the whole continent. Italy is the third largest economy in the eurozone, but it does not aspire to hegemonic pretensions, on the contrary it aims to be the guarantor of the chorality of decisions and pluralism. Never before has it been necessary to stress the importance of a political axis that opposes this undue centralisation of power which would make the debate within the institutions meaningless. We are opposed to this dirigisme by participating in and involving from the bottom up. Everyone must have equal dignity in Brussels. The European institutions are perceived as distant from the citizens, it is true. This democratic deficit should be answered not by perched in the building, but by giving the power of legislative initiative and greater powers of control and political direction to the only European institution directly elected by the citizens: the European Parliament, in fact. Does Europe want to change? Then abandon austerity policies that lead to cuts to education, health, pensions and rights. Instead, despite Junker's fake self-criticism of austerity, the path taken is always the same. In this regard, I appeal to all of you, ladies and gentlemen: let us block macro-economic conditionality. To impose sanctions or suspend European funds on a Member State because it does not respect the Brussels diktat is to penalise the regions and citizens even more. European funds are fundamental resources for the development of our territories and for the fight against hydrogeological failure, for example, cutting them would be striking at them. Europe can change if it is on the side of its citizens and if it gives them answers and not slaps down.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2019-01-31.json", "name": "Mario BORGHEZIO", "mepid": "21817", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, welcome to this Parliament, albeit a little deserted at the moment. The enormous sympathy which, at least in my view, the peoples of Europe have towards your people prevents me from reaching out to the fact that, cynically, it could lead an exponent, like myself, to those populist parties that you are agitating against, to say that every time you declare that you want to host – even at home and above all , which is more serious, in the country – 20-25 thousand immigrants, you bring water to our mill, because in Europe there is a growing awareness – even on the part of those who are certainly neither racist nor xenophobic – that this disorderly immigration only leads to insecurity, difficulties in integration and appalling costs.  Would it not be better to think – as someone intelligently and wisely says, even from certain summits of this Parliament – that we should instead commit ourselves to a Marshall Plan for Africa? The right recipe is not reception, it is not the attempt – very difficult, very difficult, often impossible – of integration – I think, for example, of people of religion and, above all, of Muslim culture, difficult if not impossible to integrate.  Instead, I would have liked to hear from those who represent a great people, a rich nation like Finland, their willingness to join this Marshall Plan. But the appeals made do not coincide with this Europe, which is a little distracted, a little demagogic, which does not realise the seriousness of the problem of immigration and the need and the moral and historical duty of Europe to help the peoples of Africa, not by doing as they have done in the past, by financing wars and speculation, but by means of real aid, perhaps woven through the network of small and medium-sized enterprises. , of those who know how to do business and who could solve the root of the problem of immigration.  Instead, you – excuse me for saying so – have been a little demagogic, giving the impression that you have a demagogic approach to immigration. If I were Finnish – and I would like to be a true Finn – I would advise you to change course and follow the example of those in Europe who, courageously, perhaps running the risk of being accused of xenophobia, racism, etc., choose the right path, the real path, that of our missionaries, who have gone to Africa and brought culture, education and growth. Follow the example of the Italian saint, Don Bosco, who – if he were alive today, as he did in the nineteenth century, in poor Italy – would put in his hands an instrument of work, teach them to work, not to come and peddle, to rape, to do what in their countries, perhaps, these African children never thought to do.

Many of the leaders' decisions are irreversible, creating a sense among citizens that democratic control through elections is pointless.  A typical and very recent example is the Prespa Agreement, which was even welcomed by all European leaders. The Greek people expressed their clear opposition, but the Tsipras government was indifferent to creating fait accompli. By concluding this agreement, Europe despises the will of the Greeks and appears to be hostile to Greek interests.

I will briefly answer the questions I picked up from the speeches. First of all, thank you, Jean—Claude, thank you, Jyrki, for your kind words and the same applies vice—versa. It has been pleasant to work with the Commission. It’s true that it will be a very challenging period of time when our EU Presidency starts. We are forming a new Commission, there will be Parliamentary elections and we will have our own elections before that. There will be multi-annual financial framework (MFF) negotiations, Brexit, the Economic Monetary Union (EMU), and so on. There will be big files on our table. Jean—Claude, you were also right on the Arctic questions. This is absolutely a key part, including with regard to climate change. We are ready for the Arctic Summit in a few weeks if there are circumstances available to arrange that. Jyrki Katainen’s investment fund is an excellent example of how we can create jobs and we have also used this tool in Finland. Mr Weber, congratulations on your nomination. The EPP meeting in Helsinki was very good for me, also because I met about ten colleagues at the same time in the meeting. I agree with you about the economic principles.  The MFF: I have now discussed with 17 colleagues already the situation regarding the MFF and I’m sure that we will find a compromise during our Presidency.  Climate change: I agree that we have to find a sustainable solution, including so that people can live with the solutions. I emphasise that new technology can do much more than we thought. I talked about the CO2 capture from the air. There is a small university in Lappeenranta and I saw the prototype. They captured CO2 from the air and they made other products out of that. The low price of the solar energy is a key solution for that. Think about what kind of possibilities this gives to Africa and for cooperation with African countries.  Mr Kofod, you have learned Finnish in your group. I think that you have some Finnish Members there and there is a good education basis in your group. Finland is the happiest country in the world, but I have to say, at the same time, that we are the best nation to hide it also, if you follow our domestic discussions. I also mentioned the social pillar in my speech. Our priorities are gender equality. We have been leaders in women’s rights in Finland by being the first country in the world to give full political rights to women. Tax havens: I fully agree with what you say about taxation. It should be everyone’s, all the companies, all the countries’ and all the citizens’ values and the basis for regulations that ensure that we pay taxes where the profit is made and this is absolutely the key principle for that. Ms Ruohonen-Lerner, maybe I will answer this question in Finnish. Ehkä tässäkin foorumissa on hyvä sanoa, mistä tuossa taloni luovutuksessa oli kysymys. Kyseessä oli tietämäni iso perhe, joka omassa maassaan oli joutunut vainon kohteeksi kahdesta syystä. Ensinnäkin he olivat auttaneet länsimaalaisia avustustyöntekijöitä ja toiseksi he olivat kristittyjä muslimimaassa. Näin ei pitäisi olla, että vainotuksi joutuu näistä kahdesta syystä. Tämä perhe oli hengenvaarassa joka ikinen päivä. Me emme voi kuvitellakaan, minkälaisissa olosuhteissa he olivat ennen pakoon pääsyänsä. Tämä perhe oli tulossa talooni ja en voinut kuvitellakaan, että Suomessa voisi ilmapiiri kääntyä sellaiseksi, että tuon päätöksen joutuu perumaan perheen turvallisuuden vuoksi. Poliisiviranomaiset sanoivat, että tuon perheen henki on uhattuna myös Suomessa, jos vien päätökseni loppuun. Valitettavasti he eivät tuohon päässeet, mutta he ovat onnellisesti turvassa muualla. Mr President, Guy Verhofstadt has already left – he’s so busy – so I will jump to Ms Keller’s speech on climate change. I have worked a lot on climate-change issues, including at a personal level. I have made a promise that my family will be carbon neutral at the end of next year. I have solar panels at my home, I have an electric car, I have reduced consumption and I have planted trees, so that the end result is carbon neutrality. But it’s too easy for one individual to do this, and we need common action in three forms. We have to lower emissions, and continue on that path, and we also have to increase carbon sinks. There is proof that the Finnish way, a sustainable way, of managing and using the forest is the best way to handle forest, and that also has my strong support. New technology is important too: I am eager to pursue new ways to capture CO2 directly from the air and use that as a source of other new products; and we also have to plant new trees. You mentioned that we have experience of cooperating with a populist party, and my message is that populist parties too should take responsibility as part of a government, in the same way that all of us have to carry responsibility and be answerable to the people. Mr Sylikiotis – I am not sure how to pronounce your name – the famous Finnish left-wing politician Outi Ojala said, in the Finnish Parliament, that the best friend for poor people was a balanced state budget. That is the basis for taking care of everyone, in every country, every day. And that is why, in Finland, social benefits are set at such a high level – besides which, we have equal education for all our citizens. Ms D’Amato, on the employment rate, I agree that the employment rate is the key to balancing the economy, and all your actions in support of development to that end have my support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2019-01-31.json", "name": "Danuta JAZŁOWIECKA", "mepid": "96781", "text": "   – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Prime Minister, i would like to thank you for your excellent work.

It is just that some countries know this, and other countries don’t know it yet. You spoke of a challenge, namely defence and security, and that is meaningful in view of Finland’s neutral past, but you said less about migration. I urge you to overcome the temptation of populism, and to gather up the forces necessary to unblock the Dublin Regulation, as this has been the mandate of the European Union.

My question concerns when you emphasised the implementation of decisions. I agree with you that one major shortcoming is that ambitious decisions are taken, but then the Member States do not implement them. My question is this: is it more the Member States? What can be done to do homework together? Have these decisions been adequately prepared here at the Council of the European Union meetings, even at the Prime Minister's meetings there?

We in Finland are used to this kind of questioning. Every Thursday at 4 o’clock in our Parliament is Question Hour. All ministers have to be present and we are used to this. But we give our answer right after each question. Now I have 30 questions to answer at the same time, so I will conclude with some top—lines.  First education. Education and equal education is very important for Finland. Public school is the best school for rich people and poor people. All the people in Finland, all the kids, go to the same school. We have the best teachers in the world and we have a challenge to educate about one million Finnish people during the next ten years. I think that this same challenge is in every European Union country because of artificial intelligence, because of the changes in work life. Climate change – thank you for supporting my speech and all the issues I raised with regard to climate change. Arctic issues are very important for Finland. We are especially worried about black carbon, and this is a quite concrete issue where we can negotiate also with Russia and the United States, which are not very keen to support climate change actions. We need also R&amp;B investments, that’s true in this sector. Defence cooperation – Finland has supported defence cooperation from the beginning. I really welcome the progress on that issue. There was a question about Turkey. It’s very complicated. It’s a NATO country and the rule of law developments in that country worry us a lot – the situation in Greece and Cyprus also.  As for the Romanian Presidency, I have always been sure that Romania will do an excellent job as the Presidency of the European Union, and there has been some proof of that already. Venezuela – our full support to democratic development and elections. The humanitarian situation in that country is really bad at the moment and I am sure Finland will follow everything that we decide together in the European Union.  There were some – actually quite a few – questions in Finnish. So I will conclude my answers in Finnish.  Ensinnäkin kestävä metsänhoito: Suomessa käytetään puun kasvusta 70–80 prosenttia ja Suomen metsät kasvavat koko ajan enemmän kuin käytämme puuta. Puuta käytetään koko ajan paremmin ja tehokkaammin myöskin sillä tavalla, että hiili sitoutuu pitkäksi aikaa niihin tuotteisiin, joita teemme metsistä ja puista. MFF:stä kysyttiin täällä useamman kerran. Tulevana puheenjohtajamaana olen aivan varma näiden käymieni kollegakeskusteluiden perusteella siitä, että tulemme löytämään kompromissin, missä tämä perinteinen EU-politiikka ja uudet haasteet pystytään sovittamaan yhteen. Emme ole olleet siellä kaikkein tiukimmassa prosentin liikkeessä vaan meillä on jouston varaa myöskin kotimaisessa kannassamme, ja puheenjohtajana tulemme löytämään siihen ajallaan oikean ratkaisun.  Täytäntöönpanosta puhuin paljon tuossa puheessani. Meillä Suomessa on tapana, että kun yhdessä sovitaan jotakin, varsinkin tällaisella joukolla, niin sitten me teemme osuutemme siitä yhdessä tehdystä päätöksestä välittömästi. Tästä varmasti meillä on tarpeeksi näyttöä.  So implementation is a key issue: when we have carefully prepared our decisions we then implement everything efficiently. I think this is a key message from my speech. Mr President, thank you very much. It was a pleasure to be here and it was a very interesting discussion.

Deutsche Bank posted losses between 2015 and 2017 and Commerzbank re-organized its activities through a sharp reduction in its workforce. In short, the low level of own funds of both institutions makes it possible to foresee a scenario of some reserve. This merger between these institutions will accentuate the problem of large financial institutions with systemic effect that were the basis of public intervention after the financial crisis.

This question is all the more urgent in view of the fact that some countries do not report any kind of fraud. How is that possible?

I would like to point out that this agreement in the Chamber on the need to condemn the practice of raising prices, not ensuring competitiveness, despite some internal compatibility, is very often superficial. I would also remind you that competition policy must be oriented towards ensuring a level playing field for all actors in all sectors and that this is the cornerstone of the European social market economy.

Still, I support reports welcoming the Commission efforts to ensure the effective application of competition rules across the EU, and indeed the encouraging of a structured dialogue with the Commissioner for Competition and the efforts of the Commission to maintain close cooperation with Parliament on these matters. Finally, I welcome the call for the Commission to increase support for SMEs and to protect our rights in the event of unfair commercial practices, and indeed the call on the Commission to step up efforts to promote fair competition in the global market.

Large companies gain a significant and unfair competitive advantage over small and medium-sized enterprises by avoiding and circumventing taxes. Large companies seem to be playing by their own rules when they even take advantage of illegal state aid schemes. As the report states, tax avoidance is detrimental to honest taxpayers and public finances. It also threatens good governance, macroeconomic stability and social cohesion, as well as public confidence in the institutions of the Union and the Member States. There are also regions within the EU that have been involved in creating low-tax tax systems that distort competition for multinationals and rich individuals.

Of course, the market that is open, where there are both market forces and the protection of consumer interests, where we want to avoid unfair competition.  So all of this, I think, affects the report very well, but moreover – and this is very important to me – it expresses the idea that markets must be environmentally friendly.
