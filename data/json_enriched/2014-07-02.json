Some of you have been here for a long time; many are new to this Chamber; others are returning after a period away – congratulations to you all. Together you reflect the changed experiences of the people of Europe who voted for you. Even compared to 2009, you all carry with you new expectations and new viewpoints on their behalf.  Let me also of course congratulate President Martin Schulz on his unique re-election, and I am looking forward to continuing our close cooperation. Indeed, we live at a time where many things can no longer be taken for granted. Politics and prosperity at national and European level as we knew them, jobs, borders, geopolitical stability and the European idea: all have come under pressure.  Our countries are leaving the worst economic period in a generation or more – a period for our Union in which solidarity and responsibility have been put to the test like never before and in which, for the first time, we have experienced the true extent of our interdependence as European nations. The euro – and with it the Union – has been saved from the existential threats of the financial crisis, and as President of the European Council, I am grateful for the constructive work of your predecessors in legislating for a more solid monetary union. The recovery is now slowly – but solidly – under way, and growth is returning to all our countries. But as Europe re-emerges, there are many challenges to be met. A thirst for hope, for tangible results – that was clear, again, in the results of this European election. Working for the recovery is our biggest task – restoring confidence and preparing our Union for the future. And it is with this goal in mind that, last week, the European Council set out the Union’s priorities for the years ahead. It was an extraordinary meeting in many respects, not least because leaders met on Thursday in Ypres, at my invitation, to commemorate the outbreak of the First World War beneath the Menin Gate. It was not a ceremony about the end of the war, but about how it could start, about the mindless march to the abyss, the sleepwalking, and the millions killed on all sides. Four generations have passed, but the memories remain untouched of where we, as Europeans, come from, of what we have overcome, what we must build, and what we must prevent. This awareness remained very much with the Presidents and Prime Ministers in Ypres, on Thursday. In giving the Union a direction for the years ahead, my intention was not for the European Council to meddle in the day-to-day legislative work, but to play its role under the Treaties, namely, and I am quoting now, to ‘provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and define its general political directions and priorities’.  We agreed unanimously on a programme of priorities for the next five years to guide the action and planning of the EU institutions over that period. It is important that all institutions organise their work accordingly, and also that national parliaments are kept closely involved. To this end, the European Council will hold a debate on 16 July in the evening on this programme with Jean-Claude Juncker, whom the European Council – after a formal vote – is proposing to this Parliament as next Commission President. The priorities we have set out are fivefold.  First: stronger economies with more jobs; making the most of the single market; reinforcing the Economic and Monetary Union; promoting entrepreneurship, job creation and investment; and reinforcing our global attractiveness as a trading partner. This will be vital work. This means prioritising key goals, like the digital single market, strengthened economic coordination, smart regulation, and concluding the TTIP negotiations by 2015. It also means finding the right balance between fiscal discipline and the need to support growth – something which the inbuilt flexibility of our Stability and Growth Pact rules allows.  All of these were key points during our discussions last week, not least as part of the European Semester; and leaders also stressed the importance of addressing overdue investment needs – in transport, telecoms, energy, innovation, education – by mobilising means and fostering a positive environment for long-term investments. Second priority: societies that are able to empower and protect all citizens. People expect Europe to defend their interests and keep threats at bay, but also to respect their identities and sense of belonging. Besides being a ‘great opener of opportunities’, the Union must also be seen as a source of protection. In short, it must be stronger outside and more caring inside. This is why the focus must be on fairness and life chances for all, on unlocking skills and talents, on safeguarding freedoms, and on tackling abuses and fraud, which not only affect societies but undermine trust. Third priority: a secure energy and climate future. This is one of the Union’s major projects for the immediate future. We want to build an Energy Union to guarantee access to affordable, secure and green energy. The current context shows clearly the importance of reducing our energy dependency on, notably, Russian gas. Energy will be a major topic of our October European Council, when leaders are expected to decide the Union’s 2030 climate and energy framework. Last week, we took stock of progress, and I am confident that we will achieve a good result in four months’ time, in line with the Union’s ambitious agreed targets for 2050. Fourth priority: a trusted area of fundamental freedoms. In this field also, cross-border issues call for cross-border solutions – whether on organised crime, justice matters, or migration flows. European citizens increasingly work, study, do business, get married or divorce across countries. The Union must do its best to accommodate these changes – above all, it must consolidate the decisions and work currently in progress. This message was also at the heart of our review last Friday of the strategic guidelines in the field of Freedom, Justice and Security, as required by the Treaty. On migration more specifically, it is important that our countries keep attracting talent and skills through legal migration, whilst dealing more robustly with irregular migration, notably through better cooperation with third countries.  Fifth and final priority: effective joint action in the world. Maximising our global clout, engaging our global strategic partners, especially our transatlantic partners, and developing security and defence cooperation – these are all issues on which we, as a Union, must keep working these coming years. But the most pressing priority will remain being a strong partner in our neighbourhood.  To our East, Friday’s historic signing of Association Agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine has opened up an ambitious path of cooperation. On Friday, after speaking with President Poroshenko, the European Council laid out a set of urgent and concrete steps on which our next decisions would depend. The Council will assess the situation and, should it be required, adopt the necessary decisions. The European Council leaders are committed to reconvening at any time for further significant restrictive measures.  The years ahead are going to be essential for our Union – a time of consolidation, perseverance, a time of change. Let me conclude, therefore, by wishing you well. May these be good years for our Union too.

We all know about your very strong and sincere commitment to the European Union, and I would like to underline the excellent institutional, political and personal cooperation that we have had over the last two-and-a-half years. I wish you well.  I believe more than ever that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council must do everything in their capacity to work together to deliver concrete results for our European citizens. I would also like to congratulate you all – each and every one of you – on your election to this Parliament. I wish you success for this legislature. I believe that it is very important that, alongside our national parliaments, which have strong legitimacy and great experience of presenting our democratic states, we continue to build our European democracy. To believe that it is possible in the 21st century to progress in the European path without democracy is a fundamental mistake. This is the house of European democracy; fundamental to the democratic nature of the European Union; a unique institution, directly elected from across an entire continent. You are members of an institution that illustrates perfectly the very special nature of the European Union as a community of values for peace, democracy, tolerance, freedom, justice, the rule of law, and solidarity.  As we have seen over the past mandate, with your election comes a responsibility to listen, to cooperate and ultimately to take the necessary decisions for the benefit of the citizens of our continent. Representing citizens from 28 different Member States, with 24 official languages, coming from 186 national parties reunited in seven European groups; a mix of nearly 50 % new Members and 50 % returning Members; with 65 years separating the oldest and youngest member of this House, and with more women than ever as part of the Parliament, I believe you are in a great position to give concrete expression to what Europe is – a Europe united in diversity.  I want to underline what President van Rompuy just said about the special character of last week’s European Council and to thank him for his initiative to start this European Council in Ypres. When I was standing at the ceremony in Ypres, I could not resist thinking that, whereas one hundred years ago young soldiers from our countries and many other countries all over the World were killing each other in the Flemish fields, this week leaders – North, South, East and West – were discussing our collective future together.   The ceremony, very moving and very well organised, was a potent reminder of why the EU was created and why peace on our continent is our first and greatest common achievement. Regrettably, peace is not the case in all parts of the world, and also it is not happening in all parts of Europe. Peace cannot be taken for granted.  This brings me to the issue of Ukraine. At the European Council, President Poroshenko shared with us an assessment of the situation in Ukraine.  We praised his determination and commitment to de-escalating the crisis with his 15-point peace plan. But this ambition must be shared by all sides. That was the reason why, in the European Council, we welcomed the positive first step made by Russia in repealing the law on the use of force in Ukraine.  We have said that this commitment should be backed up with action: action that will stop arms and more fighters from moving into the region, action to withdraw troops from the border and return the three checkpoints to the Ukrainian authorities, and action that ceases all separatist activity.  In the meantime, President Poroshenko has terminated the unilateral ceasefire. We, of course, have some understanding for his decision, given the special circumstances in Ukraine, and the right of the legitimate authorities of that country to defend the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. That said, we continue to call for a permanent halt to any violence on all sides. For this, we expect Russia to fully exercise its influence on the separatists in order that they lay down their weapons.  We have discussed not only the political and security situation, but also our economic and political support for Ukraine.   That is why we are going to host next week in Brussels, on 8 July, a high-level meeting to coordinate international assistance to the country. I am happy that we can now build on the consensus that was achieved in the G7 meeting hosted by the European Union in Brussels, where it was clearly decided to go with this double-track approach: on one side, to show Russia that this behaviour is not acceptable and that we are ready to take, if necessary, additional measures; and on the other side, to show our determination to do everything that is in our capacity to support an independent, sovereign and hopefully democratic and prosperous Ukraine. So far we have disbursed EUR 750 million towards Ukraine. Last week, we also completed the Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with Ukraine, and signed similar agreements with Georgia and the Republic of Moldova.  Quite significantly, President Poroshenko said at that signing ceremony that he was signing the agreement for Ukraine with the same pen that was used for the Vilnius Summit on the Eastern Partnership. That was a way of showing that history cannot be stopped. The Ukrainian people have the right to decide with whom they want to be in the future.  These were historic agreements – the most ambitious negotiated so far by the European Union – offering a long-term political and economic commitment to our eastern neighbours. It is also recognition of the significant progress these countries have made since they became independent sovereign states over twenty years ago; recognition that they want to share the same vision for a prosperous, democratic model, and that they want to live by the European spirit and values, namely the sacred principle of freedom. They are an integral part of the Eastern Partnership, which we launched five years ago. The usual critics – the prophets of doom – have questioned our determination, but now they have seen that the determination of our partner countries is indeed there. After the Vilnius Summit last year, our resolve, and our partners’ resolve, is to move closer together in terms of our joint agenda on prosperity, peace and shared values.  During my recent visits to Georgia and Moldova, I underlined to our partners our commitment to this shared vision. But the task ahead is substantial. The success of the agreement first of all relies on our partners’ willingness to carry out the reforms that they need to fight corruption and to establish a true rule of law; reforms that need to be endorsed not just by the governments, but also by the parliaments, civil society, the media, and the social partners in those countries. I believe that these agreements represent the beginning of a new journey on which the European Union and these partner countries are embarking together.   Our relationship to Ukraine and the Eastern Partnership in general also underlines the importance of energy policy. I believe it is now time for all the governments of Europe to agree on what we have been proposing for some years, to have a truly European energy policy.  If not now, when? In this field, the European Council has endorsed the Commission's proposal for an ambitious Energy Security Strategy and has asked for more work to be done on both energy security and the climate agenda ahead of the October European Council. Because both issues are the two sides of the same coin. We have to address energy concerns and the climate agenda. They need to be agreed together, because it will not be possible to have a sustainable economy, with more jobs, if we have an unsustainable environment, if we  remain vulnerable to external shocks, like the current crisis in Ukraine, and suffer from energy insecurity.  With our energy dependence estimated to increase to 27% by 2030 – importing 53% of the energy we consume – the solution is to create a low-carbon, competitive and energy-secure economy; one that moves away from our dependence on imports of crude oil and natural gas to one that diversifies our energy supply, both geographically and to include renewables; one that improves the efficiency of our energy consumption; and one that improves our energy infrastructure, our interconnectivity, and establishes a genuine energy single market by the end of the year.   Our international partners are doing this. So must we. That is why the European Council has welcomed the review of our Energy Efficiency Directive on which the Commission will make further proposals in this month of July. It is good that the European Council has reaffirmed its desire to see ambitious European leadership, with our agreed 2030 climate targets, at the September UN Summit, with a view to next year’s Paris international conference.  Leaders of national governments nominated Jean-Claude Juncker as President-designate of the Commission. I have congratulated Jean-Claude in a personal capacity and on behalf of the entire Commission. We have been working together in different capacities at a national and European level for around 25 years. His European credentials and experience, his commitment to our Union and its values are beyond doubt.  As the nomination process moves into its final stage, the European Commission and I are committed to ensuring the best possible transition to the new College, so that the European Commission can, together with the European Parliament, continue to deliver a European Union that is united, open and stronger.   The European Council last week also agreed conclusions of the European Semester, showing that we have more enforced economic governance and co-operation at an EU level; and I would like to refer here to the REFIT programme for better commitments to better regulation as well as the programme on freedom, security and justice. Since I will have the pleasure to speak with you twice more today for the results of the Hellenic Presidency and for the next Italian Presidency, I will not now go into detail on those priorities.   It was important that the European Council took the time to set out its own strategic priorities for the coming years.  I very much welcomed this step both on the substance, but also on the process. It allowed the European Council to focus on where the European Union adds real value and to work on the priorities in the coming years. I am happy to see that it is now well accepted, the idea that I have been expressing to this Parliament, that the European Union needs to be big on big things but smaller on smaller things. The European Council priorities also demonstrate an evolutionary process. They are clearly based on important work and results achieved during the past mandate. In the past mandate we were able together to avoid an existential crisis to the European Union. When many people were predicting the end of the euro, even the disintegration of the European Union, it was possible, in very difficult circumstances, to avoid that. I believe now we have a basis to go forward during this legislature to make Europe strong, namely to focus with more attention on growth and jobs.  Last but not least, the priorities show the respect for the division of labour as laid down in the Treaties, with the European Council setting a strategic agenda, with the European Commission assuming its right of initiative, and of course, with Parliament having the basic democratic responsibility, preserving the possibility to reach an inter-institutional agreement on our planning and programming for the next mandate. The European Union is working hard to learn the lessons of the economic crisis, as shown by the European Council’s strong support for the country-specific recommendations and the European Semester process, our collective exercise of partnership in economic governance. We are also, as a Union, playing a crucial role in the Ukraine crisis. We are leading globally the debate on climate and energy and we are developing our vision for freedom, security and justice.  All of this together shows that we are in touch with citizens’ concerns, that we need to implement with ever more determination what we have set out to achieve these last few years. In the past five years there was no lack of decision. Sometimes there was lack of implementation. That is why I believe that, together, we should do everything that is in our capacity to make our European Union more united, open and stronger.

Since this is my first speech in my new role as group chairman, allow me first of all to give a general address and also the question of how the Members who have been re-elected and elected feel now that we are meeting in the European Parliament for the first few days. On such days, when we have the new electoral mandate in the background, I feel it is an honour to be able to sit here, and I naturally also feel the obligation to the citizens who elected my party, who elected the various parties, to now assume the responsibility here and to shape European politics. This should lead to an atmosphere of reliability, commitment, responsibility and also mutual respect in our house. That would at least be my wish and also the wish of my group. I would also like to remind you that the fact that we are coming together here – we should be aware of this – is not so self-evident to God. My grandfather's generation was the generation that still had to wage war on this continent, my father's generation was the generation in which at least to a large extent peace prevailed in Europe, but half of Europe had to live in freedom behind the Iron Curtain. And, at the age of 41, I belong to a generation that, for the first time, can work in a Europe in which we can live together in peace and freedom. That is why we should never forget that it is not a matter of course to sit here together. (Applause) I would like to say one more sentence on the outcome of the election. We had a stable turnout, we had a clearly pro-European, strong, democratic result in the European elections. The march of the right-wing radicals has stopped; they are not even in a position to form their own group. By the way, 25 May also means that Ukraine voted pro-European. I would say that the voters of Europe voted for Europe and voted for coexistence in Europe. That should be our job! (Applause) I would like to thank Herman Van Rompuy for nominating Jean-Claude Juncker in the Council. The proposal that the EPP presented to voters during the election campaign has been nominated. A heartfelt thank you for that. I refuse to talk about an interinstitutional struggle. I have respect for all the institutions at European level. But it is clear that the power of an idea has prevailed, namely the idea that before voting, before election campaigns, you present both content to people and the staff with whom you want to implement that content afterwards. The power of this idea has prevailed. And if there is talk of more democracy in all areas of Europe in Europe, ladies and gentlemen, then the logical next step is that if democracy is called for, then the decisions that are important for the future must be taken in a parliament. That is the logical link between democracy and Parliament. (Applause) Last but not least, I would like to take a look at the tasks that are to come. The European Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, has described a wonderful, good presentation for the next few years. For us in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this will be the framework on which we are now tackling the content. Growth is important to us, respect for the national level is important to us, it is important to us that we have learned the lessons of the crisis, implement banking regulation and end debt-making in Europe. And it is important to us that we develop stability with our neighbours, especially in eastern Europe. The principle that we need to tackle the future is to raise awareness and promote to the citizens of Europe that we must be open to reform. Reforms, changes are the key to the future. If Europe is prepared to leave, if Europe is ready to change in the world's current context, then Europe will have a wonderful future!

I hope to have a positive, loyal and fruitful relationship with all of you. I would like to renew our sincere and warm wishes to President Schulz. With President Schulz, we will work hand in hand to promote and fortify the European project, to increase the confidence and participation of citizens, and to strengthen the role and prestige of this institution. The most significant, I would say historic, fact of this European Council, Mr van Rompuy, was the decision to propose Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the Commission. This result is first and foremost a victory for democracy, the result of a battle by the European Parliament. In this regard, I would like to stress with pride the crucial role played by the Socialists and Democrats, a role that has given impetus to this process. However, we give credit to the Council for overcoming the understandable difficulties involved in every step forward in the democratic process; We acknowledge that we have not succumbed to the temptation of ebb and flow which would have prevented Europe from achieving this historic result today. Mr President, this is only the kick-off of the game. The game is all to be played and can reserve surprises. It is now up to Juncker to convince us with his proposals, his programme and the talent of his team that he will choose to implement this programme. The Council's recognition of the need to make the Stability and Growth Pact more flexible is a breath of oxygen that should have come sooner. We are now calling for all the possibilities offered by this flexibility to be clearly declined and used to the full. My group will not sign blank cheques. We are asking for concrete answers on concrete proposals, we are calling for decisive action, which will allow a revival of employment, a plan for growth, public and private investment directed towards major infrastructure and energy networks. I am also thinking of Project Bonds, better use of the European budget and increased funding. We call for actions that safeguard and improve the quality of life of our citizens, a strengthening of solidarity measures to reverse the alarming growth of poverty and social inequalities. I am thinking of minimum wages guaranteed at European level, I am thinking of equal treatment for cross-border workers. We call for the Opening up of the Council on strengthening the legal channels of entry for migrants to take concrete form. We call for solidarity between the Member States to become the basis of a new immigration and asylum policy, in which there is a fair distribution of responsibilities. We call for asylum to be guaranteed, safely, to those who are entitled to asylum, using all available instruments, including the examination of third-country applications or the use of humanitarian visas. The European Union must rise to this challenge and return to thinking of the Mediterranean, this great sea that is often bloody, but which is our common European border, a place for intensive cooperation in support of democracy, fundamental rights, security, sustainable human mobility and economic and social development.  Last but not least, the agreement with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, which represents a crucial step forward. Our commitment to building and ensuring peace and lasting stability in the area requires us to look strategically at our Eastern Partnership programme and our relations with Russia. It is in this direction that we must walk. We Socialists and Democrats will certainly play our part. Best wishes to all of you.

In your speech, as conveyed by the interpreter, you described the nomination of Mr Juncker as a victory for democracy.

(Applause and gradually some laughter) They take a bit of time to warm up. Much has been said about the winners and losers in the recent European elections. Let me ask you to consider the real loser: the status quo. For a growing number of people believe that Europe cannot go on as it is. Europe has to change, and that change has to start now. They do not believe that the choice is between more Europe or no Europe: they want a better Europe, a Europe that allows our nation states to cooperate freely and not a one-size-fits-all European super-state; a Europe which embraces the future, not one that lives in the past; a Europe to meet the challenges of the 2050s, not the problems of the 1950s. And in the ECR we aspire to give these people a voice. So as the leader of this new, exciting, growing force, I want the ECR to become an exciting hub for new ideas for reform: ideas that make the EU fit for the challenges of the future in an interconnected global economy. But so far this week we have seen too much of the politics of the past – the type of politics that voters rejected in May. That is why, to all those new and re-elected MEPs across the House, I make this plea: let us turn our backs on the parliament of the backroom deal and the division of spoils. Let us reject a parliament of self-interest and personal ambition. Let us leave behind a parliament of intolerance towards minority views that challenge the conventional wisdom. Instead, let us build a parliament based on tolerance and respect. Let us build a parliament of passionate debates and stimulating ideas, and let us build a parliament that seeks fresh approaches and new solutions. Let me give you all this pledge. Our group will work together and form coalitions with others based on ideas for reform, and we take the nomination of Mr Juncker in the same spirit. Our concerns about the process are well known. They need not be repeated again today, because we are a group that wants to look forward, not back. But if this Parliament elects Mr Juncker, then we will work with him, and we will work with the Commission if he pursues a forward-looking agenda of reform; if he pursues a forward-looking agenda of decentralisation; and if he pursues a forward-looking agenda to face the challenges of the 2050s and not to look back to the ideas of the 1950s. Mr Van Rompuy, we welcome the fact that the Summit communiqué set out a number of priorities for the future. We welcome the reference to different paths of integration, recognising the diversities of our interests and our traditions in our different Member States, a flexible Europe of nation states cooperating where there is mutual interest and public support rather than that old dream of a one-size-fits-all European super-state. Let us turn those ideas from the European Council statement – of exploiting the single market, of creating a climate of entrepreneurship, of opening trade, of enhancing energy security and efficiency, of supporting our neighbourhood and of cutting bureaucracy – let us turn those ideas into the building blocks for reform. If you want to deliver real change in the EU, we look forward to cooperating with you. If you want to defend the status quo, we will urge you to embrace change. If you want to look back to the past, we will confront you with the challenges of the future. And that is the real division in this Parliament today: between those who want to prepare the European Union for the 2050s and those who cling to the ideas of the 1950s. The ECR is a new force with a modern agenda: to give Europe a fresh start. That is our belief and our mission. We will work with all of you who want to succeed, by embracing the challenges of the 21st century together.

You will see we are a funny club. There are the most sympathetic people – Mr De Backer, of course, and Ms Zimmer. The most outspoken one, naturally, is Mr Farage. And, as you will see, I am the most disciplined one in the House. (Laughter) Let us be honest about it, the most important outcome of this European Council was one thing: the nomination of Jean-Claude Juncker as candidate-President of the European Commission. I do not understand all the criticism that has been addressed to Mr Pittella, to the effect that the process is not democratic. The procedure is exactly the same as that for David Cameron’s nomination in the British Parliament. So I don’t see any problem. I recognise the British democracy as a real democracy, and it is time, too, to recognise that this Parliament is the real European-level democracy of the European continent. (Applause) So far from criticising it, I think it is a big victory for the European Parliament – and more so, in fact, for European democracy and Europe’s citizens – that Mr Juncker has been proposed. We are now, in my opinion, entering what I see as the second phase of the process, because it is up to Mr Juncker now, in the same way that it works in the British Parliament and British democracy, to assemble a majority around him: to create a coalition. In my opinion, it has to be a broad coalition, a stable coalition, a pro-European coalition, creating a majority of people and groups who want to negotiate a programme and to have a new strategy for change for this European Union. When I talk about change, I am talking about real change – not what Mr Kamall is calling for. He used the word ‘change’ at least 10 times, but what he calls change I call blocking progress. It involves leaving the euro, breaking up Schengen, stalling labour mobility and abandoning all European common policies – so less integration and less Europe, and that is not change, that is regression. (Applause) What does the word ‘conservative’ mean?  [Interjection from the floor] ‘Nothing’? Well, yes, that is a good explanation, but if it means anything it means the status quo. Conservative equals status quo, and that is what we do not want in the European Union today.  This part-session and the next one will be two very important weeks. We have to decide on a new leader for the Commission and we also have to take a new step forward in our relationship with the Commission. Let us be honest, we have to replace Mr Barroso with a new President of the Commission, one who does not simply walk into this House, deliver a speech, without always listening to us, and then walk out and implement the wishes of the Council. That is what has mainly been happening over the past few years, and we have to change that. It is possible to do so because this new President of the Commission – and here lies the key change –will be backed by a coalition and will be accountable. For us it will be very important that the key priorities are in place. There has to be a new plan Delors. Austerity plus growth is necessary inside the Union. There should be a new approach on migration, on civil liberties, on LGBT rights and on privacy regulation and, most of all, we need a Commission that really uses its right of initiative every time we as Parliament ask it to do so.

My group has grown. I am proud of it because we have also broadened. In other words, we also have party movements in our group that, beyond our political spectrum to date, are able to absorb the voices of people who have so far fallen under the table in the Political Establishment of the European Union. This is an added value of democracy if we succeed in bringing the voices of those who have suffered the most from the crisis and are suffering the most into Parliament. Dear institutions, the Council and the Commission, you and we have a duty to pursue a different policy here at long last. We have heard in recent days that the summit was above all a confrontation with the UK's ideas about how to proceed in the future, when the staff of Juncker was not supported by the United Kingdom. I did not feel this great difference with British policy in the Council. I rather had the impression that Thatcher's slogan \"There is no alternative\" – TINA policy – is simply being continued. This is the basis for what the Council has done in recent years and which it obviously intends to continue after the European elections. Where are the considerations, the conclusions on how to deal with the election result, with the statement of millions of voters who say: 'We do not want an EU of liberalising rights, privatisation, the drastic policy of cuts which, above all, threaten the livelihoods and livelihoods of millions of people. We want answers!\"? We want concrete answers to combat youth unemployment. We want answers on how to change the EU's free trade agreements. We have not heard anything about it. All we have heard is that, in the end, the decision on the European Semester will further increase the pressure on the Member States. I would like to make it clear that we want answers. And in every sitting – and I promise you this now – we will draw attention to this with every speech by one of our Members and put our finger on it.

These are changes that reach citizens who understand them, and not always just speeches about changes that we consider necessary here and which, in the end, cannot be achieved to the extent that we tried to do in the last parliamentary term, but which we always did not manage. As is so often the case, I have observed this last summit. And I thought it was a good decision to go to Ypern. Of course, as a German European and a German MEP, I thought it was good to go to Ypern. Symbols count in politics. Especially when you have heard over and over again during an election campaign that the past no longer matters at all, it is good to work with such symbols as well. It is regrettable, however, that when such a strong symbol is set, a summit will come together in Brussels at the end, which will not make a good decision at all, especially in the debate on the breach of the peace order in Europe. I think that we need to think very carefully about what happened in Brussels and what did not happen there. We have seen a meeting of Heads of State or Government. A few days earlier, a new contract with Gazprom had been signed in Austria. A few days after the Brussels Summit, 400 Russian marines arrived in France to be trained. This inconsistency of the European Union in the dispute over Ukraine and Russia could really end tragically. The European Union must at last show great self-respect for its own positions, so that the signature of the association agreements does not cause us great difficulties. Indeed, I really believe that we are in a situation where it is becoming increasingly advantageous for Russia to destabilise what we want to change for the better in the east of the European Union – and I have known for a long time that it is much more difficult and much more expensive to stabilise a country than to destabilise it. If the European Union is not really prepared now to underpin diplomacy with consistent economic sanctions, then I am very concerned about the further development in the east of our continent. I was frankly dismayed that President-in-Office van Rompuy only mentioned the decision for Mr Juncker in a meagre sentence. I am not with those who believe that with this new axis Martin Schulz/Jean-Claude Juncker – as Martin Schulz likes to say – everything in Europe will be able to change. However, I believe that it is important that these personnel decisions make European policy more recognisable to citizens, and that there could be a different obligation if they take seriously what they have advocated during the election campaign. It will be our role to keep pushing for it. The decisions that are to be taken have all been stripped of at this summit in Brussels. Copy and paste has now also become a tried and tested method for the speechwriters of Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy. The Energy Union is a project that has not yet been advanced, which has been wrongly blocked and watered down in many areas, in particular by Energy Commissioner Oettinger. It could be the European Union's project for the future! It could be the European Union's innovation project, where we are refocusing and saying goodbye to the old! But I can see that the men of the old are being pushed forward again. What I really regret is that not only has Martin Schulz become President of Parliament – I think that is actually promising, because he is doing this for the second time – but that the decision for Martin Schulz was also a decision to continue the work of Günther Oettinger. He did not make a living for this European Union project for the future, but he actually consumed all the innovative spirit that his predecessor, Mr Piebalgs, had.

Not, of course, that it happened only there: right across Europe, on the left, the centre and the right, there are now more Eurosceptics in this Parliament than have ever been seen before. So imagine my surprise, on 27 May – heading to the Conference of Presidents’ meeting in Brussels, where all the European leaders were sat in a room and I was not sure whether they would be nice or nasty to me, and whether they would accept that something fundamental had changed – when I found that, no, it was business as usual. Coming from the UK, we did not even realise that these elections were seen to be significant as far as the next Commission President was concerned. The Tories did not have a horse in the race; the British Labour Party disowned Martin Schulz; and, as for the Liberal Democrats – who, I am pleased to say, have collapsed to one Member – had you put old Verhofstadt on British television they would have lost the lot! So we were pretty unaware of what was going on. A victory for democracy? I am not sure. Who is the loser? Martin Schulz. He has become the President again of the European Parliament. It all looks like a bit of a stitch-up to me.  Dave obviously misunderstood the mood.

You would have thought it was time to apply the principle ‘When in a hole, stop digging’ – but no, Dave kept on digging away, and I must say as the final vote approached it began to feel a bit like the Eurovision song contest where it does not really matter how good the British entry is: such is the dislike of our country around much of Europe that we are always going to lose.  I wonder what the prospects are now for renegotiation. Well, Mr Juncker has had a rough ride in the British press: we are told that he drinks cognac for breakfast (that is not in the UKIP manifesto, I promise you); we are told he is ‘Juncker the drunkard’; we are told he is a smoker. My God, isn’t that awful! Some have even said that he drinks endless cups of black coffee, which is why he looks so old. I cannot see him being in any mood to concede. To come back to Ms Merkel: she was quite clear, after the summit when Cameron challenged the principle of ever-closer union, and she very gracefully said that we are all allowed to move at different speeds towards ever-closer union, but we must continue in the same direction. We have a referendum coming up at some point in the not-too-distant future in Britain. There is one thing that would convince the British voters to vote to remain part of a European Union and that is a fundamental Treaty change that says we no longer have to accept untrammelled access for countless millions of people from across the whole of Europe. We need, and the British people – 80% of them – demand that we should get back control of our borders so that we can choose who comes to Britain. (Applause) Having lost 26:2 in the last vote in the Council of Ministers, we are going to need to succeed with this. To end total free movement we are going to need the support of the European Parliament. Are you going to help Britain to end the free movement of peoples? I do not think so. Are we going to win 28-nil in the Council of Ministers? I do not think so. It is not going to happen. We are whistling in the wind and we are closer now to exit than ever. As for the rest of the EU, I suspect the next five years will bring endless misery for the southern Mediterranean eurozone countries. That is perhaps reflected in the number of Italians we now have in our Group. And what have we seen in the last 48 hours? We have seen naked militarism, with the EU flag being virtually goose-stepped around the yard, we have heard the European anthem and, actually, I can tell you that we, the Eurosceptics, are now the progressives. The two gentlemen we have just heard had nothing to say today. It was the usual dirge-like, dull looking-back to a model invented 50 years ago. We are the ones who want democracy, we are the ones who want nation states, we are the ones who want a global future for our countries, and do not want to be trapped inside this museum.

The European Council of 26 and 27 June 2014 adopted decisions that undoubtedly have a major impact on the further development of the European Union and on the standard of living of its population, which means that these decisions will affect the future lives of us and the citizens of all the Member States of the European Union. I would like to highlight two issues that are important for all the countries of the European Union, but for Lithuania in particular. Firstly, the european Council approved the Commission's proposal to introduce the euro in Lithuania from 1 January 2015. This decision is undoubtedly important for both Lithuania and all euro area countries. Our neighbours, the Baltic states Estonia and Latvia, already have the euro. This decision will not only strengthen the Lithuanian economy, but will increase the competitiveness of our state and give Lithuania greater financial and even political security. However, so far, more than half of Lithuanian citizens do not support the replacement of the national currency with the euro, and this is a serious challenge for the Lithuanian Government, which must convince citizens of the benefits of this step. And only if, or when most Lithuanian citizens understand and agree, such a move will be successful.  The second Decision of the European Council, which has links with the state I represent, is the signing of the European Union's association agreements with Georgia and Moldova, as well as the remaining economic provisions of the agreement with Ukraine.

Everyone knows that this choice was not the primary wish of some members of the Council; yet, in doing so, the European Council has not yielded to a so-called putsch of Parliament, mentioned by some. Parliament will only vote in two weeks to confirm the choice of the European Council. In fact, the Council gave in to the citizens' vote. This is the great innovation of the Lisbon Treaty: the European Council must now take note of the citizens' vote. This is not a battle between the institutions: Parliament, in this case, is merely a reflection of the citizens' vote. The five major European political families, right, centre and left, have understood this: each has nominated its candidate and the campaign has been organized everywhere, in the utmost clarity, behind them. Several televised debates took place between them. For the first time, the European election gave rise to a European-wide campaign, not just the 28 Member States.  Some colleagues have criticised the fact that Jean-Claude Juncker is not a member of this Parliament, but each of our countries has different parliamentary traditions: the French Prime Minister is not always a parliamentarian.

He was momentous for three reasons. Firstly, for the first time, citizens' voices have been heard and have had an impact – this precedent – on the election of the Eu's executive, namely the election of Jean-Claude Juncker, the representative appointed by the winning political party, the European People's Party. This is a milestone in shaping and bringing citizens closer to the new European Union system and in reducing the democratic deficit.  The second important reason for this momentous summit is that the Energy Union (the principle of solidarity on energy and energy security) has received political support and there are chances that it will be implemented so that the European Union can have safe, cheap and competitive energy. This will tear up the political and economic dependence on a monopolistic supplier and will not, if they happen, cause high energy prices to stittle our economic growth and increase unemployment. And thirdly, great progress has been made, such as the Eastern Partnership, great progress in terms of relations with our eastern neighbours, who have chosen European values and were willing to pay the ultimate price, the price of their own lives. The signing of the three most far-reaching agreements with our partners so far is more than a 'semi-membership', a lasting link, an opportunity for democracy and prosperity in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia and for their return to the European family of nations.

For someone who has staked Britain’s membership of the EU on reforming Europe, he is certainly not very good at making friends and influencing people. Perhaps it was his decision to pull out of the EPP and away from the centre-right leaders across Europe; maybe it is the fact that he is now allied with the German version of UKIP, or maybe it is his constant threats that he will pull out of the EU if he does not get his own way. It is clear to everyone that whatever Cameron does is not really about trying to change the EU for the better but rather to appease certain sections of his own political party. It is not about the British national interest; it is about the interests of the Tory party. Yes, we need reform; the election results across Europe told us that people expect better – an alternative to relentless austerity. They expect us to prioritise jobs and growth, and they expect us to address some of the absurdities of the EU, such as travelling here once a month.

They would be saying that the European Union was discredit, that it frustrated the will of the voters and that we had not been able to honour the will of the voters and therefore they have a double standard and a double measure.

From this perspective, why does not think president Barroso to our country, Portugal, where the austeric troika did not want to know the risks of corruption and let go privatizations, PPP's, SWAPS and other ruinous contracts suspected of corruption, such as the one his government, in 2004, celebrated to buy submarines, and let protect, with obscene fiscal amnesty, rich and powerful bankers who fled to pay taxes.

You have already witnessed a debate which was truly political. We have clearly seen what will be the new debating lines in this Parliament. It is clear that those who are for Europe must – and, I believe, they will – work together. Therefore I would like to say a big thank you to all the leaders of the groups – Mr Weber, Mr Pittella, Mr Verhofstadt and Ms Harms – and all of you who have been clearly supporting European ideals and European cooperation with a view to the future. I also believe that support for Europe in our Member States very much depends on how Europe is explained to citizens by the national leaders and on how effectively the national leaders can assume, at the same time, the role of European leaders. I think it is time to realise that these two roles cannot be separated: that the national leaders are also European leaders and that they have this dual responsibility – to both their own countries and the European Union. We also have to be clear that the election result was very much affected by the fact that we are emerging from what was the worst economic crisis since the Second World War. So of course citizens have been frustrated – and rightly so – because, to be honest, it has taken us too long to find an appropriate cure and appropriate solutions to the crisis. However, after all this, we can clearly say that we are rising to the challenge, we have to overcome the problems and we will work better if we work together on overcoming the remaining economic problems in Europe. We have introduced new economic governance, we have made our banks healthier and stronger and we have finally managed to cut them off from the taxpayers’ purse. In that connection, I would like to remind our colleague Mr Verhofstadt that one of the architects of this new system, Mr Rehn, is now working in his group. I believe they will have ample scope for healthy discussions on how to progress in this area in the future. Several of you referred to the nomination of Jean-Claude Juncker for the Commission Presidency as a major achievement of the last summit. That is an accurate assessment because we have seen how the democratic will of the people was respected by the leaders and how that was reflected in this nomination. I believe this has paved the way for close and effective cooperation between the new President of the Commission and the European Parliament. We have also heard, in the statement by President Van Rompuy, that the European Council is looking for new ways to use the Treaty frameworks for even closer cooperation with this House. For the first time, we will probably use the articles providing for effective Union programming involving all the institutions. The European Council will be using the provisions on the new strategic guidelines, and I believe this will create new possibilities for cooperation among all the institutions. It will allow us to establish a new framework, in which we can act faster and adopt decisions much more speedily, and which will allow us to tackle what we see as one of the major problems in Europe, namely the ‘implementation gap’: the fact that we often make decisions but it simply takes us too long to implement them. To conclude, I would like to highlight the importance of all pro-European forces’ working together. Why? Because we need to prevent Europe from becoming xenophobic and anti-minority, be the minorities national, religious, sexual, or ethnic. We have already seen several indications of such a trend in sections of this Parliament, and it is therefore very important that we defend fundamental freedoms and the freedoms for which Europeans have been fighting over many decades. Otherwise I fear we could end up in a Europe where we would again have discussions along national lines, emphasising national and, indeed, nationalistic borders. I simply do not think that is what Europeans deserve. What we need is to restore trust in Europe by supporting growth, giving back to young people the chance to get a job and to plan for a bright future. We need to work on ways of making the European Union more competitive and making our economy perform better, and of securing for Europe in that way a position of leadership in the world. The world and globalisation need Europe. They need our values and our respect for social justice, the environment and human rights. That should be the agenda to which all pro-European forces in this House should work during the next five years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2014-07-02.json", "name": "Luke Ming FLANAGAN", "mepid": "124985", "text": "  President of the European Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have, as always, been very attentive to all the interventions. This time the debate was different from the other times because there were exchanges between you, and not just with the Commission or the European Council. We took decisions last week in the European Council. We will be judged, in the future, not on our speeches, one more poetic than the other, one more inspired than the other, some with a more marked verbal outburst than others, but of course on our decisions, on the results of our policy. We have taken some decisions at this European Council, the first formal Council after the European elections, a special European Council because of this very moving celebration in Ypres.  First, we agreed on a \"strategic agenda\" of a priority agenda for the coming years, which is an innovation. This is the first time that the European Council has made the effort to draw the lines of a programme for the coming years, to set certain priorities and even if it is not in detail, without being limited to generalities. In fact, this decision was taken unanimously: the twenty-eight prime ministers and heads of state unanimously agreed on this programme. Unfortunately, other decisions had to be taken by qualified majority but on the content, which is the most important thing, we agreed. In fact, all the prime ministers and presidents around the table represent - even if I did not count it - more than sixty or seventy national political parties. So they speak for many voters at the national level. This program is also important to you, as you will be able to judge future institutions and their leaders on the basis of what is agreed. We try to give content to these words, which are often hollow words, such as the words \"change\" and \"reform\"; it all depends on what meaning we give to the words \"change\" and \"reform\", otherwise it is only a speech, they are just hollow words. We have tried to fill in the empty boxes, to give content - in general terms, I admit - to these notions of \"change\" and \"reform\". I understand that the President-designate of the European Commission will need your votes to be elected by you. This Chair agrees, broadly and more even more, with this approach. I understand that within the major political parties in this Parliament there is a great deal of convergence on the lines to follow on this 'strategic agenda' for all the European institutions. The effort we have made to agree on this \"agenda\" of priorities for the next five years is therefore important. Secondly, we have, of course, proposed Mr Jean-Claude Juncker to the presidency of the European Commission. Colleagues, when I attended the Conference of Presidents in April- three months ago, four at most - I told those who were leading the groups at the time that I would try to do two things: avoid a clash of institutions and put forward a proposal that you could vote on before the summer. I kept my word. Yes, I kept my word. It has not been easy. It has not been easy to gather this very large majority around the name of the future President, I hope, of the European Commission. I ask you again here not to judge me on the number of sentences and words I say about this decision. I ask you to judge me and others on the decision itself, which is clear. I hope your decision will be as clear as ours.  We agreed - and made a decision on an association agreement - with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. We have certainly discussed it well here during this period of session, but for these countries it is a very historic moment: for decades, for centuries, they wanted to be part of the great European family. Thanks to this association agreement, the link becomes extremely concrete. In Ukraine, in Kiev, dozens of people died because of the refusal to sign the association agreement. We did it. Yes, we signed it. I hope that a stable majority will emerge in each of these countries to ratify this agreement, so that this close link between the 28 Member States, the European Union and Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will be sealed forever. We have made an extremely important decision here. Thirdly, after the Stockholm programme, we agreed on the broad guidelines for freedom, security and justice. The next five years will be crucial in this regard. There is always - and I very much welcome this - a very large majority, in the European Parliament, for the European project, with, of course, nuances, differences in content, but a particularly large majority emerges for the European project as such. However, if we do not achieve results, especially in terms of jobs, prosperity, standard of living, I am not sure that such a large majority will be achieved in five years' time. The next five years will therefore be extremely important, not only for the citizens, but also for the European project and for the functioning of the European institutions.  We therefore have an obligation to achieve results: once again, we will not be judged on the high quality of our speeches, but on our results. The next five years will also be extremely important for stability and peace in Europe. For the first time in decades, they are in danger: instability in one part of Europe could affect stability in another part of Europe. It is therefore necessary to do everything in the coming days, weeks and months to seek a political solution to the conflict, by negotiating of course.  But to negotiate, you have to be two. To negotiate, you have to be in good faith. To negotiate, you have to keep your commitments. To negotiate, you have to commit to a result. If necessary, we will need to take the necessary steps to make this commitment more concrete and sustainable. That is why the European Council has said that it will take the necessary decisions, including sanctions, so that the negotiations - and this political solution - can be successful. Again, the next five years are, in this respect, very crucial for peace and stability in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, and I am coming to my conclusion, we have a programme, defined by the European Council. The President-elect of the European Commission will also submit his programme and discuss it with you. I am sure that this programme will be in line with the \"strategic agenda\" on which the 28 Heads of State and Government have agreed. However, then it will have to be carried out, because, as I said, we will not be judged on the quality of our programmes, on the quality of our speeches, but on the quality of our decisions.  When we meet again next time - I am speaking to you for the last time in Strasbourg - in Brussels, the very last time I have the opportunity to attend a debate, I will be able to announce to you, on a crucial chapter, namely that of the energy union and the fight against climate change, the results and decisions of the 28 Member States. A new path will be laid out for energy policy and an essential path will be laid out for climate change policy.  I agree that, from this crisis, which has geopolitical dimensions, we must seize the opportunity to make a qualitative leap forward, particularly on energy policy, but we will also make progress in other areas. Having said that, in terms of the end of my mandate, the October Council will be dedicated to this energy policy and the fight against climate change, and this will be the first chapter on which we will make decisions. The other chapters will be the responsibility of the new leaders of the European institutions, who will be responsible for them and who will report back to you in sessions such as this morning's.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2014-07-02.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The sale agreement in this regard was concluded after the 2008 Russian aggression against Georgia and shows that, in the view of Paris, it was as if nothing had happened, even though President Sarkozy was personally making efforts at the time to agree the terms of the truce. Three years later, he signed a sales contract. President Hollande says he's just fulfilling the agreements and everything. It is as if it is not to be remembered that only a few months ago Russia occupied the territory of its independent neighbour, Ukraine, known as the Crimean Peninsula, whose french-Russian arms deal so wittily attaches the name of the capital, Russia, to another Mistral-type vessel. The territory of which the Ukrainian State was to be guaranteed by the same France among the other major powers. Can more hypocrisy ever exist? I have said that the European Union could finally start to establish a common security and defence policy, the central mission of atalanta in the Horn of Africa that would require french Mistral platforms. Let us buy them out of the hands of the Government of Paris and apply them in a decent European spirit, but, for God's god's time, let us not allow them to be sold to an aggressive Russia, autocraticly led by a former KGB officer.

Θέλω επίσης να συγχαρώ τον παρευρισκόμενο κύριο Barroso για την προσήλωσή του στο ευρωπαϊκό ιδεώδες και την τόσο επιτυχημένη παρουσία του ως Προέδρου της Επιτροπής. Οφείλω να πω ότι χαίρομαι ιδιαίτερα που το Ευρωπαϊκό Συμβούλιο, τώρα με τη Συνθήκη της Λισαβόνας και τον νέο τρόπο εκλογής, πρότεινε στην Ευρωβουλή την υποψηφιότητα του Jean-Claude Juncker, ενός αφοσιωμένου Ευρωπαίου εγνωσμένης αξίας, πείρας και ικανότητας. Αγαπητοί φίλοι, Αισθάνομαι ιδιαίτερη συγκίνηση που βρίσκομαι σήμερα εδώ, σε ένα χώρο γνώριμο, που τον νιώθω πραγματικά σαν να είναι το σπίτι μου. Διότι υπήρξα ευρωβουλευτής σε αυτά ακριβώς τα έδρανα που βρίσκεστε εσείς. Ακριβώς πριν δέκα χρόνια. Πάλεψα για τα ίδια ιδανικά, δηλαδή για το κοινό μέλλον των λαών της Ευρώπης. Και μάλιστα, πολλά απ’ αυτά που σήμερα θεωρούνται «δεδομένα» για όλους, τότε ήταν αδιανόητα για οποιονδήποτε. Γιατί το Ευρωπαϊκό εγχείρημα είναι ζωντανό! Έχει ελλείψεις, έχει αδυναμίες, προχωράει άνισα. Αλλά προχωράει! Και μάλιστα, πολλές φορές, με θεαματικά άλματα. Κι αυτό μπορεί κανείς να το διαπιστώσει, μόνον αν δει τα πράγματα από κάποια απόσταση. Πράγματι, υπάρχει αλματώδης πρόοδος από τη μια δεκαετία στην άλλη. Μέσα σε μια γενιά έγιναν όσα λίγοι πίστευαν κι ακόμα λιγότεροι περίμεναν μερικές δεκαετίες πριν. Κι ο ρυθμός της ευρωπαϊκής ενοποίησης επιταχύνεται συνεχώς. Με συγκίνηση, λοιπόν, σας καλωσορίζω όλους τους νέους συναδέλφους και εύχομαι καλή επιτυχία στη νέα σταδιοδρομία σας. Πολύ περισσότερο, που σήμερα βρίσκομαι εδώ για να σας παρουσιάσω τα αποτελέσματα της Προεδρίας μας, της Ελληνικής Προεδρίας. I will now switch, if you will allow me, to English. Our priorities for the six-month Presidency were the following: first, to tackle the euro architectural deficiencies as evidenced by the crisis, and mainly to deepen the EMU. So, the conclusion of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) regulation, together with the intergovernmental agreement on the single resolution fund (SRF), constitutes a major step towards the completion of the banking union. Our monetary union is now much better equipped to avoid future crises and better prepared to face them if they do happen. Then, on jobs and growth: the approval of the own resources legislative package will ensure timely and steady financing of EU policies. The adoption of legislation in the framework of the Single Market Act I and II has further contributed to improving competitiveness. It facilitates and safeguards the economic activity of our citizens and businesses. I will just mention here the regulation on e-business and e-commerce, the directives on the posting of workers, electronic invoicing in public procurement and the disclosure of non-financial information of businesses – also very important in fighting tax evasion. Further on, agreement was reached on the participation of the Union in the capital increase of the European Investment Fund. This means more liquidity to restore normal lending to the economy, and in particular to the most important part of our economy, which is the SMEs. Important investment files were also concluded while progress was made in the fields of telecommunications and infrastructure. Better funding, more market flexibility, more access to the markets for everyone, more access to liquidity for SMEs, more transparency across our Union. All these are different aspects of two things: more integration and more competitiveness. In other words, better prospects for job creation, employment, growth and prosperity, especially at times when huge unemployment levels threaten the fragile social cohesion in many of our Member States. Thirdly, border and migration management: this presents major challenges not only for the European South, but indeed for the whole of the EU, with far-reaching repercussions on economic growth and social cohesion.  Important achievements here were the revision of the list of countries for which a visa was required to enter the EU – allowing the citizens of about 20 non-EU countries to travel to the EU without a visa – and the adoption of the directive on the conditions of entry and stay of third-country nationals in the context of intra-corporate transfer as well as, of course, the new FRONTEX Regulation. A major breakthrough was the adoption of the Post-Stockholm Strategic Guidelines in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice which focus attention on the implementation of the principle of solidarity in the areas of asylum, border and migration management, the linkage between migration and the Union’s foreign policy – that is cooperation with third countries and the ‘more for more principle’, etc. – the development of effective return, readmission and visa policies, and continuous attention to an effective internal security framework. Fourthly, the horizontal theme of the Hellenic Presidency has been to redefine and re-launch EU maritime policies in all their aspects, including security, growth and energy. A key component is the European Maritime Security Strategy. This is the first time that the EU has developed a holistic, cross-sectoral strategy of this kind, which will result in better protecting and promoting security and the economic interests of the EU and its Member States at sea. It defines strategic interests and threats in the global maritime domain. The Strategy promotes EU principles and values, the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights, energy efficiency and security and a rule-based approach to maritime security, as reflected in the UN International Law of the Sea.  At the institutional level, the adoption of the Regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and foundations is also a qualitative leap for European representative democracy, through truly European political parties. I congratulate Parliament for voting this through. Particular attention was also paid to enlargement, thus renewing relevant EU interest, while confirming the engagement of those countries to fulfill their accession criteria. A week ago, Albania was awarded candidate status, while five months ago accession negotiations started with Serbia. Concerning Turkey, in the framework of the EU-Turkey Association Council, it has been underlined that Turkey’s EU path depends on her fulfilling her EU obligations relating to Cyprus. All in all, the Greek Presidency concluded 67 pieces of legislation and advanced another 15 legislative initiatives, where consensus was achieved between the Commission and the Council. This was done in four months, instead of the usual duration of six months, because of the European election. And we did it with a minimal budget of which not more than 40% was finally spent!  Now, we are particularly happy that the next Presidency, the Italian Presidency, will take the lead and push all policies and initiatives further. We are very hopeful and optimistic that it will exceed all expectations so that 2014 will be regarded by everybody as a very successful, Mediterranean year; a proud year for every European citizen!   In the last three years, my country has been seriously challenged. Europe was also challenged. Some were predicting the so called ‘Grexit’, the idea that Greece should exit the euro. Some were predicting that the euro itself would not make it either. We proved them wrong. Europe worked. Our Union has problems, but it also has the capacity to solve those problems and go ahead.  We proved that our peoples across our Union can work together and construct their common future in times of prosperity, obviously, but also during trying and very difficult moments of crisis. We proved that peoples across our Union can change their countries in making them fitter and more competitive so that they can successfully demand change in our Union, to make it stronger, safer, with more competitive economies and more stable democracies. In the last European elections, the European peoples did not vote against Europe. On the contrary, they voted for more Europe and better Europe! I believe we have already started delivering although we have still a long way to go. But we have to do more than that. We have to bring our Union closer to the hearts of the Europeans. To prove that our Union is not a series of bureaucratic procedures nobody can follow, and that it is mainly about common prospects and common ideals that everybody shares and can understand right away.  Just a hundred years ago, a devastating war started here. It was not the only one in the years to come; it was dreadful, but not the worst one, either. Our peoples suffered again and again – one tragedy after another for decades. Now Europe is the most united we have ever had. The most democratic we have ever had. The most prosperous and most stable we have ever had in centuries. Yet our people need to be inspired by our Union and by its prospects. They need to feel our Union closer to their hearts. I believe this is your first and foremost priority, here, in the European Parliament: to bring our Union closer to the hearts of our peoples! Because you, in our European Parliament, are indeed the very heart of our Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2014-07-02.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "  President of the Commission. - Mr President, the end of the Hellenic Presidency marks the end of one parliamentary term and the beginning of a new one so it took place in a very specific situation. Also, these last months have coincided with the beginning of the exit from the deep crisis in the European Union, perhaps the most difficult we have had since the creation of the European Community in the 1950s. We have now started on the road to recovery, but there is still a long way to go. I think it is important that, precisely at this moment, a country like Greece, one of those most affected by the crisis, has been able – showing the European commitment of its leadership – not only to respond to the challenges at home but also to contribute constructively to our European agenda. I would like to thank personally Prime Minister Samaras for the way in which he and his competent and dedicated team have carried out their duties and responsibilities, leading the Council during this very specific and challenging time. Under his skilful captaincy, the Hellenic Presidency has worked extremely hard – across many issues – to put in place what was necessary and to bring important decisions to fruition, against extremely tight deadlines because of the European Parliament elections. Prime Minister Samaras has already mentioned many of these issues so I will not list them again. I would prefer to concentrate my attention on the big achievements in relation to the economic situation. The reality is that economic confidence has improved and is improving in Europe. Growth across the European Union is predicted at 1.6% this year, rising to 2% by 2015. Investment is rebounding. Our collective excessive deficits are now under the 3% mark for the first time since the beginning of the crisis. Six more Member States have now exited the excessive deficit procedure, bringing the total number down to 11, fewer than half of the 24 countries which were in this position in 2011. I believe this is progress; and it shows that the Stability and Growth Pact is working. During the last months, and following Ireland’s successful exit from the programme and the successful implementation of the programme in Spain for the banks, Portugal too has exited its financial assistance programme with success. The situation in Greece and Cyprus has stabilised, with real signs of improvement, particularly in terms of the correction of very important imbalances.  We all know this process has been painful. I would say that Prime Minister Samaras and his government know it better than anybody. However, after these difficult and necessary reforms, Greece has now seen a further reduction in its deficit; it has projected growth; it has corrected historic external imbalances; and, indeed, it is recovering its competitiveness.  Despite the many prophets of doom, Greece has remained an integral, loyal, member of the euro area. I remember that, not so long ago, I personally had to discuss these matters not only with many in the European Union, but also outside the Union with those predicting a Greek exit and those predicting the implosion of the euro and even the disintegration of the European Union. It would be helpful if they could consider that they were wrong. Nobody denies that the recovery is still fragile and uneven. Growth is modest. Unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is, the biggest challenge facing us. We cannot afford a jobless recovery or a lost generation. That is why we need to speed up the work that is now on the table of the Council and Parliament. In fact, it is now possible to make more progress in that direction because very important achievements have been realised during these last months. Some of these developments were considered unthinkable a few years ago. If you had asked analysts in Europe and outside Europe, just two or three years ago, whether it would be possible to have a Banking Union and to have European Central Bank competence over national banks, they would have said it was not realistic. I remember, when the Commission proposed the Banking Union in 2012, that when I used the words ‘banking union’ many people said this was not realistic. They did not even accept the words. They said: ‘OK, something about financial stability, but do not talk about banking union’ – and now we have a banking union. We now have agreement on both the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism and Fund. This was a crucial sign of our commitment. It was a very important sign to the markets, and to our citizens, that Economic and Monetary Union is here to stay and is going to be completed. Alongside other important pieces of financial markets regulation, this will strengthen confidence and stability in the financial markets, and it will help to restore lending to the economy. Let us be honest: without stability any prospect of growth is impossible. If this work of stability had not been done we could not now consider, as we are considering, the ways to foster growth at European level. Another important issue is the European Semester. It is already in its fourth edition, it has now reached cruising speed. It has taken us further down the road of economic coordination, which is also a prerequisite given the high level of interdependence of our economies. On the country-specific recommendations agreed at the European Council last week, I want to underline that there was unanimous agreement, because sometimes I have the impression that those who agree at the European Council, or at Council level, then forget what they have agreed and say it is the others who have agreed. I repeat: the endorsement of the country-specific recommendations was unanimous in the Member States, so it combines all the governments, left, right, north and south. This exercise is now making real progress. We are now in a phase of moving Member States from crisis mode to a more forward-looking, reform-oriented perspective.  The European Semester, too, was unimaginable a few years ago. If, some years ago, we had asked whether the Commission would one day have the power to look at the national budgets before they are adopted, people would have said it was impossible – and now it is not only possible, it is an obligation. Why? Because the crisis has highlighted how interdependent we are. The European Semester, unimaginable a few years ago, has become an established focal point in the European calendar and economic governance. We now have in place a genuine debate about national economic policy, about what is happening in each of the Member States, and I want to congratulate this House, the Member States and the national parliaments, for the constructive role they have played, against very tight deadlines, in securing agreement on the country-specific recommendations and completing this semester of economic governance. That said – and I want also to highlight this – the idea being popularised in some countries that these are impositions from Brussels, or from the Commission, is completely false. That is not at all the way it works. The Commission has the role of making proposals and is the initiator of the process. It is also the objective referee. The role of the Commission is to check whether recommendations have been implemented or not at national level. But the decisions, I repeat, have been taken by all the governments, by the finance ministers and, ultimately, by the prime ministers of all our countries. So, please, it is time to avoid these discussions putting the blame on Brussels for decisions that are taken by the governments themselves. I hope they will have the courage to stand by decisions they take collectively. We now need to focus specifically on implementation and there is no room for complacency because a lot of reforms are needed. We need to do more, for example, regarding employment, the Youth Guarantee, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, investment, taxation and, overall, on progress in terms of our competitiveness. These two developments – the European Semester process and the completion of the Banking Union – were among the most important during the last six months. However, there are many other areas where we need to speed up our work, and I believe that the Italian Presidency has a lot of work to do here in terms of more focused action regarding the fight against youth unemployment and making better use of our EUR 1 trillion budget for the next seven years. We hear talk of the ‘new Marshall Plan for Europe’, but what we have is much more than the Marshall Plan. We have a budget for the next seven years which, if properly managed, can help us very much in terms of the investment needs which some of our countries do not themselves have a sufficient margin to meet. Efficiency is another essential consideration, and that it why I was very happy with the results of the last European Council in relation to REFIT, the programme for regulatory fitness at European level. During the last six months, through our REFIT programme, we have further lightened the load of legislation that no longer serves any useful purpose. We have withdrawn 53 more proposals, making a total of 293 withdrawn since 2006. It is interesting that these figures never appear publicly. In the conventional wisdom today there is still talk of bureaucracy from Brussels. Let me tell you that if all the governments made the same effort that we are making at European level to reduce the administrative burden, we could have a much better environment for our citizens and for our SMEs. Let us not forget that 80% of the European budget is administered by Member States themselves, and one-third of the administrative burden linked to EU legislation comes from national implementation. Member States can and must play their role too, creating a more growth-friendly environment by cutting red tape, and this is a collective responsibility of the Commission, of this Parliament and also of the Council. We have discussed other important issues during this semester. I will not repeat what has been said already in relation to the important area of justice, freedom and security, and especially the issue of migration. Finally, let me say a word about enlargement because this has been a period in which we commemorated 10 years since the big enlargement of 2004. Let us not forget that at the beginning of 2004 – when, by the way, my first Commission took office – there were only 15 Member States. Now there are 28. We have almost doubled the membership. It is one of the greatest achievements ever, in terms of European history, to have this reunited continent. That is another reason why 2014 should be remembered: it is 25 years since the Iron Curtain came down, 70 years after D Day, 100 years since the First World War, and also, in May, we celebrated 10 years of the reunification of Europe. A Union of 15 has been transformed into one of 28 and is open for the future, bringing together rich and less rich, big and small, old and new, central and peripheral, north, south, east and west. Those Member States have grown stronger economically, politically and democratically. Latvia, which will hold the Presidency from the start of 2015, successfully joined the euro area at the start of the year. Lithuania – a country whose wealth has increased from 35% of the EU GDP average in 1995 to 78% – will become the 19th member of the euro area at the start of 2015. So, dear Members of Parliament, how can people still be negative about the enlargement and reunification of Europe? How can they fail to understand the great convergence machine, the great creator of opportunities that the European Union has been: not only working for those new Member States but also projecting stability and thus avoiding many Ukraines around us. For Ukraine illustrates what would have happened if we had not had enlargement at the right time.  I firmly believe that Europe should remain open, particularly to the Western Balkans. It would be a complete mistake for Europe to suggest at this stage, because of current difficulties, the closure of our borders. We have to manage some specific challenges, yes: freedom of movement is a sacred principle. We should combat any kind of misuse or abuse of the rights of freedom of movement, but it would be a real mistake for Europe to close its borders. I have seen just recently, visiting Serbia and Albania, the progress that those countries, along with others, are making, and it would irresponsible on our part not to sustain the hope for those countries, if they meet the necessary conditions democratically and economically, of joining the European Union when they are ready. This has been a very important Presidency in very difficult times. Prime Minister Samaras and his team have demonstrated their commitment, capacity and experience – indeed, it was the fifth Hellenic Presidency – as well as their strong national traditions. I believe that those traditions, which were apparent in the course of this Presidency, can best be described by three Greek words that underline our European approach as we face the challenge of the 21st century. Logos implies pressing ahead with what is rational and right for Europe; pathos means listening to all sides and understanding the needs of our citizens, especially those who are suffering the most; and ethos, implies preserving our European values of freedom, justice, and solidarity.

It is true what the Prime Minister said that in only four months the Greek Presidency has completed 67 legislative texts, reached consensus with the Council on 15 other legislative texts on money laundering, on terrorism, on Europol, on the protection of children in criminal proceedings.  The Greek Presidency has moved things forward by promoting solidarity policies, by adopting the Regulation on the European Solidarity Fund for Natural Disasters, by trying to complete the enlargement dossiers in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, by promoting transparency, by making public non-financial information for businesses.

Mr President, as Vice-President of the ECR, the predominantly anti-federalist political group in the European Parliament, I would like to point out that the Greek Presidency is a monument to failure. This is certainly not a \"success story\", as is not a \"success story\" the policy that greece has pursued in our country, a memorial policy that has torn the country apart. Since May 2010 to date, Greece has taken 214 billion euros in loans, a huge amount over 120% of GDP. And one would imagine that with this amount the Greek economy could have developed, taken off. But what is the reality? One and a half million unemployed; thousands of shops closed; six thousand suicides; 40% reduction in wages and pensions; 40% of the Greek population below the poverty line. Public debt now stands at 175% of GDP; budget deficit of 11.5%; PSI with which the insurance funds were dissolved; 50 billion euros to save the Greek oligarchs who were the big shareholders of the banks. Greece was therefore turned into a social cemetery because Mr Samaras followed the troika's policy. You have missed the opportunity, Mr Samaras, to raise all those issues that have been of concern to Greece for decades and their claim, apart from a historical imperative, is also of immediate vital importance to the economic situation of our country. You missed the opportunity to identify yourself with the European Parliament against the Troika, while you supported the Troika. You missed the opportunity to stop the policy of austerity, which you supported as classic Mercely policy. You missed the opportunity to recall to class the Commission, which serves the lenders. You missed the opportunity to call on Mr. Draghi and his company not to profit at the expense of the Greek people, who pay 100% of the bonds bought by the Central Bank at a discount of at least 40%. So your policy in Greece and at the level of the Presidency of the European Union is a monument to failure.

Mr President, unfortunately the Treaty of Lisbon has weakened the role of the rotating Presidency so that the presiding country is finally called upon to implement pre-decisions by technocrats and non-parliamentary actors involved in the intergovernmental bodies. So who is a successful or failed presidency for? The European directories speak of impressive work, excellent results and prudent, almost spartan, financial management, and even talk about the man who at the beginning of the presidency referred to him as the weakest link. This for us means that the Greek Presidency has faithfully followed the neoliberal policy of extreme austerity without putting the slightest mound, despite the strong arguments it has had, given the unprecedented humanitarian crisis that the country is experiencing, and indeed in the heart of Europe. And that is a threat to all the peoples of Europe, as Greece is a pilot for everything they want to implement. And I will give a few typical examples: the abolition of collective bargaining, the complete liberalisation of redundancies, the complete absence of the state from health, pension, social benefits and welfare expenditure; complete liberalisation of the unacionable action of the major monopolies, the sell-off of public wealth in the name of the repayment of a large debt, a debt that was never controlled and which was loaded on the Greek people. On issues of sovereign policy, such as banking union, fiscal consolidation, economic governance mechanisms and others, the absence of decision-making centres was glaring. I will conclude with two extremely important developments during the Greek Presidency which show that the policy of the European Union is decided in absentia by the governments of the Member States, the European institutions and the European Parliament itself. And this is a sovereign matter of democracy and concerns us all. I am referring to the Ukrainian crisis and the issue of Syria's chemicals. In both cases it was the economic interests that determined to an absolute extent the political behaviour of the governments they support. For us, such a successful Presidency has proved disastrous for the Greek people, poses a threat to the peoples of Europe and is dangerous for the future of the European Union itself. We are committed together with our Italian colleagues to fighting for the Italian Presidency not to have the same successful results.

Nevertheless, I would like to make a few things clear briefly about the last six months under the Greek Presidency. First of all, thank you for concluding a whole series of dossiers which are very important for the stability of the financial markets, and first of all, of course, the conclusion of the Banking Union. The Banking Union is the biggest step towards stabilising the financial system in Europe, and in this respect we have really taken a big step forward for Europe. Now that the European Commission is working on the details, however, I am very concerned that in future the rescue funds will be disproportionately financed by the small banks and that investment banks will be largely spared from them. It is also regrettable that the Greek Presidency has set out to deepen the euro zone with a whole series of measures. Beyond the banking union, little has become of the big plans – we have discussed all of this here: the Commission's blueprint, the presidential paper of the four presidents. The result was a policy that was one-sidedly oriented towards austerity, and unfortunately nothing has happened in the area of aggressive tax competition. We have too little investment, too high unemployment and a lack of fair funding for our public communities, which is why we are now discussing new debt again. With regard to unfair funding, tax evasion and tax competition, the Presidency has done little, and I hope that this will be different in the next six months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2014-07-02.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "    Mr President, just now Mr Barroso spoke and said that Europe is now more united and more democratic. You all know that ancient Greece was the cradle of democracy. What perhaps many of you do not know is that in modern Greece, at a time when the Greek people are suffering the consequences of the implementation of the Troika memorandums, i.e. economic impoverishment, hunger, poverty, unemployment, unbearable taxation and civilian suicides, an oligarchic co-government of Mr Samaras and Mr Venizelos, the leaders of the second and fourth electoral forces of political parties, as the recent European elections have shown. , has abolished the separation of powers which is a basic principle of democracy. By manipulating justice and interfering in its work it has violated fundamental principles of the Constitution of our country. In particular, in order to neutralize its essential and only political opponent, the Golden Dawn Party, the country's third political force, because it has no political arguments to deal with it, it imprisoned its leader and six of the deputies without proving the charges against them. Those who have not been imprisoned are prohibited from participating in party events. This situation is unacceptable because it offends the principles of democracy and justice. For this reason, Mr Samaras should, in addition to taking stock of the activities of the Greek Presidency, apologise to you for the undemocratic behaviour of his government.  We call on the entire political democratic world of Europe to condemn the illegal practices of the Greek government.

These include the political agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism and its Fund and, as regards maritime policy, the inclusion of the report on respect for the law of the sea. On the other hand, however, the Presidency has not taken the necessary initiatives on issues it has set itself as priorities, such as youth unemployment, which tends to become a building block of societies in crisis, and on the migration issue, where more change in practice is needed on the part of the Union. I suggest, Prime Minister, that you work closely with the incoming Italian Presidency to tackle the common problem effectively. And while we have not seen any concrete proposals on hot issues, the Presidency has promoted the controversial issue of genetically modified organisms by giving more rights to multinational companies. We still wonder why. The Presidency was completely absent from the Ukraine problem, while the other institutions were on the ground.

We can organize a workshop to discuss the issues of Greece's interior (applause).  Note two: the first slogan the European People's Party had in the European elections was quite rightly the battle against populism. We will fight this battle in the European Parliament, we will fight it against the populists and we will move forward with the ideas of the European Union, the ones that lead to its European integration. Thirdly, the solution in Europe is more Europe, it is a better Europe, it is enlargement and deepening of democratic institutions. And that's our goal. And one point about the crisis: if Europe experienced the crisis so dramatically, it is because it did not have the tools. If we compare Europe with the United States, the United States manages 6% of its Gross National Product at the federal level, while we manage 1%; the United States has the ability to make bonds, we cannot; and in the period of the crisis they printed money, albeit a little inflationary, on seven banks. So we need to see the European vision, most of Europe, the best Europe, to move forward.

In such a difficult atmosphere, the Greek Presidency passed the test 100%, representing the Council in the negotiations of this 'Pandora's box', as was colloquially called this directive.  In particular, I would like to draw attention to the excellent work of Vassilika Kokkori and the negotiating team representing the Presidency. You have done your work very reliably, responsibly and with class. Thank you very much for this.

You called it the ‘come-back Presidency’, and I think that today we can all agree that this come-back was very successful.  Your country returned to the financial markets; your country is returning to growth, and you achieved a structural surplus in your budget after many long years.  On behalf of the Commission, I really would like to highlight the dedication that we observed in every member of your team to using every single minute which was left before the parliamentary recess to pass the important pieces of the legislation that would make Europe better served and stronger. I cannot agree with some of the comments I heard today to the effect that the Presidency is not important. This is not true. The Presidency is chairing nine of 10 sectoral councils, and the experts of the Presidency are chairing more than 100 working groups. Furthermore, I know that without the personal commitment, personal effort and determination to succeed, there is simply no success at the end of the Presidency. Therefore, I would really like to thank your Minister, Dimitris Kourkoulas, your Permanent Representative, Theodoros Sotiropoulos, and your Director-General, who is sitting behind you. I also want to thank all the experts with whom we have been working so closely. It was a very good team and collective effort which brought very impressive results. Several of the Members made a reference to the importance of the Banking Union, the Single Market Act I and II, the Posting of Workers Directive, the package concerning the modernising of administrations in Europe through e-government and new e-procedures, visa policy revision, the entire agenda related to justice and home affairs, and the historic steps which have been taken in the area of enlargement.  All this was achieved thanks to your team and to the good cooperation with this Parliament and the Commission. I would like to give my personal thanks to your colleagues for their good work on the General Affairs Council, preparing the summits, discussing the horizontal issues and completing this very important file on the European political parties, which I believe will be quite instrumental for the next European Parliament elections. Your Presidency came at a very crucial time for Greece and for Europe. I believe now that we can say – six months after the beginning of your Presidency – that we managed to put Europe on a stronger, safer footing. I would like to thank you for that and wish your country and your citizens all the best on the continued come-back to economic recovery as well.

I would also like to thank colleagues for talking about that the solutions that have been provided for the euro’s architectural deficiencies. I am sorry that, as a colleague has said, emphasis was placed mostly on Greece and not on Europe. I think some answers are indeed deserved. In 2010, when the Greek debt crisis surfaced, our monetary union had no instruments with which to face it. We were totally unprepared. There was no ESM, EFSF, SRM or SRF – nothing. I believe that we are now better prepared to avert similar crises before they happen, or to face them if they do happen. If we were now to rewrite our roadmap out of the crisis, everyone agrees that we would do it differently. I was among those who criticised the policy mix from the very beginning. But my position, as Prime Minister of my country after July 2012, was not to criticise the policy mix or engage in an academic discussion about the perfect path to stabilisation; my problem was to save my country, given all the mistakes of the past and all the structural problems of the present. We modified what could be modified, we implemented what should be implemented, and we ended up delivering results. It was neither easy nor painless. We achieved the largest fiscal adjustment ever in the shortest time ever. We corrected our fiscal deficit by 8% of our GDP in two years, stabilised the collapsing economy, produced a primary surplus one year ahead of our programme and came out into the international markets much earlier than anybody could have thought only six months ago. Despite the strict austerity measures, we reversed the trend of unemployment, which is now falling. We are putting an end to a six-year-long recession and are now starting recovery, and robust growth for the coming year is forecast. Yes, the Greeks have suffered a lot; and, yes, people in my country are still suffering. This is the first thing I said every time I met a foreign leader during the past four years, but things are now improving. We came to power just two years ago. In a few years I believe this will be a bad memory. If you like you can take the opposite example of Argentina, a very rich country that went bankrupt back in 2002. Twelve years later, they are still in crisis today and are again on the verge of collapse, with much more suffering and no hope. This is what we did not want to happen in Greece, and we achieved our aim with the sacrifices and the maturity of the Greek people and the determination of my Government. Some people did not want anything to change in Greece. Some people are still doing everything they can to block changes, to block privatisation projects, to scare away investors, and to keep the country in the misery trap we are trying to escape from. Some people tried to use the Greek crisis as a pretext for bringing us out of the euro or to use the architectural defects of the euro as a pretext for demolishing the euro altogether. We did not let them do that, and we are very proud that we did not, because things are indeed improving in Greece, where we are coming out of the worst crisis we have had for decades. I would like to answer some MEPs by saying that I do not have to apologise to extremists or populists of any sort. I only serve the interests of my country, and I do not have to apologise to people who do not want anything to change and who tried to block – as I said before – investors and privatisations. I think it is beyond the dignity of my country and of any country to live on borrowed money. We have put an end to this. In doing so, I believe we have served the best interests of my country. Concerning something that we heard earlier, Greece is a democracy, and democracies persecute actions. Democracies do not persecute convictions. Members of Golden Dawn are persecuted by the independent judiciary because of their involvement in criminal acts. We take law and order very seriously. Without law and order, no democracy can stand. Golden Dawn is persecuted as a criminal organisation because of its alleged involvement in crimes. Greece suffered from a devastating occupation by the Nazis. Seventy years ago they were the worst tyrants the Greeks had ever known. Their admirers and their supporters are totally unacceptable, but I have to repeat that the leaders of Golden Dawn are persecuted for what they do, not for what they believe in. They are persecuted by justice, not by the Government. This is the way it should be for any democracy in the world. (Applause) May I add something I heard from somebody who was not very well briefed on GMOs. We are proud that, as a result of our Presidency, a Member State can now, for the first time, unilaterally ban genetically-modified products, as was decided two months ago by the General Affairs Council and by the Council of the Ministers of the Environment. I have one last point. Regarding the crisis in Ukraine, the Presidency, in close cooperation with the Commission and the External Action Service, followed the two-track approach, which is a political solution and more sanctions if required. I would like to finish by saying that we are already in continuous cooperation with the incoming Italian Presidency for the next semester, which I am sure will be – and must be – a very successful one.

Good luck to you, Mr President, and congratulations on your election, but good luck and congratulations on the election to each of you Members of the European Parliament. You have a great responsibility: to restore confidence and hope in the European institutions and you immediately had the maximum cooperation of the Council, which chose to respect, as was right and in my opinion, the prerogatives of Parliament and respect for the election campaign. For all these reasons, therefore, I am happy and honoured to represent my country. (Applause) I leave to the Presidency, Mr President, the written document which deals with all the issues that we want to bring to the attention of the institutions during the Italian Presidency. So I will not make a timely written intervention with the obligations and choices that Italy has made for this semester, leaving it to your attention in the written text that we will deliver to you. Instead, I try to ask myself and all of you what the debate on European policy is today after the crisis we have all experienced and also the political crisis we are experiencing. Let me say it with a joke: if Europe took a selfie today what image would it look like? Can I say this with great concern? The face of tiredness would emerge, in some cases resignation; If I had to say it briefly, I would say that Europe today would show the face of bore boreness in the selfie. Yet it is incomprehensible: outside of here the world runs at an extraordinary speed, time offers us wonderful opportunities to understand how much the future may need us. I want to give you a concrete example, to do it first of all to me. This morning you closed the Greek Semester, so there is a handover between Greece and Italy. All over the world if we stop for a second to reflect and imagine what is the witness between Greece and Italy, we think of extraordinarily fascinating and suggestive things. Some may think of the relationship between Anchises and Aenea, someone else between Pericles and Cicero, Greece and Italy could be the agora and the forum, the temple and the church, the Partion and the Colosseum: instead, we do not think about this when in Europe we discuss between Greece and Italy and we do not even think about the questions about the meaning of life despite Aristotle and Dante Alighieri or Archimedes and Leonardo da Vinci. We think about the financial crisis, the spread, economic valuations and financial difficulties. Because? Because it is very strong in our body the wound that has left the recent economic difficulty. Let me be clear: I do not believe that we can underestimate the financial issue and in a few moments I will go into it very decisively and also very firmly. There is a major economic and financial issue: but Italy maintains that the great challenge of the European Semester is not just to list a series of events – which will also be there and I hope will see the convinced participation of Members of the European Parliament and Members of the European Parliament. №! The real, great challenge facing our continent today is to rediscover the soul of Europe, to rediscover the profound meaning of our being together. Because if we are to unite our bureaucracies, I assure you that we Italians are enough and we are advancing our bureaucracy. Either there is a strong, deep identity to recover together or we lose the challenge we face. I have said that I must not give the impression – nor do I want to – that I underestimate economic and financial issues. I would add and I want to say this with great clarity and conviction: here I represent a founding country of the European Union and a country that continues every year to make an important contribution to the European institutions. We Italians are among those who give more than they receive and we are happy about it and we are proud of it because the greatest value is not the economic one. But I must also say that I represent, or rather, I am one of the many representatives of a political party that is the party that has taken the most votes throughout Europe: the Italian Democratic Party. No one took the votes of the PD (Applause) and I tell you that we took these votes not by binging Europe on the crisis we are experiencing but by acknowledging that in Italy the problems arise from Italy, not from Europe. We have used a language of truth; we have said that 'we' must make our own reforms, that 'we' must change bureaucracy, justice, the tax system, that 'we' must change the institutions and at the moment, Mr President, the Italian Senate is voting in committee on reform that changes the rules of the game in our country. So we know that first of all we have to ask \"we\" for the strength to change if we want to be credible. Italy does not come here to ask Europe for the changes it is unable to make. (Applause) Italy comes here to say that it is the first to want change and that it believes in the European institutions. And it comes to say it with the conviction and determination – I would like to say the courage and pride – of those who know that they represent a great country that when it enters the European institutions is not to ask but to give. It is therefore clear that the economic question we are experiencing and the debate that took place at the last Council are not reduced to a request by some countries in relation to others to change the rules. We were the first to say that we want to respect the rules and we are not asking for them to be changed. Let us say, however, that those who remember that we have all signed together, our predecessors, a pact called the 'Stability and Growth Pact' respect the rules. There is stability, but there is also growth and the demand to have growth as a fundamental element of European economic policy does not make it a country: it serves Europe does not serve Italy. (Applause) Without growth, Europe has no future, it is not a single country that has a problem. (Applause) That is why, in the six months before us – and we want to say this with great serenity – we are not asking for a judgment on the past; we are not interested in judging the past: we are interested in starting the future. Right away. The world outside is running at twice the speed of Europe. Do we wish or not to make up for this gap? Do we or do we not want to be at the forefront of information and communication technologies, of major investments in climate change in the run-up to next year's Paris meeting? On the strategic importance of the issue of human capital?  There will not be a Europe worthy of the name until there is a European Civil Service for our children, for the new generations, who can see this continent as an opportunity for human growth for themselves. (Applause) There will be no room for Europe if we agree to remain just a dot on Google Maps. We are a community, a people, we are not a geographical expression – to use the expression that was addressed to Italy by a great Austrian politician in the nineteenth century. In order for this to happen, I believe that during the Italian-led six months we must be able to tackle forcefully the question of the simplicity of our institutions and of European political life. It may seem strange to you that the term 'simplicity' is used: but it is a great political battle. And if in this Smart Europe that we all want to build together, we will also be at the side of those who have different political ideas, this must be a positive fact, a fact that makes us more humled, not a fact that indicts us. That is why I believe, Mr President, that a Europe without the United Kingdom would not simply be a less rich Europe, it would be less Europe, it would be less itself, and we will do everything in our six months not to recover different positions, which were also held at the last European Council, but to affirm that those values of investment in a different Europe, which were also expressed in the last debate in the European Council , from different locations must be traced all together with units. Because we believe that Europe can be the place of the future if we have the courage to get involved now. If we have the courage to say that Europe must be and must return to being a frontier. It is physically, it is physically, it is in everyday life. Europe is also a frontier because, if we look at the map together, we see the country that has the most kilometers of coastline compared to the territorial extension. We are geographically a frontier. This poses many problems for us and we in Italy know something about it at the moment. At a time when the difficulties that are particularly present in Libya – not generally and generally in North Africa – but specifically in Libya, are causing a series of massacres in our Mediterranean Sea, the Mare Nostrum of the Latins, which we are trying to cope with with Italian operations and which, together with the Heads of Government and certainly with the sharing of the Commission , we will be able to cope more decisively for the future through operation Frontex Plus. But the problem is not just immigration or what is happening in North Africa at the moment: it is trying to reverse the approach. It is said that Africa must see a protagonism of Europe, which perhaps must be greater not only in economic needs, in the investment by our companies, in an attempt to address the energy issue, but also – let me tell you – in the human dimension. You represent, gentlemen of Parliament – as a great responsibility, as an extraordinary vertigo – you represent a beacon of civilisation. You represent, as Europe, the civilisation of globalisation.  (Applause) If, faced with a woman named Asia Bibi whose name I want to hear pronounced in this House, who has been in prison for four years because she is a Christian in Pakistan, there is no Europe that is indignant, it means that we are not matching our call, our destiny. If, faced with the girls kidnapped in Nigeria by a fundamentalist group that is kidnapping those girls simply because they are educated in Western values, if there is no reaction from Europe, if there is no reaction, if there is no reaction, if there is no reaction, we cannot define ourselves as worthy of the great responsibility that we have. If, faced with a woman, Meriam, who gives birth in Sudan in prison for her faith or the girls of the Arab Spring, we continue only to use phrases made, empty slogans, rhetorical words, we continue to lock ourselves in our borders without having the courage to affirm our values, we will not go anywhere and we will lose the dignity of our Being European politicians. (Applause) Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying that we are a frontier. Italy wants to live this six-month period by immersing itself in the spirit of the European debate with great determination, by bringing its voice on foreign policy into a framework in which we strongly say that we cannot but listen – and this was also the subject of the last Council meeting – to the voice calling for freedom, calling for Europe, coming from Ukraine and the eastern countries of our continent, and at the same time we want to say with great determination that we are not building a Europe against our nearest. We cannot be blind to what is happening in the Middle East at the moment, with children who have the right to grow up and – let us be frank about this – Europe can and must do more to assert the right of the Palestinian people to their homeland and to say that Israel not only has the right to exist – let me tell you so – Israel has a duty to exist. , being a community that remembers all of us the value of memory and the future. We must continue to work during our six months at the ASEM Summit in Milan on 16 October to affirm the idea that European foreign policy towards Asia must take a step forward.  All these issues, which it would be very interesting to go into one by one, lead us to say that our six months are meant to be a semester in which we are not afraid to say that politics has its own dignity and that in the dignity of politics we rediscover the profound meaning of our being here. That is why there is no Italy here that asks for shortcuts: here there is an Italy that with courage and pride offers its availability to do its part. And there is also, let me tell you, a new generation. If I were to conclude with a reference from which I started in the relationship between Greece and Italy I would say that it is the Telemachus generation. There is a beautiful epic in the literature on Ulysses, because Ulysses is the great character that fascinates and excites, and then because Ulysses animated not only ancient literature but also, from Dante Alighieri to Joyce, the thought and literature of many parts of our continent. No one talks about Telemachus, but Telemachus, if you think about it, has a task that is even more difficult. It is no coincidence that, at the beginning of the Odyssey, Athena calls him and tells him: \"You can't think of staying here waiting\". Even our generation, those who were not even eighteen years old when the Maastricht Treaty was signed – I was not even of age at the time – well our generation has a duty to rediscover Telemachus. He has a duty to deserve the inheritance. We do not consider the great fruit of our fathers a gift given forever but an achievement to be renewed day after day.  So the invitation of this European Semester is not simply to think about economic issues, on which – I assure you – we will make ourselves felt with all our might, with the strength of those who are a great country and those who contribute more to the Union's budget than when it collects. But it is not simply in the currency that we have our destiny in our pockets: our destiny is in rediscovering ourselves heirs, in having the right to call ourselves heirs, in taking the great tradition from which we come and saying that we will ensure tomorrow to this tradition. We owe it to our children, we owe it to those who have died over centuries so that Europe may not only be a geographical expression but an expression of the soul. Good luck to all of us.

I would also like to congratulate you very sincerely on your speech, which was full of passion for our common European project. During this transition period, the Commission will do its utmost to support you in delivering your Presidency priorities, because time does not stand still. We have a collective responsibility to ensure a smooth transition and to continue to work together hand in hand: the Commission, the Council and its Presidency, as well as the European Parliament. I particularly want to welcome the clear commitment that you, Prime Minister, have made to taking forward further reforms in Italy as well as in the European Union. The world is changing. We cannot stand still, and your impetus for reform, both in Italy and in Europe, is of the essence for our collective success. Prime Minister, you spoke eloquently about the transition between Greece and Italy. In many respects, Greece and Italy have been together quite recently. Not so long ago, three or even two years ago, people were talking about ‘Grexit’ – about Greece leaving the euro. Many Cassandras were predicting the implosion of the euro. I remember well when, in November 2011, several governments wanted to put Italy firmly under the supervision of the IMF, when Italy was on the brink of disaster. It was not just Greece or Ireland or Portugal or Spain that had financial sector problems: Italy, one of the biggest economies in Europe and indeed in the world, was very close to financial disaster, and it was possible to avoid that disaster. I am proud that the Commission, unlike others, always stood behind Italy, and always showed our commitment to, and confidence in, Italy as one of the biggest economies in Europe and the world. We have to build on this. During the terrible circumstances of recent years, we were able to avoid disaster, we were able to stand together to survive the crisis, we were able to provide the requisite stability, in spite of all those who predicted the implosion of the euro or even the disintegration of the European Union. Now we have the conditions in which to use all our collective experience, our ideas and our commitment to make Europe grow, to make Europe invest, and to enable Europe to generate the jobs that our people need and want. Together, across all our three institutions and with all our Member States, we need to ensure that we deliver what is required for our citizens. What they want most is results. What they want most is growth and jobs. As one of the original six signatories of the Treaties of Paris and Rome, Italy has played a fundamental role in shaping our Union from the very beginning. Alcide De Gasperi and Altiero Spinelli, as founding fathers of the European Union, understood the need to move Europe into a new phase of history after the tragedy of the first half of the 20th century. It is certainly refreshing today, here in Strasbourg, in the European Parliament, to listen to a Prime Minister of Italy who brings this commitment and this promise of reform, because we need a strong Italy at the centre of a strong European Union. That is why it is very important, Prime Minister, that you now bring this impetus for reform to the European Union. In this Presidency, Italy’s twelfth, and at this important transitional moment, it was very fitting that you spoke less today about the economy – though I know well how important you believe this is for your country and for Europe – and instead, rightly, put the emphasis on reminding all of us that Europe is a community of values and that we should not be arrogant about this. We should not be arrogant about European civilisation, but rather be proud of what Europe has been giving to the world, and what Europe can still give to the world. This Presidency comes at the start of a new parliamentary term: a term that will be of critical importance for the future of the European Union; a term that will see the Union move into the next phase of recovery. It is a transitional moment that builds on the progress we have made – and we have made progress – ranging from stronger economic governance in the European Union and the Banking Union to concrete growth, investment and social justice, as was agreed last week by all the members of the European Council with the strategic priorities for the next five years. The challenge is great, but the reforms to which Italy is committed at home and the reforms it is now trying to bring to the European Union show that the ambition is there for building a better Union. It is a top priority to deliver on our objectives for a smart, sustainable, inclusive social market economy: to deliver on our goals for jobs and employment; to deliver on the fight against poverty and for social equality; to deliver on research and innovation, education and skills; and also on the very important climate and energy agenda. We have certainly made progress but, honestly, not enough. That is why, during this half of the year, we are taking forward the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 agenda, to examine properly how we are all doing and to explore what we need to change in a post-crisis period. Getting this right will require the utmost coordination between Member States and between the European institutions, because the lesson from European integration is that it works best when we work together and cooperate in close partnership. I support the main themes of the incoming Presidency: growth, citizens, external action. Starting with growth, because this is an issue of vital importance, allow me to highlight five concrete results that I hope we are going to achieve during the next six months. First and foremost is the task of tackling unemployment, especially youth unemployment. This remains our absolute number one priority and I welcome the Italian Presidency’s particular focus on the issue. We simply cannot meet our long-term growth ambitions if we continue to have more than 25 million unemployed, a sixth of whom are under the age of 24. We need to ensure that the time lag between the economy picking up and businesses recruiting again is as short as possible. The Commission will be holding a technical seminar on this issue on 14 July. I would like to urge all Member States to join Italy and France in adopting operational programmes to take advantage of the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative, the result of a collective decision taken by the European Council. The reality is that we are not completely delivering on the commitments made for our young people. Some countries are already advancing on the Youth Guarantee, others not really. Secondly, we need to use the seven-year budget smartly and without delay, and we need to agree the budget for 2015. Although it is smaller than some of us, namely the Commission and Parliament, wanted, the budget for the next seven years amounts to EUR 1 trillion, so it can be a major lever for growth. It needs to be fully exploited. The budget represents a large proportion of public investment in many Member States: more than 80% of public investment in many of our Member States, particularly those that have very little margin for national investment. So I would urge Member States to finalise the partnership agreements as a matter of priority. Thirdly, we need to support our small and medium-sized businesses and our industry through research funds and access to long-term financing. This remains critical in the European economy: there is not yet enough funding for our SMEs. Much as we need fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, we also need targeted investment for growth and jobs. SMEs represent 99% of Europe’s private companies, employing two-thirds of Europe’s total workforce. It is thus vital that we breathe life into them in order to inject growth into our economies, making the best use of our new Horizon 2020 research and innovation budget – at around EUR 80 billion it is one of the biggest research programmes, if not the single biggest, in the world – and working towards a situation in which our industry accounts for 20% of Europe’s GDP by 2020. Let me now salute Vice-President Tajani, until now Vice-President in a Commission of just 28 Members and now Vice-President in a Parliament of 700 people. He was, in the Commission, one of those promoting this agenda for industry and SMEs and also making progress on dossiers such as pension funds, shareholder rights and access to finance. These will be critically important. Fourthly, we must continue to open up. I particularly enjoyed, Prime Minister, what you said about the idea of reform and openness. There are some people in Europe, in all political families, who believe that the best way to fight globalisation, or to respond to globalisation, is to close up, to be protective and to hide behind the table. This is not the Europe I want, and I think it is not the Europe that you want. We believe that European civilisation is a civilisation for globalisation, and that the message we have to send to our children is a message of confidence and openness, not one of being protectionist or chauvinistic, of being xenophobic, or being mediocre. This is the real debate in European politics today: are we going to embrace the possibilities of change or reform or are we going to give up to the negative forces of populism, chauvinism, protectionism and extreme nationalism? I believe we are on the right side if we go for an open Europe – a Europe which has confidence in itself. That is why it is critically important to deepen the single market, especially the Digital Single Market. We have to strengthen our trade relations, including with the United States, building the biggest free trade area in the world. Certainly we must address the concerns which have been expressed in that regard but we should not give up on Europe driving the world in terms of the economy: Europe being the number one trade bloc in the world, with a surplus in trade of goods, services and agriculture. Finally, turning to our climate and energy needs: we will be launching the review of our Energy Efficiency Directive this month. We will carry out stress tests on our most vulnerable countries to ensure that we meet our energy demands, and we will focus, at the UN conference in September and the October European Council, on our 2030 climate targets alongside our energy security strategy, to demonstrate European leadership ahead of next year’s international conference in Paris on climate change. I know the Italian Presidency is absolutely committed to this twin goal: the energy union and the fight against climate change. The theme of the World Expo in Milan 2015, ‘Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life’, reflects the complementarity between Italy’s priorities at home and those of its rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Honourable Members, we also want Europe to remain a free, secure and just place for our citizens to live in. Significant progress has already been made over the past five years but work remains to be completed. The Stockholm Programme will come to an end this year; and the European Council has just endorsed the Commission’s proposal on a future agenda. We must deal with our asylum and humanitarian challenges. Some Member States are significantly affected by migration flows into Europe, Italy being one of them. I was in Lampedusa, I remember what I saw there, and the Commission position has always been one of asking for more cooperation between Member States. The situation of sea refugees in search of a better future remains a source of deepest concern. Thus we must pursue our goal of a genuine common European migration policy with equitable burden sharing between the countries most exposed to migratory pressures. We must strengthen the tools we have and use them to their full capacity: we should fully enforce the recommendations of the Mediterranean Task Force; assure the exchange of information with third countries to tackle irregular migration flows; strengthen the Schengen area; defend the principle of free movement; and, at the same time, tackle all forms of abuses and address the new and serious challenges of cybercrime, cross-border organised crime, trafficking in human beings, violent extremism and terrorism. Honourable Members, we must ensure that we continue to have a strong global voice with our partners and neighbours. The current situation in Ukraine is well known and requires our attention as a priority, and there is also a new momentum now in the Eastern Partnership, where agreements have recently been signed with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. But the situation in the Middle East – in Libya, rightly highlighted by the Prime Minister, in Egypt and in the whole Mediterranean area – requires our fullest attention. It is crucial that we continue to work closely with these countries, as well as taking forward accession negotiations with the candidate countries, a task to which I know the Italian Presidency attaches great priority. Next year there will be another large international negotiation that will require our careful attention: the post-2015 Millennium Development Goals. The European Union and its Member States represent over half of the world’s official development assistance – another thing that we should be proud of, and that our young people are proud of. We have a moral responsibility, as well as a strategic interest, to ensure that, on the basis of our values, we help our partners to improve their prosperity and their security. And ensuring a successful outcome at that conference next year requires preparation today. The same goes for Asia. There will be an important ASEAN summit in Milan during the Italian Presidency. I believe that Asia is a very important continent full of opportunities. We have a lot to gain if we engage with Asia and, at the same time, fight for the common standards that everyone should agree to if we want open markets and open economies. So there is a lot of work ahead of us. We need to build on the experience we have gained collectively and we need to show political will. Prime Minister, what I saw from your commitment today and from the Italian Presidency programme is precisely that political will: the idea that, more importantly than bureaucratic or technocratic decisions, we need the democratic consensus to go ahead with them. You have great authority precisely because of the results you have achieved in Italy. I believe the time has come in Europe for the forces from the left, the right and the centre – all those who believe that Europe can be part of our vision and that Europe has not only a market but also a soul – to work together and to work to reduce the gap that often exists between statements made and their implementation. In this way we can put an end to what has been too common, namely national leaders’ taking decisions collectively in Brussels and afterwards putting the blame on Europe when they have not done their homework in their capitals. We need to work together at all levels to understand that this is a common task and that we are not going to succeed if the parliaments at national level blame the European Union or if the European Union blames the governments and the Member States. We can win only if you work together and if you understand that the European Union is not just part of the solution, but is fundamental to our solution. Prime Minister, since you quoted Odysseus, and so many figures of classical Greece and Rome, let me also conclude on that note. Europe is a never-ending project, so part of the frustration with Europe is that we are always thinking about it as some kind of completed building, whereas Europe is also a voyage. It is like Odysseus’ voyage to Ithaca. We should make it happen step by step. We cannot constantly compare it with what will be a complete achievement. This process of European integration is something new. So let us do like Odysseus: let us enjoy the journey towards a stronger, open and free Europe.

It is a great responsibility that you draw from this election result. Europe is strong when the Member States are strong, when Italy is strong. You yourself have acknowledged and described that, as President of the Council, you are stronger when you do your homework at home, if you tackle your own reforms at home. Congratulations on this statement, on this statement. As parliamentarians, we have already heard many speeches here, many ambitious drafts for the future, and we naturally also have an eye on what the Italian Presidency's record of shooting is, what comes out of it. We hope that you will tackle much of what you have promised here. The central point is the question of generating growth. That is why we need reforms. My group, the European People's Party, has no catching up to do. In many countries – Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Spain – as the European People's Party, we have taken responsibility, we have given a great deal to our citizens and, despite these difficult decisions, we have been confirmed as the strongest group. In other words, we have taken the path of reform. And now it's up to you to go the same way. There are many points on which we agree. Specifically, creating the internal market – we agree on all the points that you have described in the programme, which are practically European law-making. There is, unfortunately, some difference on one point, Prime Minister. That is, when it is asked whether we have learned the lessons that the crisis has taught us, the crisis of recent years. One of the lessons was that we regulate the financial markets. To this end, many laws have been made to get the banks under control of the financial markets. No one today would come up with the idea of saying that because the financial situation has calmed down, because the markets are more stable again, we no longer need to implement the laws that we have made for the financial markets so closely, we now need to implement it a little more loosely. No, we all expect the ECB to enforce the rules of the game hard! That was the first lesson. The second lesson: Debt does not make a future, but debt destroys the future. That was the second lesson we learned in the crisis. Here, too, we have given legislative answers: the Stability and Growth Pact, the Six-pack, the two-pack, our laws here – which, incidentally, were enforced against the votes of the Social Democrats. We in Parliament have been responsible for making us more stable and more sustainable. And now, suddenly, because the markets are becoming a little more liberal, we hear, especially from social democrats and socialists: we need to become more flexible, we have to reinterpret this, we have to reconsider all this. I tell you that is the wrong way to go. We must implement and take seriously the lesson we have learned. This is the only way out of the crisis: to build sustainable budgets. I ask the Prime Minister of Italy: with a total debt of 130% of GDP, where is the money going to come from? You yourself have said that you want to give your children opportunities and not build up more debt. Let me go further. There is an argument that we will then be able to make reforms if we are given more time. Mr Renzi, I understand the message, but the President-in-Office of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has already given French President Francois Hollande more time to carry out reforms. So far, we cannot see that the promise is being kept there. In other words, how can we be sure that reforms will then be carried out? Let me make one final argument: if we give Italy and France more time, if these countries are allowed to take on more debt, how can we argue with Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland, which have done their homework and have learned their lesson, have taken on the burdens that it is only because it is a G7 state, just because it is one of the great ones at stake now? , suddenly must be more flexible! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she Rules are there to ensure that they are complied with. There is no difference between small and large states in the European Union! Last but not least, I would like to give you some work on this subject: you have spoken of the trust that the citizens have in us. What if you promise your friend something, agree rules, and don't keep it? Then you destroy trust. And if we in Europe do not understand that we are doing what we agree on in Europe and that we must decide, take them seriously and implement them, as the President of the Commission said, and we will destroy the confidence of the citizens. In other words, the most important lesson is that we also take decisions seriously and implement them, everyone in their responsibility!

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Matteo Renzi, if I were to tweet about your speech, I would write 'authoritative, ambitious, passionate, concrete'. You have not disappointed the positive expectations and I must say that your positions are fully in line with the positions that the Group of Socialists and Democrats has always held.  Because yes, in these years of severe economic and social crisis, we Socialists and Democrats have fought, and will continue to fight, for a fairer Europe, for a more democratic Europe, for a Europe capable of guaranteeing each person a decent job and a decent wage. A Europe that does not abandon governments to itself when it comes to managing migratory flows, a Europe capable of making young people dream. And today you outlined that dream of stone, that better future that Europe owes to young people and citizens, the citizens who said in the last elections: 'Either Europe changes, or Europe dies'. And a first step towards change has been achieved in terms of the appointment of the President of the European Commission, noting the citizens' vote: a great democratic breakthrough. But there are still two major issues, among many that are priorities: one is the economy and the other is migration flows.  On the economy, we cannot fail to see the comatose state of European society. They talk about the figures, about unemployment, about marginalisation, about the situation of the middle class, which is now spat out, weakened and impoverished. We have answers on this issue, which is the priority issue, because there is no freedom unless there is freedom from need. This is a priority condition that we are making. We do not want to 'smash' public finances, Mrs Weber: we are not the wrecks of public finances. Nor can we accept the breakdown of society, the humanity we represent, the flesh and blood people, not the numbers. (Applause) We have to fix the numbers, but we have to fix people's lives. This means using all the flexibility provided for in the pact. We do not want to change, at least for the time being, a balance: that pact was called 'growth and stability' but it was only one of stability and austerity, I would add, and it was not one of growth. And so we are faithful to the agreements: that others should not back down, taking positions that we frankly unacceptable. (Applause) And on immigration: we need to practise the word 'solidarity', which cannot be a slogan, it must be practised. Solidarity with those who ask us to open our doors, solidarity with governments and countries that are under greater migratory pressure. We owe that. Europe was born as the seasoning of solidarity but then loses and forgets the concrete meaning of solidarity. President Renzi has made clear words both on the issue of the flexibility of the pact and the need for growth, and on the issue of European management of migratory flows. President Renzi spoke of the Mediterranean, this bloody sea, and recalled that the Mediterranean is not only the sea of interreligious confrontation, of the carts of death: it is also the sea of a great thousand-year-old civilization, which founded democracy. Yet a small policy allowed itself to say a few years ago: 'But what happens if Greece leaves the euro or the European Union? Almost nothing happens,\" forgetting that Europe without Greece would be like a child without its birth certificate.  Well, Europe needs to recover greatness and politics needs to recover greatness, it needs to recover real leaders, not paperweight, as the real leader is the Italian President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers. We will support the Italian Presidency, because it will be a six months of real change. Thank you, Mr Renzi, for what you will do for Europe.

With regard to the agreements, we are faithful to an interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact in which there are two terms: stability and growth. So far, it has only fought on the accelerator of stability and austerity and not on the accelerator of growth.

I am afraid that my speech will not be as flattering as the last one towards you. Europe is in crisis. We see little or no growth. You have identified that global competitiveness is in decline. We see high levels of unemployment, and the results of the European elections are clear. Whether you voted for the left or for the right in the last elections, Europe cannot go on as it is. Europe has to change. Europe needs reform now. Here in the European Parliament, I am proud to lead the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, a group committed to reform and to working with those who are prepared to take the tough decisions to meet the challenges of the 2050s, not look back to the 1950s. So, while we may not agree with the old idea of a United States of Europe, I very much hope and believe, Mr Prime Minister, that you are one of those modern politicians who seeks positive change to meet the challenges of the future. So, as you advance the agenda of your Presidency, we will give you our support when you make the case for reform. We will give you our support if you make the case for economic reform, and we will look to you to champion the single market and the digital economy, to reduce bureaucracy and to cut red tape, to open up markets and to stimulate trade. On the digital economy, let us no longer seek to second guess digital entrepreneurs or to engage in the Soviet-style economics that tells companies how much they can charge their customers. Let us instead lay down a framework for strong competition and for cross-border commerce. Then we should get out of the way and allow entrepreneurs to do what they do best: create jobs, generate wealth and improve our standard of living. That is why we welcome the Commission’s second tranche of refit announcements to cut the burden on our businesses.  But this Parliament can help by asking some questions. Where is legislation no longer needed? Where is legislation destroying jobs? Where is legislation standing in the way of economic growth? And do we really need all of the 180 proposals carried over from the last European Parliament? On trade, my group will work with you for an EU that is open to trade, not an EU of protectionism sheltering uncompetitive businesses behind barriers at a cost to the consumers. We should instead seek more trade agreements with negotiations which are as transparent as possible to prevent those with an anti-trade agenda from hijacking these discussions.  Let us now turn to two vital political questions: the Mediterranean and energy. All of us in this House have been shocked by the tragedies that continue to occur in the Mediterranean. Frontex can clearly play a role by helping to secure the borders and by stopping those seeking a new life from falling victim to traffickers or to the roaring seas. But, in meeting this challenge, it should be about cooperation and not coercion – and not the erosion of sovereign Member States. Turning to energy policy, we should seek to reduce our over-dependence on regimes which do not share our values, whether in the Middle East or Russia. So let us not seek yet another rhetorical Union, but instead a functioning market identifying and eliminating the blockages in the single market and encouraging better interconnections. Prime Minister, you have a busy agenda. Where we disagree with your proposals, we will offer an alternative. Where you pursue the 1950s agenda of ever-closer union, we will urge you to look to the future but, where you look forward to the 2050s, we will work with you. We hope that a fresh face in the Council chair will see fresh ideas and a fresh break in the politics of the past. If you can deliver this, we look forward to working with you.

È innegabile. Allora, caro Presidente, contiamo su di lei per riaffermare l'impegno europeo del vostro Paese, per rilanciare anche il progetto europeo e il progetto così come lo immaginava Altiero Spinelli e per ridare all'Italia, nella buona tradizione di Romano Prodi, un ruolo centrale di motore dell'integrazione europea e non per sprecare tempo, come ha fatto Berlusconi che ha perduto dieci anni per parlare nel Consiglio europeo di donne e di calcio: non è questo importante, penso, in Europa. Mr President, this is a crucial time in Europe. I want to continue with the discussion we have been having here in the European Parliament. It is not the first time; if you come tomorrow we will be having exactly the same discussion: a discussion on austerity and growth, saying to public opinion that there is an opposition between them.  I believe that there is no opposition between austerity, which is needed for sustainable growth in the medium term and the long term, and, at the same time, a strategy for growth in the future. There is no opposition. We are stuck and blocked in the European Union between the discussion between Mr Krügman on one side and Mr Ferguson on the other; between a Socialist government in France – Mr Hollande – and on the other hand Mrs Merkel of Germany, who are in fact opposing different positions. It is Merkel against Hollande, or maybe the other way round. What we need now is to recognise that austerity and growth are in fact two sides of the same coin, and that the only possibility is that you need austerity; you need to continue, and to apply the rules that Mr Weber is correct in asking for, but at the same time, the problem in Europe is that we did not have a growth strategy and a growth package. We have, for the first time, to be intelligent, and not to think in old schemes, or that it is by deficit spending – by making new debts at national level – that you can create sustainable growth. You have to use Europe for growth. We need to use a new package – a Delors package – in the new sectors of digital and investment in energy to have this growth. It is not at national level, with debt in Italy of 132 % of GDP – how can you create growth in Italy? It is not possible. We have – and that is the role you must now play – to say to the colleagues in the European Council and to ask the European Commission for a second Delors package, as we did in the 1980s – you will remember that there was also a crisis in Europe; there was no Euroscepticism, they were not there. There was eurosclerosis, which was even better than Euroscepticism at that moment. At that moment it was Delors who came forward with a package to create an internal market and to launch this internal market. We do not have it in a number of crucial sectors – not in digital, telecommunication, energy or capital markets – for the moment. The consequence is that small and medium companies have still to pay interest rates of 6-8 % while the banks receive money from the European Central Bank at a record, historically-low interest rate.  That is your task now: to launch this kind of new Delors package. Then I am very sure that Europe can emerge from the crisis. Let us use the European Union as an engine of growth, as the engine to emerge from the crisis, and not believe any longer in the old style of deficit spending – programmes at national level – that are not sustainable, because the market will never accept them if countries are making new debt by simply increasing interest rates. I hope you can do that. You are a reformer, we know that. That is the way you have been elected at the head of the PD and then later as the Prime Minister in Italy, and you are also representing a fantastic country. You are representing Italy, which is the basis of the European Union. It is the basis of our conscience, of our history and of our civilisation. So make it work and make it true.

I would agree if words were matched by concrete plans. Everything must change in the Union: economic rules, institutions if a Union of solidarity is to be reborn. On the other hand, the Italian Presidency begins with worrying assurances: the economic rules are not re-discussed, even if it is they who have aggravated the recession and an unprecedented mistrust in Europe; nor is the liberal creed re-discussed, the so-called structural reforms – increasingly precarious work, a reduction in public expenditure, even diminished constitutions – are still considered indispensable conditions for growth. Everything remains as it is: only words change to say it. There is no growth without rigour because rigour is a prerequisite for growth. Sylgism has become intolerable. What we are asking of the Italian Presidency is a radically refounded Union. It is not enough to be complacent about the flexibility of the parameters on national investment that we are not in fact allowed to do: we need a European New Deal, a Delors turn or, better still, Roosevelt, not fictitious exemptions negotiated between strong and weak states. We need a Union with adequate own resources for the New Deal to provide work for the millions who have lost it. It can be financed by the European Investment Bank, the financial transaction tax, the carbon tax, two taxes that prepare for ecological development. Investing in infrastructure, renewable energy, research: that is the task. Nor should we overlook the proposal for a debt conference, similar to the one that in 1953 condone most of Germany's war debts and allowed it to be reborn. (Applause) It is also up to managing immigration not only by controlling borders but by creating real humanitarian corridors for refugees: the situation is too tragic. The last Council says something else: it is up to the countries of the South alone to save lives in the Mediterranean. Nor, unfortunately, has Renzi's proposal on the mutual recognition of asylum seekers been successful. The task is to listen to the citizens who demand a clear break in continuity: a break in economic policies and also in foreign policy. Peace in Europe can no longer be decided in the United States. On our borders with Russia and in the Mediterranean is a European pax that we need. And america needs a breakthrough, too. Renzi promises to conclude soon the trade treaty between US commissions and multinationals, the TTP: he seems oblivious to the dangers, nor does he seem to be fighting for an end to the scandalous secrecy of the negotiations. What the voters want is clear: that liberal dogmas fail, they have not worked. Keynes said politicians are generally slaves to deceased economists. What I am asking Renzi is not to make us believe that the new one consists of denouncing eurobureaucrats and uninterrupted slavery by defunct economists.

Mr President, Mr President Renzi, what I had been told was true: you exercise the ministry of speech with talent, passion and energy. You are lucky because in the next six months you will be able to demonstrate to us that you are exercising with the same talent, passion and the same energy the Ministry of Action! On the subject, first of all, of this debate you had on stability and growth - a word I have banned from my vocabulary - I just want to tell you that you are lucky because the texts of European economic governance - the 'two-pack', the 'six-pack', the EU 2020 strategy - are all coming to an end, halfway through, for review. In the next six months, we will have to consider whether we have not gone the wrong way and will therefore be able to question those policies that ultimately boil down to one thing, namely austerity, that is, how to make the most vulnerable pay the price of the crisis? You have the opportunity to show us, by putting these texts back on the job, how you want to rework the European economic governance apparatus and there are in any case three areas in which I think you can score points. Are you prepared to move forward to make social goals, such as reducing poverty and inequality, mandatory? To make environmental objectives binding- is this already partially true - on the part? The question, as Yannick Jadot said, is now being asked of binding targets for energy efficiency, for CO2 reduction, for renewables. Are you going to make that target binding because it is only what we measure that we get, that it is only the constraint that moves us forward? Are you also going to make this European economic governance democratic again? Today, the way things are going means that parliaments are no longer, either at European or national level, really involved in economic and social policy choices. Democratic deficit, social deficit, environmental deficit: there is work to be done if you want to review economic governance! When it comes to taxation, there are no sustainable public finances without responsible spending, but not without sustainable revenues. However, we realize that with 1 trillion euros of tax evasion and evasion per year, there is also work to be done! Will you, as President of the Italian Council, ensure that by the end of your semester, the automatic exchange of information is the norm, not only in the area of savings taxation but generally between European tax administrations? Are you going to get the issue of corporate tax harmonization, starting with the harmonization of the tax base, to be finalized? I would especially like to address you, as head of one of the two governments deemed socialist in Europe - that of France and Italy - because it is my responsibility that, with regard to the financial transaction tax, Rome and Paris are the two capitals that make the most effort to empty the draft financial transaction tax of any content. Starting from a project that aimed to bring in more than 100 billion a year, we may be at 5 billion: it has become a small stamp duty tax like in the United Kingdom, that is to say three times nothing. On energy and climate: which Energy Union? Are you going to choose Donald Tusk's formula of setting up a common purchasing power plant to buy our gas in Russia, or are you going to make the Energy Union a project whose objective is the independence of the European Union through the use of renewables and energy efficiency? It is both a strategic issue, a climate issue and an employment issue. Finally, I would be remiss if I concluded without mentioning social Europe. If you are a reputed Socialist President - I do not know if the Democratic Party is a socialist party, but finally whatever - are you going to carry this European unemployment insurance project, which your colleague is pushing with all his energy, before the end of his term at the European Commission? In other words, you have your work cut out for you. We're waiting for you at the foot of the wall.

But no words have been said to those millions of citizens who are systematically excluded from all the decision-making processes that affect them. Talk about discontinuity: but what is your conception of discontinuity, of change, of the new generation? Is it the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the Commission and Martin Schulz as President of this Parliament?  Popular and Social Democrats united in the division of power and armchairs with the support of a few small groups. We want change: we want a different Europe, a different Europe, first and foremost in the type of treaties, agreements and political lines. We have heard with fervour about treaties such as the Fiscal Compact, but never in these institutions has there been any talk of a Social Compact or some social measure of rebalancing, a matter which you obviously do not care about. We have seen you enthusiastically in having the European Stability Mechanism, but we have never seen any enthusiasm for a European Social Stability Mechanism, in which income, work and citizens' dignity are preferred. (Applause) And now we hear in your words a great enthusiasm when you say the acronym TTIP, it sounds good, doesn't it? If multinationals operating in the assembled markets are really given the opportunity to take legal action against national governments, then the most perverse design of globalisation, namely the governments that are controlled by the markets, can really be said to have been achieved. Do you have any idea what the consequences of this TTIP, that is, the agreement on free trade and investment between the United States and Europe? Secret meetings are being held which exclude us citizens from the debate and the doors are opened to narrow and very powerful lobbies that will decide everything about our future, a future that would completely give multinationals our market, the food we eat, the medicines with which we care, the air we breathe. With this treaty, who could prevent the sale on the Spanish, Italian or Portuguese markets of a GMO tomato built in a Texas laboratory? Or a Parmigiano Reggiano \"Made in Minnesota\"? Who would control and rule on the protection of the typical features of the territories, and on the basis of what rules? An agreement for the usual multinationals that would wiped out small and medium-sized enterprises and the many workers who have historically been the lintel of the well-being of European society. But who wants this treaty? Who's carrying it out?  As a 5-Star Movement, as early as this July, we will launch with determination and courage in all committees a process of transparency and supervision of the TTIP Treaty. The citizens must be able to have their say. (Applause) We, Mr Renzi, expect this presidency to take a different path from the one we have mapped out so far. The model of globalisation is almost an indispensable and indisputable dogma for the European Union. But are we really sure that the time has not come when globalisation itself is controlling these governments?  There are many open tables for economic and financial globalisation. Yesterday Morocco, today the United States, tomorrow China, Tunisia and then who knows. But those for the globalization of rights, Mr President? Have you ever opened a table, one, to negotiate equal rights for workers, to ensure fair competition in Europe and with countries outside Europe? Are you asking the question of the conditions of workers in the countries to which you are asking for free trade? Who gives an answer to the Spanish, Italian or Portuguese farmer, who is on the market for his products at half price and is forced to close the farm? How do you explain to underpaid Polish workers, romanian exploited workers, the millions and millions of unemployed and desperate Europeans without any income? We ask ourselves, as European citizens, what future does a Europe have that relocates the arms of workers where labour costs know no dignity, relocates their wallets to tax havens, often home to multinationals, and keeps only its head here, namely the administrative and financial centres, which are slowly surrounded by social anger and so much misery. And what does the European Parliament do? It spends two hundred million euros a year on travel here in Strasbourg and at the same time devotes a few pennies to deal with continuous humanitarian tragedies, such as the dramatic rescues of human lives in the Strait of Sicily. Is this the Europe you want, Mr President? We honestly don't.

Perhaps it is tiredness, perhaps travel, perhaps tonight you cannot stop to talk to journalists because there is a television broadcast in Italy. Perhaps it is the fact that the debate is so interesting that the President of the European Commission has left. I think it is shameful that the President of the European Commission has gone to do his own business and is not in this House listening to Renzi's answers and the speeches of other Members. I am speaking to the President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking to my fellow Members and I am talking to those who are watching us live on a live stream: it does not look like Mr Barroso, but I do not think mr Barroso is the gentleman who replaces him. Not a word about marò. I have heard about women's rights in Pakistan, right; of Christians persecuted in Nigeria, right. This is the palace of hypocrisy and lies because there are two soldiers, not Italians, but Europeans who have been jailed in India for two years: not a word on the subject. We take care of losers all over the world, the poor all over the world, not those in our own homes. And that's really depressing from my point of view. The humanitarian corridor – I say this to some left-wing friends – I would have liked there to have been for the 150 Italian entrepreneurs who committed suicide in the economic crisis last year. I would like the humanitarian corridor for pensioners massacred in Italy and the rest of Europe because Europe is calling for it. I would like the humanitarian corridor for those farmers and for those fishermen who have been destroyed, with decades of experience thrown away, because european regulations, decided at the table by someone who, although I have never seen a fish or apricot, decide how to fish, how to fish. Not a word about agriculture, not a word about fisheries. Not a word about banks. This building and the Commission – ghost – is fattening a billion euros for banks without a penny reaching savers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen and families. There is a massacre going on: in Italy last year there was a negative record of new babies born. I do not know how it works in the rest of Europe, but we have gone back 40 years in terms of newborns. Because this wrong Europe and this wrong currency are stealing future and hope. So I am sorry that this is the palace of hypocrisy and lies, which gives a minute's silence when a few hundred desperate people drown, when the only way to prevent these drownings is not to let them go. Either someone explains to me that Italy and Europe can welcome a billion people or Mr Pittella will give a minute's silence, two minutes' silence, three minutes' silence because these massacres have been repeated again today, they will be repeated tomorrow, they will be repeated the day after tomorrow. Perhaps you live on another planet: I reply to Bobby Sands in Telemaco who died on hunger strike after 66 days saying: our day will come. Here someone is dancing on the Titanic: the day will come when those who do not have will come here to take back what is theirs, starting from a wrong coin in the name of which you are destroying the hope of entire generations.

The debate is becoming too Italian, but I thank you because you drew up a vision at the beginning of the Italian Presidency and without vision, Mrs Weber, it will be difficult to get out of the crisis and make our countries stronger. Of course, we need our countries to come out of the crisis and become stronger for a stronger Europe. But let us not forget that we can only be so with much more solidarity, much more justice, much more equality. So we need to take up so many challenges and think that we are all starting a parliamentary term. The Commission begins, Parliament begins it, all the institutions at the moment know the state of the art of Europe. What should we focus our common attention on? First of all, on the lesson that comes to us from these five years of crisis: with rigour alone, we will not get out of the difficulties. We must therefore put into it what is natural: resources. Resources for what? Resources for investment, employment and research. If we think about the future, how can we not invest in research? These are objectives for the benefit of all European citizens. We need to change policies and policy approaches. We talk a lot and we are rightly shocked by what is happening in the Mediterranean: but until we transfer national policies to Europe we will not have a real Europe that deals with immigration policies. Do we all want to take up this challenge together? This is for all the citizens of Europe and I thank you, Mr President, for talking about inheritance: it is very important because we must never forget where we come from and we must remember what Paul Valéry said with distrust during the war, as Nazism advanced: 'What will become of Europe? Europe will become what it really is, that is, a small promontory of the Asian continent\".\" No, we didn't become one and we don't want to become one.

They were saying: yes, we need development; yes, we need to grow; yes, we need to fight unemployment; we have to do something about energy, climate, and so on. There is one way to do it and that is more Europe, more unity and more Community method.  This is a sort of rhetoric, which for my use I call the ‘Barroso rhetoric’. Your speech was different.

We have tens of billions of euros available from the Youth Unemployment Fund, and none of them are being called up! The problem is not less money, the problem is: how do you do it, how do you use the money in such a way that it has an effect? How do you create structural changes, structural reforms? How do you create innovations and how do you create research and new ventures? Not by using new rules to prevent companies from investing or by slowing them down, but by doing exactly the opposite.

Give hope back to millions of Europeans, through concrete policies and through profound change in European policy.

It is killing many European countries and millions of citizens who are looking at us to make our rules more flexible — because there is room to do so – and we believe in employment and return rights to workers, and give freedom to women, and make it possible for a real fight against poverty that is real and is just around the corner of all our streets.

In terms of growth, we are convinced that the solution is at European level. To revive our economy, we firmly believe that it is by betting on major European industrial projects, such as Airbus, Copernicus and Galileo, that Europe will be able to compete with the giants of India, Brazil, China or the United States. It is also essential to define a clear policy of re-industrialisation based on four or five pillars, with massive investment in innovation and research. With regard to the transatlantic treaty, we say 'yes' on principle, but not on any conditions, and we will be vigilant that this agreement is not concluded with cheap standards, particularly in the field of agriculture. Europe must impose itself and its prerogatives. It must be respected on all free trade agreements and the principle of reciprocity must become the absolute rule. Similarly, the recovery of our economy must not come at the expense of fiscal discipline. We cannot make our citizens believe that we can revive our economy while undermining their future. It would be their lie and this schizophrenia that some political discourse offers us is a dangerous game. On the migration issue, the French Presidency had, as early as 2008, led the way. Despite this, we have not made any major progress since then. Europe is under a lot of migratory pressure and Italy is of course on the front line. It is by joining forces that we must act, because again, it is at European level that we can solve our problem by moving towards a chosen and unsured immigration. In the end, we want a Europe of results, a real political Europe that weighs in the world, a Europe built around citizens and for citizens.

Similarly, I draw your attention to the role of women in the economy — we would like to hear it more often. Women entrepreneurs are making a significant contribution to developing this untapped potential in Europe. There is also a need to work towards better integration of women into the labour market, whether in terms of pay, part-time/full-time work, or career development opportunities. Second, migration policy. I will mention two key elements in this regard: solidarity between the Member States and the strengthening of the Frontex Agency. But there is also another important aspect: our common visa policy, which could now be a tool for better managing migration flows. It must be implemented quickly as proposed last April by the Commission. Before last point: what about the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area? The technical conditions are met; I hope that the Italian Presidency will be fair and commit to this issue. Finally, with regard to the Union as a player on the world stage, I believe that our voice will never be heard if we are not united and if the common reactions do not intervene in time. I wish the Italian Presidency success, from which European citizens expect a great deal, as do the citizens of Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine, who aspire to democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2014-07-02.json", "name": "Tonino PICULA", "mepid": "112744", "text": "   Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, the European Union is still awaiting recovery from the crisis. And the crisis is both an economic and a crisis of vision. It is therefore justified during the Presidency to develop innovative economic growth programmes, as well as to encourage open debate on the concepts for the Union itself. This presidency falls into transitional time as the new Commission will only be appointed towards the end of your mandate. However, you can also use the presidency to fully commitment to existing programmes. One is the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative. Over 70 million people gravitate to the space, and the initiative already includes priorities such as investment and energy independence. It connects four member states and four countries that want to become one. A similar model of member-neighbourhood unity would be beneficial for the whole Union, as the recovery of the European project depends largely on the stability and European perspective of our neighbours. I am a representative from Croatia, which connects a lot with Italy. However, what connects us best is our Adriatic Sea. During the presidency, I call on Italy to show additional sensibility for the proud community of small fishermen and to adapt European legislation to their needs, traditions and lifestyles. Let me also express my deep regret over the new immigrant tragedy in Sicily when 35 people died. It's a reminder that unhappy people from unhappy areas have been losing their lives for years in an attempt to get their hands on Europe.

Prime Minister, you started your Presidency in great style. You brought to this House what Europe needs so much: pro-European passion, Mediterranean temperament, energy and political will for change. European citizens send us a clear message: they want a Europe of growth, a Europe of jobs, a Europe of values, and a Europe which has a soul and cares deeply about her citizens. Your Presidency is the first one after the European elections. It is the Presidency which will oversee not only the institutional renewal, but also the setting-up of the priorities for all EU institutions for the next five years. We must make sure that these correspond to the major concerns of the European citizens – how we can restore growth; what about the worries of the unemployed; how we can address the fears of young people about their future; how we tackle poverty; how we deal with the migration pressures which are felt particularly strongly in your territory in the south of Europe. I am very glad that in your introductory statement you were very clear that your Presidency is going to look for answers in Europe, and here I agree with all the honourable Members – Mr Pittella, Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Weber and many others – who clearly underlined that we have not used the potential of Europe fully, and that there is still a lot we can tap into and can use, be it the European single market, our digital economy, renewal of our industry or the fact that we are the biggest trading bloc and the biggest economy in the world. We have to search for all the possibilities and look into all opportunities which Europe is offering in order to make sure that the enormous financial resources we invested in the financial industry to save our banks are actually transferred and channelled to the real economy to help our European companies to innovate, get our Europeans new, much-needed skills and help our enterprises to innovate through access to innovation, research and development programmes. I also believe that you can use project bonds much better. We can use new, innovative financing much better, because this is exactly what the European economy needs: renewal, real money for the real economy for real entrepreneurs. I am very thankful to you for reminding us of the important role that Europe must play in the process of globalisation. I am absolutely convinced that globalisation needs a European flavour. It should do more to reflect European values, and Europe must remain the world global leader to shape it better than before. You said that today’s selfie of Europe would be one of a tired, bored continent, and I want to underline that the Commission is ready for full and close cooperation with you and your team, and I am also sure that, thanks to Italian energy, enthusiasm and reform, the selfie of Europe in six months’ time will be significantly refreshed.

I am grateful to you. It was also very interesting and I will take home some reflections. The first is that Italy is not afraid of judgments, but I am a little afraid of some prejudices, some prejudices that have also been expressed in this chamber. For example, I wonder how one might think that the Italian position on the environment is that which has been described by a blu card and then by the leader of the Green Group. I wonder how we can imagine, for example, that there is no attention on the subject of energy, when we hosted the G7 on energy on an Italian initiative in Rome. And I very much agree with some of the reflections that have been made on the subject of interconnections, especially from Spain and France and the whole subject of the energy report, no longer just to the east or west, but to the north-south. There will be a way, during the six months, to discuss the merits of the work. I also hope for civil service, since it has not been discussed again, nor the great ideal references that we have tried to bring to your attention. I say to Steven Woolfe, who is not here and who spoke about Western values, that it is not my expression but is in boko haram's statement of claim. (Applause) I hope that you will have a clear difference between our position and that of Boko Haram, and I also believe that we can turn our backs on the ion, but we cannot turn our backs on the real problems of this continent. (Applause) But I would like to close by simply thanking you for all the speeches, especially, as always, not only from my political group, but it is always a pleasure to hear so many of you – Verhofstadt on everyone. I have been listening to him ever since, as a young citizen, I shared his great European anxiety, which is also mine. However, I am very impressed – and I am sorry to speak in his absence – by the speech by the leader of the PPE Group, who probably escapes the fact that some of his Members support my government, but that is not important to say it here now. I am surprised because I did not understand whether he spoke in this House on behalf of his political group, in which case – I see some friends, although of different opinions – I have no doubt that his political group will have explained to its members in recent years all the brilliant reflections made about Italy's debt and economic policy, having led our country for many years and I am sure that Weber will have explained it to him. Just as I am sure he will have been answered.  (Applause) If, on the other hand, Mr President, the group leader, Mr Weber, spoke on behalf of Germany, I would like to point out to you, who knows you much better than I do, because of your experience and your membership, that it was in this Chamber, during the last Presidency of Italy at the head of the European Semester, that there was a country that was not granted flexibility but was allowed to violate the limits. That country was Germany, with the reform process that has allowed Germany today to be a growing country. So I want to say quite frankly: if we come to discuss the substance, we, Mr Tajani, will be happy to make our European Semester a great opportunity for discussion, reflection and discussion. But if you imagine brandishing the weapon of prejudice, without knowing, for example, that, while It is true that Italy has a very high public debt, it does have a public and private wealth that is four times that of public debt. Obviously there is a problem that concerns our country for which we do not talk about \"homework\", but we are talking about reforms that we have shared with our citizens. The attitude of those who imagine that they are here to morally cheer others, without listening to the speech but talking about something else, is an attitude that I believe is an attitude to be rejected by the sender. I am therefore sorry to have, in the absence of the leader of the GROUP of the European People's Party, who will certainly have had more important commitments, had to answer him on the substance to tell him that this is a country – it is a great country – which has not only history on its side, but the future, and that if anyone imagines coming to lecture others, it has got the wrong place. This is the place of democracy and let me therefore close with a reference to the financial crisis, not the last, the first. Do you know where you've been, Mr President? You know better than I do: it was the first financial crisis in Florence. And I'm honored to be the now former mayor of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Well, at that time, because of the financial crisis, the families that owned the banks paid the states to save the states: the families failed, the states were saved. Exactly the opposite of what happened with the Rescue Fund states to which Italy contributed, where we saved instead, understandably, not only the countries, we have also saved some credit institutions from important countries that had – with little foresight – invested in those countries, in those banks, in those government bonds. Well, I would like to mention the financial crisis in Florence, not to say that the opposite of what happened today happened then, but to learn a positive lesson: the Renaissance was born from that financial crisis. From that financial crisis a lesson was learned and the great lesson was that educating the beautiful, educating in teaching, educating in school, in then universities, educating in the values of man and woman, was the key to pulling a city – in that case a country, a Europe now – from difficulties. So, as a former mayor of Florence, I say this as Italian President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers: we are not afraid to face the crisis, because we know that the pride and courage we have with us will be enough to change Italy. But it is not Italy and France that are calling for different rules of the game. We are okay with the rules of the game. We are all saying that only by investing in growth will we guarantee our children a future of prosperity.

I look hope to support the Presidency in broadly promoting Horizon 2020 in order to allow as many people as possible to participate and to identify the best innovation ideas at the level of preparation. Efforts to strengthen scientific centres are also important. In this respect, it is important to promote cooperation between strong centres and weaker ones, in order to maintain the pace of investment and research and at the same time ensure a sustainable growth of innovation in the EU. It is necessary to ensure the coordination of national innovation policies at Union level so that a common Union innovation and research capacity can be effectively built up.

In order to strengthen the European Research Area, we need investment in the modernisation and development of science in the European Union.

The Italian Presidency has set good priorities in the field of social affairs and employment: I too think that the issues of youth unemployment, workers' rights and the social dimension of EMU are central.

Cases of posted workers and bogus self-employed workers must be included. The platform should not serve as an exchange of information, but should also take on specific tasks such as EU-wide training programmes for inspectors and the organisation of transnational labour controls. I also welcome in principle the fact that worker mobility is one of the priorities of the Presidency. However, mobility must be made fair and voluntary. The EURES reform must promote border partnerships. The lack of information on employment relationships and social security in other Member States is one of the main obstacles to cross-border worker mobility. EURES should therefore not be used for the mere placement of employment agencies, but should, as before, cover the increased need for information and advice.

I wish you success and I believe that with the passion that distinguishes you you will serve our common goal that wants Europe to be an essential leader in developments for generations to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 161, "date": "2014-07-02.json", "name": "Σωτήριος Ζαριανόπουλος (NI)", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Writing. – The priorities of the Italian Presidency are characterised by the same common strategic objective that permeates the entire EU's unpopular policy: to ensure the profitability of EU monopolies, to strengthen their position in global monopoly competition. The debate and controversy over the maintenance or relaxation of restrictive fiscal policy do not imply any relaxation of unpopular measures for the working class and the grassroots. On the contrary, they require intensity in order to ensure high profitability in monopolies. The Italian Presidency's commitment to promoting capitalist restructuring, its aims to further strengthen surveillance mechanisms and the incorporation into the EU Treaties of the unpopular transnational agreements of the 'Financial Pact' and the 'European Stability Mechanism' are preparing an escalation of the EU and government's attack on workers. The main priority of the Italian Presidency is to strengthen the EU CFSP and its war arm, the Common Security and Defence Policy, particularly in the regions of the Middle East, Libya - North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa - Sahel - Somalia, which are of particular interest to the Italian bourgeoisie. It thus marks a new round of EU imperialist interventions, multiplying the risks of generalised warfare, with dramatic consequences for the people. It foreshadows the strengthening of the crackdown on migrants.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}]
