We welcome you, Prime Minister. As you know, and as my fellow Members know, Parliament wants to be at the heart of the debate on the future of our continent and our Union. We are experiencing particularly difficult times: Europe must be changed, but it is a precious asset that we cannot renounce, because it has guaranteed us seventy years of peace, democracy and freedom. We want the European Parliament to be increasingly at the centre of the political debate, we want to be protagonists and we want the European Parliament to have the power of initiative like all parliaments in the world. In recent weeks too, we have made our voice heard on the subject of immigration, calling on the Council to adopt the reform of the right of asylum. This is one of the important issues for Parliament. It will now be important for us, during this debate, to listen to your ideas, your proposals and what the Polish Government intends to do to make a contribution to the construction of the Europe of the future. There are many proposals on the table: those of the European Parliament, those of the Commission and those of several Member States; that is why it is important to listen to what the Member States think: we want to confront each other, and this is a new method of confronting a face-to-face between the European Parliament and the leaders of national governments. Thank you for accepting our invitation. I would remind you that the debate today will end at 11.20 a.m., because then I will receive the President of Angola: for speeches, you can register with the usual system, sticking paper and pushing one of the buttons.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Prime Minister Polish. – Mr President Antonio Tajani, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. Dear Minister, I would like to thank you for your excellent work. Dear President Valdis Dombrovskis, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. Honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your excellent work. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schwab Dear! It is an honour for me, as Prime Minister of the Government of the Republic of Poland, to be able to speak here in Strasbourg today, to be able Polish present this point of view on the most important challenges facing the European Union. It is also an honour to speak here in the European Parliament, which, of all the institutions of the European Union, most reflects the voice of its citizens expressed in democratic elections. The European Parliament is an important place for the Functioning of the Union not only as an institution with a huge influence on the shape of EU law, but also as a forum where decisions are discussed that will set the direction for European integration in the coming years. Poland is celebrating this year the 500th anniversary of the convening of the first Sejm and the centenary of the regaining of independence, when we were one of the first countries in the world to grant women full democratic rights. This shows how deeply the idea of parliamentarianism, democracy and the rule of law is rooted in Polish political culture. It is the national parliaments that are the expression of the sovereign's voice and a living symbol of democracy. The discussion on the future of Europe is one of the most important debates that we face, especially when we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, from which the difficult history of 20th-century Europe began. It was after the cataclysm of two world wars and unimaginable crimes of genocide that the free nations of Europe made the historic decision more than 60 years ago to start integration, in order, despite our differences, to look for what unites us. Had it not been for the Iron Curtain and the tragic division of Europe after World War II, Poland would also have been the founder of the European communities in accordance with the will of the Polish government in exile. This division put Polish society outside the bracket of the first wave of European integration, but also outside the bracket of sustainable development. That is why today, even more so, as a full member of the Union, we want to be as active as possible in the search for a constructive agenda for our continent. Like every nation in Europe, we have our expectations for it, but we also have a lot to offer. It is impossible to understand the continuity and essence of Europe without acknowledging its Greek, Roman and, finally, Judeo-Christian roots. Without Christianity, European diversity would never have achieved a sense of universalism and unity in diversity, especially in this House. This motto of our Union is not just empty words. Our nations have been shaped for hundreds of years through their culture and institutions. Respect for these national identities is the foundation of trust in the Union. The constitutional pluralism enthused in Article 4 of the Treaty is a great value and every country in the Union has the right to shape its legal system in accordance with its traditions. For me, the European idea has always been a Polish state of affairs, both when, as a young boy, I participated in the anti-communist opposition, fighting for freedom and democracy, and when, as director of accession negotiations in the Committee for European Integration in the 1990s, I worked on Polish's entry into the Union. Today, despite almost thirty years since the fall of communism, we are still in the difficult process of sewing the European experience, the European memory. However, the differences that divide us must not obscure the common objective of the security of our citizens and economic development. Honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your excellent work. In recent years, the European Union has been grapple with existential crises: the banking crisis, the financial crisis, the euro zone crisis, the migration crisis, Brexit and Russia's aggressive policies. The five losing Community referendums in recent years, as well as the change in the political landscape in European countries, are all evidence that the European project needs a new opening. Some argue that the Union is always going through a crisis, that any change to the Treaties is the result of one solstice or another. However, our situation today seems to be unique, different from in the 1960s or 1980s or in the first decade of this century. This is because we are dealing not with a single crisis, but with multiple cumulative crises at the same time. The answer must therefore be based on the best possible understanding of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. We all see that many Europeans are no longer enthusiastic about integration. Some of them are openly opposed. We can be outraged at that. We can close our eyes and pretend it's just a margin. But that won't change the reality. This is not a margin. This is a real signal that we have made mistakes, and an opportunity to fix those mistakes. Instead of wringing our hands over dangerous populism, we should rather to consider why there has been such a situation that so many Europeans do not like the direction in which the Union has been going for years. The answer to this question has been given many times and in different ways, but I think the most pertinent is the one that has stood at the source of all the great changes in our history. People have the gene of freedom within them and they want to decide for themselves what life will be like for their families and their societies. When they see that they are losing this influence, that they have no real impact on the fate of Europe and the world, it is a natural reflex to oppose this situation. I think that in this House we are all more or less convinced that European integration is one of the best ideas in the history of not only Europe, but also the world. But if this belief is not shared by our citizens, there will simply be no further integration. Therefore, the further development of the Union must take into account their voice. In other words, in order for the European project to move forward, its democratic legitimacy must be strengthened. This can be called populism, but sooner or later one has to ask ourselves whether the answer to citizens' expectations is actually populism or rather the essence of democracy? Europe is currently experiencing a democratic awakening, which shows that we need to renew the social contract that created the great success of post-war integration. This contract was about restoring a sense of security and an economic policy that offers relative prosperity for all. Today, we must \"annex\" this contract by restoring a sense of security and hope that our children will live better than ourselves. Only this can restore confidence in the European project. So how do you respond to this democratic awakening? The answer is a community that adapts to the challenges of today without giving up its existing responsibilities to its citizens. In order to deal with all these challenges, we need to redefine the balance between national states and cooperation at European level. This is what the Union of Nations 2.0, de Gaulle's vision adapted to the challenges of the present day, should be all about. This is the vision of the Union that Poland wants to propose. As part of such intelligent adaptation, we propose to focus primarily on three aspects. The first is union 4.0, the European Union as the forefashing of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a deepened common market. The second point is a secure union, that is, aware of the geopolitical challenges it faces and ready to respond to them with one solidarity vote. And the third point is the Citizens' Union, a socially sensitive union that supports its citizens against the power of global corporations, a union of solidarity. And now I will briefly discuss these three areas. I have no doubt that more cooperation is needed above all in terms of the challenges of the changing nature of the global economy. The Union should set itself ambitious targets and focus today on a bold budget and further economic integration within the internal market. Completion of the internal market, productivity gains can only be achieved by increasing competition within a fully integrated internal market. According to an analysis by the European Parliament, only in the last 14 years since the creation of the internal market has it contributed to gdp growth of ceteris paribus above the alleged increase of an additional €250 billion. We therefore need more common market, especially in services. The services sector accounts for around 70% of the Union's GDP and at the same time represents only 20-25% of intra-EU trade. The 2006 Services Directive needs a major revision in order to finally make the freedom to provide services a reality. But there will also really be no single single market without a further ambitious fight against inequality, without an active cohesion policy. This policy is not a unilateral, non-refundable aid to underdeveloped countries. Cohesion policy is, above all, an investment in the development of the common market, which brings enormous trade benefits, including to those who today are most demanding that it be reduced. According to EU and our calculations, around 70-75% of euro cents return from each euro to net payers in the form of orders and orders. Commissioner Oettinger recently spoke of similar proportions. This must be made clear: attempts to reduce cohesion policy are populism. And it does not matter whether it is anti-European populism or supposedly pro-European populism proclaimed under the EU flag. Cohesion policy, an ambitious fight against inequality, is a win-win situation for the founding countries of the Union and for all other members. This fight against inequalities can be achieved not only through cohesion policy transfers, but also by sealing our tax systems. The real fight against the VAT gap must be tackled and tax havens at European Union level must be tackled. Vat revenues are, after all, union's revenue. I would point out that the Commission's calculation shows that tax avoidance losses amount to up to EUR 200 billion per year in the Union, and vat fraud and losses amount to an additional EUR 150 billion per year. If it's not just this \"big African elephant in the room\" (the elephant in the room), Then I don't know what it would be. In Poland, we succeeded. We have dealt with tax refund criminals, fraudsters who have robbed our citizens. These people could afford the best law firms. They managed to delay proceedings for years, hide money, avoid accountability, flee from poor justice. This justice system was, moreover, extremely opathleable and opathliable for these criminals. The courts have been convicted of ridiculously low sentences, often suspended. And we've heard from everywhere that it has to be, that nothing can be done about it. And we just showed that we can. Thus, we have generated revenues for the European Union and also for Poland, the Polish society. It was only necessary to be determined, to define the goal we are aiming for, and then to act smoothly to achieve it. This is also our offer to Europe: effective, proven legal solutions. This is often discussed at the European Council. The state and society robbed by bandits, by the terrorist mafia, the state's unsuccessful justice apparatus was partly fictitious. We have been showing for two and a half years that an effective state can almost eradicate extreme poverty in children and young people. These are our very real social achievements. It is also essential that we work very closely within the European Union in the area of tax avoidance, including on so-called digital tax and tax havens. In the morning, I also spoke with President Tajani about the European Union's own revenue. Poland also supports this idea, which I know the majority of the European Parliament also supports, namely the European Union's own revenue. So it is also necessary to limit tax havens. These havens are not directed against one country or another. Their existence threatens our entire economy. It allows billions of euros to leak out of our tax systems every year so that this money does not go to our citizens. Just as we prosecute tax criminals who commit individual actions, together we must counter organised action that allows for systemic and sometimes even state dishonesty. The modern economy also requires a new approach to competition law. It seems reasonable that a European antitrust office should be set up at EU level, more tailored to the challenges of today's digital economy. There is also a need for new competition rules and perhaps even sectoral regulations adapted to the digital age. Haven't Google and Facebook, for example, become essential facilities today, like transmission infrastructure in the energy industry? None of us in this House, and above all none of our citizens, can imagine daily functioning without these tools. They are essential for functioning in a modern digital society and regulations must keep up with these changes. The new Investment Plan for Europe proposed by President Juncker has been a success. Economic growth has accelerated and today the European Fund for Strategic Investments has generated additional investment of €300 billion. This fund should not be disbanded in 2020, but should be transformed into an ambitious new tool. The need for further strategic investment today stems not from the need to recover from the crisis, but from the need to make Europe competitive. The European Investment Bank warns that the Union is suffering from a chronic lack of infrastructure investment. This expenditure is now the lowest in many years. The investment gap is more than €600 billion per year. Until we fill it, we will not be able to compete with other global powers. One such strategic goal is the European energy transition, which requires a combination of price competitiveness and geopolitical realism. So what does it take? Investment in innovation first and foremost. Europe should create the world's largest clean-tech fund and put more pressure on market-based mechanisms to increase the rationality of the energy transition for European companies and citizens. After all, competitive energy prices are crucial for the competitiveness of national economies. The path taken by the European Union towards a low-carbon economy, and perhaps even zero-emission economy, is certainly the right way to go. This is the way to a clean environment and a better health for our citizens. In Poland, we are well aware of the importance of these challenges, which is why this year we have taken a strong fight against smog and are introducing a package of solutions that will guarantee an improvement in air condition. However, when we set further reduction targets for the Union, we must remember that our countries are starting from completely different levels. Until the economic transformation in 1989, the Polish economy was based on heavy industry and coal energy. Nevertheless, Poland has made a huge effort to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 30% in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol with our commitment to 5%. We have exceeded our target six times. Poland is ready and wants to participate in the European energy transition. However, it must be based on equal opportunities and take greater account of the differences between our economies and support the efforts of countries with different instruments. For years, Poland was not able to switch its energy to natural gas, as it could only source this raw material from one direction – from Russia. Thus, any attempt to increase the consumption of blue fuel would lead to a breach of our safety. However, all our efforts in Central Europe can be crossed out by Nordstream II, which, it must be made clear, is not an economic project, but a political project. The European Union does not need Nordstream II, which increases the risk of destabilising Central Europe and gives Russia very strong tools to influence not only the European economy, but also European politics.  So the industry of the future will decide the reality of the global economy. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, Big Data, industry 4.0 – these are the ways that can give a new impetus to our economy. As the internal combustion engine played a huge role in the industrialisation of the West, so thanks to European cooperation it was possible to build Airbus, which alongside Boeing is today a global leader in aircraft production. It's time for new joint technology projects. Poland wants to participate courageously in such projects. Today, electromobility can be such a 21st century reindustrialization vehicle. This development is already dynamic, but requires more substantial support from our countries. Today, only about 1.5% of cars in Europe are electric cars. If we really want to reduce CO2 emissions in our economy, we need to take a decisive step forward here. It is not science fiction that in 10 years' time, for example, about 25% or 30% of cars will be electric cars in the European Union. If we also want all these technologies of the future to develop, we must continue to build a Capital Markets Union, capital markets especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Poland supports this direction of market development. The economic growth generated by the smart adaptation of the European economy will strengthen confidence in the European project. I mentioned earlier that the second point should be the pillar of European security. The second pillar, the second part of this contract, must be safety. Recent years have been a time of exceptional increase in geopolitical threats such as terrorism and Russian hybrid warfare in Ukraine and more, interference in the democratic process of Western countries and even direct attacks on the people of the Union. We all remember Salisbury or the destabilisation in Syria. Russia's aggression against Ukraine has shaken the security architecture of Central and Eastern Europe, but it has also been part of a larger plan to destabilise the West. A few years earlier, georgia was the target of a similar attack. This clearly shows that Russia's actions are not a coincidence, but part of a pre-established strategy. The only fault of these countries was the choice of the European economic and political model. This shows that the security of the Eastern Partnership of Europe is a matter for the union as a whole, to the same extent as the security of our southern neighbourhood. Peace and the stable development of our borders are in our best interests. The Union must therefore respond with all available means. But our security is also about building our defensive capabilities. This equates to our defence policy spending and our ability to maintain the transatlantic alliance. We have to take care of these relationships. Differences of opinion are natural, but it must be remembered that the strength of the West will always be our unity. Contentious issues need to be resolved in a spirit of partnership. After all, America also helped win Western democracies in World War I and II and stopped the Soviet Union from attacking western Europe. The global imbalances that our American partners are talking about are a fact and we need to resolve them at a global level. In this context, I am also pleased with the creation of the European Defence Fund and the entire PESCO programme, which will provide an additional transnational source of financing for investment in the defence industry. This is the way to strengthen our cooperation and the development of new technologies. One such challenge is cybersecurity. We already know very it is good that it plays a key role in the democratic process and that we may be vulnerable to attacks during elections and referendums. Today, no country in the European Union is safe from interfering in its internal affairs. Nor are our citizens safe, their bank accounts, and basically their entire digital identity is constantly exposed to cyber attacks. Together, we must make an effort to fight for security in cyberspace. Dear! Last week's European Council also showed that the Union is capable of realism and restoring the trust of its citizens who want safe and protected borders, as well as the right to influence decisions on migration policy. The Union is struggling with the influx of migrants and refugees from different sides and only through an intelligent and flexible approach to the migration challenge can it restore the sense of security of European citizens. Poland is a new home for more than 1.5 million Ukrainian citizens, including many who have fled their family homes due to Russian aggression. They are not registered with us as refugees, but simply because our procedures allow them to obtain a work permit much easier and build the well-being of themselves and their families, so that they also support our economy and the economy of the European Union. Demographic pressure from outside, especially from Africa and the Middle East, will only increase. That is why the European Union must commit to the stabilisation and development of these regions. Today, a new Marshall Plan for Africa is a necessity, just as it is necessary to combat the illegal smuggling of people into Europe. We support the creation of new funds for Africa, such as the European EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, but we propose even more. We propose the creation of a European Development Fund for Africa and Declare that Poland wants to participate more in such assistance – in giving such a fishing dish rather than fish – than would be the result of the proportion of our GDP. And it's not just a declaration. This is what we have done in the context of our participation in the European Resilience Initiative built by the European Investment Bank.  The European Union is the greatest achievement of post-war Europe. The strategy for success for the next decades is a strategy of a renewed European contract, including in terms of prosperity and security. That is why, now, a few words about the third point that I have said, namely the socially just Union of citizens. We must not forget one more fundamental principle on which our community is based – social justice. This principle, as the guiding principle of Polish state policy, is established – and already in its initial articles – by both the Polish Constitution and the Treaty on European Union. These are not just empty words. There can be no question of the development of our societies without fighting inequality, with exclusion, with poverty. It is also in order to combat these inequalities that it is so important that we pursue an ambitious social policy. What has been achieved in Poland over the last 2.5 years shows that paradigm shift is possible and that the implementation of a tailor-made development strategy is now delivering excellent results. Today, Poland has the lowest unemployment rate in history – less than 4% according to Eurostat. Public debt fell last year for the first time in 30 years. The budget deficit is shrinking and at the same time we are running the most ambitious social policy since the victory of Solidarity and the fall of communism. At the same time, we are cutting red tape for businesses and citizens, reducing taxes, but only for small and medium-sized businesses – not for the big ones – and rebuilding effective financial policies by fighting tax fraud mafias and by effectively sealing the fiscal system. Moreover, we have created the largest public innovation support system in Central Europe. Thus, the new democratic capitalism in Polish is innovation plus solidarity. Globalisation, together with the progressive liberalisation of world trade, has become a driver of economic development and, as a whole, certainly does not deserve to be condemned, but economic growth does not translate proportionally into an increase in middle-class incomes. The answer is therefore not protectionism. Investment in human capital is the right instrument to combat inequalities. Education today is the main determinant of future earnings. The need to invest in human capital is directly linked to the second challenge we face: automation and robotics. Of course, I do not want to call for a new 'ludism' in the 21st century edition and to block innovation – on the contrary – but the fear of this technological unemployment is and this problem must be solved. This technological advance will, of course, create demand for new professions, but they will have a different character than those in the past. In almost all cases, they will require high skills. These require adequate level of education. Moreover, as a result of robotisation, the importance of capital as a means of production increases immeasurably compared to the importance of work. As a result, income from capital is evenly distributed evenly than income from work. Worldwide, the share of wages in GDP has fallen by 5-10% since the 1980s, sometimes more. As Piketty shows, wealth is already concentrated and its concentration will increase as a result of further investments. Therefore, these digital technologies have led to the creation of a winner takes all distribution model. It consists in the fact that fewer beneficiaries take over a larger part of the profit. The digital age, the platform economy have created incredible potential for monopolization. The network effect has become the dominant factor, resulting in the emergence of global giants that have no competition. The need to tackle growing inequalities in the European Union is the strongest argument in the current debate on the European Union budget. I therefore stress: we recognise the importance of new policies and challenges, but their financing should not come at the expense of cohesion policy, which is the fundamental, Treaty and essence of the European Union. Dear! Polish example, over the last 2.5 years, shows that the right strategy can change social and economic reality. The European Union can once again become a symbol of the European dream. However, this will only happen if we make the right choice, when we overcome the disputes that divide us, and we will always remember that, despite these disputes, we also share a European identity. Recently, in this Parliament too, we have heard important words about European sovereignty. So! Europe should be an entity in the world of global business. Europe should be strong to better defend our interests. However, European sovereignty cannot mean building the Union at the expense of the strength of the Member States, because the power of a sovereign Europe comes from the strength of the Member States. Weak Member States, nations living in a sense of disregard for their opinions and interests, are a recipe for a Union that will not care about anyone, which is becoming a problem, not a solution to our problems. Poland will do everything to ensure that such a scenario is not implemented. European cooperation is an important dimension for all of us to build prosperity, solidarity and security. In the words of my great compatriot John Paul II, we can find what happened at the source of a united Europe. It was he who spoke of the two lungs of Europe and the fact that both these lungs, eastern and western, are equally important for the Old Continent. Dear! The European Union is still an open book. Each of us has at least one page to save. The Union is not a finite work. Walter Hallstein, the first head of the Commission of the European Economic Community, compared the then community to a living organism that was constantly evolving and evolving in 1963 under the title \"Europe under construction\". Following this trail, we should not give in to any form of determinism that would make us see only one future of the European Union, forcing us to simply transfer competences from the national level until a super state is created. The Union is a legal and international experiment that allows us to find solutions that have not yet been available within nation states. Discussion, cooperation, coordination and negotiation are the real DNA of the European project. And on the basis of such rules, their founding fathers De Gasperi, Adenauer, Schuman and Jean Monnet formed the foundations for economic communities. Therefore, we should not engage in a kind of genetic engineering that changes the essence of the Union, but should constantly seek new methods of cooperation that will guarantee the security and development of our countries and the well-being of our societies. European integration has never been an end in itself. After all, it is intended to ensure peace, prosperity, development, democracy and justice for the peoples of Europe. The European Community is on a cusp where it must listen again to the voice of its citizens. To conclude, I would like to stress that we must hear and understand the causes of the concern in this voice of citizens, and hear the hope that these citizens in Europe still have and from which they expect security, development, respect and solidarity. They want a Europe open to citizens, giving opportunities for development for all and solidarity with the weak, a Europe united in the face of common threats and challenges, respecting the will of the peoples. The European Parliament is the best institution to understand and express this voice for the benefit of the free peoples of Europe and for the good future of the European Union. Thank you very much.

It is an honour for me to be here. Poland is a country with which I have a close affinity and I say this partly because I have some Polish roots myself. My last name is, in fact, a Latvian version of ‘Dombrovski’, a name synonymous with your country, your history and even your national anthem, Mr Morawiecki. Throughout my life and career I have always been full of admiration for Poland and its people. As Prime Minister, I made it a point to deepen our partnership, which goes back long into history. People of my age in Latvia, and right across the Baltic Sea region, grew up inspired by Polish workers, students and intellectuals who had formed the Solidarnosc movement to fight for change. It is thanks to these values, to this courage and to the determination of your people that Poland took its rightful place at the heart of the European Union. Since then, Poland has given so much to Europe. Since we are in this Chamber, it is only right to mention Bronisław Geremek, a great Polish patriot who worked tirelessly for European integration. He was both an architect of Polish freedom and a builder of Europe. I also think of Marie Skłodowska Curie, who has lent her name to one of Europe’s most successful programmes for young researchers. I could mention many more examples to show how Poland has shaped our Union, and this is why it is so important for Europe to keep its solidarity pledge to Poland. Europe has shown its solidarity in many different ways. For instance, Poland was allocated EUR 86 billion in the current EU budget for European structural and investment funds – far more than any other country. This has helped to build, for example, 13 000 km of roads and allowed more than nine million people to gain access to high-speed internet. These investments are paying off. Poland’s economy has gone from strength to strength. The Polish success story is also built on the benefits of being part of the biggest single market in the world. Every day, Polish companies trade and work with businesses right across our Union. Since 2004, Polish exports have tripled, with 80% of exports going to other EU countries. Europe will keep supporting and showing solidarity in the future. In our proposals for the next long-term budget, Poland will continue to receive the most cohesion funding, even though the total amount will be somewhat reduced, to EUR 72.7 billion, which works out at EUR 270 per person per year – more than double the EU average of EUR 120. That investment will be focused in areas where there is the biggest potential for Poland, whether it be innovation, small and medium-sized businesses or renewable energies. At the same time, Europe must also continue to make good on its promise on security and prosperity. That is why we focusing our proposals for the new Multinational Financial Framework on areas where we can achieve more together, and which are also crucial to Poland’s future. For example, we want to spend 22 times as much on defence as we currently do, with EUR 13 billion allocated to the European Defence Fund, for which Poland has been a strong advocate. This strengthens our ability to act, avoids duplicate structures and saves taxpayers’ money. At the same time, we also want to invest in our future growth. We have proposed to increase our current investments in digitalisation and networks by a factor of nine, to EUR 12 billion. We are also strengthening our currency by firmly anchoring the euro area in the EU budget. We are holding discussions with all EU Member States, not just those which have already introduced the euro, on how best to strengthen our economic and monetary union. We are using new budgetary instruments to support all countries, including those Member States on the road towards euro membership. This will be done in a fully inclusive and transparent way and I look forward to working with Poland across all these areas. Honourable Members, as we look to our future, Poland’s place should be firmly at the heart of our Union. This was the choice made by almost 80% of Poles in the referendum almost exactly 15 years ago. On that day the Polish people made a free, clear and decisive choice. They chose peace and democracy and they chose the values and fundamental rights that define our Union, as they define the people of your great country, Mr Morawiecki. At the heart of that lies respect for the rule of law. The law is our best tool to defend our freedoms, to work for social justice, to settle differences peacefully and to protect the most vulnerable in our societies. The justice system is a guarantor of our democracy and our fundamental rights. It is also what binds our Union together. As Walter Hallstein used to say: ‘The European Union is, at its heart, a community of law’. That community is the foundation of everything we have achieved and everything we still have to do together. This is why, if there is a systemic threat to the rule of law, we cannot simply turn a blind eye; we cannot simply say it is purely a national issue. So, where the separation of powers is weakened in one country, or where the independence of the judiciary is challenged in another, it becomes a European issue which affects our whole community. (Applause) This is why, through the tireless work of Frans Timmermans, the Commission has worked closely with the Polish Government to address the concerns on a number of new laws which pose a systemic threat to the rule of law. Dialogue always comes first, and dialogue has shown that progress can be made. The Prime Minister and his Government have shown willingness to amend the laws on a number of issues, for instance on the retirement age of judges. On behalf of the Commission, I thank him for his effort and his cooperation. We always remain open to dialogue but, so far, it has not been enough. I hope that last week’s hearing will lead to further changes in Polish legislation, and that we will not see 40% of the Supreme Court judges replaced. (Applause) European will never turn its back on Poland or on the Polish people. The Commission will always stand up to support them, and our hands will always be outstretched to the Polish Government. Prime Minister, the Commission counts on your leadership to continue working with us and delivering the real changes needed. Poland has shown how strong its leadership can be in our Union and in the world. We will see this again in December, when Katowice hosts the United Nations Climate Conference – COP24 as it is known. It is more important than ever for Europe to lead from the front in the fight against climate change. We are doing that by focusing on green and sustainable investment. Through our capital markets union and sustainable financial action plan we want to unlock a systemic change in investment culture so that sustainability comes first. Here again, Poland has shown that there is a way. In 2016, Poland became the first sovereign to issue a green sovereign bond. Through this leadership and climate diplomacy, Poland is helping to send a message that the Paris Agreement is here to stay, and that Europe is here to lead. Katowice is itself an example of that: it is a region historically reliant on coal and heavy industry, which is turning itself into a leader in innovation, sustainable investment and new technologies. I can think of no better priority for the future of our Union than the health of our planet and the health of our economies. Poland must be at the heart of these efforts and must stay at the heart of our future. As Marie Skłodowska Curie said, ‘Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.’ Now it is time to understand more, so we may fear less. This applies as much today as ever: it applies to Poland, Europe and our common future.

It was absolutely not Europe that brought democracy to Poland, but it was Poland that brought democracy to Europe with the first modern codified constitution in Europe in 1791. The principle of the separation of powers was included in this first constitution.  For these principles the Polish people stood really strong, even in dark times: the Second World War and during the oppression by the Soviet Union. John Paul II said in Warsaw, when standing in Victory Square in 1979, that there could be no just Europe without the independence of a democratic Poland marked on the map. More than 10 million people – a quarter of the population of Poland – were members of Solidarnosc. Together with Lech Wałęsa, they fought for freedom and democracy and they laid all the groundwork for a free and open, unified and democratic Europe. That is why we believe in a Poland that is based on the ideas of Lech Wałęsa and John Paul II. We admire what they did for Poland and for Europe.  (Applause) But today, Prime Minister, there are so many questions on the table from people all over Europe, and in your country where yesterday there were demonstrations on the streets. There are so many questions on the table: for example, the question why is state TV in Poland today more a propaganda TV and not a free, independent media anymore? Why does your Government dismiss churches because of their political opinion? You referred to Walter Hallstein. He would be very surprised to see that today nobody knows whether the President of the Supreme Court of Poland is still in office or not. We have uncertainty there. Nobody knows exactly what the situation is today.  Why did another Member State have to refer to the European Court of Justice on a court case, fearing that Polish citizens do not enjoy the right to a free and fair trial in your country? Why is this happening and why do peaceful protesters, like Władysław Frasyniuk, face imprisonment for carrying roses, while nationalists who attack peaceful protesters are not even facing trial? Those are the questions on the table.  (Applause) I think you missed an opportunity today to clarify these questions. Europe is together here. You missed an opportunity today to clarify these questions. The founder of the free and democratic Poland, Lech Wałęsa, said recently that in the 1980s there was no freedom without solidarity and today, he said, there is no freedom without the rule of law. The rule of law is in the very roots of Poland and in the hearts of the Polish people. Europe will not turn its back on the Polish people. If the Polish Government does not preserve the great Polish achievements, Europe will do so. There is another Poland. There is a Poland of the demonstrators, the people in Poland who went out onto the streets. There is a Poland which welcomes 18 million tourists, who enjoy the freedom of movement, tourists who admire Poland and the culture of your great country. There is a Poland which welcomes 4 000 NATO soldiers with the idea of protecting our European Union together. There is another Poland, and sometimes I wonder myself whether you speak here as a PiS Government or whether you speak here as a Polish Prime Minister? Do you really have this second Poland in mind? I also want to welcome some of these NGOs here on the Tribune. They were invited by Michał Boni, so my thanks to him for that. Having all this in mind, you talk about sovereignty. I want to ask you whether, when we talk about sovereignty and winning back sovereignty, is then the anti—EU atmosphere which has been created in Poland – in a way saying that Brussels is the new Moscow – is this really creating an atmosphere of sovereignty for Poland? When you talk about the content, and I completely agree with a few of the things – a Marshall Plan for Africa, and so on – and when you talk, for example, about taxation and about the initiatives you want to take on this, do you really think that your approach of an EU of the nations is really something which can work?  When you have the unanimous vote in the taxation field in mind, we see that in the Council a lot of initiatives – good initiatives – are blocked because there is always one single Member State blocking everything, on taxation and so on. Do you really think that such a Europe will work? I tell you that when you talk about the EU of 4.0, a new Europe, which listens to the citizens, there is already a Europe which is listening to the citizens and that is this Chamber, the European Parliament. We represent the citizens of the European Union.  (Applause)  We don’t need another Europe. I think our Europe is already working very well. Yesterday, the Bulgarian Presidency was present here. Boyko Borissov, a colleague of yours, was present and gave us an overview of what we have achieved together in the last six months in the interests of the citizens of the European Union. Again, in the Council meetings last week, we experienced that the nation states can no longer find a common ground to go further. That is why I strongly believe that the European Union, which was founded by Adenauer – you referred to this – and which is based on the institutions at European level, this Europe works, and the Europe of egoism and nationalism cannot deliver in the interests of the people of the European Union.  (Applause) Let me say a final word. I want to conclude with a personal remark. Prime Minister, because of your PiS governmental propaganda, I never took the floor here in this House when we spoke about Poland, because I was afraid that my German background could be misused to attack my friends in Poland and others who are fighting there for the rule of law and freedom; that it could be used as, ‘the Germans are telling us’. We have sometimes experienced this in Poland: ‘the Germans are telling us’. I was afraid to take the floor here, and I want to tell you that I am not speaking here as a German Member of the European Parliament. I am speaking here because 219 colleagues voted for me as group leader of this Group. I want to fight for the interests of the citizens of the European Union. That is what we have to do, not to decide between good and bad Europeans. Let’s discuss the future of this continent. Let’s stick together. Let’s not be divided anymore. That would be a great message if we were to hear this from a Polish Prime Minister.

Mr Prime Minister, you said that we started from different places in recent European history. Yes, this is true. You quoted Pope Jean Paul II: ‘the eastern lung, the western lung’. Yes, I can very much identify with this picture. I would add that we are still one body and we need both the eastern part and the western part. But the question on the table today is: what is the Polish contribution to the eastern lung functioning well?  Today, the President of the Constitutional Court in Poland, Judge Małgorzata Gersdorf, went back to work. I sent her the greetings of the European Parliament and I sent her the greetings of Europe, because she is obviously paying tribute to the Polish Constitution.  (Applause) She is obviously full of this democratic enlightenment you were talking about. Today, as yesterday, people in Warsaw have massively taken to the streets to express their right to freedom. They are obviously full of this freedom gene you were talking about. This is important. We want to see a healthy Poland contributing to this eastern lung, and we are waiting for you to give answers to the questions expressed by colleagues, expressed by the Commission, expressed especially by our friend Frans Timmermans, whom we fully support.  On a lot of issues you rightly raised questions where we can fully agree – the future of Europe; questions on industrial politics, on the future of cohesion, talking about cultural diversity, security politics, energy security – and rightly so. But why is it necessary to raise these questions and at the same time undermine the European values on which our new project of the European Union is based? You cannot do that at the same time as raising questions on the future and appealing to the unity of the West, which is a values-based unity, and at the same time hope that we can collaborate in the best interests of our citizens. No. Poland has to come back to the centre of the European Union and you have to contribute to our values and to their development in the best interests of our citizens.  Herr Premierminister! Lassen Sie mich dennoch auch an dieser Stelle etwas sagen als jemand, der ein deutscher Sozialdemokrat ist. Wie der Kollege Weber bin ich gewählt von den Freundinnen und Freunden hier in meiner sozialdemokratischen Fraktion als der Sprecher dieser sozialdemokratischen Fraktion, als der Vorsitzende. Sie haben keine Vorstellung davon, wie dicht die Zukunft der polnischen Gesellschaft, wie dicht die Zukunft der Bürgerinnen und Bürger Polens nicht nur uns deutschen Sozialdemokraten, sondern allen Kolleginnen und Kollegen in meiner Fraktion am Herzen liegt – den polnischen Freunden, den deutschen Freunden, aber auch allen anderen aus meiner Delegation. Wir wollen Polen in der Mitte Europas haben! Wir wollen, dass Sie Ihren Beitrag leisten, aber zerstören Sie nicht die demokratische Kultur in Ihrem Land, und kommen Sie zurück an den Tisch, um unsere Werte gemeinsam weiterzuentwickeln: die Rechte der Frau, die Rechte der Minderheiten, die Rechte der Menschen in Ihrer Gesellschaft! Dann werden wir Sie willkommen heißen als jemanden, der uns hilft, die Zukunft zu bauen.

The title of your speech, Prime Minister, was ‘The Future of Europe’ but apparently no one is interested in the future of Europe here. They are indulging in their favourite pastime, which is Poland-bashing. You could just as well have recited Shakespeare sonnets and you would have had exactly the same effect. You can see how it is difficult to get through with arguments, because there is a thick wall of lies, half-lies, half-truths, mystifications – like this ridiculous story about arresting a man for carrying roses. It just boggles the mind when you hear something like it. Every day we have to deal with such idiotic stories that are absolutely groundless. This also shows that this Chamber is, as I have said before, completely resistant to listening to arguments. You never hear counterarguments. You hear heckling, booing and mud-slinging. That’s the usual reaction. There is what I would call a very deep refusal to know, here in this Chamber. I can continue, making a more general point. You were talking, Prime Minister, about a democratic awakening in Europe. Yes, there is a democratic awakening. At the same time, there is an increasing number of people who say that the European Union is going in the wrong direction. It’s over 40% now – in some countries above 50%. I have come here and I have listened to self-indulgent and self-serving comments – ‘We are so good’, ‘We are so responsive to citizens’. So are all these people insane? Are they all being fooled by some demagogues? No! The reaction of these people is the final effect of what is being said and done here. This arrogance, this self-serving arrogance, is simply becoming more and more unacceptable. So, yes, when I hear about the separation of powers in Poland, the problem of the separation of powers, I think: ‘Come on!’ Here we have a Commissioner, a Commissioner who is representative of the executive body, and the Commissioner is telling the Polish Parliament and the Polish courts what to do with this and that law, or how this law should be changed. Is that an example of the separation of powers? It is a blatant violation of the separation of powers. (Reaction to off-mike comments by Mr Verhofstadt) You see! That’s debate, European Parliament style. I suggest, Mr President, that you start putting order in your own house. Yesterday, we were prevented from having an exhibition on Jósef Pilsudski, one of the founders of Polish independence. That is censorship – and not for the first time. There is a well-established practice of censorship in this Parliament and you seem to be quite serene about it. You do not really care because this censorship serves the interest of the majority. People are being punished here. Fortunately, recently the Court reversed the decision of the European Parliament. But that continues. So I suggest, before the finger-pointing at Poland starts, this House should be made more open, please, and a more receptive place for all points of view to be debated and considered. That is my request. I know it has no chance whatsoever, but I just had to say it.

I have spoken about Poland in this plenary so many times that today I am going concentrate more on the future of the European Union. Yesterday, Mr Morawiecki, in a debate with your compatriot Donald Tusk, I said that more and more people are realising that, when we talk about the future of the European Union, a new world order is emerging. In this new world order, Europe is on its own more and more. Let’s recognise that. There is Putin, who is on a warpath; there is the Chinese leader who has nominated himself as emperor for life; and there is Trump, who is openly questioning the transatlantic relationship and, by doing so – let us recognise it, and I think you can also recognise it – is putting the security of the European continent at risk. That is the main reason – and although you didn’t go into that proposal, I think you can agree with it – why we need a European Defence Community, as soon as possible. And let there be no misunderstanding, Prime Minister, we need it not as a body to compete with NATO but as a European pillar of NATO, to strengthen NATO, and also to give Europeans the possibility of acting on their own. However, we should know that the European Defence Community means much more than being in favour of simply pooling a number of military budgets, a number of tanks or a number of aircraft. A European Defence Community is primarily about defending European territory and defending European interests with European lives. That means that a European defence community, as such, can only work on one condition, namely that we share the same European values, the same European democratic principles, the same rule of law, and the same rules of the game that are fundamental in our society. Only then can such a defence community work in the future and defend our interests. So the future of the European Union, Prime Minister – and this is my message to you – is more than an internal market, more than a single currency, and more even than the free movement of people. Let me put it very bluntly: it is a community of values, and I have to tell you openly that putting judges under political control plays no part in these values. You have to know that. (Applause) That is not a question of tradition, if I may say so. I like traditions, but it is not a question of tradition. It is a question of principles and of our common community. Prime Minister, do not misunderstand me: reform of the judiciary is certainly a legitimate goal, but forcing judges to retire and delivering them to the will and the whim of the governing majority can never be part of such a reform. Over the past three years, the Polish Government has systematically liquidated democratic checks and balances. It was not this Parliament but rather the Venice Commission which said, loudly and clearly, that your reforms – and I am now quoting the Venice Commission, of which Poland is a part – ‘bore a striking resemblance with the institutions which existed in the Soviet Union and its satellites’. I think that what they said sums it all up.  So, instead of what is happening now – rejecting two infringement procedures, ignoring the verdicts of the European Court of Justice – I use this occasion, Prime Minister, to appeal to you personally. You were a youngster who engaged with Solidarnosc. You were part of the team which directly negotiated the accession of Poland to the European Union. So I ask you personally: turn the wheel, and bring Poland back into the family of democratic nations, away from the illusion of so—called ‘illiberal states’, and bring Poland back into the centre of European politics again, instead of letting it linger at the fringes. This dream of an ‘Intermarium’, the 12 central and eastern European countries from the Baltic to the Black Sea working together, is a mirage. It is an illusion. Even, Germany, Prime Minister, is a small nation today, although many Germans may not recognise it. In a world of empires – Russia, China – it is only together that we can do it, and I have to tell you it is a big mistake to think we can divide our Union into regional clusters. To conclude, I believe that division in Europe – as is now to some extent the case, let’s be honest – is welcomed by only one man, one autocrat, Vladimir Putin. Poland knows better than any other country what the fate of our continent is if the Tsar of Russia or the Comrade in the Soviet Union is running the game in Europe. Don’t play it.

I want to stress that the Verts/ALE Group and I share the criticism on the rule of law that you have heard from almost all the Groups. You can see that Parliament is pretty united on that issue and I don’t think it’s going to change. You might say you do not care what other people think about you. But I think you should care. It has been mentioned by the Commissioner already how important Poland is in Europe, and also how important Europe is for Poland, Poland being one of the biggest Member States in the EU. Polish people have a very positive image of the EU and actually trust European institutions more than they trust the Polish Government. The EU contribution to Poland’s economy, in terms of many euros going every year to farmers, organisations and businesses, has been mentioned. Many Polish citizens work elsewhere in the European Union. In fact, Poland has actually the highest number of migrants to other EU countries. You mentioned Brexit, Prime Minister, which will hit Poland hard, and you mentioned Russia. That’s why you should care. But also, we care. The whole of Europe has much to thank Poland for. Poland was the first country on our continent with a modern constitution. You practically invented the division of powers, and that is actually then a Polish tradition – the separation of powers. Poland also has a long tradition of civil movements for freedom and democracy, from resistance against the German occupation to the Solidarnosc movement, which was the first opposition movement to participate in free elections in a Soviet-bloc nation since the 1940s. That is a tradition to be proud of. It gave hope to so many people all over Europe. Poland could be a shining example of democracy and the rule of law, but your Government, Prime Minister, is taking Poland away from the path of democracy and civil rights. You undermine the independence of courts, you put judges into retirement, you put judges under increasing political pressure, and you put people into prison who you think are not following your ideas. You try to control political discourse and threaten the freedom of the media. The rule of law and democracy are crucial for the future of Poland and they are also crucial for the future of Europe. They are at the very heart of our Union. Therefore, as the European Union all together, we have to respond clearly and strongly to what is happening in Poland. We Greens fully support the Article 7 procedure and we are also very grateful to the Commission for starting an infringement procedure in order to stop the Supreme Court Act. People wanted to join the EU, and still want to be part of it, because they believe in the rule of law. They believe in democracy. They believe in good governance. People in Poland are protesting against the dismissal of judges; they are standing up for women’s rights. There are people marching against corruption in Europe. They carry the blue flag of the European Union because they believe that the European Union is the body that can help and support them, the body that will stand up for them. We are proud of the people taking to the streets to stand up for their rights, their democracy and their rule of law. Those people are Poland too. Furthermore, they are Europe too. We need to support them because the rule of law and democracy really is the cornerstone of the European promise in Poland, as elsewhere in Europe, and it is something that we, as MEPs, have to deliver on. It is the promise of the EU and we have to deliver on that. That is why we, as Greens, and also we in the whole Parliament, will never give up on these issues – especially since you keep adding new ones, like changing the law for the European Parliament elections, making it practically impossible for any smaller parties to enter the European Union. The future of Europe really is in your hands, too, as is the future of the planet, in Katowice: unfortunately you did not even mention in your speech the very important conference taking place there. You could actually bring something to that, namely the idea that the transition for climate protection also needs to be fair, that social rights need to be protected as well. Why don’t you bring that to the table? Then you could really be a forerunner on climate change, aiming to protect all of our planet, in Katowice and beyond. You would even find allies in this House. On many issues, such as Brexit, the rights of Polish workers abroad, even Nord Stream, and social cohesion, you would find many allies. But if you want cooperation, Prime Minister, then you have to stick to the basic rules of this Community, a Community that so many of your compatriots have worked so hard to build and to join: and that means the rule of law and democracy. You will have to deliver on that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Tania GONZÁLEZ PEÑAS", "mepid": "127330", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, Mr Morawiecki, from your speech it would seem that you are living a reality and your country is living a very different one.  In this House we have adopted by a large majority several Resolutions that warn them of the flagrant breach of Article 2 of the Founding Treaty, because their ultra-conservative, xenophobic and sexist government is adopting reforms that annihilate democracy and freedoms in their country. Amnesty International reminds us that his government remains committed to controlling the judiciary, the right of assembly, the functioning of NGOs, freedom of the media, sexual and reproductive rights or the right to asylum.  You are generating the breeding ground for social conflict, which you then try to tackle with the same recipe: a law against freedom of assembly, which is leading hundreds of people to face criminal sanctions for participating in peaceful —yes, peaceful— meetings and defending human rights.  A new anti-abortion law was debated in Poland on Monday, which will further limit access to a legal and safe abortion: a project involving depriving women of medical care to have abortions, even in the event of severe foetal malformation, when official statistics show that 96% of legal abortions are performed for these reasons. Massive demonstrations during black fridays managed to park this reform in 2016 and, on Monday, women have once again demonstrated their strength and determination.  You can't keep playing with women's lives, Mr Morawiecki: listen to them, though maybe the church bells won't let you hear.  And if we talk about the right to asylum, you refused to participate in the 2016 relocation plan; make summary refunds to Belarus which the European Court of Human Rights orders them to cease. Yesterday, the European Commission opened infringement proceedings for non-compliance with the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union for their reforms of the judiciary.  Is this what you want for your country, Mr. Prime Minister? Do you want to go down in history as the prime minister who ended the division of powers, with freedom of expression, with freedom of manifestation, with the rights of women, refugees and LGTBI people?  We live times of double standards, double truth and double accounting, said the writer Vázquez Montalbán. Poland is now a very clear example of this: the european institutions themselves, relentless against Greece for asking for a restructuring of its public debt, are allowing xenophobic governments to continue to cut democratic freedoms.  From this group we stand in solidarity with all those who fight in Poland for democratic, civil and sexual freedoms and call on the Commission to apply real and effective sanctions that contribute to a rectification of government authoritarianism, because we believe in one Europe — another Europe, yes — where, contrary to what happens today, economic policy can be discussed and freely debated, but the most basic human rights are unquestionable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Mr Legutko, I probably did not quite understand the interpretation during your speech, but the substance as to the objectivity of my behaviour and parliament's behaviour is certain.

In order to understand the future, we need to look a bit at the past. From 1949 onwards, there were two models in Europe. On the western side of the Iron Curtain we had the model of the Anglo-Saxon USA western liberal democracy where peace was kept by NATO, and on the eastern side, where you had the misfortune to be, you had the communist tyranny model. Now the Germans lost the shooting war but they did not lose their ambitions.  Nazi Germany left us a legacy. Back in I think it was 1942 when the Germans thought that they were going to win the war, they wrote a plan for how they were going to govern their new empire, and it was called the ‘Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft’, the ‘European economic community’. They were going to have interest rates linked to the Reichsmark. They were going to have a common agricultural policy, a common industrial policy, a common policy for everything.  That plan resurfaced in 1957 as the European Economic Community, and Mr Dombrovskis naively mentioned Walter Hallstein, the first President of the European Commission, who was a lawyer who had happily worked for the Nazis. How have things progressed since? Of course, communism collapsed in the East, thank God, and your countries eventually asserted their freedom. In the West what happened? The Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft progressed into a plan for a United States of Europe.  Where is Europe heading? There are two Europes. There is the Europe that is part of the European Union and there is the Europe that isn’t. Let’s talk about all of it. Those parts of the European Union, where are they heading? They are heading towards a United States of Europe. We see increased integration in everything. We’ve heard about this defence community – I think that’s called an army, isn’t it Mr Verhofstadt, I believe in other countries – we see full economic, political and financial governance being aspired to. The European Union now governs almost every aspect of the citizen’s life. Mr Morawiecki, you mentioned the freedom gene. Well that is very strong in the British and that reasserted itself in 2016 in the vote to leave the European Union. The British people voted to reassert their freedom and their independence. Sadly, that project has not yet been realised. The British people chose freedom over domination in an undemocratic European Union.  Now Poland, you’ve been a member of the European Union for the last 14 years and it was entirely understandable why you joined, along with the other eastern European countries. After languishing under communist tyranny for decades, you needed the financial subsidies from the European Union and you wanted the opportunities for your younger people to be able to work abroad, earn money and improve their lives. All of those things are understandable.  But now things are looking up for Poland. Your economy is picking up and you have personally invited many Poles to come back from their migration abroad and rebuild your economy. But you have discovered that there’s a price to pay for European Union membership: the EU requires you to accept migrants in untold numbers, which would change your country and your culture beyond recognition, as indeed it has already in many parts of Europe.  Not surprisingly, you and your government are opposing that forced acceptance of irregular migrants and refugees, but you’ve been threatened by the EU. If you do not take the migrants then you cannot have the money, and you have found that when you have outside interference in your country from such as multi-billionaire George Soros, who seeks to interfere in your nation’s life, as he does in mine, then the EU tells you that you cannot oppose him. You have learned that if you sell your soul, eventually someone will come to claim it. You can have the rule of law, but you cannot have the rule of your own law. You can only have the rule of this—place law.  You will see in Poland, I believe, in the course of time that it was a wise decision that the British people made to leave. I would ask you that, as we came to your assistance in 1939, you in the Council come to our assistance. Please help us out with the utterly useless and incompetent Mrs May. Please help to facilitate our exit from the European Union in the Council, and return the favour that we did you in 1939.

When I analyse the last three years of the polish government and parliament, I am tormented by ambivalent feelings. On the one hand, I see that the current government is increasing taxes instead of reducing it. To win electoral votes, he does not hesitate to take one to buy the other. I see that it deprives Poles of personal freedom, giving countless special services increasing powers of surveillance and force. After all, laws such as the Anti-Terrorism Act or the Agricultural Land Act would have been called Bolsheviks 10 years ago. One allows without the consent of the court to eavesdrop on anyone, block bank accounts and websites. It allows, whenever the authority wants, to close everyone for a long time without the possibility of defense, even without giving a reason for embedding. The second prohibits the majority of citizens from selling and buying land without the consent of the authorities. Does it not refer to communist times the current obligation to enter in the register the data of anyone who bought even a minimum amount of gold? I also see that you want to Polish the battleground of the Americans and Russians. By the way, I do not understand this approach, to create an enemy from Russia instead of a friend in the East. Less so. Meanwhile, America is no longer the same as it was 30 years ago, and Russia is not the same. What else did you preach before the election.  But on the other hand, I know that the aim of this European Union is to crush all resistance to the power of the European Commission and to force the citizens of the Union to obey ruthlessly. Hence the bluntness of patriotism, because countries where there is patriotism are hard to enslave. Hence the struggle with family ties, because where there is parental love, the power of officials disappears there. Hence the fight against Christianity, because according to these future rulers of Europe, this is competition for the government of souls. Hence, agreeing to flood Europe with crowds of Muslim immigrants, because if people in Europe are afraid, it will be easier for them to take away their freedom and govern them. This is why this terror of political correctness, the promotion of homosexuality, medding in the internal affairs of other countries. That is why I am wholeheartedly in favour of your government and the Polish Parliament's actions, which are against the Union's plan. I therefore have an extremely important question for the Prime Minister. The European Commission has now prepared a directive on copyright in the digital market. This directive will forever close the mouths of internet users. It will close access to the world's internet. It will give enormous power to the European Commission. The directive will leave citizens of the European Union with only one source of knowledge about the world controlled by the European Commission and national governments – paper newspapers, television and several online portals. I ask the Prime Minister to make a clear statement, not a vague cliché like 'we want there to be as little freedom as possible', and so on. Specifically. If Articles 11 and 13 remain unchanged in this directive, will your Government support the directive in the Council or block it?

Everyone is engaged in a rather rude \"bingeing\" of the Polish government in the absence of any knowledge and competence to do so. An example of total dilettutation is Mr Verhofstadt, who speaks without any knowledge of it. But you have introduced us to such a Union. It was Law and Justice that urged Poles, deceived them, and they benefited greatly from European subsidies. It has introduced us to such a Union that it now still wants to write it into the Constitution even. You put us against a wall and let yourself crawl in front of EU MPs or bureaucrats. The vision of Europe is already decided. Germany and France want one country, one army, one budget, and we either sign up for it or we don't. These are the facts.

Thank you very much here for your votes, thank you very much for this repeated reminder of Solidarity and the fact that Solidarity was so crucial for the overthrow of communism. Indeed, I was an activist of Solidarity and I can say that at that time, as a young boy, I experienced very different moments. For example, I do not know if you know that judges of martial law – judges in the 1980s – sentenced my comrades in arms to ten years in prison. A woman, my colleague from the underground – Ewa Kubasiewicz, and many others were sentenced to many years in prison. Some of my colleagues were murdered, many of them were in prison for a very long time. Did you know that these judges of martial law, some of them, those who delivered heinous sentences during martial law, are today in this Supreme Court, sometimes defended by you? Did you know that, Mr Bullmann? Did you know that? There are several judges of martial law who are still there today, so the mention of Solidarity must also include such a reflection that this post-communism has not been overcome with us and we are fighting this post-communism precisely through justice reform. Several people have also mentioned the European Defence Fund and its complementarity with NATO. Thank you very much here to Mr Verhofstadt, who has just developed this thread. Here I fully agree and this is very important for the future of Europe. I was very happy that, with the representative of a group that is theoretically quite far from us politically, including the extremely important dimension of security, complementarity of our activities in PESCO, in the EDF (European Defence Fund), in relation to NATO, we are talking about cohesion, about complementarity. We also look at it very similarly. I would just like to refer to the thought that Mr Verhofstadt also said – I think we are in Poland and in Central Europe badly received. The Tri-Sea Initiative is not intended to compete with the European Union. It is also a complementary initiative, because it is very difficult for many of our partners, friends from Western Europe, to understand our Polish Central European reality, because you were very lucky that you did not live fifty years in communism. You were lucky enough to be on the good side of the Iron Curtain. Unfortunately, life looked very different with us, and the transformation after 1989 assumed that the Communists had entered a new system with a properly dry foot. Therefore, we, looking at the different political dimensions, are trying to throw off this yoke of post-communism. The Tri-Sea is part of the European Union's support in the sense that we want to develop the North-South corridors. Today, Europe is much more built around the East-West corridors, while this potential – Scandinavia, Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, czech republic, Slovakia, Romania and south to Greece – is much less exploited due to the lack of gas, energy, rail and road infrastructure. This is mainly the case with the Tri-Sea Initiative – I think it complements what Mr Verhofstadt said. At the same time, you also referred to the retirement age. Did you know that here – a few hundred metres from here – the European Court of Human Rights introduced in 1998 exactly the same early retirement rule for judges as we are now introducing? That rule was then fully accepted. Today we are doing exactly what we do in many other countries – we are not doing anything else. You also mentioned the Russian danger in a few voices. Thank you for these voices, because although we want to cooperate with Russia, it is not with aggressive Russia – not Russia, which is conquering more countries, which is attacking more countries that are attacking the countries of Europe – the whole of Europe, because that is what we have seen in recent statements by various countries, including western Europe, so pointing to these threats, Nord Stream II, we are not only relying on Eastern European or Central European solidarity, but we warn against threats , which may also exist in western Europe. In our opinion, this is extremely important. Mr Verhofstadt said that \"judges are under political control.\" The judges are much more independent today than they were before, and I will show that to you. Well, when is the judge more independent? When can the president of the court order a judge? When can he choose a judge for a particular case? When can it move between chambers? No – then it has indirect pressure mechanisms. That was the situation before. Did you know that in earlier times one of the judges of the key district courts was ready for the Prime Minister's phone call? It was a journalistic provocation to pick a judge on the Prime Minister's phone in a particular case, and it was the case for the biggest fraud - amber gold's pyramid scheme. Whether you know that this judge was ready to do so then? Today it is impossible – we have strengthened judicial independence, we have strengthened objectivity. Not only that, Vice-President Timmermans acknowledges this. Mr Timmermans acknowledges that the ban on moving judges between chambers, which we have introduced since 1 January this year, also increases judicial independence, increases the objectivity of judgments, increases the fairness of these judgments. Dear Sir, before you speak, look a little deeper – I ask you very much – what is the truth, what is the reality of the rule of law, because judges are more independent today, and the tripartite power. I would also like to thank you very much for this reminder of the Constitution of 3 May, the first constitution on the European continent. This is indeed a big deal and the rights of the women that have just been mentioned here are also very respected with us. Poland is one of the first countries to introduce women's democratic rights in Europe. You also mentioned the media. Are there no free media, the vast majority of which – 80 to 90 percent – present a critical or highly critical view of the situation before power and in view of today's reality? Does this mean that the media is in any way threatened about their freedom? Ladies and gentlemen, the media in Poland are overwhelmingly critical of the government and we absolutely agree with that. We understand that this is the case, albeit very biased the other way around. If you looked at it up close, under the magnifying glass, you'd see it. Does the opposition have any restrictions on access to the media? Do journalists have any restrictions on the selection of topics? Nothing like this is the case, and before we came to power, we had an unprecedented raid by the special services on newspaper editors, including the requisitioning of materials in newspaper editorials. Did you know that? Did this High House say anything when the previous government did? I have the impression that the High House is biased in this regard by the fact that you may not like one government, one government, and others like it. Why didn't you look at what the Polish authorities were doing at the time? This is the reality: one of the leading newspapers, famous for its objectivity but critical of the power of the time, was taken away from the editorial team and granted, through indirect actions, to one of the oligarchs. That is, Poland has moved towards oligarchy in this regard, dear country. At the time, the media was actually almost 100 percent hijacked by one political option. Should freedom of the media be about this? Today, the limits of the judge's work are determined only by professionalism and conscience, but this was certainly not the case before. Our changes have led us to recover EUR 10 billion from the hands of the mafia. You should appreciate this – it is also money that belongs to the Budget of the European Union. Poland is a proud country. Please do not instruct us on such matters. We know very well how to manage our institutions, and because we have changed our approach to tax institutions, we have the best economic situation in 30 years – the lowest deficit, the lowest public debt, the lowest unemployment, one of the highest GDP growth, great economic success – and all this with huge support for our social programmes, huge solidarity support for these social groups. As for the eradication of poverty, we should all be proud of it. Did you know that our government has eliminated extreme child and youth poverty by almost 100 percent – poverty eradicated by 95 percent. No one was interested in it before. We have allocated this money plucked from the hands of the mafia for social purposes. At the same time, this supports our economy, which is something that you would also look at on this side of the political scene – socialists, greens and so on – would be very supportive. I encourage you to look at what our economic model looks like. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your excellent work Democracy in Poland has never been as alive as it is today. Civil rights are implemented without hindrance, the media are more diverse and pluralised than they used to be. You can say this with certainty – if you look at it, you will see that it is. We are a proud nation and we know best how much freedom costs. Here you have emphasised and thank you for that. We fought for our freedom and yours, we were the first to put a dam on German barbarism during the Second World War and thus save the continent from even greater genocide. We also do not forget our neighbours in the East. We are against closure, there has been less talk of this, but we are very supportive of the process of integration of the Balkans into the European Union, in order to complete as if the whole continent had been integrated. Strength is precisely diversity. We acknowledge our european heritage in its entirety. Our contribution to security is not only about spending highly on defence policy, it is also the Eastern Partnership. I call for us to understand our point of view better, to be able to respect each other. Think about how it is that a huge part of the media, 80-90 percent, is against us. A huge part of business, big corporations, western and home, is against us, a huge part of the European Parliament is probably against us too, and yet we still have such support in a country that far exceeds any support for another party. Maybe there is something deeper in our politics, solidarity on the one hand, and fair on the other hand, seeking to recover those taxes that (a word inable) in the days of our predecessors, also because of poor justice? Did you know that in the days of our predecessors, two judges – a judge of the Supreme Court and a judge of the Supreme Administrative Court – made an appointment with each other about the judgment? You didn't say anything at the time that it was unacceptable. Now to the Commission, Valdis is a friend of mine, with whom I have talked many times on a number of economic and macroeconomic issues, and we agree – monetary union, banking union, the financial crisis are topics that we have discussed many times and we speak virtually the same language in many fields. It is also worth highlighting what the European Commission is saying positive about us: this very positive type of economic growth, the high quality of economic growth with a decreasing deficit and increased tax efficiency. Thank you very much that President Dombrovskis said that we have done a lot for dialogue. I do not know if you have caught it, because we have actually focused on dialogue and have done a lot for dialogue. But I have to think out loud about whether the Commission is this honest broker, as you say, or whether it is this honest broker, because I expected that in a situation of such polarisation as it was in Poland – as it is in Poland, it is true – the Commission will be an honest broker. But I have doubts as to whether this is the case, because, despite the enormous efforts on our side to meet, to implement, for example, those measures which have been strongly suggested by the Commission as to the ordinary courts, and to make a promise that the application to the European Court of Justice will be withdrawn, this has not happened. And did you know that with us the National Council for the Judiciary was elected by a three-fifths majority? Show me a better democratic mandate, where the National Council for the Judiciary is elected by such a majority. From the outset, too, our government and I, as Prime Minister, have tried to have a dialogue with the Commission – I was looking for a compromise. Today I must say that we have come to a point where, having made some changes, we want to reform the justice system so that it is a better justice system for Poland, but also for the European Union as a whole, because weakness is best defined by the numerous shortcomings, imperfections that I have conveyed in our dialogue to President Timmermans and Mr Juncker – they know very well what we have here. Dear! Transatlantic relations were also mentioned here. They are very crucial and I would like to say two more words about them and, finally, about migrants. In the context of transatlantic relations, it is very important to restrained some of the anti-Americanism that is alive in Europe, and for this alliance between Europe and the United States to continue, because I find it difficult to imagine a more viable security guarantor – not only in eastern Europe vis-à-vis Russia, but also in the Middle East – than NATO and we are very supportive of the transatlantic alliance. But perhaps some of you will be surprised – I, too, am most in favour of strengthening Europe – the European Union – as an independent defence force. Only for this we would have to spend 3, maybe up to 4 percent of GDP on defence policy. Meanwhile, Poland is one of the few NATO countries to meet this goal, spending 2 percent. It was also only under our governments that we changed the methodology for calculating. Previously, it had not fulfilled that objective. It is also money taken away from tax criminals and VAT mafias, which we have set up to defend Europe. However, as long as there is no such spending on defence policy, this alliance with the United States is very important and it is not just an anti-American attitude. This is also an anti-European attitude taken by all those who want to subdue the transatlantic alliance. It is an attitude that pleases, as someone here said \"tsar\", Putin, only Russia enjoys. Let us not go down this path! Dear! Thank you also for stirring up the migration thread. We recognise that it is necessary to help migrants and refugees in their countries of origin as much as possible. I do not know if you know that Poland puts four times more to the funds than our weight in the EU's GDP – to funds such as the European Resilience Initiative or the European Fund for Africa. But it will declare more – we are ready to double this support to countries abroad if there is a similar contribution from other Member States, because it is important to protect the external borders, but also external support, also support through external hotspots – after all, this is an idea that we discussed at the last European Council. We support external hotspots as part of the refugee action, we believe that this must be done. But when it comes to migration, about accepting refugees, also point out that we are weakening some African countries or the Middle East in this way, because the brightest, most enterprising people often leave. By absorbing them into Europe, we are also weakening our ability to reform the economies of those countries, and yet we do not want that. Poland most supports the development of these countries there on the spot. Dear! To sum up this part of our discussion, thank you very much for the voices that have died here. Mr Verhofstadt, in particular, has raised a number of issues relating to the true future of Europe, because we want to play a very positive part in the future of Europe in the areas of defence, innovation and migration. However, it is not good if proud nations are istructed by others, because then there is indeed polarization and clinching, there is a short circuit. We therefore call, on the one hand, for this dialogue that we are conducting – unfortunately, here we have failed a little on the commission's basis. I ask you to compare to those orders of the Member States on the basis of which our reforms were introduced, because what we have done is nothing more than the introduction of solutions that actually exist in western Europe. I stress very strongly that Poland is today a country of economic success thanks to the new socio-economic model that we have adopted, by sealing the tax system and at the same time by opening up to new channels of cooperation, including in terms of innovation, trade, exports-imports, which is europe's strength, and that is what we want to offer Europe, to be a constructive Member State. I think that, contrary to appearances, contrary to the various estrities that are present today, in these coming times, when it occurs – all the time, because we see the earth tremble in the context of national elections – we want to help stabilise the situation, we do not want to be in a position of success with this European boat, because I very much believe that Europe has a future, has great value, but we must respect our national differences, our national experiences and our national successes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "   – Mr President, we cannot have a debate about the future of Europe without reaffirming our founding principles, and we need to reiterate that if the rule of law is under threat anywhere, then it is under threat everywhere.

Because whatever the EU looks like in the future, and whatever the scenario, you cannot be a fit and proper EU member and undermine the judiciary at the same time.

Let me start by commenting on the latter, because it is a very interesting aspect of defending the rule of law in one of the Members of Parliament, the High House, defending the high pensions of the special communist services, those services that murdered Polish heroes and who also murdered people I knew. This is precisely the difference between part of our opposition today and us, that we want to change those rules, and that is why we have reduced pensions for special communist service agents and raised pensions for Solidarity activists. That's the difference. And we are certainly not going to change that, Mr Euro- We're certainly not going to change that.  Dear! On values, we are on one side, but it is certainly not possible to dictate to the Member States the conditions of the rule of law. The systems are very different and the differences of these systems need to be taken into account. This is also why justice and home affairs are the exclusive competence of the Member States. This is not part of the acquis communautaire within the meaning of EU competence. I therefore answer this question as to whether Poland will respect the judgments of the Court: of course Poland respects the judgments of the Court. Today we have 50 judgments of the Court across the European Union that have not been implemented. Poland has no problem with this. But at the same time, it should be pointed out that there are EU competences, that is, transferred from the Member States to the whole Community, and there are national competences, national competences. And justice is definitely a national competence. Dear! The European Parliament rightly wants to be at the centre of the debate on the European Union, but many of you are unnecessarily reducing the dimension of this debate to matters that fall precisely within the competence of the Member States. We are therefore losing the opportunity to play a key role in the debate. And if we do not lose quite, then at least in part, because the key elements are precisely those that you and I have been talking about here, that is, the single market and the harmonisation of economic rules, where this makes sense above all else. I points to two areas in conclusion: the freedom to provide services, which can increase the competitiveness of the european Union as a whole, and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Because the great ones are doing well, but there will be no support among the middle class. There will be no support for the idea of integration unless there is support among small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Jáuregui Atondo asked rhetorically whether we should address issues such as sealing the VAT system and tax havens together or separately. Dear European, I am signing up to this with both hands. After the great successes that our government has achieved over two and a half years in sealing taxes, which has allowed us to eradicate child poverty and pursue a proud pro-social policy in order to take the next step, we must act together. Poland calls on every European Council, including the one held a week ago, to work together to win against terrorism, with terrorists, with VAT mafias, with tax criminals and with tax avoidance, that is, with tax havens. We are most in favour.  There were also voices broadly referring to the euro area. Here, ladies and gentlemen, many questions hang in the air. And economists from all sides are wondering whether the euro area solves problems or creates problems. We are waiting for different banking systems, different financial systems to deal with their problems, and we are trying, where we can, to help. But today – i just specialized in optimal currency areas – I can say: it makes sense to create a single currency between countries that are at a relative level of macro- and micro-economic convergence. Poland and Central Europe are catching up with Western Europe because after World War II we were left on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. Dear! I will mention these three things once again in the summary. For the future Europe to be great and strong, we need Europe 4.0, that is, the European Union at the fore of the technological revolution, the industrial revolution, the digital revolution. We are working closely with the European Commission here. This is a very important part of the agenda and the future of the common market. Secondly, a safe Union. And thank you for all these voices here in so many places. I didn't expect us to say so unisono. And that is a very good sign both in the context of Nordstream II and the transatlantic agenda, in the fight against protectionism, but also in the common defence policy. This is a positive signal for me for the future. But there is also a third aspect: the Citizens' Union, a socially sensitive Union that supports its citizens and defends them against the power of global corporations. And this is the reflection: when, 100 years ago, the great corporations have mastered national markets, then we have created national antitrust institutions, antitrust offices. Today there are global monopolies and we do not have global antitrust offices. That is why Poland supports the digital tax that the French President has talked about and the fight against tax havens, and it is precisely the fight for a fair distribution of income that will cause the European middle class, which, after all, consists of the middle classes in the various nation states, to believe again in the idea of Europe, the idea of a great Europe, and the proud peoples of Europe will continue to be able to build this future of Europe in changed configurations, in a revised arrangement. I firmly believe this. Thank you very much for all these voices, including those critical. I think that some of you, at least some of you, have convinced you that we have the right to reform our tax systems, our justice system, our internal affairs. These are the competences of the Member States. In this way, we are strengthening one of the key Member States of the European Union and will be able to make an even better, stronger contribution to building a europe that is strong, innovative and solidarity-based.

Poland and the European Union need each other.\" Poland has been co-creating the history of our continent for over a thousand years, and for many years it has also been doing so within the European Union, to which it belongs as a country. Poland has a measurable impact on Europe's security policy, both military and economic. As a country, we are part of NATO and operate actively in its structures, where, as one of the few Member States, we fulfil our financial commitments to common defence. Our efforts to ensure the security of the EU's eastern border are becoming particularly important at a time of growing migration crisis. Frontex has Polish headquarters in the Capital of Poland, which oversees the security of the Community's borders. Examples of fruitful cooperation could still be cited for a long time, but I would like to conclude my statement in this way: only joint action will ensure that we develop harmoniously, without discriminating against any member state because of other beliefs, values, or even voter decisions that do not fit into the great political coalitions that have taken place in Europe so far.

Angola is an important country in Africa and strengthening ties with the African continent is a priority for the European Parliament.

The European Council conclusions adopted last week reflect this approach, calling for increased exchanges and contact with Africa. President Lourenço, in September 2017 you became Angola’s first new president in 38 years. Your election greatly contributed to the democratic process in the country. The reforms you have pushed for are contributing to revitalising Angola’s economy by attracting foreign investment, enhancing private-sector competitiveness, reducing dependence on the oil industry, corruption and inequality, and improving citizens’ rights. Structural changes, however, remain to be accomplished. Poverty and unemployment rank top of the list, as does the lack of diversification of the economy. The EU stands ready to support Angola in tackling these challenges. Through stronger economic diplomacy and by drawing up an investment plan for Africa, we can help you develop a manufacturing base via our transfer of technology and know-how, as well as improving social infrastructures. Trade is another area in which we can do more. In this respect, I invite Angola to join the Economic Partnership Agreement that exists between the EU and six countries of the region. Beyond the economy, Angola can play a strong role in the region. I welcome the efforts made and the openness towards refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen, Angola has experienced for decades a situation of armed conflict that has caused the death of thousands of people and the almost complete destruction of its infrastructure, a situation that would only end with the signing of the peace agreements on April 4, 2002. The achievement of peace and national reconciliation has led to the promoting a wide-ranging campaign of construction and reconstruction and the start of a new stage of reforms in all areas of political, economic and social life, with visible gains in the lives of citizens. Although this process has been heavily affected by the international economic-financial crisis and the lower price of oil on the international market, this did not prevent the normal functioning of democratic institutions, the exercise of justice and the affirmation of citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms.  Today, when the country is experiencing a natural phase of political transition, the Angolan executive remains committed to deepening the democratic process and improving the conditions that allow a favorable environment for the diversity of opinions, freedom of expression and, in general, respect for the fundamental rights of citizens. Since 2008, the Republic of Angola has held periodic, free, fair and transparent elections, held by different parties and coalitions of parties, with a view to legitimizing power, electing the President of the Republic, deputies to the National Assembly and the formation of the government executive.  We have a national assembly, with a total of 220 Deputies distributed between four political parties and a coalition of parties, according to the results of the August 2017 elections. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen, before my investiture as President of the Republic on 26 September 2017, I have sought to implement policies that directly benefit the people, in consultation with all the political and social actors of the nation. The executive I direct has focused his attention on the implementation of macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal consolidation programmes, with a view to reducing the effects of inflation and normalising the foreign exchange market.  Although there is a decrease in the weight of the oil sector in the national economy, this reduction is not enough to overcome existing imbalances and is not yet reflected in the diversification of the economy and a structural change in state exports and revenues. In recent years, a great effort has been made for national reconstruction, and a great deal of resources have been invested in infrastructure and social works, even though there is insufficient to meet the needs of companies and populations with regard to energy, water, schools and hospitals, for example.  We therefore count on the European Union as an important partner that can help us overcome the constraints we still encounter to put the Angolan economy at the service of the development, progress and well-being of its people. Ladies and gentlemen, in the context of the moralisation of society, the creation of a better business environment and greater attention to foreign private investment, we have made a real crusade against corruption and impunity throughout society, with emphasis on so-called 'white collar crimes', the positive results of which we will soon begin to feel and benefit from. At the same time, a number of other measures have been adopted, such as the recent adoption by the Angolan Parliament of the new competition, which aims to prevent and penalise the actions of economic operators who do not comply with competition rules; the approval of the private investment law that has become more attractive to the investor in general and, in particular, to the foreign investor. There, where it was still possible, billion-dollar contracts were cancelled for the construction and management of important public infrastructure, such as the port of Barra do Dande, because the most elementary principles of transparency and competition were not respected. A call for tenders for new mobile phone licences and the privatization of Angola Telecom's capital was privatized in part. Studies take place for privatization in a transparent tender or on the stock exchange of some public companies from different sectors, including oil. A few days ago the council of ministers approved the new model of commercialization of diamonds that ends with the so-called preferred customers, in other words privileged, who had a monopoly of the business to the detriment of the producing companies and even the concessionaire itself, Endiama. We believe that, with this measure, we will soon see the return of large multinational companies in the sector, both of the producers and of trade and diamond cutting. In the same context of the moralization of society, combating corruption and impunity, criminal proceedings against those citizens who, presumably, will have harmed the state in hundreds of millions of US dollars, take place in the competent courts of justice. Let's wait for its outcome. It was also passed the law of repatriation of capital that aims to make the voluntary repatriation by its holders of the large financial resources, real fortunes, which a restricted group of Angolan citizens holds in tax havens or other banks around the world. It was our intention to give them the possibility to bring these resources voluntarily to the country and with them make investments in our economy, create wealth, create jobs, thus contributing to the strengthening of the national economy. This window that opened will be for an exact period of six months, which expires at the end of this year, after which the State will have all the freedom and legitimacy to use all the legal instruments at its disposal not only to locate and recover all these resources that are of the Angolan people but also to bring to the bars of justice their responsible. We have been signing bilateral visa-free agreements on ordinary passports and, in general, measures have been taken to facilitate and speed up the visa process for almost all countries, for investors, tourists or simply citizens who want to visit Angola for other reasons. Believe that Angola has become, in recent months, a country more open to the world and, therefore, more friend of investment, more open to tourism. Angola is open to foreign private investment virtually in all branches of the economy, agriculture and livestock, fisheries, hospitality and tourism, manufacturing and construction materials, the refining and distribution of oil and natural gas derivatives, the construction and operationalization of road, railway and port infrastructure, as well as the production, distribution and management of electricity and water. Ladies and gentlemen, with a view to solving the main social problems of citizens, such as access to clean water, electricity, collection and treatment of solid waste, public transport, school, primary health care and others, only possible in the framework of ever closer governance of the citizen, through bodies elected by them, are being prepared for 2020 the first municipal elections , to be carried out gradually, in order to progressively provide the various municipalities with financial, patrimonial and administrative autonomy. Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen, Africa is today experiencing a climate of internal conflict, insecurity, economic and financial crisis, terrorism, hunger and poverty and, as a consequence, has known successive waves of emigration towards the nearest continent, the European continent.  This is a situation that embarrasses us all. It is sad and revolting to note that, about six centuries after the children of Africa were taken in degrading conditions on slave ships to the Americas where, as slaves, they contributed to the flowering of great economies, today the saga is repeated, albeit at a different juncture.  The children of Africa are going to Europe today as immigrants, some will say that on a voluntary basis, which is debatable. To be frank, they flee the armed conflicts, hunger and misery that plague some of our countries. They are fleeing unemployment and the lack of prospects for a better future. All we are responsible for this framework that many African countries are facing. It is in this conformity that we call on the European Union to establish with our continent a model of cooperation that, in the medium and long term, can contribute to reversing the current framework, which will help our countries to move from mere exporters of raw materials to producers of manufactured, industrialised products, as a guarantee of greater job supply and business opportunities for our citizens.  We believe that this will be in everyone's interest, that Africa and Europe only have to gain from an Africa capable of retaining its children on the continent, through a greater offer of employment and better living conditions overall. It is not a mere dream, but something that can become a reality if we always discuss it equally, without complexes of any kind, with realism and pragmatism. Ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as acting president of the SADEC policy, defence and security cooperation body, we have been working on initiatives to support the efforts of SADEC, SIAC and CIRGL in the peaceful resolution of the problems affecting some countries in the region, with emphasis on the DRC, the Central African Republic, South Sudan. , Lesotho and, lately, also Madagascar. We work together with the sub-regional organizations cited and also with the African Union and the United Nations, always respecting the national sovereignty of each State, as well as the norms of international law. As regards cooperation between the European Union and the African continent, last year we held the fifth summit, at which issues of peace and security, good governance, democracy, human rights, migration and citizens' mobility, investment and trade, capacity building and job creation were discussed. The common African position is the need to change the paradigm of the model of cooperation established under the Cotonou Agreements between the European Union and the group of countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. I will end by reiterating my thanks for the hospitality, cordial welcome and attention given by members.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Thank you, Mr President, as you will have noticed from the reaction of the House, your words are of great importance, because they underline how much more can be done in relations between Europe and Africa.

Greece’s third programme is drawing to a successful close. The Greek people and all euro area citizens are finally able to turn the page. This is the right time to assess what Greece and the euro area countries have achieved together during the last eight years. It is also an opportunity to cast a glance at the near future. First and foremost, I would like to pay tribute to the Greek people. The positive results of the last programme are to their credit. (Applause) These should now have a lasting effect on growth and would not have been possible without the extraordinary sacrifices made by the Greek citizens, without the country’s tremendous efforts to rebalance and modernise its economy.  The Eurogroup has also contributed to the successful outcome. Over the years, Greece’s European partners have provided time and money. Time for Greece to redress its fundamentals; the time that every reform process requires. Over EUR 250 billion in loans when no one else was willing to lend. This was unprecedented solidarity that will benefit Greece for many decades. Today Greece is ready to stand on its own feet again and with the sound foundations for sustainable balance and inclusive growth.  The agreement reached at the June Eurogroup is key for Greece to achieve that goal. I will walk you through the details of the agreement, but before that, let me briefly mention where we have come from. I am well aware of today’s time constraints, so to borrow a reference from Greece’s history and cultural heritage, I promise to be more Spartan than Delphic. Greece has been on the agenda of the Eurogroup for the last eight years. Back in 2010, the country was facing formidable adjustment challenges which required a deep reform process. Public finances had to be put on a sound footing, competitiveness needed restoring, the economy had to be made more open and modernised and the negative spill—overs of all this to the financial sector needed to be addressed. These were long and difficult years. We all would have liked a few things to have gone differently. Yet today, Greece is set for a successful exit from the third ESM programme. 20 August 2018 is a date to mark in our calendar; a date to celebrate. During the programme, Greece adopted over 450 policy actions across a vast array of areas. Of course, implementation takes time, and we need to be resilient. Patience, though often in short supply, is critical but reforms are indeed paying off. Economic growth has been back in positive territory. Since last year, the economy grew by 1.4% in 2017, and is expected to increase 1.9% this year. The outlook – according to the latest forecasts – is bright and in line with the euro area average. The results have been particularly impressive on the fiscal side. Today, Greece’s budget is running a solid primary surplus, above 4% for two consecutive years, and has been made more sustainable through ambitious taxation and patient reforms. Importantly, the social safety net is being revamped to better protect vulnerable groups. The country’s competitiveness has been improving, with a positive effect on the labour market. That means faster job creation and falling unemployment. Greece’s business cycle is now more aligned with the euro area economy and this is great news. Against this positive backdrop, the financial sector is more and more resilient. All these are encouraging signs that will help Greece to regain investor confidence. It has already successfully raised funds from bond markets on several occasions. The income—passing agreement of euro area finance ministers of 22 June will improve market sentiment even further, as already seen on the secondary market. The recent agreement on debt relief is the last of several improvements in Greece’s lending terms since 2012. Thanks to these favourable landing conditions, Greece saves money every year. In 2017 alone, it saved EUR 12 billion in debt service payments, or 6.7% of the country’s GDP, according to the European civility mechanism estimates. These benefits represent no cost for the European tax payer; on the contrary, we all gain from a stable and growing economy across our common currency area. Back in 2012, private creditors did agree to take a hit to the tune of 53% on their holdings of Greek debt. This was a unique feature of the second assistance programme. Already in the ESM programme, we had agreed short term debt measures that reduced the debt to GDP ratio by 25% in 2016. In the last Eurogroup, we agreed to an even more substantial package of measures to make Greece’s debt sustainable. This includes an extension of the bulk of the loans by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and a deferral of interest by an additional ten years. In other words, until 2033, Greece will have less interest and have the motivation to burden its budget and this means more fiscal leeway to support its economy and its citizens. In addition to that reprofiling, the Eurogroup last month agreed to resume transferring to Greece the profits made by the euro system on its holdings of Greek government bonds. This will take the form of semi—annual payments in December and in June until 2022. These payments give a positive incentive for Greece to continue implementing reforms in the coming years. It is time to continue the process of reforms that is now fully owned by Greece. This process must prove resilient over forthcoming political and economic cycles, and we must never forget that. The final tranche of the European stability mechanism to Greece was another element of this package. We agreed that EUR 15 billion will be disbursed after the national parliaments in a number of Member States have had their say, and this can happen as soon as next week. Out of this amount of EUR 15 billion, EUR 9.5 billion will be dedicated to a cash buffer, which should also reassure investors as it will act as Greece’s fiscal backstop. The remaining EUR 5.5 billion will be disbursed in 2020 to a segregated account and should be used to cover Greece’s debt servicing needs. At the end of the programme, the overall size of the cash buffer in Greece will be EUR 24.1 billion, which is a very large amount that covers Greece’s financing needs for around 22 months after the exit from the programme on 20 August. This is a longer safety net than in any other country’s programme so far.  So, it is now up to Greece to build on the programme’s success and to consolidate its achievements. Greece should continue implementing responsible fiscal policies and growth—enacting reforms to improve the living conditions and the chances and prospects of its citizens. This is what Greece’s post—programme framework will be about. We all agree that for the next couple of years, the so—called enhanced surveillance by the European Commission will help Greece stay the course. Commissioner Moscovici will be able to tell you more about that in a minute. But let me be clear, being out of the programme means Greece being out of the programme. Greece should commit to the requirements to participate in the euro just like any other country in the euro, but in this safe framework the government has an obligation to provide policy options to its citizens and to debate them internally. That is indeed a good thing for democracy. I am confident that Greece will look at its policy options and be able to improve on existing reforms to promote stability and political compromise – stability to spur investment, compromise in the name of future generations. This will require action on several fronts: prudent fiscal policy based on primary surpluses and sound management of public finance, financial sector governance and handling of non—performing loans, an efficient and effective social safety net, flexible and open labour and product markets and – also very importantly – modern public administration, just to name a few. For this purpose the Greek Government presented a growth model which is based on the continuation of reforms. These will help Greece to continuously lift its productivity capacity and offer a solid anchor for confidence amongst foreign investors and Greek citizens. Market volatility some weeks ago has shown that Greece remains vulnerable to risks. New policy options should take this into account. It is very important that Greece continues to take ownership and implement its ambitious long—term growth strategy. I am encouraged to find that the Greek authorities see it that way too, and I welcome the policy commitments they have announced to the Eurogroup.  Confidence in Greece’s future is the key message I wanted to convey to you. I would now very much like to hear your views on this matter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "   Member of the Commission.

After eight long, interminable years, Greece is finally preparing to return to the path of normality and autonomy. I spent two days in Athens yesterday and the day before yesterday, and I could see how powerful this aspiration for restored freedom was among the Greek authorities and, I am sure, among the Greek people as well.  This is a historic moment for this country and, as Mario Centeno said - that is the phrase I heard for two days in every mouth - \"a page is turning\" and we must take the measure of this moment. Not to regard it as an end in itself, not to regard it as a perfection, but to be aware of the very great importance of what is happening. It is also an important moment for the euro area, which has proved, through this crisis, its robustness and resilience, and today we can say, with the conclusion of the assistance programmes for Greece, that the economic crisis that has hit us so violently is indeed behind us and that the eurozone, like Greece, is emerging from it. , I think, stronger and with greater potential. We now have until August 20, and August 20 is the official date of the release of the program, to prepare together the transition and the future of the country in serenity. I am aware, as all of you here, that the last few years have been trying for the Greek people, and especially for the middle class and for the most vulnerable. I know that millions of Greeks have lived and are still living hard this long recession, successive reforms and austerity even though, as I had the opportunity to say yesterday in the Greek Parliament, make no mistake, it is not austerity that caused the crisis, it is because there was a crisis that measures and reforms were needed.  Everyone in Greece has gone through their own tragedy or tragedy, either by losing their jobs overnight, by seeing their pension go down, or by watching, helplessly, their children leave the country in pursuit of a better future they could not find at home. I hope you will believe me when I tell you that we are always thinking about the consequences of our decisions for the Greek people in the Eurogroup, where I have been sitting for more than six years now. The European Commission has always been an ally of citizens in defending their interests. Not the ally of this or that government, but the ally of the Greek people to oppose, as best as possible, the proponents of blind austerity, and above all to oppose all those who were willing to throw Greece out of the eurozone so as not to have to show a little solidarity towards a partner. During those six years, which I went through first as France's finance minister, then as European Commissioner, I remember two summers, those of 2012 and 2015, when we each time came close to the 'Grexit' which I am sure would have been a disaster, both for Greece and for the euro area. I am proud that we have managed to avoid this Grexit disaster scenario because, beyond the consequences I mentioned, it carried, in my opinion, a risk of an irretrievable fracture of Europe betraying its founding values.  For the Greek people, I also want to congratulate myself that we have been able to integrate a social dimension into this programme, in particular the third. It is certainly timid, to be confirmed and amplified, but we have managed to put in place: universal health coverage - almost two million Greeks now have full access to care, which was not the case before - and an income of social solidarity, from which more than 600,000 Greeks have already benefited. In the face of adversity, I want to say my admiration for the Greek people who have always maintained their European will, their willingness to remain in the euro area and for that I would like to pay tribute to you, European elected representatives, for their courage which has been very important during these years. As Mario Centeno said, in exchange for EUR 241 billion in loans from the Europeans, because we are still talking about this, Greece, as we know, has embarked on an unprecedented process of structural reforms. Never, it can be said, in the history of our Union has a country - and it must be said that it needed it - reformed as quickly and deeply as Greece. In the last three years alone, the Greeks have implemented 450 priority actions that have begun to profoundly transform the country. What has Greece achieved in deciding on reforms? In a word, a lot. I know this is a controversial subject and I could see how lively the debate was yesterday in Athens, but I will still give some concrete examples. First, Greece has embarked on a major tax reform. Income tax is now fairer, more efficient by broadening the tax base and lowering the minimum tax threshold. At the same time, a land registry, yes a land registry is finally being set up - it has been in existence in France for 200 years - which will facilitate the collection of taxes and what constitutes an effective mechanism to combat fraud or tax evasion and, finally, revenues are beginning to arrive in the Greek public treasury. We know that this was one of the endemic evils of the country. A major pension reform has been adopted and is being implemented. Not only does it restore the viability of the pension system, but it also introduces unified rules for all, which I believe will make the system fairer. To stabilise the Greek banking system, various tools have been put in place to improve the reduction of non-performing loans. We are not at the end, it is a problem that affects the whole of Europe, but the governance of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, as well as that of systemic banks, has been considerably strengthened.  Eight years later, these efforts, these reforms, these sacrifices are beginning to bear fruit. I will not put too much emphasis on the numbers, but Greece is well on the road to economic recovery. All indicators confirm this positive trend: stronger growth (1.4% in 2017, and a forecast of more than 2.3% in 2019), a very dramatic fiscal performance (remember that there is a surplus of 0.8% in 2017, while Greece in 2009 had a deficit of 15%, the largest in all of Europe!), a gradual reduction , although still too slow, unemployment (20% today, up from 27% a few years ago).  Progress is there but efforts must be continued, reforms must be completed so that the Greek people can benefit from the progress made and see their situation improve. This is the whole Agreement of the Eurogroup that Mario Centeno has just presented. I will not go into detail because he has just done so, but I want to emphasize the benefits of the agreement. Why is this a good deal? Quite simply, because the agreement reached on debt reduction lives up to our respective ambitions and Greece's needs. It provides Greece with sufficient leeway to continue to meet the many economic challenges it still faces, while providing - and this was important - a necessary guarantee to partners, investors and markets, who are waiting for Greece's return now. The elements contained in this agreement will first reduce the level of public debt considerably. We expect a fall below the symbolic 100% of GDP mark at the end of the process. The arrangements in the agreement will generate up to 1.2 billion euros each year. Very concretely, this means that Greece will not pay interest on its loans until 2033. This is fifteen years of respite to invest and to invest. This is the challenge for Greece, for the authorities of today and for those of tomorrow, to put growth at the heart of future political choices. It is also an additional fifteen years to try - and must do so - to build a better social future and create social justice for future generations. This must be one of the priorities, I believe, of the Greek governments to come, because, as I said, and we all know, the people are still suffering. Beyond that, the only one, and I say the only strategy for the sustainable and effective reduction of Greek debt, is growth.  That is the whole philosophy of the 22 June agreement: to give Greece a breath of fresh air so that it can return to growth in a sustainable way and put an end to the infernal spiral of debt. I call, of course, for the responsibility of the Greek authorities to transform the trial. It is a question of implementing the progress made in recent years, because there is still work to be done. However, it is the Greeks, who can pursue prudent and balanced policies, who will produce positive results for, once again, the Greek people and their middle class. But let me be clear, I insist on responsibility, I insist on freedom - and this is very important for Greece - but Greece will not do its job alone. Europe and the Commission will stand with the Greek people along the way.  Greece is now regaining its rightful place in the eurozone and the normalization of its status means that it will have to respect its rights and duties. Like any other Member State, Greece will have to follow the European budgetary obligations of the Growth Stability Pact and be a responsible partner in this monitoring process. It will have to present a draft budget for 2019 as part of the normal European Semester as part of the European Semester on 15 October. I was talking about it yesterday with Alexis Tsipras and Euclid Tsakalotos.  As the Greek crisis has been much longer than in any other country, as the debt remains much higher than in any country, we have chosen together to apply enhanced supervision at the end of the programme. We will ensure that the reforms that were agreed under the last programme are carried out in a good way. Firstly, because Greece has committed to it in return for an additional payment of 15 billion euros, but mainly because they are necessary for the modernization of the Greek economy and administration. I am thinking, for example, of the finalisation of the land registry for 2021. We will also remain particularly vigilant, with the European Stability Mechanism, to the debt reduction trajectory which still severely handicaps the Greek economy. But - and I will end with this - I want to emphasize one last point, namely enhanced surveillance. Contrary to what I heard in Athens yesterday, by some politicians, who should measure their words - because the policy does not allow everything, does not allow to go against the truth - no, enhanced surveillance is not a fourth programme, it provides a framework to support the completion and implementation of the reforms that are under way. It is in the context of the European Semester that the dialogue with Greece will now be established and I can assure you that the monitoring missions will not be there to be judges, prosecutors or professors, but rather wise and benevolent advisers so that we can succeed together. Yes, that is what we are talking about, and there is no question of a fourth program. To say otherwise is simply a lie. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express one last time my admiration for the Greek people, for their strength, for their dignity in these painful moments and for the confidence I have in the Greek authorities to pursue reforms in the coming years, otherwise the sacrifices and efforts made will have been in vain. I am sure that will not be the case, I think we have learned and that we will learn together from these eight painful years, from which we are once again coming out stronger.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 87, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Manolis KEFALOGIANNIS", "mepid": "125068", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, I am sorry, but I have to say this: we have entered the election period for good. The day before yesterday in Athens, Mr. Moscovici did not behave as European Union officials, he behaved more as the Socialist Party's candidate for the European Commission, claiming Mr. Juncker's position. I do not know why he has untenablely adopted the government's narrative of a clear exit from the memorandums, as he told us today.  Instead, Mr. Tsipras has pledged new onerous measures for years to come: cutting pensions from 2019, tax-free reduction from 2020, increase in insurance contributions to professionals and farmers, surplus of 3.5% by 2022 and 2.2% by 2060 – only OPEC countries, due to oil, can achieve such results – mortgages of state property for the next 25 billion years , and a super fund that will be in charge by 2115, still for 99 years. Mr President, in August the third unnecessary memorandum was completed, which cost the Greek people a great deal because of the wrong policy of Mr Tsipras's left-wing government. Now – and I disagree with Mr Moscovici – Greece is facing a fourth covert memorandum. Tell me, isn't it a memorandum when it includes measures of 5.1 billion euros for the next few years and raises the bill to 14.5 billion euros, almost 10% of Greece's Gross National Product? So there is no celebration, much more triumphalism. What is needed are reforms and investments in Greece.

(Applause from certain quarters) But let me come back to the programme. The agreement reached by the Eurogroup on the conclusion of the third European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme and the additional debt relief is a milestone in the process of returning Greece to sustainable growth and to autonomy. It is a great success for the Greek people, who can finally turn the page after many years of hardship and sacrifices, and for the whole of Europe, which, after many mistakes, has proved that it can ensure the integrity of the euro area. I would like to congratulate the Greek Government, the Greek people, the Eurogroup and its President, Commissioner Moscovici, the ESM and the European Central Bank for their positive engagement in this process. Let me also give a special mention to Declan Costello, who has done excellent work on the ground. Greece is now exiting the financial assistance programme with an impressive track record of reforms implemented and with an ambitious and socially balanced growth strategy that has to be pursued, and which we should all support with complementary policy actions at EU level in order to further Greek growth potential, employment and social cohesion. Together with the reforms, the significant debt relief – in particular with the cash buffer, the upfront deferral of European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) interest and amortisation until 2033, and the binding commitment to additional measures if needed – now makes the Greek public debt sustainable. It should allow Greece to regain full access to financial markets. In this context, while it is important to continue ensuring fiscal sustainability, I regret that the IMF – the IMF, not the Commission – has imposed clearly unnecessary additional fiscal measures in relation to pensions and personal income tax for 2019-2020. This shows why it is important to reform the ESM and, while the outperformance of the primary balance would fortunately allow those measures to be fully offset with the tax and spending package, I think it would be wise to allow Greece to redefine the timing and the nature of such a relevant reallocation of resources. Finally, we have been closely monitoring the programme. We will do the same with the Enhanced Surveillance framework, ensuring its fairness and ensuring what has been clearly said: it is not a programme. Greece has entered the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, with all its flexibility provisions.

As far as this programme is concerned, it was a major failure. We have driven Greece into an economic disaster. We must make it quite clear that Greece's debt ratio was around 140% in relation to the debt ratio in 2010. Then Greece got a huge debt relief of 107 billion euros – far larger than Argentina's sovereign default, far larger than any sovereign default before. And today the debt level is higher – at 180%! Income in Greece has fallen by almost 25%. For years, the Greeks have been forgoing 25% of their income – not voluntarily, as the word waiver suggests, but forced by the adjustment measures that we have imposed on them. Government revenues in Greece have not increased. The entire adjustment of the government deficit has only come together on the expenditure side, because all sorts of government expenditure swelled. But the Greek state budget has not succeeded in generating more revenue! Non-performing loans in Greek banks have risen. Greek banks are shaky and unstable. The entire Greek economic system is based only on a good economic situation at the moment. That is why we have a mealike growth of 1.4%, while the Greek neighbours Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey have 4% or 7% real growth. Greece has the red lantern, including in terms of export growth. All neighbouring countries are growing more strongly in terms of their exports than Greece is doing. Greece is currently benefiting from a certain economic tailwind, but that is all!

Delayed payments regulation is a case where the Greek economy would have big dividends to avoid future generation of non-performing loans when the next crisis comes.

Mr President, eight years: it has been eight years since Greece was placed under financial assistance by the European Union. Officially, the country is now coming out of the assistance plan, growth is back, tourism is picking up, the trade balance is in balance, everything is fine, except that for us, these eight years seem like a scandalous mess. Greece's socialist and conservative parties have, for decades, allowed public deficits to slip, notably by failing to collect taxes from their privileged clientele. Nor have they tried to modernize the country's economy. Their responsibility for the disaster is overwhelming. But they were not alone, because if Greece was able to take on debt beyond reasonable, it is because banks, not just Greeks, far from it, have lent to Greece beyond reasonable. And it is ultimately the people of the country who find themselves paying the price for this double irresponsibility. From the outset, successive assistance plans were the sole objective of protecting the financial interests of creditors, i.e. those banks. Once again, European taxpayers have flown to their rescue. Worse, the remedy inflicted on the country is economic nonsense. Greece is expected to generate a substantial primary surplus in the coming decades, which even the International Monetary Fund considers totally impossible. This denial of reality by European creditors has very direct consequences. The Greek people are suffering, they are dying. The suicide rate has increased by 35% in the country since 2008, 20% of Greeks are in extreme poverty and more than 400,000 Greeks have left the country for lack of prospect. The desperation of the population is such that even the neo-Nazi far right has returned to Parliament. Meanwhile, the country's endemic ills - underinvestment, clientelism and fiscal laxity towards the richest - remain. So what should have been done? First, to make lenders bear their share of the responsibility by cancelling, as the IMF intended, a substantial portion of their receivables. Secondly, Mr Moscovici, not after eight years, conditioned European aid on a fair contribution from the richest and on the establishment of a tax administration worthy of the name. The European Union should have put its investment tools at the service of the country's energy transition in order to make Greece capable of being a net exporter of electricity from renewable sources. It could also have borne the costs of taking in refugees, which we know hosts more than its fair share.

We are well aware that those EUR 270 billion loaned to Greece in exchange for spending cuts and these reforms, which are often useless for growth and harmful, have not been used to support the Greek people and to restore the Greek economy, but have served to pay previous debts to foreign creditors.  What you call the \"Greece bailout program\" was actually a giant masked bail-out of French and German private banks, heavily exposed to tens of billions of euros in Greek government bonds, to the taxpayers of eurozone countries as a whole, which in 2010 had no exposure to Greek sovereign debt. In other words, France and Germany used the Greek bail-out to spread to eurozone governments all the risks arising from the speculative system that had set up these two banking systems on Greece. Parliament should therefore tell the whole truth about the nature of this bailout and the dramatic state of the Greek economy.

Greece has suffered probably the largest privatisation programme in history: airports, ports, railways, historic real estate, tourism, gas and water companies have all ended up in the hands of private companies, mainly Germans, but also Of China, Qatar and Russia. Yet since 2010 GDP has fallen by 25%, and so has household income. Real investment has fallen by 60% from pre-crisis levels and remains depressed. Since 2010, greek citizens' pensions have suffered 13 consecutive cuts, with a total loss of up to 70% of their value. And that is not the end of it, because within the programme that you have left to Greece, there are other cuts and other measures; unemployment is still over 20%, youth unemployment is over 50%. More than 35% of the Greek population is at risk of poverty. Finally, the population also continues to decline, both because of the fall in births and because of the brain drain. In just eight years, Greece has lost 450 000 citizens who have emigrated abroad.  This is the real photograph of Greece that you should give, and I ask you: are these the results of the European Union?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Barbara KAPPEL", "mepid": "125024", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ENF Group.

A total of €274 billion in aid has flowed to Greece since 2010. In return, painful reforms had to be implemented – as we have heard several times today – in order to get the country back on a growth path. However, a primary surplus of 3.5% and economic growth of 1.8% cannot hide the fact that unemployment in Greece is still above 20%, the brain drain of young people continues and the public debt is at a daring 178%. The tax burden in Greece today is as high as in Scandinavia, while public services are at Balkan level and incomes are lower than in emerging markets. Massive income and pension cuts, while raising taxes, have dramatically weakened the middle class. Against this background, there is a risk that the Tsipras government will withdraw reforms once the austerity regime comes to an end and the government can refinance itself on the capital market after 20 August. However, this will lead to higher spreads and also more expensive financing, which will continue to weaken competitiveness.

And we have had this aid programme for eight years. The course has certainly been set in the right direction, but I would like to warn against excessive euphoria. For one thing, the whole thing will only pay off if Greece maintains the path of fiscal reason and focus on competitiveness and continues along this path. On the other hand, there are still major problems in the banking sector. A very strong indicator of this is the fact that capital controls still exist. A country that wants to return to the capital market should no longer have capital controls. This is also where the legacy of the crisis is revealed, because at the beginning of the crisis, an extremely large amount of capital was transferred from Greece abroad. During our visit last week, we were informed that more than 50% of this capital has still not been returned to Greece. This, of course, still weakens the banks' deposit base. This weak deposit base, together with the still high stock of default-prone loans on the balance sheets of Greek banks, means that Greek companies are hardly able to refinance on reasonable terms. The ECB's favourable key interest rate simply does not appeal to Greek companies. Even well-positioned, solvent companies – as I could see for myself on the ground – still get loans at an interest rate of around 5%, which is significantly higher than the average for the European Union and the euro area.

I think this is a moment to be welcomed. We were, with a delegation from Parliament, in Greece last week, and we can say that there, something has changed and, in this something that has changed, ideology may not be where we think it is. There is sometimes the impression, if not certainty, of a government perfectly in control of its ship, in responsibility, negotiating with international bodies and an opposition that continues to put oil on the fire, an opposition that prefers to see Greece have to take out a new line of credit, rather than accept an extension of maturity in Greece. On the European scene, an opposition that prefers to continue to think that it would be good to have a programme for Greece, not to trust this government, even though it has demonstrated, day after day, its ability to carry out reforms. So of course, not everything is perfect. In Greece, the issue of tax collection will have to remain a priority. It will not be necessary to redefine the conditions of taxation, but rather to continue the improvement of collection. Of course, we also need to learn from it. Greece will have to be helped to develop projects, to ensure that there is administrative capacity, to finance and to support national investment. Of course, Greece must also find a space for countercyclical fiscal policy, this is the space that the conclusions of 21 April allowed. But we also need to learn from the lessons, because we will not be able to start programs again in other countries as we did in Greece. I do not expect that to happen, but if that is to happen, we will have to be more careful about the social and economic cost of such recovery programmes.  And then, this crisis has never been a crisis only of Greece, it is also a crisis that says something about the functioning of the euro area, about the need to have a capacity to stabilize, an investment capacity.

However, as we see it today, the Greek economy is back on the path of growth and the fiscal primary balance turned into a solid surplus of 4% of GDP, which acts as a buffer and a protection against future shocks. At the same time, a number of important reforms have been implemented, including in the areas of the labour market, tax collection, sustainable pensions and bank restructuring.

Had Greece decided to leave the euro area, the implications would have been truly catastrophic: even deeper recession, higher unemployment, hyperinflation, mass bankruptcies, the collapse of the banking sector and, of course, not a single euro of assistance from the euro area. However, while celebrating the completion of the ESM programme, we have to emphasise that a lot remains to be done. The Greek economy still remains very fragile. That is why I welcome the decision by the Eurogroup to provide further support to Greece, including three important measures: the abolition of the step—up interest rate, the transfer of Securities Markets Programme (SMP) profit to Greece and, finally, a further deferral of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) repayments by 10 years.

But is it really right that we should fall into a jubilant mood? The signals seem to be green for Greece: unemployment is falling and the country does indeed have a budget surplus this year, but have the aid packages really helped?  Mr Moscovici pointed to the social measures in the third aid programme, but they were limited and youth unemployment is still sky-high at 42%. Greek debt is the highest in Europe and it will be hanging around the necks of the Greek people for years to go. You can see that the Greek hospitals are understaffed, that the equipment is out of date and that the purchasing power of the Greek population has fallen by a very large percentage.  Which brings me to my question. Wages have sometimes halved in recent years, partly because the system of sectoral collective bargaining has been broken down. Mr. Centeno, you also have experience with the Portuguese aid programme. You also both know that, even by the IMF, there is now a call for an increase in wages in Europe. So my question is: what lessons do you draw from the situation in Europe in which in Greece, but also in other programme countries, the trade unions have been sidelined, people no longer have bargaining power and ultimately are left with non-living wages?

Firstly, I would like to know why the French proposal linking the growth rate of the Greek economy to the level of the Greek State's interest obligations was abandoned. It was good because it reduced the pressure on the economy and the citizens. Secondly, I welcome the return of central banks' profits from greek bond purchases to 4 to 5 billion euros, but the amount is half of what was foreseen in the second memorandum programme and the difference of 4 to 5 billion euros is extremely valuable for the Greek economy. Thirdly, while the Greek government implemented and committed to implementing more measures than originally envisaged, Greece eventually received 24 billion euros less than the third loan programme envisaged. The difference is great and makes our lives difficult. For example, the Bank of Greece has estimated that 70% of red loans could be settled with 14 billion euros and thus make borrowers and the economy profit. Fourthly, the International Monetary Fund is not involved in financing Greek debt, sending its message to the markets. The Eurogroup, however, retains all the new pension reduction measures – which is why we are fighting politically – abolishing benefits, raising taxes – and this is a huge problem – that were linked to the presence of the International Monetary Fund.  This creates, in conjunction with the delay in the implementation of the prerequisites, a curious situation with us discussing the end of the programme and millions of Greek citizens preparing to foot the bill for the new measures and the timing of dozens of prerequisites. This creates a crisis of credibility, which is related to the European institutions, to the government and – I am not hiding it – to the political system in which it stars and the party to which I belong, because we are talking as if something extremely good is being done – there is progress, I recognise – but we seem to despise the problems of the average citizen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "   – Mr President, Mario Centeno, this agreement on Greece to which the Eurogroup has reached, under its leadership, is good news not only for Greece but for the euro zone.

Far too many believed that if you spend more money than you have, in the end you will have more money than you had. That was the road map to austerity because if you spend more money than you have, in the end, you will have no money and you will have no one loaning you the money. What we see today is an achievement for the Greek people, who should be congratulated on that, but let’s remember that it is because of the implemented reforms regarding budgets and structures that we can see these developments. Budget reforms and structural reforms that were rejected by successive governments in Greece, not least the present government, which threw the country once again into a deeper crisis than it was in before, in the belief that you could spend yourself out of the crisis. In the future, it must be the main task of the Commission to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact is respected. The way to deal with problems in the economy is about reforming and consolidating public spending. It must be learned that we can never achieve anything without ensuring that we have the competitiveness, the growth, the entrepreneurship and the investments that are needed for growth.

The responsibility always lies with the Member States, not with the EU, which financed them with loans, and not on the euro, which is a currency, but on the need for reforms.

Europe must continue to guide them in order to sustainably anchor the growth rates that the country is now showing.  Economic growth, ladies and gentlemen, and I would like to stress this seriously, must also be inclusive growth. The Greeks have had to make huge cuts, including in their pensions and in their social security. Although there were few other options from a macroeconomic point of view, we really have to acknowledge that this has been a very difficult period for ordinary Greeks. The worst part, I think, is that it is the young people, the generation that has never been able to bear the benefits, who will have to bear the heaviest burden, even in the future. On the positive side, the Greek Government seems to have its budget in order, including a primary surplus. This should allow debt to evolve to a feasible level in the long term.  I believe that getting the Greek debt ratio under control is of paramount importance. Debt restructuring should not be taboo. The debate must be held on this subject, although this can never mean a complete remission. But just as importantly, in the long term, all the promises made are actually kept.

It has been eight years, and 450 different reforms that were discussed between the Troika and Greece, and what are the conclusions that we can draw now at the end of the process? Firstly, we should do everything it takes to make sure that such a situation of crisis never ever occurs again in Greece or in any other Member State of the Union.  What do we have to do for this? Firstly, we have to make sure that our economies reform, that they become stronger, they remain competitive, they attract private investment, that we support entrepreneurs, SMEs, and of course we have to keep to our budgets in order to make sure that we can react in a situation of crisis. Crisis prevention is so important, because if we do not prevent a crisis, then if we enter into a crisis it’s always more difficult. Crisis brings misery to people, it brings poverty, it brings unemployment, it brings bankruptcy to companies, and we have to avoid this at any price. The second message which I would like to give is that we have to make sure that the sacrifices made by the people of Greece over the last eight years are not in vain. We have to make sure that the country stays on the right track, and for this reforms have to continue. We have to make sure that education is such that children in school are equipped with the right skills to be successful on the labour markets in Greece and internationally. We have to make sure that the public administration is efficient and equipped, populated with experts, not politically driven. These are things that we have to observe not only in Greece but also in many other Member States, but I think it’s important that we draw this conclusion in the end.  And one more thing I want to say. Over these eight years, we have learned that populism is never a solution. We have learned that populists don’t have solutions; they say one thing during the campaign and then we see that what they say during the campaign they either forget it afterwards or it does not work in practice.

Today, the truth is not that Greece is out of the woods, because it is not out of the woods, but it is getting better, it is getting up and recovering step by step. By concluding this program, we are creating the conditions for a lasting and powerful rebound. Greece is returning to growth, and its fiscal performance is already impressive. Unemployment is falling, of course too slowly, but it is still falling. So, having said that, there is obviously a lot of work to be done to ensure that all the Greek people finally feel the positive consequences of the efforts made in recent years. I know, on returning from Greece, that the middle class and the most vulnerable still do not feel that the crisis has passed and they are right because they are still paying in their flesh and in their lives the inheritance. We must remedy this and this is the whole philosophy of the 22 June agreement, which Mario presented to you, in which the Commission has been fully involved and in which I fully recognise myself.  I am convinced, as I have said and I will repeat, that the agreement we have reached is the best possible agreement. First, because it is balanced, it responds both to the needs and interests of the Greek people and to the concerns of the partners. It offers freedom - I stress this word again - and time for Greece, which will now be able to concentrate fully on the essentials, as has been said by many of you, with different terms, of course, namely its economic recovery, the creation of strong growth. At the same time, it provides the necessary guarantees and strengthens the confidence of investors' economic partners to ensure a smooth return of Greece to the financial markets. That is what it is about after August 20.  The various arrangements in the agreement will first have to help reduce Greece's debt, which now stands at almost 180% of GDP below 100% of GDP. It is, you will agree, an ambitious approach. There must also be additional resources to make strategic investments in job-rich sectors, in favour of competitiveness, particularly the sectors that the Greeks themselves have identified in their growth strategy. I am thinking of transport, energy, agri-food, the maritime sector, the pharmaceutical sector, sustainable tourism, a whole range of subjects on which Greece has comparative advantages to assert.  Today, that is Greece's priority, it is to make a full commitment to the return of solid growth and this is the key to its full recovery. Much remains to be done. I know this and I say again here that Greece will not take on this task alone. The Europeans and the European Commission will accompany him along the way. Our success will be collective or it will not be. We will work closely with the Greeks, as has been the case for the past eight years. We will do so in the context of the European Semester, and I know the importance of the budget meetings we have in the autumn.  As the economic crisis has hit and destabilized Greece more than any other country, our agreement, it is true, provides for the establishment of enhanced surveillance. This seems to me to be a good compromise for Greece as well as for the European Commission, but you will see that this monitoring is by no means a fourth programme. I have heard the criticism, I have heard the questions and I want to emphasize this one last time. No! No, no, enhanced surveillance is not a fourth program in disguise. It serves to preserve the momentum of reform, to strengthen credibility, which will be crucial for Greece during the period after the program. This will reassure european markets, investors and partners. It will also help to contain the internal pressures that are bound to emerge over the years to influence the responsible policies that are needed. So I was accused here, as I was in Athens yesterday, of playing I don't know what political game occupied by I don't know what ambition. What I understood, in any case, in Athens yesterday, and still today, is that it is true that elections started in the heads, but not the European elections and not for me, but the elections in Greece for some. I understood that for some, criticizing, criticizing and criticizing again was part of the game. I say this here, I do not find this attitude honest, because the Commission has been with all the Greek governments, as I have. I have worked well with Antonis Samaras, the previous Prime Minister of the New Democracy party, I have worked well with his ministers, Mr Stournaras and Mr Hardouvelis and I work well with Alexis Tsipras, I also work well with Euclid Tsakalotos. I had a little more trouble with Yanis Varoufakis, not because they are from the Syrisa party, but because I love Greece and the Commission stands with Greece. So please - I say to those who indulge in facilities - political passions are what they are, and we all experience them, but they must not lead to a discrediting of a good agreement. In doing so, we are playing against his country and me, I want to play for Europe and I want to play for and with Greece.  I think once again that this agreement is not perfect, that the situation still needs to be improved many times, but that we are really in the right direction, and I would like this Parliament in its diversity to simply recognise that. It is a question of honesty and truth, and that is what has always guided me.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 139, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "   President of the Eurogroup. – Madam President, after listening to all your interesting and well placed comments, concerns and questions, I am even more convinced that given its diversity, future success for Greece depends on the resilience that the current reform process can show across political and economic cycles. Respecting the hardship that the Greek people have experienced in the last eight years is crucial for the continuation of this reform process. And this is the only way that we can show that this is, and was, really not in vain.  Let me stress that reforms take time to mature. Reforms take time to have an effect. And this time that we need to provide this reform process with in a society is best given by its institutions. And in Europe this includes the European institutions, and of course the European Parliament. That is what our citizens expect from us. We need to make our institutions stronger. We need to make them work.  If we look back, we can conclude that we have come a long way and, indeed, as many of you stressed, not everything has been easy. In the past eight years, both Greece and the euro area had to overcome hardship. We were pushed to the limit very often. Together, however, I think I can say today that we have learned a lot. No doubt we were not fully prepared to deal with this crisis at its outset. Many things had to be tried and learned on the go. We all indeed paid a price for that, yet we managed to overcome the obstacles on our way.  Some of you mentioned concerns vis-à-vis the ongoing legal proceedings against the former president and senior staff of ELSTAT, and those are indeed a matter of serious concern. We have asked the institutions to monitor developments and report to us in the context of the post—programme framework. Of course it goes without saying that we fully respect the independence of the Greek judiciary, but this is a matter that we need to follow up.  Reforms are needed, continuing the process of reform is needed, and I am going to stress here a special role – some of you also mentioned this – for public administration reform, and we deem public administration reform for tax collection. That must continue to improve in Greece.  Over those concerns, I must say in any case – and this is my main message here today – that we have many reasons to be proud. Today, Greece joins Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain and prepares for the post-programme period. Greece is ready to turn over a new leaf and is well equipped for ensuring sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth.  It is not just Greece but also the euro that emerges stronger from this experience. Our single currency area has become more resilient and much wiser. It has several tools and solutions to withstand the next crisis, and we are working to strengthen it even more.  For those of you who expressed concerns over the success of the Greek programmes ahead of us, I would urge you to think of the Portuguese experience and of the subsequent waves of reforms that followed the exit of the programme in Portugal and that guaranteed a sustainable success for the exit. The Portuguese example is a good example for us to be aware of. To finalise, I would just like to say that we are committed to making sure that another eight such years will never be repeated again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PSE", "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was well known that Salvini represented a party with xenophobic and racist tendencies. I have no hesitation in using these words, even if they are strong, because they are amply confirmed by a number of statements we have had over the years. What we did not know was that the League would find support to govern the Five Star Movement and that it would be able to sign a government contract in which, for example, support for free daycare services for Italian families is used, in clear contradiction to Article 3 of the Constitution, which prohibits distinctions on the basis of sex. , to race, religion, etc. It was only the beginning, because this government immediately clarified who its enemies were: the different and the minorities. The different in every sense. The Minister for The Family immediately stated that there is no family other than a father and a mother, in the face of LGBT rights. Then the migrants, who have become scapegoats for all the evils of a country that instead has very deep suffering. Finally, it was the turn of the Roma and Sinti: after a few days in office Minister Salvini decides to proclaim that he will make a census, but adding, so as not to leave any doubt as to what his ethnic contempt is, that \"unfortunately the Italian ones we must keep\". Imagine the indignation! No, i don't! Or certainly not enough. The problem is precisely that, unlike perhaps what would have happened a few years ago, there has been a lack of a really strong reaction. How is such an attitude possible and where does it come from? It also comes from here, from Brussels, from the European institutions and from the Heads of Government in the Council who are not in a position to decide anything; they can't give a signal! As far as they're told, they don't even have reference values. I am talking about Hungary, France and Austria, but I could go on for quite a while. It is our reference values that we have lost, because on the modalities and technical ities to deal with any type of emergency, not only that of migration or economic, we can clash or agree: but the values, those must be clear, they must be firm and they are no longer. I turn to President Tajani – I am sorry he is not here: when the Italian Minister of the Interior spoke about the Roma census, where were you? I immediately took the initiative of writing to you, involving the other political groups as well, asking you for Parliament to reaffirm one of the founding principles of our Europe: 'United in diversity', which our lemma. The European Union was born after the tragedies of the Second World War, where millions of people died as a result of supposed diversity. Consequently, the European Parliament cannot remain motionless, astonished and silent in the face of the words of hatred that we have heard in too many quarters, certainly not only from Italy, in recent years. Do you remember, Mr Tajani, when in 2009, parliament strongly opposed a similar initiative by Maroni, also from the League? I wonder why, after so many days, you have not yet done anything, nor have you responded to a letter signed by the chairmen of four political groups in this Parliament and dozens of Members, including your group, and instead continues with statements that are more like party leaders.  Another sign of the loss of the values that should found Europe in a race to those who are most hypocritical: we sign an agreement in the Council and in less than 24 hours there are so many distinctions that we have returned to a point even before the agreement. But who do we want to make fun of? How can we then be surprised that the citizens we govern and who see us behaving in this way do not do the same?

Of course, as you will understand, it is not for the Presidency to comment on public statements made by individual ministers in Member States. Instead, I would like to build on what the Bulgarian Presidency said when you discussed the situation of the Roma at your last session. Firstly, I would like to recall that equality is a core value of the European Union and that it is a value we rigidly uphold. It is part of the European pillar of social rights jointly proclaimed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the end of last year. In our joint proclamation, we once again committed ourselves to the principle of equal treatment and opportunity, regardless of racial or ethnic origin. We also stated that equal opportunities for under-represented groups would be fostered. Allow me to add a personal note to this discussion as I am politically responsible for the Mauthausen Memorial, the former concentration camp in Austria where approximately 100 000 people were killed during the Second World War. Most of them were Jews but there were also homosexuals, people who opposed and fought against the Nazi regime and Roma and Sinti. It is essential, especially in the commemorative year which we are celebrating in Austria in 2018, to uphold this memory but it is not less important tirelessly to seek equal rights for all these groups. We all know that many Roma in Europe face deep poverty, social exclusion and racial discrimination and we know we must do more to put this right. I am sure we all agree on one thing: a Europe that protects should especially protect those who find themselves in the most vulnerable situations. In this spirit, seven years ago, the Council, the Commission and Parliament jointly called for action across Europe to improve the situation of Roma. We successfully launched an EU framework for national Roma integration strategies. As part of this drive to improve the life chances of some of our most vulnerable citizens, the Council, like Parliament, has strongly emphasised the importance of fighting discrimination and prejudice against Roma – a specific form of racism known as anti-Gypsyism. Anti-Gypsyism is a root cause of the social exclusion of Roma. I would also like to take this opportunity to recall the Council’s position on hate speech, racism and the fight against discrimination. On several occasions the Council has invited Member States to ensure the effective transposition and implementation at national level of the Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia, as well as other relevant hate crime laws, in order to counter the plague of hate crime. In addition, the Council has asked Member States to develop effective methods to report, and ensure the proper recording of, hate crimes. Moreover, the Council supports the ambitious plans of the Commission high-level group seeking to develop, with Member States, concrete practices and tools to improve responses to racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We also welcome and support the ongoing EU-level dialogue with major IT companies to address hate speech online. Last, but not least, we should remember and commend the remarkable work done by the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field, and concerning Roma in particular. Equal treatment is not just an ideal but a solid principle enshrined in European law. The Council has already adopted a directive that prohibits discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. This directive protects, inter alia, the rights of Roma, Europe’s largest ethnic minority. The framework we established in 2011 is due to expire in 2020.

This came at a time when the Roma people were facing a series of threats and pressures and, in response to the Council, I can confirm that we are now working on the evaluation of this framework, with the aim of preparing the ground for the new strategy after 2020. But back to today’s reality. It is regrettable to see that, seven years later, similar issues are re-entering public discourse in some Member States. The Commission has always made it clear that the fundamental rights of EU citizens, including free movement and non-discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, must be respected. Respect for fundamental rights is a key European achievement which both promotes and gives concrete expression to mutual understanding, openness and tolerance in European societies. While all EU citizens have the right to move and reside freely within the EU, this must be done within the conditions and limitations set out in EU law. As regards stateless persons, Member States are bound by obligations under international law. In particular, the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. However, not all the Member States of the European Union are signatories of these conventions. Under the EU Treaties, for migration and border-control purposes, stateless people are considered as third-country nationals, and expulsion of stateless persons to third countries is possible only if carried out in line with EU law as set out in the Return Directive. This directive is applicable to all third-country nationals, for instance all persons who are not EU citizens staying illegally on the territory of an EU Member State. Where challenges arise because the presence of marginalised Roma communities is placing particular strains on some localities, the Commission supports the efforts of local authorities to improve their social inclusion by promoting good practices and also, of course, the effective use of available EU funds. In its latest assessment of the implementation of Italy’s national Roma integration strategy, the Commission emphasised that addressing the issue of camps should be carried out within an integrated approach, fully respecting individual rights and freedoms, and addressing simultaneously the challenges in the areas of education, employment and health. It is evident that Member States have to be reminded of their commitment made in 2011 when the EU framework was adopted by consensus in the Council. More importantly, it must be clear that inclusion cannot be achieved by denying people’s fundamental rights and violating human dignity. The Commission condemns all manifestations of racism and xenophobia, as these phenomena are incompatible with the values and principles on which the European Union is based. Statements associating anti-social behaviour or criminality with people of a certain ethnic origin or nationality are stigmatising and totally unacceptable. They fuel racism and xenophobia, they can contribute to the spread of intolerance in society and they are therefore very damaging. Public authorities must distance themselves from, and actively rebut, such discourses targeting Roma, and proactively fight against racist and xenophobic behaviour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 149, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, let me start by firmly condemning every act, speech, intention – direct or indirect – that negatively addresses my people, the Roma, and every discriminatory practice against them. In the era of fake news, we can never be 100% sure what is reality and what is overreaction or misinterpreted, so I contacted Mr Salvini’s cabinet, with the help of colleagues here in the Chamber, to learn the real plans so that I could help the Italian Government to make Roma integration in Italy a reality instead of an utter failure. According to the latest news, Mr Salvini downplayed his comments, arguing that the intention of the census proposal was to examine how European funds were being used and investigate life in the camps. The EU Roma strategy, as you said, was initiated by Parliament and endorsed by the Hungarian Presidency in 2011. It was designed significantly and swiftly to improve the situation of the Roma, but there is a lot to do and this debate can speed it up. In this regard, if the latest news in this case is true, Mr Salvini is partly right. There is an acute need to examine whether the European funds that were used for the situation of the Roma have effected change or not, for better or worse. Nowadays, every fifth European citizen is poor: more than 100 million. The next workers’ generation will come from these poor families. Less than 7% are Roma and 5% to 10% have a migrant background and came in the last 30 years. So what can be done? With this report that you are talking about, Ms Jourová, that the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is preparing, you can make history and big changes. Parliament initiated this in 2010 and the Commission was not strong enough to take it on board to the Council. In the end, the Council even vetoed the monitoring. Without these mistakes that you made, we would not be debating this issue here today, so what I’m asking Mr Kurz to do is to upscale this strategy to an EUR 120 million anti-poverty strategy for all European citizens. We have the knowledge and the money to do this and I think it is the only way that this issue can be solved. We are counting on Austria especially as, in the 1980s, it became the first country to resolve persecution of the Roma after we were hit by Molotov cocktails in Oberwart and so many people died.

Such governments say no to people in need and leave them to die in the sea. Such governments want to register Roma people so that they can deport them. Such governments attack, criminalise and exclude those who do not fit into their racially dictated boxes.  Such governments use our democratic tools to crash our jointly-built democracy, our commonly set European values, which we have worked on together for decades. Such governments incite fear, hatred, anger, and make innocent people scapegoats and treat them as criminals. We have already seen the horrific consequences of such political groups gaining ground in Europe, but it seems that our European memory is very short.  Fellow citizens, we are at the crossroads. We have to decide if we want to keep an open, democratic society, or if we want to live in a Europe of growing intolerance and racism. The choice is yours, and it is one with far-reaching consequences. And to those politicians feeding hatred, intolerance and fear in order to get votes and gain power: what are you? I say, shame on you!  Finally, let me use this opportunity to raise my voice for those Roma people who have been targeted, injured or killed by far-right groups in Ukraine recently. Colleagues, the reality is that there are pogroms in Europe in 2018.

I demand a proper investigation of the cases, fair legal procedures, and I demand measures aiming at Roma inclusion and countering anti—Gypsyism.

Today's debate follows in a long and sad tradition here in the European Parliament, where every time a government is elected in a European country with which one politically disagrees, a shame game and such built-up indignation here from the hallowed halls of Europe is intended to target those voters who have expressed their dismay. , the Brussels bubble has formed a consensus on this.  It started with the condemnation of the Jörg Haider government in Austria in the late 90s, it continued with an endless stream of accusations against governments in Poland and in Hungary, in Slovakia and in Malta.

That is why we must now use our time in the Plenary To debate the statements of an Italian minister, a former colleague, who has been taken out of context and which can only be used to feed the indignation that is clearly felt in this city.

Among them is that of respect for all nations and minorities and equal treatment for all EU residents, regardless of their origin, native language or religion. For many decades, these principles promoted the peaceful coexistence of many peoples who had been mutual enemies in their recent past. Now the atmosphere in Europe is changing. The hate speech against minorities in a number of EU countries is no longer associated with marginal political radicals, but is becoming a part of the everyday rhetoric of mainstream politicians. I see this as the main problem. The starting point for today’s discussion was some xenophobic attacks by Italian ruling politicians against the Roma minority but there are also examples of hate speech from other countries. Two months ago, Kārlis Šadurskis, the Latvian Minister for Education, appealing to the Latvian Parliament, spoke about tolerance regarding minorities and then, and I quote the Minister for Education, said: ‘Over-expressed tolerance and empathy [toward minorities] have been a threat to the Latvian state, and we have to make every effort to eliminate this.’ However, Jānis Iesalnieks, the Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Justice, publicly compared Latvian residents of Russian origin to insects that are difficult to get rid of. These statements have not received any criticism either from the Latvian ruling elite or in mainstream media. This intolerant attitude towards part of the population opens the way to arrogant and aggressive behaviour against other nations and countries. I am sure, in these circumstances, the European Union must develop a centralised system of monitoring hate speech cases in the EU Member States in order, at least, to compensate for the absence of national discussion on such issues.

What is quite different, Mr Bizzotto, is the anonymous statistical and quantitative reconnaissance dossier produced by Istat a year ago with the National Anti-Racial Discrimination Office and the Association of Italian Municipalities, in collaboration with the National Roma Forum, aimed at monitoring and overcoming the presence of nomadic camps to follow European guidelines. There are around ten million citizens of Roma and Sinti origin in Europe. In Italy there are 180 thousand, 40 thousand of whom live, certainly, in housing difficulties, in formal slums, managed by local or informal administrations, a segregation that is suffered above all by half of them, minors, for repercussions on psychophysical health and schooling.

And it is a populism that has been there for a long time, which has been in the shadows, and which we have not taken seriously enough, but which in Europe in recent years has exploded in scope and found its way into governments and parliaments. But if the Union is no longer based on common values and the rule of law, what is the cohesive glue? If we allow member states' restrictions on human and minority rights to pass without anyone reacting and putting an end, our violations of international and own rules will normalise and become the new norm, and then we might as well scrap Article 2 of the Treaty. And what do we have left? And it was with great sadness that I took note of the Italian Interior Minister's statement about the Roma the other day. Citizenship does not distinguish between majority group and minority, we all have the same rights and obligations. Yet roma are particularly special is treated everywhere.  For example, Swedish police in a municipality kept a register of Roma for law enforcement purposes until it was discovered that the register registered all Roma – children, adults and old – solely on the basis that they were Roma, completely in violation of our regulations.

It is not the words, let alone the courageous action of the Italian Minister of the Interior, that must be called into question, certainly not in this Chamber which is a real shackle for freedom of expression and which is becoming more and more frightened as the Peoples of Europe turn their backs on the ideological diktats of Brussels, especially, of course, , on immigration.

Obviously, outside all legal frameworks, as in the case of the shooting of the Roma census, in clear violation of the Constitution, the principle of equality, the European Charter of Human Rights and privacy legislation. He prefers to call it \"registry to expel irregulars\" but while I quote, he says \"the Italian Roma you have to keep them at home\", except then at the first protests – and there have been many of them – to take it all back and justify themselves with the cloying rhetoric of the good father of the family, saying that the file serves only to protect children. But what about the children you are letting die at sea, closing ports and preventing relief, with the complicity of other European governments? The Libyan Coast Guard will take care of it, you say; we saw how. It is very easy to convey people's fears and insecurities to the weakest, the latest arrivals. But why do you never point the finger up, for example to those multinationals that evade tax every year by a thousand billion, stealing fundamental resources from the citizens?

Not only in Italy, but in Hungary, Poland and many EU countries, the fundamental rights that we have put at the foundation of the Eu ropean Union are at risk: the European institutions must react before it is too late.

Salvini followed the communication strategy that is proper to this new government, based on demagoguery, populism, simplification and has fomented social and ethnic hatred, causing rifts in society. Yes, because in his chilling speech, Matteo Salvini went beyond the racial census, moreover prohibited by our Constitution; it has also gone beyond expulsion, even these illegal if carried out on an ethnic basis: Minister Salvini has purposely fuelled a vicious circle in which ignorance and prejudice increase each other. Xenophobic discrimination campaigns against Roma and all ethnic minorities not only undermine fundamental rights but also produce marginalisation and ghettoisation. This senseless chase must stop; it voluntarily aims to eliminate every effort we have made. New generations born and raised in Italy are thus marginalized.

This policy is exemplary for the exclusion of Roma in European societies.  Another sadder example of this structural exclusion is Salvini's outrageous statements.

I think that the best response to this drift is not only the redemocratisation of the institutions, but it is becoming increasingly essential to re-legitimize the European Union, by regaining the confidence of the citizens, which can only go from the recognition of the rights denied in recent years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "  We have had a rather lively discussion here in the European Parliament, Commissioner.

In my introductory speech, I described the legislative framework and the very clear condemnation of racist and xenophobic statements and attacks, both in the real world and in the online space, nota bene particularly dangerous attacks when they come from the mouths of people who influence public opinion and the situation in society. And I deliberately spoke in general, I did not use the word Italy or Salvini at all, because I did not want to contribute to the Italian national debate. I wanted to talk about the fact that, yes, we are after values in Europe and we need to speak increasingly loudly to appeal to everyone that racism and xenophobia must not be tolerated.  I will admit that when I first heard the statement about the Roma census, i.e. the census on the principle of race, it shook me personally and I started to find out how these things happened, what can be expected next, how the next development will take place. Of course, I must also take into account and respond to a number of messages and emails I receive from people who are very concerned in Italy, and it is not only the Roma who may be affected by such statements. I have been investigating the situation, I have had a discussion with a contact person who is dealing with the strategy of Roma integration in Italy, I have had a discussion about this with a number of experts, and so far I have a reflection from practice that it was a declaration that is not going to be implemented, which is not such a strong reason for some completely complete calming, but we can see that so far it has only stayed with words. because words are as dangerous and can be as dangerous as actions.  We want good cooperation with the Italian Government, it is a government that has emerged from free elections. I think that good cooperation and dialogue and progress on Roma integration can help the Roma themselves. That it won't help them if we get into conflicts, unnecessary controversy. I'm not a follower of barking over Twitter and sending some messages and acronyms. We want a good debate with the Italian Government, we want the situation of the Roma to improve, that the principle of equality before the law and non-discrimination are fully respected. This is what we want in all countries where we have Roma citizens. 90% of Roma live in 11 countries of the European Union and I work very closely with all these countries personally. Each country has different problems, different warning signs in the context of Roma integration, and we need to apply a very individual approach. We had a good debate with Minister Di Maio at the EPSCO Council on improving conditions for women, on a better reconciliation of private and working life. I had a good feeling about the debate, so I repeat, we want dialogue with the Italian Government in order to improve the situation of the Roma.  I have to say that I deal a lot, a lot of me lies at the heart of dealing with the issue of violence online, in the online space. We have a so-called code of decency, Code of Conduct, with big internet companies. I have a very good overview of who is at that time on the list of those who are objects and victims of attacks. I must say that in some countries the Roma are gradually replacing the first place where there were refugees until recently. These are all very warning signs. We deal with it and, as I said, we work with those countries individually. Anyway, the fact that hateful content within 24 hours where it is notified, where it is detected, removed from the Internet, that I think is a great progress. And I will always fight against critical remarks to my address or to the Commission or anyone who promotes this code of decency, this Code of Conduct, because the criticism says that we are actually introducing censorship and that we are opposed to the right to free expression. I will never defend the free expression of people who send Roma and Jews into the gas, people who have absolutely disgusting comments when looking at pictures of a Czech girl who was the victim of an incendiary bomb attack. I will never protect such people and their right to free expression. And it's not about me, it's about the criminal law in every single country.  In every European country, we have a ban on incitement to violence and hatred on a racial basis in criminal law. And we want law enforcement agencies to work with IT firms to detect and effectively prosecute perpetrators and punish them. And not what we have seen recently, that the perpetrator of such an attack on Roma was fined EUR 5. I think that's totally unacceptable. It must not be cheap to attack people, whether they are Roma, whether they are other citizens of the European Union. I have to say that the police and law enforcement are facing a new situation because they are telling us, \"A few years ago we were dealing with extremist organized groups.\" Now online violence is actually done by individuals, and according to some surveys, we find that it's not people without education, they're people educated, they're often people with college degrees, and it's very warning, actually, the wave of violence, which now gets space in the online space.  We are now updating the strategy for Roma integration, and I must say that we will continue to promote an integrated approach and a better use of European funds. It's been said here, too. An integrated approach must consist of clearly effective ways to improve housing, work, education and health conditions. And as I said on the basis of the pillar: equality before the law and non-discrimination. Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, I will return to the power of words. I recently studied documents relating to the Wannsee conference , which was a continuation of the practice of Nuremberg laws, which also involved the census of people of racial origin. I do not like historical parallels, but I have to say that this is where it is offered to remind ourselves that we have already had this in Europe, that we are playing with fire if we let these things run through our lives. Wherever it is in Europe, it must not happen that we relativise fundamental values, that we give way to hatred. I think it's an appeal to all of us.

To be honest, at first I was a bit surprised, but in the end, I am very thankful for this debate because it is obviously necessary to remind Member States of their duty to remain sensitive, to reflect history, to be careful with words and to implement both the framework established in 2011 and effective measures to ensure equality.  Whichever government a Member State of the European Union is ruled by, it is indispensable to guarantee equal rights, equal chances and the right to education to all citizens, irrespective of their origin, and to do everything to preclude any form of discrimination. This is not only the duty of the Member States of the European Union, but also of the Member States of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe’s European Court of Human Rights is only a few metres away from here.  Regarding Ms Gomes’s comment, I know that there are many states with a very long tradition of protecting minorities and that is also the case in Austria. I myself am in regular contact with different minority groups and we do everything we can to protect them. But let me end on a positive note by once again stressing the fruitful cooperation between the three institutions in defending the rights of Europe’s Roma. Parliament has worked particularly hard to keep this topic on the agenda. I also commend the Council’s contribution and commitment. As mentioned, we have already called on the Commission to propose a post—2020 strategy on Roma integration. Keenly aware of the harmful effects of anti-gypsyism, the Council has also called on all Member States ‘to implement and enforce legal safeguards against discrimination, racism, xenophobia, hate crime and hate speech’. Fundamental rights and decent life chances belong to Roma and non-Roma alike. Let us show that this is so. Let us stay the course, stamp out discrimination and make social justice a reality.

Tourists as well as those arriving for business purposes are welcome in Europe. However, those arriving for the purpose of committing acts of terrorism or other offences must be identified long before they enter. This is made possible by the new European Travel Information and Authorisation System.  At the moment, we do not have prior information on visa-free visitors to the Schengen external border. This lack of information is to be remedied by ETIAS, as it is currently up to border guards at the external borders of the Schengen area to take this decision, without prior evaluation. It is clear that there is not the right time at the external borders to carry out appropriate checks and cross-checks. So we needed a system that would allow for a more efficient and faster risk analysis. This will also allow for the avoidance of lengthy waiting times at the external borders.  Securing our borders and protecting our citizens is our top priority. ETIAS eliminates a lack of information by allowing us to cross-check visa-free applicants' data with our other systems. This automated system identifies security, illegal, migration and epidemiological risks for visitors who enter the Schengen area visa-free. At the same time, it is in line with human rights and data protection aspects and does not place too much burden on third-country nationals who are exempt from visas for those trying to get into the Union. It is a certainty for these travellers that, if they have an ETIAS licence, they will be able to cross the EU border without problems. This will be a simple, fast, cheap and effective tool that will in no way qualify as a visa.  By creating the simplest possible procedure, our aim was to keep Europe open to those who come with tourist and business intentions, but also to make it safer. There were three aspects to the negotiations, and I did not want to create a more complicated procedure than for visa applicants, because that would take away the very essence of the visa waiver. I have tried to maintain coherence between ETIAS, the Schengen Information System and the EES. I didn't want to overload the mechanism, make it useless.  I think they have all been achieved in the negotiations. The mandate from Parliament has been greatly enforced, and I can say with a calm heart that the functioning of the ETIAS will always take place in full respect of fundamental rights and the protection of personal data.  For this reason, I would like to thank the Commission and the Commission, but above all my shadow rapporteur colleagues, Mrs Guillaume, Mrs Stevens, Mr Deprez, Mrs Vergiat, for their constructive approach to the dossier and for their cooperation in a good atmosphere.  I would also like to thank the political advisers, Katrin Huber, from the LIBE Secretariat, as well as the assistants for their lengthy, persistent and difficult work. In a year and a half, four political trilogy and 26 technical consultations resulted in this interim agreement first under the Oct, then the final agreement under the Bulgarian Presidency, and finally we were able to close the dossier effectively.

We are now debating, and tomorrow you will vote to adopt, the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), a milestone in our common work.  Together with you and the Council, we jointly agreed to work together to prioritise the legislative work of initiatives where European citizens are clearly expecting us to deliver concrete results. For this, I would like to express my thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Gál, the shadow rapporteurs, and all those involved, for their hard work on this file.  Migration and security are at the very top of our citizens’ concerns, as we see in survey after survey. One of the challenges we identified was to close our information gap on visa-free travellers, while in parallel facilitating legitimate travel. ETIAS was therefore an immediate priority. Today we deliver on this priority.  Let me recall and highlight a few aspects about ETIAS and its concrete benefits. First, it will strengthen internal security and the quality of Schengen border management. Today, border guards have limited time and information when making their assessment on entry. They have no prior information on visa-exempt travellers, especially at land borders. With ETIAS they will benefit from an additional and broader security and migration risk assessment than at the border crossing point, and before the traveller arrives at the Schengen borders. With this system in place we should also see a decrease in the number of refusals of entry at the borders.  In addition to the system contributing to the reduction of migratory risks, persons that pose a security risk will be identified and denied travel authorisation before they arrive. Anyone who is denied authorisation will not waste time and money travelling to Schengen border crossing points. This will also reduce the cost of return for carriers, which will have to repatriate fewer passengers from air, sea and land borders.  Second, while enhancing border management and internal security, ETIAS will at the same time also facilitate travel for visa-exempt third country nationals. Applying for a travel application will be quick, simple and cheap and will not require more than a travel document, credit card and access to the internet. The vast majority of applicants will receive a positive reply within minutes. If additional information or documentation were to be needed, or even the need to have an interview, different possibilities will be offered, taking into account the situation of the traveller. Third, and this is a crucial point, the system will also help to safeguard our visa liberalisation policy, something which is, of course, a key component of the European Union’s external policy. Several visa liberalisation dialogues are progressing with EU neighbours. Visa liberalisation is also an important tool to promote reforms in partner countries and contribute to overall stability and good cooperation with third countries.  ETIAS is, of course, not a visa, but it will compensate in a relatively light way for the loss of information on travellers who were previously visa-required and hence present in the Visa Information System (VIS). With our Visa Information System, the proposal we made last May will ensure also that ETIAS and the VIS work smoothly together and there is no information gap leading to migratory or security risks, all in full respect of fundamental rights.  Please let me now touch upon some of the data protection aspects of the agreement – what data is collected, its retention and how it is protected. The robustness of the risk assessments to be performed by the system is, of course, related to the data collected and to the checks performed against other systems. The outcome on this point is very balanced. It will allow ETIAS to achieve its objectives and functions efficiently while at the same time minimising the data collected. The system will not require the collection of additional information other than what is strictly necessary. I appreciate Parliament’s contribution to striking a constructive agreement with the Council on this point.  As regards now data retention, the agreement is fully in line with the European Parliament’s proposal on extending the retention period only if the applicant freely and explicitly consents. In terms of data protection, the proposal was built to be fully compatible with our new data protection framework. As you know, the extensive discussions reflect a delineation between the General Data Protection Regulation and the Police Directive without affecting their scope of application. Data is protected against risk of abuse. Access is restricted to specific persons within designated competent authorities. Transfer of data to third parties is prohibited, except for exceptional cases where the entry/exit system would not already contain necessary data.  Travellers have the right to access, rectification and deletion of their personal data stored in ETIAS. Supervision is provided by the European Data Protection Supervisor and independent national supervisory authorities. The system will be built in accordance with the principles of data protection by design and by default. Moreover, the Fundamental Rights Guidance Board will, at the suggestion of you, the European Parliament, reinforce and advise the ETIAS screening board by appraising and issuing opinions on the impact on fundamental rights and of implementing ETIAS screening rules.  Today, we are ready to pursue our joint commitment to the full and continue to deliver results for the benefit of our citizens. We should rapidly start to develop ETIAS so that it is up and running in 2021. I am looking forward to the debate today, and thank you for your continued commitment to truly European initiatives which enhance our external border management, ensuring more safety for our citizens.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to first congratulate Mr Kinga Gul on the remarkable work we have had to do with her. The proposal we are discussing today is important because it potentially affects 1.4 billion citizens from some 60 countries, who are exempt from the visa requirement, and it actually affects 30 to 40 million people every year who enter the European Union. The proposed system is simple: any third country national, exempt from the visa requirement, will have to have prior authorisation tomorrow before going to the EU borders. The first question is: Is such a measure necessary? In our opinion, yes. Of the 30 to 40 million people who are willing to join the EU each year, some may pose a real risk to internal security, a migration risk or a risk to public health through the spread of epidemics. ETIAS is therefore a plus for internal security, for border control, because it allows us to identify potential risks in time. It's also a plus for the travelers themselves. Do we know that there are currently almost 300,000 people who are turned back at the borders of the Union every year, even though they have already borne the cost of their journey? ETIAS will significantly reduce this number. The second question is: is this measure bureaucratically unbearable? Obviously not. Travellers will simply apply online by filling out a standard form and 95% of applicants will receive a positive response within minutes. The third question is: Is this measure excessively costly for travellers? This can be discussed, but 7 euros per person for an authorization that will be valid for 3 years does not seem excessive. For comparison, the price of a visa is 60 euros. And finally - and the Commissioner has insisted on this point - this measure respects fundamental rights. Personal data is kept only for the duration of the authorization. No sensitive issues are allowed. An ethics committee is set up to verify that risk indicators are necessary and proportionate and a right of appeal against a refusal decision is established.

Indeed, there have been intense negotiations on this issue, which has been identified as a priority by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Council, which has agreed to create this travel authorization for visa-exempt third-country nationals, following the model of the ESTA in the United States. These nationals will need to apply for ETIAS authorization online by giving information about themselves—their travel. I make a little break on the experience, I hope that the online scams to obtain ETIAS will be less numerous than for obtaining the ESTA. I close the parenthesis of lived. This system will be supposed to verify, before travellers arrive, whether or not they pose a risk to public safety, public health or irregular immigration. Today, with their only identity documents, these risks are assessed in a time frame that is sometimes constrained at the border. The Commission has therefore imagined this new system as a pre-authorization, an upstream assessment, in a way.  Put it this way, once we recognize the need for external border controls, which I do, everything looks fluid, but I still have some reservations about this system. Some may have resulted in the addition of safeguards, as is the case in some areas, others are part of the form of the European security negotiations.  Basically, like any European information system, my political group has been working with concern about these objectives, but above all about its impact on the rights of applicants and the protection of their data. Thus, through our initiative, an evaluation and referral body, an guidance board, has been added to the system, which is made up of independent experts to verify that it does not result in violations of the fundamental rights of travellers. We have also ensured that there is no systematic retention of traveller data, which is consistent with the Court of Justice's ruling on the EU-Canada PNR agreement. This tool will take the form of a database managed by the EU and its Member States. Transport companies and border guards will need to check that each passenger has an ETIAS before letting them leave or enter Europe.  This system will be colossal to implement. When we see the difficulties of a number of Member States in implementing the European NNP on time, we can cast some doubts about the operational implementation date of ETIAS.  My biggest regret about this text is the desire of the Member States to broaden the objectives of the system. ETIAS was designed as a simple travel authorization, but the Council proposed, for example, to make it a lie detector. (The President interrupts the speaker) He wanted each traveller to declare the address of their first stay and that at the border, the border guards could ask for the address where the person would go and check the system to see if it complied with what had been reported at the first online application. Fortunately, Parliament has managed to avoid this infernal machine.

Mr President, I am pleased that the Ethias dossier will be voted on tomorrow, after months of hard work on it. It was identified in a study as an important missing link in European border control, together with the entry-exit system.  This system will hopefully screen in advance from 2021 to screen foreigners who do not need a visa to come to Europe. An automatic survey of European and international databases should give the security services a complete picture. For example, a person who is signalled through the Schengen Information System will no longer be able to travel undetected to the Schengen countries.  But the system is more than just consulting databases. It also tries to predict risks with smart algorithms and statistics. Good news for the taxpayer: the system is self-sufficient, as applicants pay EUR 7 for their electronic request. In most cases, the applicants will be given a decision within 10 minutes. After all, the system is fully automatic and only in case of possible identity confusion or a hit is the application checked manually. An admission is valid for three years.  The system should support border guards who have to make the decision on the ground at the border whether or not to admit someone. Via Ethias they can see if an admission has been issued and whether an additional check is needed.

The system will thus have major consequences for travel and crossing the Schengen border itself and on fundamental rights, in particular to privacy.

Together, we are implementing initiatives which make a clear difference in that domain. At the European External Action Service (EEAS), we promote mobility between the Schengen area and third countries, while contributing to the fight against terrorism and serious crimes and safeguarding fundamental rights. In this context, I welcome the fact that you have recently reached an agreement with the Council on eu-LISA and SIS. On SIS, one of the main priorities of the ETIAS rapporteur was to ensure coherence between SIS and ETIAS. A big effort on this was made during the negotiation on ETIAS. The Visa Information System (VIS) together with ETIAS and the recently adopted entry—exit system will together form part of a single platform for third—country nationals visiting the European Union. ETIAS will fill a significant information gap on visa exempt travellers. The VIS proposal will close the gap on long—stay document holders. Together, the three systems will allow verifications of third—country nationals crossing our external borders into the Schengen area for short and long stays. It is therefore of paramount importance that the development of the three systems is synchronised, as ETIAS provides for interoperability with our other EU information systems for borders, migration and security. It not only brings added value, in itself, but also reinforces the added value of other EU information systems. The reinforced eu-LISA will be the beating heart of our work to develop these systems, put them into effect and ensure their smooth and seamless functioning. For these reasons, I call on you to reach a swift agreement with the Council on the VIS proposal so that together we can add the last missing piece of the new EU information platform for borders and security. I am looking forward to the start of the development of ETIAS and the other information systems we have in the pipeline. You will remember that it was one of my priorities from the very first moment I was designated Commissioner responsible for security and migration. I am more than happy to share the responsibility with you and, most importantly, to share the results that we achieve.

In the light of the recent challenges that the EU is currently facing, especially in terms of migration, it is clear that there is a need for a new approach regarding border security. The European Travel Information and Authorization System – a completely electronic system – will allow and keep track of visitors from countries who do not need a visa to enter Schengen. ETIAS will undergo a detailed security check of each applicant to determine whether they could be allowed to enter any Schengen country. Thus, the travel authorisation system will gather, keep track of and update necessary information regarding visitors, to determine whether it is safe for them to enter Schengen countries.

Instead, I have been able to discover, thanks in part to the efforts and work of the colleagues with whom I have worked – I see the chairman of the committee from whom I have learned a great deal – that the BUDG Committee is in fact a very political committee and that everything is ultimately decided in the last few weeks and hours when we are going to draft the budget for the following year. Today we are beginning to get to the heart of the 2019 budget and I have to say that, despite the percentageally significant outlook on all the budget lines, the Commission's proposal, which provides for significant percentage increases on all lines, responds – mind you – not to the bizarre demands of MEMBERS of the European Parliament but to the needs of european citizens. Yesterday we heard Chancellor Kurz, who made an inspired speech and was poisoned by a Europeanism which I consider to be very sincere. Unfortunately, however, your words yesterday and also those of other Heads of State or Government that we have heard in recent weeks and days have focused mainly on the issues of immigration, security and the defence of our borders. I must put a question to the Council, to the Heads of State or Government, who are not here today: exactly what is the reason why the Council is so concerned about migrants and migration and not about the future of European citizens? Exactly, what is the reason why the Council only discusses immigration, security and the closure of the external borders when we are talking about 45 thousand people who, until 1 July this year, moved towards Europe? 45,000 out of 500 million citizens: 45 thousand people are a third of the inhabitants of Innsbruck in Tyrol, a third of Bergamo in Lombardy. If we are not able to deal with a situation like this, how can we expect to discuss the real problems that Europe has, the real problems and the real crises that are there in Europe, that live our citizens, our administrations, our companies? The issue of immigration must certainly be addressed, in a complex and comprehensive way. If we really want, all together, to prevent and tackle migratory phenomena, then we must put our hearts at peace and think that solutions will be found, but it will take years and it will take money and it will take a lot of appropriate ideas and policies: money to invest in Africa, to eradicate the reasons for migration. This is the real key point: hunger, drought, disease, wars, need, lack of freedom, education in democracy. At the same time, however, we cannot forget our obligations to the citizens of Europe; we cannot give them hope, implementing projects and programmes with high expectations, and then not equipping our budget with adequate financial instruments. We have moved from a grey Europe, dealing only with money and national budgets, austerity and cuts, to a Europe instead focused only on fear, fear of losing the fragile, very fragile prosperity that we have managed to achieve. That is why, as the European Parliament, we are calling for more investment, in order to give hope to an entire continent and, above all, to young people; that is why we need to invest in our programmes – I am thinking of Horizon, CEF, Erasmus. And I say this right now: we will not accept any cuts on this type of programme, on the programmes that are most successful among the citizens of the European Union. If we really want a Europe that is in competition with the United States and China, with the world's great economies, if we want our start-ups to compete with the existing multinationals, if we want to focus on Europe 4.0, we can only do it together, investing together. We need more Europe, not more borders. If there is an emergency on our continent, it is certainly not about immigration but about youth unemployment, which is 20%: this is an emergency! That is what we want to challenge the Member States on. We are also ready to support and increase the European Commission's commitment to the Youth Guarantee. If there is an emergency in our Europe, it is the risk of our companies losing competitiveness and we want to focus on that by investing in Horizon 2020 and research. If there is an emergency in Europe, it is about supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and Europe, until now, has supported Our small and medium-sized enterprises: I am thinking of what you have invested in Hungary – EUR 31 million – in what you have invested in Austria and Italy. One final final thought. We must look to our future and to that of our generations: the rhetoric of a Europe of seventy years of peace is no longer valid if we do not fill it with content and if we do not give this budget a true soul.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 220, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Daniele VIOTTI", "mepid": "124791", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, Mr Viotti, Mr Arthuis, Chairman of the Committee, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Viotti, for the work he has done on this report. I would like to thank Mr Viotti for a competent draft, for a preparatory work which Parliament, with its priorities, represents. And I can tell you that almost all the priorities of your report, Mr Viotti, and thus of Parliament, are in line with what the Commission wants to achieve politically with the 2019 budget. It is the sixth budget, the second last in the financial framework period and the last to be adopted by this House in November, before your European election.  There are annual worries. In a few days' time, we as the Commission will present to you how commitment to payments will become and how we – reste ' more liquid – will do everything we can to ensure that we do not repeat or even negatively exceed a comparable development in 2012, 2013, 2014 in the dimension. We have to report to you here in a few days significant and good progress results. Secondly, it is a question of us, as the Commission, wanting to support you, of wanting to do everything possible to ensure that the 2019 budget is also adopted before the end of 2018, in November of this year. This would be a clear sign of European capacity to act in difficult times and a sense of responsibility if everyone, the Council, Parliament and the Commission, becomes aware of the responsibility and makes an agreement possible through appropriate willingness to compromise. We fully support the efforts of Parliament and you, Mr Viotti, to avoid cuts under heading 1a: Erasmus+ or ErasmusPro, COSME for small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups, the Connecting Europe Facility and, above all, our Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. We cannot talk about the future in Sunday speeches, want to compete with Silicon Valley and China, and then cut exactly where it is easiest in terms of budget policy, but is the most stupid politically. Of course, in heading 2, in the case of heading 1b, what is paid out and what is done is fixed. But then heading 1a must not be the deanoting pillar of the European budget. That is why you have me on your side – and we can show how many applications for Horizon Europe we receive, are being cut, rejected – and you have me on your side. There would be far more added value from European research projects if the budgetary framework could be maintained and cut.  We will have to talk carefully about the Turkey-EU Facility. You will recall that a larger number of Member States initially demanded that we fully finance the second tranche with EUR 3 billion through the redeployments. Now, with a billion fresh money, we have at least achieved some relief in terms of margins in our budget on the way to the end of 2020, and everything else remains to be handed over to the trialogue.  A completely new development, which I can only discuss in a cursory way today, concerns the construction of Frontex and the strengthening of European border management. In a few days' time, we will answer your questions as to whether the figure of 10 000 – and if so, from when and with what steps – is realistic, what this means for training, what can be achieved through secondments and what it can mean in terms of salary payments and investment in material resources in the financial years 2019 – perhaps as early as 2018 – and 2020 in anticipation of the next budget framework. We are also interested in finding a good solution to the fight against youth unemployment, because this is about what the Member States can absorb, what the Member States can implement in projects and what means can be activated within the budgetary framework for reducing youth unemployment, so that we can also support this focus of Parliament. Mr Viotti was right: the issue of immigration, the issue of the number of refugees, has clearly become more and more in perspective. Nevertheless, we also want to have funds in the next financial year to provide effective support to the member states of major contact, Bulgaria, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Italy and Spain, if necessary, in order to ensure our financial solidarity in this important task in the interests of preserving the Union.

For us, it is about the future of all the Member States, that young people are not thrown into despair and that they are not being used and that they do not even get an education perhaps that gives them the opportunity to enter the labour market.

Mr President! Thank you to Commissioner Oettinger for a good speech in which I attached myself to the priorities that the Commission will play out with. At the very top of the Committee on Culture is, of course, the extremely successful Erasmus programme. I am pleased to note that this was one of the first things that the Commissioner mentioned. All of us in a unanimous committee and quite a few other people in this House are counting on there to be room for a substantial boost, both in 2019 of course, so that we can honour our commitments for the existing programme, but also, of course, for the MFF if you look further into the future. This suggests that we have at least a broad consensus here, and I personally personally am very pleased about that. Otherwise, as you know, it is Creative Europe and Europe for Citizens that we are betting on in the Committee on Culture – the two major programmes, which are not as big as we have always hoped for. I have followed it for a few years and can see that the ambitions have never really been followed by the budget. There has always been too little money, these programs have been chronically underfunded.

I urge the Commission to support us in this way, to give innovation and research the financial leeway so that the programmes – whether coSME or the programmes that are very successful for small and medium-sized enterprises and which are very successful and essential for economic competitiveness in our Member States – are given the appropriate priorities here. We are aware that we need to set further priorities in the area of security, but also in the area of migrants and refugees. I consider the new Council decisions to be very important here. The Member States must also give answers and not only always ask us to redeploy, but also follow the decisions taken by their own heads of government, which will also have financial consequences for the European Union's budget. I would also like to thank us in the area of Interrail for continuing the programme and for pushing the Erasmus programme so that young people can exchange ideas with other Member States, that is to say, to learn and study in another country.

In my short speech, I would like to mention a small but significant section of the 2019 budget, to which you have already referred, Mr Oettinger, but to congratulate my dear colleague Daniele Viotti on his excellent preparatory work. I would like to talk about the new edition of the Financial Facility for Turkey or, as it should be called correctly, the Financial Facility for the provision of refugees in Turkey, which is undoubtedly a useful and politically valuable initiative. Providing care for Syrian refugees close to home, which also means, for example, considerable efforts in the education of children, is an undertaking that is definitely worth the financial efforts of the European Union. But the Way in which the Member States deal with this money is significant. In the first financial facility, we had a situation where we were talking about EUR 1 billion that the EU had to raise and EUR 2 billion by the Member States. That, too, is no small thing in the case of a budget that pays EUR 144 billion this financial year. And now it is simply being reversed that two billion are to be raised here and only one billion by the Member States. So not about half-half, but a reversal of the conditions. And, Mr Oettinger, it is only a small consolation that it has at least been possible to prevent this from being fully covered by the European budget. Especially since the money is not lying around somewhere, but so that other tasks in foreign policy are then declared obsolete and must remain. It is this self-serving mentality that, frankly, infuriates me. That is why I warn that the Budgetary Authority of the European Union has two arms, the Council being just one of them.

I believe that this draft shows once again that the budget is seen here from a completely wrong point of view. It pretends to have money. Where does this money come from? This money that is to be spent here is first being squeezed out of taxpayers, and that does not fall from the sky. We take it away from the citizens and then claim that we can achieve a better purpose here through redistribution than if we left this money to the citizens. I think that is simply wrong. We must ensure that we have a red tape. That would be a contribution to strengthening the economy. We can achieve this, but not through redistribution. Redistribution will damage the economy, because redistribution will result in more bureaucracy and distortions of competition. That is not the right way to go. Of course, it is absolutely right that we should fight against youth unemployment. However, we are creating completely false expectations here if we pretend that the EU should simply put up new programmes and then we will get to grips with youth unemployment. That is not going to happen. People will be disappointed, foreseeable. We should not do that. There are many useful things the EU can do. For example, that we are promoting the less developed regions. Spending money on it is real solidarity. That is what we stand for, and I stand for it.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking to Mr Viotti first. Very good work, Mr Viotti, your initial text was excellent and you had the intelligence to incorporate the best of the amendments of the political groups, including mine, which makes it even better.  I know that you know the priorities of my group, but I want to remind them.  Firstly, we want, like you, more growth for more jobs, which means concretely stimulating investment, in particular the 2020 programme, stimulating and supporting SMEs, in particular through the COSME programme, to vigorously support - we have not talked enough about - the digitisation of European industry, which will be a factor in its future.  Secondly, we want the budget to be used to wake up, as you said, Mr Viotti, and to stir up the European dream in the youth of our countries. That is why we have proposed and support the strengthening of appropriations for Erasmus and we are asking for a real boost for an Erasmus Pro so dear to the heart of the President of our Commission, which is dedicated to the mobility of young apprentices.  Thirdly, we take seriously our commitments to combat global warming and say that climate spending must be increased in 2019 and 2020 if the EU is to meet the target of spending 20% of the budget for global warming for the period 2014-2020.  Fourthly, we are fully aware of the scale of the problem posed by the migration flows and the political pathologies that these flows are beginning to entail. We need more resources for border control, more resources for real solidarity in the reception of refugees and more means for an effective and fair return policy. But also and above all more resources, because the future of Europe is inseparable from the future of Africa and Africa needs, as you said, a real Marshall Plan to offer a real future to the 2.5 billion people that Africa will have in the next 20 or 30 years.

The Commission proposal, as it stands, is to increase the EU budget by 3.1%, setting it at EUR 165 billion for 2019. This is a staggering amount of money, made even more so by the fact that the Commission does not seem to care that the UK is leaving. One of the biggest contributors to the EU budget is leaving and the Commission still wants to increase the budget – which is amazing. The recent Commission statement of estimates showed that the UK will be handing over EUR 17.5 billion to the EU in 2019, which works out at about GBP 42 million a day. It is this sort of attitude which led to Brexit. The Commission does not care how taxpayers’ money is spent: a few million here, a few hundred million there, billions thrown abroad, while frontline public services are cut at home. The Tories have agreed to hand nearly GBP 40 billion over to the EU as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, we will not have paid this GBP 40 billion off until 2064, nearly half a century after voting to leave. We could still be paying billions to Brussels thanks to ‘Theresa the Appeaser’ and the Tory Government. Let me just remind everyone here – and especially the spineless Tory negotiators – that the UK is not legally required to pay a penny to the EU once we leave. Theresa May is heading for a Norway—like option, where we are forced to abide by many EU rules without any say over them, continue giving billions in contributions without representation, and have little control over immigration rules. The Tories have had two years to come up with a position on Brexit and show us a blueprint of what an independent Britain would look like. They haven’t got a clue. They don’t have a plan. They will continue giving billions of our money to the EU and are completely split on whether to carry out the result of the referendum or not. Only UKIP will stand up for the millions of people who voted to leave, and oppose this betrayal.

I welcome that, but when I questioned the Executive Director of Frontex on their expansion plans for the period of the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), his reply made it obvious that Frontex had no detailed plans for major expansion of their staff complement. The proposals contained in Amendment 2 and the oral amendment that will be moved are helpful in this respect. I look forward to hearing from Frontex clear proposals that can be funded with confidence. To the Council we should simply say, on this matter, that this is a new initiative and new initiatives require fresh money. The Committee on Budgets also recently had a hearing on the mainstreaming of climate spending, and the evidence from the Court of Auditors revealed that the Union is far from achieving its 20% target on mainstreaming climate expenditure.

This could mean the commission's already known problem of the accumulation of arrears in previous years. The proposed increase in funding for Horizon 2020, Erasmus Plus and the Connecting Europe Facility should be assessed positively, while the amount of funding to support small and medium-sized enterprises or programmes supporting youth employment is insufficient. The proposed increase in payment appropriations under Heading 1B is worryingly low – only by 1.1%, which could put infrastructure projects at risk.

From 12 July, in your presence, Commissioner, we will meet the Council and its Austrian Presidency for a trilogue to highlight our priorities, our method and our agenda. Our task will be accomplished at a time when we are already largely mobilized by the draft post-2020 financial framework. While this approach can generate a clear amount of work, it may also justify us trying to raise the 2019 budget, at least for certain actions, to the level it will have to reach as early as 2021. In this regard, I would like to mention the means devoted to the Erasmus programme, and I do so as an example and out of conviction. Erasmus, whose 30th anniversary we have just celebrated, is one of the happiest initiatives to the credit of the European Union. The mobility of young people in Europe awakens and cements European citizenship, it allows us to discover and share good practices in teaching, vocational training and learning. Unfortunately, the Erasmus programme is causing frustration, as 50% of applications are rejected each year due to a lack of funding. I am pleased that the Commission is drawing the consequences in the draft Multi-Year Financial Framework (MFF) that it made public on 2 May, as it proposes to double the volume of appropriations. Parliament, for its part, is calling for a tripling, as new expectations for apprentices and vocational trainees will have to be added to the now unsatisfied demands under the new Erasmus Pro programme. An excellent measure to effectively combat youth unemployment. In these circumstances, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that from 2019 we can bring Erasmus up to the expectations of young Europeans and their families.

Normally, therefore, the programmes and projects of the current multiannual financial framework would have to be on the right track in this financial year. From the point of view of the Committee on Budgetary Control, however, I would like to refer to a number of observations which give us some cause for concern with regard to the 2019 budget. For example, outstanding commitments have reached an all-time high: 266.9 billion as of 31.12.2017 – the equivalent of more than two annual payments. Delays in the implementation of projects from the 2006 to 2013 funding period resulted in the payment of cash being used almost entirely to settle commitments for the previous funding period until 2016. Only in 2017 did an acceleration in the implementation of the programmes of the current funding period start. We hope that this will be reinforced in 2019, so that the new funding period, the new MFF, will not again be burdened with significant overhangs of payments for the current funding period. The Committee on Budgetary Control regrets that the EU's financial obligations have increased in the first place through long-term guarantees, guarantees and other legal obligations. This makes careful financial management urgently necessary. This includes the launch of more and more financial instruments and the creation of trust funds, which, like the European Fund for Strategic Investments, are very unsatisfactory in their effectiveness, but which could confront the budget with risks. Current challenges, such as managing the migration of hundreds of thousands of people across the EU's external borders, have also shown that the budget is not very flexible. The Commission mobilised funds from various parts of the budget, but a reporting system which shows what funds have been used and for what purpose remains on the wish list.

It is also important to say that this divergence was and is a consequence of the merciless implementation of austerity policies and, therefore, what is required of this budget is that it has, in fact, a decisive bet on cohesion to compensate for the losses that have been created and caused by austerity policies that have severely affected countries such as Portugal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 244, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Tomáš ZDECHOVSKÝ", "mepid": "124713", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to thank you for presenting this report.

I personally have security as my top priority and I think that there is much more to discuss about security.  Commissioner, I told you that in committee. At present, there is a need to focus more on youth radicalisation, on the problems of terrorism, on the problems of financing some of the security measures that need to be done. There is a need to introduce digitisation of certain bodies or to strengthen some of the Agencies of the European Union. Everyone says that the external borders should be more secure. But what is \"securing the external borders\"? That's more investment in digitalisation, it's not about building more people there. Today, we have different means of stopping these people at the border, and there doesn't have to be a dog or a man with a machine gun like we know from communist times. Europol, Eurojust and other agencies also need to be strengthened. Perhaps the FRA, which deals with human rights, as well as the need to strengthen the Fund for Asylum, Migration and Integration, in order to make it more efficient to receive asylum seekers and, for example, to prevent coalitions from falling apart in Germany.

Madam President, Commissioner and the unfortunately non-existent Presidency of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has been on. Today we are going against a serious opponent of this is the summer festival in the Parliamentary Society, and that is why I am very attached to you that you have made it here to debate here today an important project, namely the so-called omnibus revision of the Financial Regulation, which is on the agenda for the first time in plenary. It is no exaggeration to say that the dossier has kept not only me, but also many of my fellow Members, you and the staff in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control on their toes for a year and a half. That is why I would like to start by thanking the co-rapporteur, Richard Ashworth, the shadow rapporteurs, the rapporteurs from other committees involved and, of course, the secretariats, the Directorate for Budgetary Affairs, the Directorate-General for Finance, the legal service and the language lawyers who have been working on the dossier, the fine-tuning, for a long time – almost half a year. I would like to thank the Commission, the Commissioner for Budgets and his team, Mr Waelbroeck and Mrs Calviso, whom we have handed over to the Spanish Government, and, of course, the Maltese Presidency and the Estonian Presidency. I would now like to thank the Austrian Presidency for its interest in the subject. The Commission's proposal came as a bit of a surprise to us in September 2016, not only in view of the timing, but also in terms of the scope of the proposed amendments. That was very surprising. Tomorrow, we will put the end of a legislative procedure which is record-breaking in a number of respects. The Commission's proposal contained not only a Financial Regulation that was completely restructured and substantially amended, but also amended to 15 sector-specific regulations – hence the name 'omnibus'. This structure led, for the first time, to the fact that, together with the Committees on Agriculture, Regional Policy, Employment, Industry and Transport, we were condemned to carry out a quasi-tailor-made extension of the Rules of Procedure in order to determine the distribution of competences. In view of the experience, I would rather advise against a repetition. In the Financial Regulation, in the budget and in the budgetary control parts, we ourselves discussed more than 750 amendments in the committees, about half of which were ultimately found in the negotiating mandate. We managed to draw up the draft report within ten weeks and then put it to the vote in the committees within ten more weeks. Last autumn, in three and a half months, we made 13 half-day trialogues, and then there was a fourteenth to clarify when the new rules would come into force. Was it worth the effort? Yes, overall, because there are many useful improvements and helpful simplifications for the beneficiaries. I believe, however, that we could have avoided some discussions and detours if we had had a simply structured proposal. The Commission's proposal, Commissioner, has contained many useful improvements. On the other hand, this was opposed by problematic proposals, including the restriction of the rights of the budgetary authority, and we could only say 'no' to that, so to speak. This is also the point on which we were able to prevail from Parliament's side, and a few others – four central ones: there are no trust funds within the EU, which would have led to less democratic control and an even greater fragmentation of the EU budget. The non-profit principle is maintained. There is no transfer of funds from the Structural Funds to the EFSI, and the powers of the Committee on Budgets are retained. On our initiative, we have achieved the rules to exacerbate conflicts of interest. For the first time, we have introduced a regulation for letterbox companies and tax havens. We have strengthened the performance idea. We have strengthened Parliament's role in setting up new thematic trust funds, we have created a single framework for financial instruments and guarantees in the EU budget.

Firstly because it is important to remember this is public money and it’s important we do not compromise monitoring and control. Secondly, because performance budgeting brings a whole new dimension to financial regulations. It will usher in a new culture to EU spending: that we welcome, but we also need to understand and recognise the potential conflict between measuring performance and achieving simplification. Overall, I would have wished to have achieved more by way of simplification, but I am happy that we made good progress establishing a performance culture, and I hope the Commission will keep up that momentum. I’d like to make a couple of points. On performance, we set requirements for internal auditors to help measure and monitor performance and we introduced concrete definitions of results and outcomes. On simplification, we streamlined the audit process, we introduced a number of procedures to make the audit burden more proportionate to the level of risk, and we also reduced the burden of multiple auditing. On modernisation, we introduced simpler regulations for blending structural funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), not only to bring greater clarification but also to ensure that there is no transfer between those systems. As rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am acutely aware of the need to ensure proper control of EU funds so, first, we now have greater clarity and transparency in the reporting procedures. Secondly, we’ve accelerated the discharge procedure. All parties committed to achieving N+1 in the future, and that’s important because it will make audit processes more relevant and more instructive for future budgeting. Overall, I am happy with the outcome but, with such a complex and time—consuming process, there are inevitably some regrets. One in particular was the timing of the introduction of regulations. This is an omnibus package and, bearing in mind the requirements of the different spend committees and the nature of their work, the new regulations will come into force on a number of different dates. That is not ideal. Firstly, not ideal because of the disruption and confusion arising from changing regulations part-way through the year; and, secondly, not ideal in terms of the coherence of the text. However, given the complexity of the exercise – there were 800 pages of text and 13 trilogues – and given the very tight timescale that the Commission required, we had no choice but to stagger the dates of introduction or there would have been no reform at all. I want to finish by putting on record my thanks to the many people who have been involved in this reform right from the start. First, I would mention the Estonian Presidency. Secondly, the Commission, and I particularly want to thank Commissioner Oettinger for his generous help and support. I want to thank the staff. I want to thank the opinion committees. In particular, I want to thank our shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Maňka and Ms Ayala Sender, and Jean Arthuis, Chair of the Committee on Budgets. But my biggest thanks go to my co-rapporteur, Ingeborg Gräßle. Without her limitless appetite for detail, her patient persistence and her tireless efforts, frankly, I don’t think we would have reached such a favourable result at all. My thanks to all of them, particularly my co-rapporteur.

This comes a bit from materialistic philosophy, but there is such a saying: freedom is an insight into necessity. Especially in the budget, this shows a little bit the political degrees of freedom that we have, because basic arithmetic is often not particularly sexy. As far as the agricultural budget is concerned, we can really thank the people involved, the Commissioner and also our two rapporteurs. We got away halfway unscathed, I would think. Perhaps it was also an acknowledgement of our low level of error in the agricultural sector. It is possible to argue – there is a long dispute – whether everything we do makes sense, but what we do is tamper-proof, I would almost have said. In the first pillar, we are close to the threshold of inconsistency, and in the second we have already become much, much better. And we are also grateful that we will then also receive the promised funds.

Madam President, rapporteurs, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Ashworth, shadow rapporteurs, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and for the work they have done. In fact, an incredibly complex work that is being produced today! It was about modernising and simplifying the Financial Regulation, and it was about the sectoral basic acts for various programmes that are in the European budget. It was very ambitious to tackle everything together. But if only cohesion or agricultural or connecting Europe rules had been discussed, modernised and simplified, other programme managers would rightly have said that modernisation and simplification are also important to them. That is why I would like to pay my respects and thanks to all those who have worked deeply on the matter here over the last two years. I deliberately pass on the thanks to my Director-General and my former Director-General, Mrs Calviso, who has worked on this herself with commitment. With the new Financial Regulation, we already have a new basis from 2018. But it is just as important that the basic rules governing the various sectors and their spending programmes are the basis for the budgetary framework for the next decade. Their work will culminameine in the discussions on the 2021-2027 budgetary framework, which is why, in fact, only a very substantial preparatory work has been done here to facilitate and simplify the negotiations now under way in Parliament and the Council and between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the budgetary framework for the next decade. It is a question of application: what data and documents does an applicant have to submit for programmes of the European budget? It is a question of the processing of applications, of questions relating to the implementation of the programme, of accounting and control of settlements. Simplification is a goal and a value in itself, but opening the doors to fraud, infidelity and corruption would be the wrong way to go. That is why you, we have all tried to strike a balance between simpler application processing, programme implementation, accounting and control on the one hand, and prevention of corruption, fraud and infidelity in the European budget on the other. We have drawn some practical insights. The question is the flexible use of different programmes: to what extent do we want to make it possible for several programmes to be used to carry out the project? Connecting Europe and Cohesion or the Juncker Plan and Cohesion are examples. As Mrs Gräßle mentioned, as tax havens, we have, I believe, brought intermediary and letterbox companies into a regulation in a very, very consistent form, which I hope will prove its worth in practice. We have made special simplifications for users of smaller-scale programmes, with a few thousand or tens of thousands of euros. We have re-introduced volunteering into the eligibility process, which is important for NGOs. I could mention a wealth of other points. I believe that, for all the complexity and also if, during the deliberations of a year ago, it was already clear that we were now struggling, and that a fundamental modernisation and simplification of our rules and the Financial Regulation through this omnibus was possible, is a worthy work which will also be positive for our Member States, regions, municipalities, researchers in the coming years. , farmers and our citizens and voters.

We have one third of the European budget, so we have looked with great interest in the last year at this type of debate, after the high-level group that came forward with the need to change and to have another attitude, not to have any more controls.  On control, I think we made big steps forward. It is important for our citizens, important for the beneficiaries, to make it, let me say, sometimes fun to work on European Union programmes, not just a burden, and this means it cuts costs. Easier reimbursement of payments, of the money, simpler checks. We had control on control, sometimes five times! You get weird things in this kind of a Union! Here now, those who perform well will have a lighter system of control – Member States, regions and cities – in cohesion policy.  So this is the aim. The aim is to perform better and to show it. Simpler rules, as the Commissioner said, to combine funds and this is, I think, the need for the future.  The second thing I might pinpoint is that, in fact, we debated on the system for this combination of funds. Is it necessary, if you have regional funds in the envelope of a Member State, to put the money first in the pocket of the EFSI, for instance, in order to get these guarantees later? We rejected Article 13.30a and this was agreed with the Council and I am surprised that now, looking at InvestEU, the Commission has come back with the same proposal. What happened there? We had an agreement with the legislative bodies on that. So Mr Oettinger, what went wrong there? Because the good steps that we make here should be followed.  And my last sentence is on communication: you could bring in some amendments to show our citizens what we are doing with these new methods.

Financial rules play an important role, setting out the principles and procedures governing both the revenue and expenditure parts of the European Union budget, as well as the control of EU funds. The main objectives of the Commission proposal are simplification and flexibility. We support the broad objectives put forward by the Commission, especially the major priority of simplification for recipients of EU funds. This is very important in order to ease the work of the beneficiaries, and to reduce the delays in implementation of a number of EU key programmes. In this regard, we support the Commission’s aim of creating a single rule book for recipients. In order to achieve maximum results we need to have impact assessment preceding any future substantial changes of the financial rules, as well as increasing cross-reliance on audits. Nevertheless, the Commission should maintain the right to audit if it deems it necessary. We welcome the measures on budgetary flexibility. These were needed in order to enhance the ability of the EU budget to adapt to changing circumstances and to respond to unexpected developments. However, we need to maintain a balance between flexibility, sound financial management and the rights of the budgetary authority. During the work on the proposal, the effective use of financial instruments has been improved. The financial rules will be a step towards a budget focused on results if we further embed performance into spending decisions. We support the agreement reached during the trilogues.

Their implementation in practice is even more distant from the ambition. I am referring, first of all, to the interpretation of the general budgetary rules in the Member States, which often ends with much stricter implementing and audit rules and the result does not reduce bureaucracy, but increases. Therefore, the first thing that the implementing rules for the new financial perspective should focus on is legal certainty and clarity. It is better not quite perfect, but clear rules, than a set of obscure lozungs full of good wishes.  I would like to commend the work of the rapporteurs. They duly took due account of the Green Group's demand not to allow the use of cohesion policy funding for other purposes, in particular the transfer of them to the European Structural Investment Funds.

I have said this already in this Chamber and I’ll say it again now, and I’ll keep saying it until it gets changed: the annual audit of the entire Commission budget by the European Court of Auditors is seriously flawed.

I think that it is precisely the issue of drawing up and implementing the European Union budget that is one of the most important issues that we need to address in the structural reform of the European Union. However, there are still some problems with the implementation of the budget. We are left with surpluses, just as the various areas financed by the European Union are changing, and that is what we need to respond to when drawing up the budget. I welcome the simplification and flexibility of the budget. In my opinion, this is the right way to go, but it is very important that European finances are also used effectively. The current set of rules, both the absorption of funding and the follow-up, need to be revised. As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I could tell you about this. In the long term, under-u.S. funding is also a huge problem. Thus, operators do not make enough use of the European Union's auxiliary hand. This is due to the current complicated and sometimes lengthy process of fundraising and the burden on the administration. I therefore welcome the simplification of the rules for beneficiaries of European Union funds.  But it must not happen that simplified administration will result in inefficiencies. The rules must subsequently be put into practice responsibly and monitored and controlled in order to avoid circumvention of the rules. And if that happens, there must be tough sanctions.

I must say that I am now glad that I was not Mrs Grule's co-manager, because surely she would have gone on to thicken those ranks too. Such is the capacity for persuasion it has in the exercise of the revision of the Regulation. After these jokes, I would like to thank the Commission, of course, for the hard work over all these months; thank the Commissioner, of course, for his services and ours too, for our secretariats, both the CONT Commission and the groups; and, of course, will also let me pay a small tribute to the Director General, Nadia Calviño, who has become the socialist and European government of our president, Pedro Sánchez. In budgetary control, one of the principles in which errors multiply exponentially is precisely the complexity of programmes. In fact, that is precisely why this simplification exercise. In addition, we add to that the repeated complaints of all the beneficiaries of the programmes, which do not help us anything to improve the image either. Hence this comprehensive exercise, sometimes frustrating, but in the end satisfactory in the progress we have made, gives us precisely the possibility of being able to apply it to the new MFF.

All I can say is that the budgetary rules that we have now presented are good, but we must monitor them in application. I am now looking at 15 years of budgetary regulation changes – every two years the Commission comes up with some draft. The great request that I would have is that it is now a good thing that we should now ensure the stability of the rules and not try again, then here and there, to get what we have not now got. We have made a decisive simplification of flat rates. You now get EUR 60 000 of taxpayers' money for very little evidence – that is a heap of money.

In the wake of the recent Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, this motion for a resolution confirms that privacy matters are taken very seriously in Europe. I can only agree with Parliament’s concerns in this regard, as the Commission has highlighted on previous occasions.  But I would like to recall that the Privacy Shield was set up to offer a high level of protection for personal data. It provides the adequate level of protection required by EU data protection law and the EU Charter, and even though the Privacy Shield predates the entry into application of the EU’s new rules, the General Data Protection Regulation, we negotiated the Shield with the new standards in mind. The Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal took place before the Shield existed, and it is the Shield that has introduced stricter rules for exactly those practices that seem to be at the heart of this scandal. Thanks to stricter conditions for the sharing of personal data with third parties, and more stringent rules on data retention, the data of our citizens is now better protected when it is transferred to the United States. It is of crucial importance that these rules are also properly enforced. I therefore welcome that the United States Federal Trade Commission has immediately opened an investigation in the Facebook Cambridge Analytica case, and that it is also assessing whether these companies violated their obligations under the Privacy Shield. This investigation will certainly be a test case for the enforcement action of the United States authorities.  The framework has been operational for almost two years and, as required, we are continuously monitoring its functioning. Almost 4 000 companies from Europe and the United States have signed up to the Shield. This is more than during the first 10 years of the Safe Harbour framework’s existence. This testifies to a large usefulness of the Shield, but we are all here fully aware that the functioning of the Shield could be, and should be, improved. We also expect that the United States authorities fully concentrate on the day-to-day oversight of the Privacy Shield.  I very much welcome Parliament’s insistence on the need for regular and proactive compliance monitoring. This is a message we consistently convey in our contacts with the United States. Let me also make it very clear that the Commission will not hesitate to act upon its obligations and to make use of its power to suspend the Privacy Shield. But, at this stage, a suspension is not warranted. All the elements on which our adequacy finding was based have remained in place since the new US administration took office, and we have seen some improvements and new appointments in the relevant bodies and authorities.  We also have to keep in mind that without the Privacy Shield framework, data transfers would predominantly take place on the basis of contractual safeguards between EU and US companies. In comparison, these will be costlier, in particular for smaller companies and start-ups. Moreover, a sudden suspension would affect all those individuals in the EU whose personal data would no longer benefit from the additional protections of the Privacy Shield.  At the same time we fully share the position of Parliament that there are a number of outstanding issues which have to be addressed. I have already made clear to my counterparts in the United States that I want the open issues to be resolved by the second annual review, which will be kicked off by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and myself in Brussels on 18 October.  Our US counterparts will need to provide answers to the challenges that we identified at last year’s annual review. I will not simply repeat the same in the second annual review. I expect the United States to stick to its commitments, including on finding a permanent solution on the Ombudsperson.  Let me also stress that the data protection supervisory authorities have been, and will be, strongly associated with the work of the Commission, including with the second annual review.  I count on your support so that ahead of the second annual review we can transmit a strong EU message of urgency to the United States, and I look forward to hearing your views on this important topic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 273, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Axel VOSS", "mepid": "96761", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done It is a stupid situation in which we find ourselves.

In addition, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are now appearing. So from the PPE-DE point of view, we have to say that, in principle, the agreement works well, and the idea of improving the Privacy Shield after each review and making it better is also good and right.

Compared to the predecessor Safe Harbour, with which the Commission has already suffered shipwreck, there are improvements to the Privacy Shield. But is that enough to achieve data protection in the US that is essentially in line with EU rules? That alone is the yardstick by which Privacy Shield must be measured. Unfortunately, it does not meet this standard at the moment. The list of concerns remains long: inadequate protection against profiling, weak oversight by the ombudsman, for which there is still no permanent occupation, the independent US civil liberties watchdog is not fully quorum, important reports on the extent of intelligence surveillance are withheld from the public, it is difficult to defend against data abuse, no protection against state mass surveillance, and no protection against data abuse by companies, as the last Facebook/Cambridge analytic underlines. The risk is therefore high that the European Court of Justice will collect the Privacy Shield, as Safe Harbour did. And even today, companies that have a well-functioning legal department say they don't rely on ePrivacy as a privacy foundation, it's too uncertain for them. Some Conservative colleagues are running as supporters of the small businesses that need this protection. But what is the point of a start-up that does not offer sufficient protection and may not even exist in a year's time? That is why we are calling for the Privacy Shield to be repealed if the US Government does not finally address the existing problems.

EU data protection law itself is complex and trying to marry that with the obligations of a third country is not always easy, but this is not a reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater, especially as many EU governments themselves are struggling to implement the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The focus should be on how we improve enforcement and there are some very useful suggestions in this resolution that we support. However, proposing to suspend the Shield is irresponsible and driven by the false assumption that the US is some sort of regulatory Wild West, which it clearly isn’t. There are no grounds to judge the US as non—compliant, as the Commission has just said. Such a proposal would hurt Europeans. It risks going back to a contractual system with fewer protections, less clarity for consumers who want to apply their rights and more onerous paperwork and legal fees for our SMEs. The Shield deserves our full scrutiny and inspection, but there is a big difference between scrutiny and sabotage.

You have to be compliant: full stop. If they are not compliant then, indeed, the Commission should suspend the Privacy Shield. The point is that they have not been compliant for the past nearly two years. This is not a matter of there being some technical problems, they just don’t want to implement. The political will is not there. If they really do want to implement, then they can follow our resolution that says ‘Comply by 1 September’. They have another two months: what’s the problem? If they really want to – and this is America, they can do anything – surely they can implement the Privacy Shield? And if they cannot do that in two months, what makes us believe they can do it in three months or in a year? We are fooling our citizens here because what we’re talking about is not the presumption of compliance, it’s the pretence of compliance. In the current situation we are pretending that citizens are covered by the protection of personal data, whereas that is not the case. We have a duty to our citizens here. If anybody wants to protect businesses, and they have a right to legal protection as well, then two things should happen. The first is that we should not be talking here about a resolution, we should be talking to the Americans and telling them to get their act together and implement right now. The second thing that needs to be done is that we have to stop making bad laws and bad agreements that do not comply with the Treaties and with EU law, and which, every single time, have to be thrown out by the Court of Justice. They are doing our homework and we are doing a disservice to our citizens. So let’s get serious about data protection.

Following the Commission's initial review, EU Data Protection Supervisors identified a number of shortcomings in the Privacy Shield. They are threatening to take legal action to the European Court of Justice unless massive improvements are made. As confirmed, the revelations about the NSA's interception centers in eight central AT&amp;T hubs came to light recently – a clear violation of the ECJ's requirements in its ruling that brought down Safe Harbour.

And since the Facebook scandal, political sentiment in the US has also moved toward data protection laws.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her The evaluation of the Privacy Shield has shown one thing quite clearly: the Privacy Shield is not a shield for fundamental rights at all, but a fig leaf for the fair-leavers. Neither the US Ombudsman is independent – and we have criticised this from the outset – nor is there any proper oversight by the competent trade authority, and the Europeans do not really have a real remedy, an effective remedy, against the US Government. And the surveillance laws have not been changed, but have been extended. The mass data collection goes on as if nothing had happened. Perhaps the United States should first adopt a sensible data protection system, then we really would not have to do the circus that we are organising here without interruption any longer. I would remind you once again: yes, Safe Harbour was cancelled by the ECJ because of mass surveillance and not because of an unsightly name. We just call it different now.

The Privacy Shield does not provide adequate data protection, and this is not in line with the General Data Protection Regulation. If you will, that is illegal.

We also have to ensure that the EU reaps the maximum benefits from the Privacy Shield and that our citizens’ data is protected efficiently. Indeed, there are outstanding issues within the framework that need to be addressed in order to ensure its success; I accept that. However, revoking the Privacy Shield is not a solution. Companies’ compliance with their obligations must be monitored more effectively and frequent searches will be necessary to deal with companies that may make false claims regarding their involvement in the framework. Significantly, it enables European SMEs to work with their US trade partners, without cumbersome negotiations on data transfer for their businesses. The Privacy Shield cuts administrative burdens hugely for nearly 3 000 companies already certified. As PPE negotiator on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I am very conscious of the seriousness of protecting citizens’ personal data and companies’ compliance with data protection—related obligations. The Privacy Shield includes sanctions to effectively deal with violations by participating companies including, if necessary, their removal from the Privacy Shield list, which will have a deterrent effect for participant companies.  Therefore, I do not agree with those who say that we should suspend the Privacy Shield. I think the Commissioner and colleagues such as Mr Voss and Mr Dalton have said this would be a mistake. I agree with them. Efforts should be focused on improved monitoring of compliance within the framework, rather than suspending the deal altogether and definitely we should try that before we talk about suspension. After all, it took a long time to get Safe Harbour replaced by the Privacy Shield. To throw the Privacy Shield out now would not be a good idea.

As many of the speakers mentioned, there are also concerns regarding small and medium-sized European enterprises. I well remember the time after 6 October 2016 when Safe Harbour was annulled by the European Court of Justice. What we heard from the big American companies, first of all, was that yes, they would cope with the situation and would make individual arrangements as they have an army of lawyers, but I heard from small and medium-sized European companies that there was panic and a big problem of sudden legal uncertainty. That is why we worked so hard on creating the new system, fully tailored to the requirements of the European Court of Justice in the Schrems case. I came here to share with you my conviction that, with the Privacy Shield, other protection of the data of Europeans is better guaranteed, but I openly admit that the system does not work absolutely perfectly and that we need to impose continuing and increasing pressure on the US administration to fulfil all the commitments, because if they do not do so I will not hesitate to suspend the shield. But this time has not yet come. We still have to take some time before the second annual review and give them the chance to do what is necessary.  One more point of a formal nature: this is not an agreement, this is a unilateral decision of the Commission, and we are taking our responsibility very seriously. I myself was fully aware that by adopting the decision on the Privacy Shield I was becoming jointly responsible for what is happening to the data of European people on US territory, and this is a strong factor compelling me to be very vigilant and to do everything possible to achieve the goal of protection of European data in the full sense, which is essentially equivalent to what we have under the General Data Protection Regulation rules. We know where the weaknesses of the system are and, as I said, we pushed the Americans to come forward with improvements. We have seen some improvements, but there are still things to be done. Especially, I do not understand why there is still no fully fledged Ombudsperson in office, and that has to be achieved as soon as possible.  I think that if the European Union has one strong voice we will achieve much more than if we send differing signals to the USA, and I appreciate Parliament’s continuing support for having as high as possible a level protection of European people’s data overseas. Thank you for this debate and for your sustained support, and I can only repeat that the Commission is fully committed to doing everything possible in order to have better news in the second annual review.

It is clear from this fact that the US side somewhat underestimates EU-US cooperation on privacy. In practice so far, our partners behind the Great Puddle have mostly taken unilateral steps before bilateral negotiations have taken place. A classic case is data relating to air passengers between the EU and the US. Another interesting feature is the lax approach of Congress, which, among other things, rejected a proposal by the Federal Commission to protect customers of broadband and other telecommunications services. In the context of the data-sharing scandal by Facebook, up to 60 different companies are taking similar steps in the EU with little understanding. By the way, facebook was found to have provided personal data to more than 2 million EU citizens for commercial use.

As part of the global efforts to fight corruption, cross—border tax fraud and tax evasion, EU Member States have concluded bilateral intergovernmental agreements with the USA in order to implement FATCA, obliging European financial institutions to report to the US tax authorities all the holdings of their customers who are so—called ‘US persons’. I would like to emphasise that the Committee on Petitions and the Parliament strongly support tax transparency and all the efforts being made to fight tax fraud. However, more than eight years after FATCA’s adoption, while unilateralism and protectionism unfortunately appear to be the cornerstones of US foreign policy, it is now high time to assess the extraterritorial effects of FATCA on thousands and thousands of law-abiding EU citizens and their families. Therefore, in 2016, a collective of European citizens from nine different Member States submitted a petition to Parliament, to my committee, alerting us via the committee about the impact of FATCA, and its implementing intergovernmental agreements, on European citizens. They testified to the violation of various fundamental principles of EU law, including the right to respect for private life, the prohibition of discrimination, and data protection rules, as well as the EU Payment Accounts Directive. All this was brought to our attention and, to tell you the truth, it was shocking. In practice, FATCA has affected a large number of citizens in Europe, such as citizens who are nationals of both the USA and an EU Member State and, in particular, the so—called ‘accidental Americans’ who, by accident of birth, inherited US citizenship but who maintain no ties at all to the USA, never having lived, worked or studied there, and do not hold US social security numbers. They are, in many cases, completely unaware that they are US citizens. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to search for US persons by looking at a variety of indicators, including indicators of power of attorney over the account of a US person with a US address, against which the individual is required to prove that he or she is not a US person. Because non—compliance with the requirement imposed results in heavy fines for financial institutions, many of them in the EU have responded by avoiding all commercial business with customers presenting any US connection, whether actual or not. This appears to be in breach of the Payment Accounts Directive and the right of all EU citizens to have access, without discrimination, to a payment account with basic features. In addition, financial institutions have to disclose detailed information on accounts held by presumed so—called US persons to the US Internal Revenue Service via their national governments. This – and I am eager to convey this message to the Commission this evening – could constitute a breach of EU data protection rules and EU fundamental rights and, therefore, it requires further investigation. The lives and livelihoods of thousands of citizens in the EU are at stake here. Those falling within the definition of US persons have their savings accounts frozen, they have no access to banking services, including life insurance, pensions and mortgages due to the reluctance of financial institutions to follow the FATCA reporting. Their family members are also affected. These issues need to be addressed at EU level, all together. Commissioner, it is now high time that the Commission took appropriate action to protect the rights of the European citizens affected, in particular the so-called ‘accidental Americans’. I wonder how the Commission and the Council intend to include the situation of accidental Americans in your transposition assessment of the Payment Accounts Directive. More generally, a full impact assessment of FATCA on EU citizens is badly needed now to determine whether a serious discrepancy exists between EU citizens and residents in different Member States with regard to data protection. Last, but not least, a common EU approach, and in particular an EU-US agreement on FATCA, could in fact prove to be more effective in ensuring reciprocity and upholding the fundamental principles of EU law. I very much look forward to hearing from both the Commission and the Council on the diplomatic and legislative steps that you are considering in order to protect the rights and interests of the EU citizens concerned against the effects of FATCA.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 289, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, as the honourable Member is aware, the Payment Accounts Directive is an important piece of legislation that improves access by citizens to basic banking services. A number of measures to ensure access to a basic payment account were suggested by the Commission in its recommendation of July 2011, and these measures were supported by Parliament in its resolution of 4 July 2012. In July 2014, Parliament and the Council enacted a Payment Accounts Directive, which has been in application since September 2016 and all Member States have notified transposition of the measures contained in the Directive.  However, it is for the Commission to assess the implementation of EU legislation by the Member States and in particular the correct transposition of the Payment Accounts Directive. We trust that the Commission will carefully assess whether it has been correctly implemented by all Member States and will take any appropriate measures in the case of any breach. When it comes to the US legislation on FATCA and its possible extraterritorial effects, let me state the following: it is a principle of international law that the sovereignty of each state implies that it can freely define its taxpayers. Therefore, it is not for the Council to interpret the legal provisions concerning taxpayers in specific non-EU countries. The double taxation situations which can arise from that principle are solved through bilateral agreements based on international arrangements such as the OECD ones. It is not the role of the Council either to interpret intergovernmental agreements concluded by Member States and the US, or to evaluate the impact that they may have on citizens. In light of these considerations the possibility for the negotiation of an EU-US agreement on FATCA has not been discussed by the Council. Finally, on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): as the honourable Member is aware, this entered into application on 25 May. The GDPR provides that processing of personal data, such as the disclosure of personal data on bank accounts, is only lawful if its processing has a legal basis such as an international agreement between an EU Member State and the US. Moreover, the GDPR applies to the processing of personal data regardless of whether the processing of the data takes place within the European Union or not.  Therefore, the same data protection rules apply to all data subjects who are in the European Union, including EU citizens and residents irrespective of which Member State they are staying in. Furthermore, the GDPR sets out harmonised rules for transfers and disclosures of personal data from the EU to non-EU countries.

Member States chose not to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate an EU agreement, preferring bilateral agreements. I would also like to underline that the information exchange requirements under the Act, as such, are similar to those in our EU directive on mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation and to the OECD global Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, which is currently being implemented by over 100 jurisdictions.  At the same time, the Commission acknowledges that FATCA and the related intergovernmental agreements may have the unintended effect of hindering access to financial services in the EU for persons regarded by the US authorities as American citizens or tax residents. This includes ‘accidental Americans’ – people who were born in the United States or to United States parents and who may not have any other connection to the United States. As Parliament rightly states in the oral question, US tax rules are based on citizenship. As a result, anyone holding US citizenship, anyone residing mostly in the United States or entitled to permanent residence in the United States will be subject to US tax obligations. This has been acknowledged at international level and in the tax treaties signed by the US with all Member States. The Commission understands that one of the practical problems that EU financial institutions are confronted with is that they need a US tax identification or social security number to report the financial information required under FATCA to the United States tax authorities. However, customers who are subject to FATCA may not have such a number, and obtaining it seems to be cumbersome and potentially costly. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that similar reporting obligations are required under the Directive on Administrative Cooperation and at international level through the OECD global Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Information.  Concerning the possible discrimination towards consumers and their right to payment accounts, all consumers who are legally resident in the EU, including real and accidental Americans, are entitled to open a basic payment account, irrespective of their nationality or Member State of residence, under the Payment Accounts Directive. Should Member States not enforce this directive, the Commission will decide on appropriate measures, including the launching of an infringement procedure. Member States appear to have followed similar approaches to the issue. They have concluded bilateral agreements with the United States based on the same model. National legislation implementing the agreements has to be in line with the requirements of EU data protection law and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. When national data protection authorities analysed the issue in February 2018, they found that there had been no occasions where the processing and transfer of data to the United States under FATCA had to be prohibited.

Of course, it is true that, as a country, you must also have the opportunity to collect your taxpayers anywhere in the world, wherever they are. That's all true. But we, as the Committee on Petitions, are dealing with a special group of people, of petitioners, who have come to American citizenship almost ignorantly or unintentionally. An example that can be presented to you: The birth of a child cannot always be determined precisely on schedule. The child is born in the United States, then the parents return to Europe with the child, and the child has American citizenship. They don't even know that. This doesn't matter until you come of age. Now one could say with a little gallows humour: By the way, they also have an advantage, they can then suddenly become American president, which is denied to the others. But of course, this has a lot of consequences in everyday life: the bad news when you try to open a bank account. You have said that this is generally possible, but the banks are doing this somewhat subcutaneously. They don't say ,you don't get a bank account\" if they feel somehow, there's a risk, and they have to pass on data that they probably wouldn't like to pass on. Then they prefer to refer the customer elsewhere. It gets even worse when you apply for a loan. In the credit procedure, the creditworthiness of the person concerned must be determined. He has a risk, because he doesn't know if he has to pay taxes in America at all or not. As a rule, the safe way will be taken, and in principle they will not receive any loans. What, of course, usually annoyed us a little as a committee on petitions: normally we would have to say that this is also a question of European citizenship, and That Europe should stand together here.

An \"accidental American\" is, contrary to what the name says, a European citizen whom the United States considers to be somehow related to American nationality, whether by ancestry, birth or even, in some cases, by mistake.  The consequences are dramatic for these individuals because what they are being asked to do is to comply with U.S. taxation by paying five years of back taxes in the United States. In practical terms, what does it look like? It is considered that with arrears plus legal fees, you must have at least 30,000 euros but, in some cases, this can go up to 60,000, 80,000 or even more than 100,000 euros to be paid to comply. If you do not, you are denied access to the most basic banking services. So you would think that we are dealing with marginal cases, but that is not the case at all, since a study on barely a quarter of the European Union reports more than 100,000 people involved.

If the situation of citizens is not your concern, then what are you doing here? It is our prime concern, and you know what the funny thing is, there are only two  countries in the world that have citizen-based taxation. One is the US, the other is Eritrea, and when Eritrea came here to Europe and tried to impose taxes on Eritrean citizens here, everybody reacted. Apparently, then, it was our concern. So what is different now?  So you think that international relations are more important than the interests of your own citizens. That’s funny, and the other thing that is also funny is that when I started to dig into this, six years ago, I got the same answer: ‘Oh, you know, taxation – there is nothing we can do. Americans decide on their own system; we hardly have any talks with the Americans about this’. But then I made a request for access to documents, and I got 14 000 documents: correspondence between the European Commission and the US authorities on FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act). So why are you saying that it doesn’t concern you? What you are saying is that you consider your relationship with the American authorities more important than the rights of citizens. And we are not just talking about basic bank accounts: we are talking about getting a mortgage loan to buy a house, which I think is a fundamental right, or a business loan for an SME, which we were just talking about. So if you can tell Eritrea off, surely you can tell the United States off too. We are talking about at least 110 000 citizens in just seven countries of the European Union, so we are probably talking hundreds of thousands. You have just started your Presidency. Maybe it would be a good start, even before the summer break, to show a little more concern for the interests of European citizens. So I expect the European Council to start talks with the United States about the abolition of citizen-based taxation or, at the very least, an exemption for EU citizens, because it is your duty.

I agree with the appeal made by my fellow Members: this is a problem that needs to be addressed not only at European Commission level, but I call on the Council to take this problem seriously, which must be resolved urgently, and to show greater commitment to it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 296, "date": "2018-07-04.json", "name": "Alex MAYER", "mepid": "185637", "text": "   – Madam President, panicked, isolated and scared: that’s how 73—year-old Cambridge pensioner Merryn Grimley says she felt when she got a threatening letter telling her she needed to pay US tax.

These are European citizens who find themselves in a very special situation because they are faced with a country, the United States, which has put in place a system of acquiring nationality that does not exist anywhere else, so there is no point in talking about reciprocity. There is a particular problem with the terms and conditions of acquisition of U.S. citizenship, and you must take this into account. There is also a problem with the way in which the United States has implemented its extraterritoriality, which, again, has an impact. But, Commissioner, I really invite you to meet these 'accidental Americans'. These are people who find themselves in a situation as European citizens, mainly, totally discriminated against. The logic of FATCA enforcement can lead them to become non-banked, because banks do not like to have to deal with the implementation of the FACTA Act. So you are telling us that it is not our jurisdiction. Of course, the states wanted to retain jurisdiction when it comes to negotiating a tax treaty or an agreement, but that is not the issue. What is at stake in the end is how did our banks bend and ask their states to comply with the implementation of the FACTA Act in order to continue to benefit from access to the U.S. market and not have their revenues taxed at 30%. As a result, it is really becoming a subject of negotiation between financial markets.

I have heard also the input from the Commission and from the MEPs who stayed late this evening to fight for the people affected, and I fully appreciate this.  I understand some Member States have been in contact bilaterally with the US authorities over concerns linked to the implementation of FATCA. Against the background regarding the question which was raised – and I would rather say the ‘accusation’ raised by MEP in ‘t Veld several times – which is why the EU is more actively and pursuing the issue, I would like to state that the EU has not yet been called on to take collective action, since Member States have been dealing with this issue individually in close cooperation with the US. And to MEP in ‘t Veld (I see that you have changed your place – I thought you were leaving already, so I am happy that you are still here), I would prefer to be quoted correctly. I said that it is not the role of the Council to evaluate the impact of an intergovernmental agreement concluded by Member States and the US. That is not the role of the Council. And I would state that again, because what we are talking about here are bilateral agreements. Nevertheless, the Payment Account Directive contains a detailed review clause. The Commission has been requested both by the Council and by the European Parliament to submit a report three years after implementation of the Directive, accompanied by any appropriate proposals. The report will deal, in particular, with infringements to the application of the directive.  The report should also highlight the number of credit institutions offering payment accounts with basic features, the associate fees, the characteristics of the consumers who have opened payment accounts with basic features, as well as best practices for reducing consumers’ exclusion from access to payment services. However, the Presidency will of course remain available for exchanges on the subject as needed, and is ready to be in touch with the Commission.
