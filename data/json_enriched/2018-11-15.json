Unfortunately, it is very telling that Sirpa cannot present this report in person today precisely because of her caring responsibilities. Sirpa, we keep our fingers crossed that everything is fine! To begin with, I would like to point out that the report is temporarily and thematically linked to the legislative work-life balance package, which contains proposals from the European Commission on a minimum standard for parental leave, as well as paternity leave and carers' leave. Sirpa Petikainen's report complements this legislative package, showing the current situation and challenges in care services, both for children and for vulnerable adults. Why are we considering care services today in the context of women's rights? Because this very difficult, demanding work is done primarily by women. If they take care of a family member, sometimes they have to give up their normal activities, sometimes they work for years without a single day of leave. Their work is free of charge, and if they do it for another family, even if it is paid, it is very often undeclared work. 80% of care services and services in the domestic worker sector in general are black work without social security, without a future, without a pension. This report deals with what is most important in every person's life – human dignity. We are talking here, in this report, about women, also because caring for dependent persons is the first obstacle to women's participation in the labour market. Career breaks, subsequent career starts, procrastination of promotion, because children, early exit from the labour market, because parents require care, choosing educational and professional paths that allow them to be available to the family and not to the employer result in lower wages, slower increases, periods of inactivity and, as a result, a low pension. I would remind you that the pension gap in the European Union is currently 38%. As caring responsibilities are the first obstacle to professional achievement for women, ensuring accessible and quality care services for children and adults is the first duty of politicians and policy makers in this regard. Demographics are unrelenting – care needs are on the rise, the problem is getting more serious and will grow, and women are the victims of a lack of effective solutions. Regulating this market, formalising care work and finding solutions for the health and financial security of informal carers are the main thesis of the Report by Sirpa Petikainen, to whom the political groups have tabled many amendments and thank you very much for all these amendments on behalf of the rapporteur. The rapporteur raises many important and urgent care needs in the report. draws attention to the fact that caring objectives are most effectively pursued in the family and environmental rather than institutional systems; It further stresses the importance of such home-based care, based on relationships with family and friends, and calls for infrastructure and organisational solutions that strengthen home, family and environmental care. It is essential that every type of care is supported regardless of the professional status of the caregiver, that is to say, that it is accessible to both full-time and part-time workers and the unemployed, and that the burden of care policies, the main direction of their development, should be based on home care, chamber care and not on institutions. On behalf of the PPE Group, I support this report, while pointing out that, with regard to some of the amendments tabled by our colleagues in other political groups concerning the separate taxation of women and men, the inclusion of monitoring of care systems in the European Semester or the translation of the burden of care into institutions, our political group will vote against, as these are proposals that interfere with subsidiarity and family policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-11-15.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Parliament and the rapporteur, Sirpa Pietikäinen, for the work done on this dossier, which highlights some key elements and issues to tackle with regard to care services. The Commission shares the Parliament’s position that such services are crucial for gender equality, in particular to allow women’s equal participation in the labour market and for women’s empowerment and the work-life balance of working parents and carers.  This was also part of the work-life balance legislative proposal and the Action Plan to tackle the gender pay gap of November 2017. Ensuring that women and men can combine work with care duties is a key element to close the gender employment gap. Two sides of the same coin are important: having working arrangements that allow workers to combine it with care responsibilities and having access to affordable and high—quality care services for children and other dependents.  This will help tackle the gender pay gap, as was highlighted at the Equal Pay Day just a few weeks ago. Having access to care services and working arrangements adapted to one’s care needs are determinant for women to achieve their full employment potential. In addition, the value of women’s work and equal pay for work of equal value are crucial. Indeed, women often carry out care work. It is therefore important to reflect upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the current equal pay provisions, for which I intend to launch an open consultation over the next couple of weeks. The work-life balance proposal is also important in this context. It will offer choices for working parents and is closely linked to affordable childcare facilities. We are making good progress in the trilogues and I hope that we will be able to finalise them before the end of the year. With regard to childcare, the Commission adopted a report on the Barcelona objectives on 8 May this year. While the overall targets for childcare have been reached on average for the EU, less than half of the Member States have met these targets. In order to meet the targets, childcare should not only be available, but also be affordable and of high quality. This is essential for the social inclusion of children from a disadvantaged background, in order for them to have a good educational start in life.  The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a Council recommendation on affordable and high-quality early childhood education and care systems, including a quality framework based on principles of availability, affordability, inclusion, a good educational programme, professionalisation and good working conditions for educational staff, good governance and monitoring.  Overall, I would like to recall that these issues are monitored in the European Semester process and are reflected in many national reports. Funding through the European Structural and Investment Funds should be prioritised, particularly for those countries lagging behind. I look forward to this debate today.

This sector is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, it is the Member States that have an interest in improving the conditions for all workers in these services, whether they are women or men. It is the Member States that must emphasise the quality and accessibility of all care services. I, of course, see the link between this report and the Directive on the re-organisation of private and working life. In this area, I also support the inclusion of care time in leave so that carers have the best possible conditions for their work. However, the competences of the Member States must be respected in this matter. The gender perspective applies only to care services to a limited way. The report in this regard, I dare say, is not balanced and omers a number of factors that should be taken into account, because care services are indeed comprehensive, they affect other aspects such as age, such as vulnerable groups and other factors. I consider it problematic, inter alia, that there is a call for separate taxation of spouses, for the broadest possible concept of family, for the Commission to regulate and control the quality of services, to establish a binding framework for minimum standards for working conditions in the sector and to guarantee financial support for carers. In my opinion, these and other points significantly interfere with the competence of the Member States. I dare say that not only in my opinion, but also according to part of the Group of the European People's Party.

This has a lot to do with the problem that currently exists in the pay gap and pension gap. It is scandalous that in 21st-century Europe women are receiving an average of 45% less in pensions than men. And another revealing fact also drawn from the report is how austerity policies have contributed to the deterioration of public services, so fundamental to achieving this principle of conciliation and co-responsibility. We therefore welcome the report and emphasize compliance with those requests to advance the reconciliation of family and work life and co-responsibility. That is why we are also calling here today for an agreement on the part of the Council and for negotiations with this Parliament with the Parental Leave Directive. It's critical. It's indispensable. Women have been reconciling all our lives. Now we also need it to be our companions, that it is men who are incorporated into this task. In addition, this report also refers to the need for social rights and pension recognition systems to be taken into account with caregivers. And so I emphasize here initiatives such as that of the Government of Spain, with its draft budgets, which includes re-incorporating women who care for dependents into social security systems.

So much for the diversity they talk about a lot.

Even today, 80% of the care services provided in the Union are for unpaid caregivers, 75% to 80% of whom are women.  The trend in Europe is negative: over the past ten years, women's time in care, domestic work and social activities has increased compared to men. This has serious economic and social consequences, it is an obstacle to achieving the Union's objectives on gender equality.  It's time to change this. It is time for us to take care of others as a key social task that marks the level of well-being and even the moral level of a society.  It is time for care services to be recognised and regulated as what they are: a European pillar of social rights.

Why is that? And because the emancipation of women at home is much slower than in the professional sphere. After all, most often, if a woman chooses a career, it is understood as an additional choice of her next to the unpaid care of children or sick family members, or household chores. Women are still punished if they choose to have both a career and a family. However, it is not only women who suffer as a result. This affects society. Yes, the first, most important step towards equality has been taken not only at work, but also at home, which I once again want to thank the European Commission, and thank you, Commissioner. I am referring to the proposal for a Work-Private Life Balance Directive. I would also like to call on the Council not to make a mistake and not to detract from this long-awaited legislation to one that does not bring tangible benefits.

Let me react on several comments here regarding the competence of the European Union to legislate and to come with measures in this area.  The Commission analysed very thoroughly the legal competences of the EU in this field of a combination of work and family duties, and as you mentioned here the family matters fall under the competence of the Member States, while gender equality is the competence of the EU, and also we have a very strong economical case because we see in all the Member States, without any exception, that the situation is not sustainable, that we cannot continue like that, that we have to enable women who want to work to work and to share also the family duties. I speak about the unsustainability of the current situation and economically inadvisable solution because we have at this moment more than 60% of the graduates at universities who are women, and then we do not use the potential of women at all or only in a limited way. Many of you mentioned here the worrying demographic line. This is something we have to do a lot about and while speaking about the social services we have a tendency to speak about the problem of women. No, this is the problem of the whole society. If we do not solve this problem, we will have in the near future a very strong issue. The Commission’s position on how to solve the problem was to respect the limited competences we have, but to use them in full, and this is reflected in our work-life balance package which, as you know, is the combination of legislative and non-legislative measures. As for the legislation, you know very well what we are proposing. As for non-legislative measures, we are recommending that the Member States take steps to have a fairer social and tax system which does not bring disadvantages to women who are usually considered to be the first parents, and also we are addressing the Member States through country-specific recommendations, where we are proposing to increase the salaries in the jobs in the social services sphere and in the jobs which are predominantly occupied by women, it means the education, social services and health sector. Among the non-legislative proposals, there is also a very strong recommendation to use more public funding for better social services which will be more achievable or accessible and more affordable for all the people who need such services, and I heard from this side of the Parliament that this is the money of the Member States, so they should have a sovereign the competence to decide. Well, we recommend something regarding the EU money, the EU structural funds, where for many years the position of the Commission was that the social services fall under the national competence and it is the traditional, the classical cost, so it should be covered by the Member States. This Commission came with a change of paradigm, we said no, this is not the cost, this is investment and this is investment which has a very quick and high return of investment which pays off and which can be covered by EU money, and this is a change, and some Member States reacted positively on that and some are still maybe hesitating. We want to do everything to through the work-life balance package. The trialogs are on a good track and I do hope that it will be one of our legacies that we came with the legislation which can bring a real difference for the lives of people. Last comment on work-life balance legislation. No, we are not dictating how the people should live. We are not dictating how the people in the family, the men/women, should divide their duties. We are just doing what I am sure is our obligation, opening wider variety of choices for working parents and for carers to combine better their duties in the family and at the workplace. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for this debate. Thank you once again for the important report which is coherent with what the Commission wants and plans and tries to promote.

Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for I sincerely thank you for all the comments and comments made during this debate to the very important report by Sirpa Pietikäinen. I thank Commissioner Jourova for her declaration of support for care policy at European Union level and for the work-life balance package, which is now being discussed in the trilogue, and I keep my fingers crossed that these talks will be successful.  The issue of caring for dependent persons – both children, adults and people with disabilities – requires urgent action in the Member States. From the European Parliament, we call on all those who take decisions on this matter to take urgent action. The problem of care is a problem for women, because the carers are primarily women. Most of them, as we said here today, work free of charge or illegally without social security, without a pension in the future, without leave, straining their health and strength. This is unfair and needs to be changed also because caring responsibilities are the first obstacle for women to pursue work, and breaks and restrictions at work result in a pension gap of 40% in the world's richest economy. We need good quality care services, most of which are provided in the family and environmental system. We need a salary for the work of a caregiver and to take that work into account when calculating the pension. We need support for informal carers regardless of their professional status so that they do not have to give up their jobs in order to be cared for by their loved ones. We need urgent solutions at Member State level, as well as a European strategy and plan, so that national policies can be implemented more effectively. Ensuring accessible and quality care services for children and adults is the first duty of politicians and decision-makers, that is, us too. Why? Because demographics are inexorable.

Meanwhile, women are at increased risk of poverty, especially single-parent families and pensioners. Unacceptable and inexplicable if you ask me.

Unpaid work as a household or care should not force people to work part-time. Let us give everyone the opportunity to make a work-life balance themselves, without gender having an impact on it. Mr President, equality does not come naturally, it is time for action and there is much to do. Extending paternity leave is an example of this.

There is no factual information on the prevalence of Lyme disease. Prevalence figures are based on guesswork and vary greatly depending on the source. In many countries, Lyme disease is still not recorded in any way and is of great importance for the seriousness of Lyme disease and, for example, for the allocation of research appropriations. There are a wide range of different views on Lyme disease treatment practices. Lyme disease is primarily treated with antibiotics. In general, it is agreed that the best treatment results are obtained when treatment can be started at an early stage. In contrast, differing views differ from each other on the dosage of the drug, the length of treatment period and the treatment of chronic Lyme disease. The symptoms of those with Lyme disease are very individual and some of the diseases are associated with severe additional infections. There may be a number of problems with antibody tests, such as the fact that the production of antibodies has not yet started because it is too short a time since the infections or because the antibodies are bound to immuno-complexes. The study of Lyme disease and related additional infections is currently woefully inadequate. The effectiveness of the various treatments should be started very quickly to explore more extensively. An important research topic is also the chronicisation of Lyme disease. Patients whose symptoms persist even after long courses of antibiotics are unfortunately often left without rehabilitation and treatment. And their fitness and ability to work have often been lost for a long time, even permanently. Little progress has already been made, as Lyme neuroborreliosis has been added to infectious diseases covered by epidemiological surveillance, but more and more efforts are needed to combat Lyme disease and to raise awareness of Lyme disease. It must be possible to harmonise and improve the treatment practices of the Member States and, above all, to improve access to care for patients, clients. In addition, diagnostics need to be refined and we would like to have a vaccine against Lyme Lyme Lyme Lyme disease one day. With regard to the above problems, the challenges, we would like to kindly ask the Commission for answers, solutions, plans for the future and ideas on this matter. Unfortunately, the number of ticks is growing very strongly in Europe and their geographical prevalence is constantly expanding. This is thought to be due to the climate mildening brought about by climate change. Even in northern Europe, frosty winters are soon a rarity, and this especially favors ticks and their host animals. In this respect, therefore, the future does not look any better, quite the opposite. The number of people with Lyme disease is expected to continue to increase. That is why we hope for rapid action to rectify this. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment and throughout parliament for their very good cooperation and strong support. I would like to thank both the International Association for Lyme Lyme Lyme and the national associations for their work in improving the status of people with Lyme disease, and in particular I would like to thank our Irish colleague, Liadh Ní Riada, who has been valiantly addressing this issue for years.

Recent studies estimate that the incidence of Lyme disease at 22 cases per 100 000 persons per year, with a steadily increasing occurrence in several Member States. In the absence of a consistent surveillance system in the past, it remains difficult to accurately assess the overall trend of Lyme disease.

Currently, there is no vaccine against Lyme disease so the recommendation is to take general prevention methods, such as tick awareness, appropriate clothing in tick-infested areas and the removal of attached ticks. These are particularly important for citizens living in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and high-risk groups, such as agricultural and forestry workers. Let me now address each of the questions you raised. Question one: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Member State experts worked on a proposal to include Lyme disease on the EU list of notifiable diseases. However, the diagnosis of Lyme disease is challenging, as the symptoms are varied and often non—specific. In addition, different diagnostic criteria and tests are used in different countries. Thus, the disease may go undetected, with the subsequent risk of developing serious chronic manifestations. Neuroborreliosis is the most serious complication of the Borrelia bacterial infection, seen in about 10% of patients with Lyme disease. The definition of neuroborreliosis is more standardised than other Lyme disease manifestations, with the possibility to confirm cases based on a common EU case definition.  This is why, based on a scientific assessment, it was therefore decided to include Lyme neuroborreliosis in the list of EU notifiable diseases under the decision on serious cross—border threats to health. The Commission remains fully committed to tackle the disease, working with Member States to strengthen prevention, surveillance and control of Lyme disease. As a key element, the decision on serious cross—border threats to health, which I have just mentioned, provides for epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases through the use of comparable and compatible data. Question two: with the recent inclusion of Lyme neuroborreliosis in the list of EU notifiable diseases, all EU and EEA Member States are required to report such cases using the standard EU case definition. The epidemiological information on neuroborreliosis will be collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, starting in 2019 for cases diagnosed in 2018. In time, this will allow a better evaluation of the disease prevalence and trend of Lyme disease in Europe. Cooperation on surveillance, prevention and control between Member States is ongoing, coordinated by the centre. Question three: the centre is actively contributing to enhance awareness about Lyme disease among professionals and the general population. Several publications and tools are available, including information about the disease and the vector infographics disease fact-sheets for professionals and health practitioners and a communication toolkit on tick-borne diseases and preventive measures against tick bites. To strengthen preparedness and exchange of best practices, the Commission organised a workshop on the challenges of managing outbreaks of vector-borne diseases in September 2017. The centre has also conducted community preparedness case studies, including on Lyme disease, focusing on synergies on community and hospitals. Question four: as regards diagnostic practices, reporting of Lyme neuroborreliosis cases from 2018 onwards will be done according to a common case definition and diagnostic criteria. This will help to allow for a more accurate picture of the prevalence of Lyme disease in the EU. In addition, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has conducted a systematic literature review on the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for Lyme disease. It will start collecting data on the laboratory methods to evaluate the diagnosis for Lyme neuroborreliosis in 2019.  Question five: as you know, the Commission is not in a position to harmonise treatment practices as this falls within the competence of the Member States. This being said, the Commission is committed to help develop new and better diagnostics for Lyme disease. This effort has seen significant financial support in recent years. Question six: let me highlight that there is indeed currently very significant funding behind efforts to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in the EU. The Commission has recently supported research on improved diagnostics that will permit early and accurate diagnosis of Lyme disease through the provision of EUR 7.8 million. It is also worth noting that, in 2016, the European Investment Bank granted EUR 25 million for the development of a Lyme vaccine. Additionally, the Commission has provided EUR 3 million to fund the development of an anti-tick vaccine aiming to protect against all tick-borne diseases in Europe. The remaining two years of Horizon 2020, and in particular its forthcoming calls for research and innovation project proposals, will offer further opportunities to support research on Lyme disease. We now need to implement a robust Lyme disease surveillance to have a clearer picture on the disease burden and trends across the EU. We will further focus on awareness raising, improving community preparedness and prevention and supporting research efforts to develop new diagnostic methods and vaccines. I hope, and indeed trust, you share the intention to drive matters forward, to strengthen prevention and reduce the prevalence and the suffering associated with Lyme disease.

We have very different practices across Member States, and patients are also at higher costs as a result.  A common approach at European Union level is needed.

In Lower Austria we had a deputy governor who was stabbed by a tick; the whole thing was not recognized in time, so in the end it led to him needing a heart transplant to survive at all. In order not to repeat this dramatic example too often in Europe, I believe that we need very specific plans to detect Lyme disease in good time, to have data so that we also know how we treat it, and, as you have also mentioned, research into vaccination is essential. What we also need is to educate the population. Not only those who have an intensive connection with forestry and agriculture, because there are already guidelines here, and a certain awareness has already been created here. But in the population, which has the right to spend their free time in nature, for example, there is often the false impression that vaccination against FSME, a viral disease that is also transmitted by the tick, provides general protection for tick bites. In other words, I believe that it is also entirely the responsibility of the Member States to invite people to spend their free time in nature, but to draw their attention to the dangers that lurk there.

Mr President, Commissioner, the courage of people with Lyme disease commands admiration, because it is a real wall that they often face in their journey of suffering. First of all, we note the misunderstanding of many non-specialist doctors who simply do not have the tools to detect this disease in time, which already affects a million Europeans, a figure that is constantly increasing, especially because of climate change. Patients also face another obstacle: the conservatism of medical academies. In many cases, they continue to claim today that the Elisa test would be 100% reliable, while all scientific literature shows the opposite. In our text, we denounce this hostage-taking of patients, who have the right to benefit from totally reliable tests. It is therefore essential to take ownership of existing best practices, with good management of patients suffering from chronic Lyme disease, as is the case in Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. This is clearly what all european associations, which are hundreds on the ground, are asking us to do. At home in Wallonia, I am thinking especially of Sonia Boulanger, who coordinates the nonprofit Time for Lyme. There is hope , as has already been discussed in this debate, doors are opening. The European Union has just added Lyme borreliosis to the list of communicable diseases, which is essential to network researchers. WHO has recently changed the codes of Lyme disease in the international classification of diseases, recognizing related dementia and mother-to-child transmission. To conclude in one word, we said that it is essential to fund Lyme disease research, because its diagnosis is complex and its clinical forms are varied.

A form of denial surrounds this disease that does not fit into the codes. This explains, for example, that in France, patients go to Germany. As you propose, better harmonization is indeed necessary, because effective diagnostic means are absolutely necessary. Just because the tests are negative doesn't mean the disease isn't present. Similarly, we need to create working groups, as you have proposed, to set up an exchange of good practices, both on diagnosis, screening and treatment. Some countries refuse to treat patients with a high dose of antibiotics. And then there is the training of doctors, who are often unfamila in environmental health problems.

Let us first highlight the territorial and social divide, since the most widespread zoonotic disease in Europe affects the inhabitants of rural areas above all, which probably explains the lack of interest of the public authorities and the difficult recognition of this condition as a occupational disease. In my region, in France, many very young men who work on apple trees, for example, suffer from this dramatic disease. Some cases are really very difficult and get worse until dementia. It's really a lot of pain. The divide then separates man and nature, since the hunt for predators, although essential to the ecosystem, will in its wake carry the proliferation of certain parasites. A recent study demonstrated the role of foxes, sometimes considered harmful, in the eradication of ticks. However, at a time when between 650,000 and 850,000 Europeans are affected each year by this pathology, the true journey of the combatant inflicted on so many patients facing the shortcomings of modern medicine cannot be tolerated.

Sometimes there can be two simultaneous infections. There has been a 400% increase in Lyme disease in the UK in the last four years. Good livestock farming practices can make an immense beneficial difference here by reducing tick numbers, yet the Green lobby, with its naive ideas of re-wilding, want to remove the livestock entirely. Between them, sheep as teeth grazers and cattle as tongue grazers can prevent grasses from becoming damp and rank and thus deny the ticks a habitat. Meanwhile, the farmers also control the bracken, another favourite tick habitat. Any ticks that do appear will attach themselves to these animals and will be dealt with by the routine application of recommended insecticides.  Twenty years ago, this involved the use of potentially dangerous organophosphorus compounds. Now, thanks to the research efforts of large companies, safer products which are simple to apply will readily destroy ticks. In the absence of these livestock, the ticks will multiply and settle on ground-nesting birds in fatally large numbers, yet the Green lobby will tell you that it’s farmers who threaten bird numbers. Unlike grass, ticks do not thrive in heather, which is an alternative feed for sheep. However, the Green lobby frown on attempts to re-establish heather because of its association with politically incorrect grouse shooting. So we have a choice: a thriving tick-free upland economy based on livestock heather and grouse on the one hand, or the Green lobby’s paradise of abandoned land, welfare payments, tick-infested wildlife and human disease.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 2, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 49, "date": "2018-11-15.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   – Thank you, President.

Climate change is moving faster and is more widespread in our northern part of the world. Ticks are effective carriers, and their spread is affected by climate change. The problem of a warmer climate and the spread of ticks goes hand in hand with other health problems. With extreme weather, bacteria spread not only in water, but also in food.

Lyme disease is an infectious disease of humans and some gardens of domestic and wild animals that are transmitted by ticks. There are around 650 000-850 000 estimated cases in Europe and geographically there is a higher incidence in Central Europe. The infection occurs in the spring and summer period (from April to October) therefore boreliosis is recognized as an occupational disease of farmers, forestry workers and researchers on the ground in the countries where it is present. The EU expresses concern about the worrying extent of the spread of Lyme disease in the European population, as the methods used have shown that around 1 million citizens suffer from the disease. So far, the Union has allocated major research funding on early detection and future treatment of Lyme boreliosis (up to €16 million through projects such as ANTIDotE, ID-LYME and LYMEDIADEX).

Vietnam has made significant economic and social progress over the past twenty years, which resulted in a substantial advancement in socio-economic rights. However, I personally underline that we share your concerns, Parliament’s concerns, regarding political prisoners in the country. The frequent use of vaguely drafted national security provisions in Vietnam’s Penal Code results in numerous arrests, sentencing and detention of Vietnamese citizens who peacefully express their opinion both online and offline. As the European Union, we systematically discuss our concerns over limitations to freedom of expression and freedom of religion with authorities, including at the highest levels, calling on the Government to end persecution and harassment, and to release all peaceful advocates of human rights.  The continued harassment and detention of an increasing number of human rights defenders is systematically raised during our annual Human Rights Dialogue. This is also where we discuss a number of individual cases. Moreover in Hanoi, the EU regularly asks for the possibility to attend trials, to visit human rights defenders in prison or under house arrest, and insist on prisoners having access to legal counsel, medical care and, of course, family visits. We extend specific support to the Government in order to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law. We share best practices with selected ministries, provide input to the National Assembly on the legal framework including on the Penal Code, Labour Law and on Cybersecurity, and promote joint actions with like-minded partners and countries. Vietnam and the EU are committed to work towards a closer partnership by implementing the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement. No doubt, a key tool is the institutional and legally binding linkage between the Free Trade Agreement and the partnership and cooperation agreement ensuring that respect for human rights is an essential element of the trade relations. The European Union wants a prosperous Vietnam, a country that respects the rule of law and human rights and honours its international commitments.

According to today's resolution, Cuba is still a totalitarian state of the only Communist Party that does not bother to respect fundamental human rights. Defenders of these rights, or only those who wish to express themselves or gather freely, are intimidated or unlawfully imprisoned. Only now in October have more than 200 Cubans been imprisoned in this way simply because they exercised their rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. State authorities do not allow the existence of human rights organisations and prevent the travel of their representatives. Freedom of religion exists in Cuba to a minimum, church leaders are under the supervision of state authorities. Cuba enforces censorship and does not allow the existence of media other than state media. This situation also calls partly to account us, the European Union and its Member States. We, for the new agreement with Cuba, did not insist on clear conditionality in its application by respect for fundamental rights. However, even this deficiency does not reduce our obligation in all the External Relations of the European Union to insist on respect for these rights, as imposed on us by Article 21(1) of the Treaty on European Union.

Around a year ago this agreement entered into provisional application, after having received Parliament’s overwhelming support in its assent vote. While there is broad—ranging agreement on political dialogue and cooperation, it was very clear from the beginning that human rights should be a central part of it, and even before its formal application we started holding human rights discussions, both in Brussels and Havana. Last May, at the Joint Council meeting, Federica Mogherini and the Cuban Foreign Minister decided to start formal political dialogues on a number of areas. The very first formal political dialogue we had with Cuba was precisely the Human Rights one held last month in Havana. This was an important point for us to underline the continued relevance of human rights in our bilateral relations. For the first time, it involved the participation of our EU Member States as observers, and the organisation of a civil society seminar in its margins. We all know that there are still important differences between the EU and Cuba on many issues, notably on the way human rights and democracy are applied. This is why during last month’s Human Rights Dialogue we raised important matters, such as the need for ratification and implementation of the relevant international instruments on human rights, proper legal guarantees in criminal proceedings, freedom of association and expression, and the protection of human rights defenders.  The civil society seminar that was organised in the margins of the Dialogue tackled the situation of LGBTI groups and gender equality. While only registered Cuban civil society organisations were able to attend the seminar on this occasion, we recalled the importance to enlarge these discussions to the whole range of civil society, whether registered or not.  I would like to give some numbers about our projects. Most of these projects, indeed for around EUR 10 million, are implemented by European and Cuban civil society organisations, including religious organisations. Vulnerable Cuban people’s rights have been specifically addressed by a number of these projects – women, elderly people, people with disabilities and LGBTI – lesbian, gay, bisexual and so on. We will continue raising this, and all other subjects that are close to our hearts, with our Cuban counterparts in different meetings. Human rights need to be promoted on a day—to—day basis.  I would like to reiterate our conviction that the best way to address the differences we have with Cuba in these matters is through a process of dialogue based on clear and consistent messages. It is certainly difficult and trying, but it is the best manner to sustain results in the long term and to contribute to Cuba’s and its population’s path to reform and modernisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 104, "date": "2018-11-15.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Despite the progress Bangladesh has made in recent years, it remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a population of over 150 million people. As such, we must therefore remain cautious when criticising its efforts to tackle clear and present threats.

That is because, within the Group on Good Governance and Human Rights, we have a mandate to oversee what is happening in the country. Even so, state power is being abused in this country. The government is letting the journalists and activists who oppose it disappear. I think that this is absolutely unacceptable and it is necessary to speak out against it repeatedly. Journalists, activists, lawyers, human rights defenders, all of them are currently victims of the regime. The resolution concerns two specific cases of a journalist and a lawyer who have fought for human rights. Both of these people have disappeared from the world and no one knows where these activists are at the moment. There is a reasonable suspicion that the government is tossing or disposing of these persons out of court. We must urgently call on the government to comment on these cases and have an active dialogue on compliance with international obligations. In particular, the rights to a fair trial, the rights of the defence, the right of access to the court, which must be respected.

Our political dialogue has intensified over the past months in the context of the refugee crisis.  We appreciate the Government’s and people of Bangladesh’s efforts to host the Rohingya refugees. The return of the refugees to their place of origin remains the objective, but it must be voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified. It should not go against those fundamental requirements. It is important that the return of refugees is conducted in line with international law and with the involvement of UNHCR. It is critical that the conditions in Rakhine State are conducive for a safe and sustainable return.  Human rights are a key priority of our dialogue with Bangladesh. The EU regularly expresses its concerns on the situation of human rights, and we see it as a positive development that the Government of Bangladesh is engaging with the EU on this issue.  In joint press statements adopted at the Sub-group on Good Governance and Human Rights in April, and at the Diplomatic Consultations held in Dhaka in July, the authorities undertook to address the shortages and enforce policies respectful of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. However, the situation is of serious concern and more needs to be done: human rights and fundamental freedoms are being increasingly challenged as parliamentary elections are coming close. While continuing its dialogue with the Government of Bangladesh, together with EU Member States and other like-minded partners on the ground, the EU has addressed this in a number of recent public statements. This was particularly necessary in the context of the reaction to the recent Digital Security Act and violence against students and press during the summer. We are notably very concerned over the situation of Mr Shahidul Alam.  The preparation of the parliamentary elections is discussed regularly with the Bangladeshi authorities. The EU expects that the upcoming elections will be held in a transparent, inclusive and impartial way. The rule of law, freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly should be upheld and protected. The Government needs to ensure a safe and enabling environment for civil society, journalists and human rights defenders. As regards labour rights, the Government needs to fully implement the International Labour Organization’s recommendations, notably on freedom of association.  Human rights are a crucial part of the EU’s development cooperation with Bangladesh, with more than EUR 40 million committed for democratic governance. The EU focuses on ensuring democratic ownership through engagement with civil society, promoting democratic empowerment and local governance, notably by addressing access to justice.

There is one explanation: obviously, it is not to improve the text, which will be done and to a large extent in the tripartite negotiations, which are plentiful and already planned. What happens is that there are powerful, powerful, totally legitimate lobbies, of course who very much prefer that there be no directive on this issue in this legislature. They know that one way to achieve a 'non-directive' is to delay the processes, since, with a small delay, it becomes practically impossible to finish our work in this mandate. Here's what's at stake, having or not having a directive. Different visions of Europe are at stake behind them, obviously. The one who believes in a citizens' Europe cannot allow us to present ourselves empty-handed before an election campaign in front of the citizens who demand protection and attention from us. We did not consider taking to the streets to say that Europe has not been able to take the citizen into account in the face of accelerated changes in the market and technologies. If we do not vote in favour of the mandate today, we will not be able to start tripartite negotiations on 21 November. And if we don't start on November 21, we'll have to think about leaving it for another legislature, and let them imagine what's going to happen. That is why those who believe that we can surely improve the text in the tripartite negotiations, but that it is now essential to obtain a directive acceptable for the good of citizens, for those who believe in a citizens' Europe, I would ask them to vote more and confirm my mandate, in order to enable a good directive.

The issues raised by some petitions and the discussions held in the framework of the Committee on Petitions work have fed into the Commission proposal to revise the process to a regulation. More precisely, the proposal aims at strengthening the rights of the child by ensuring that their views are heard in the legal proceedings concerning them. The mutual recognition of Member States’ practices in this respect will avoid refusals at the stage of recognition or enforcement, thus allowing a true circulation of judgments in the Union. We hope that the Council will reach a political agreement on this file in December. Furthermore, the cross-border nature of the family cases requires a close cooperation between Member States’ authorities. The proposal ensures a more effective cooperation between central authorities which in Germany is the Federal Office of Justice. They are the direct interface with parents and should play a key role in supporting the judges in applying the regulation. In addition, we proposed to integrate cooperation with child welfare authorities in the overall cooperation system. On the other hand, I have to recall that the functioning of the National Child Protection Agencies is governed by national law in cases of concern about the proper functioning of such a system redress had to be sought at a national level. Over the past years, the Commission has used several tools to promote exchanges between Member States to facilitate mutual understanding, with a view to ensuring the protection of the rights of children.

One of the main issues that has been highlighted to the Committee on Petitions (PETI) is the alleged impossibility for a non-German spouse to have contact with their child even during supervised visits, notably because of the strictly applied language rules whereby only the German language can be used. If this is the case, it is of course extremely distressing for parents and children. The Jugendamt plays a central, important role in the German family law system as it is one of the prior parties in all family disputes involving children, and so these accusations should be taken seriously. It is important to mention, though, that fact-finding missions have not found any systemic failures. But, in my opinion, if there are many concerns like this coming from parents, then reassurances should be given and cases should be looked at. Discrimination of any kind is not acceptable and, while I would need further evidence and rulings to determine if this is a case of discrimination, the petitions brought forward at least highlight that there is a perception of such by some in this case, and that perhaps measures could be taken to eliminate any possibility of this. I think these cases should be looked into, but let us reserve judgment until we have more information. Of course, at the end of the day, the child’s best interests must be paramount in all decisions related to childcare. Finally, I just want to say that it’s important to point out that PETI also received similar complaints from at least three other Member States. So perhaps a more Union—wide, global approach would be desirable to address these issues rather than perhaps honing in on one particular country.

Did you know that the number of Euro orphans in the EU is estimated at between 500 000 and one million? This is a huge number, but the reunification of such families has not been taken for granted, and in some cases becomes a nightmare for parents. During the last ten years, Parliament has received an enormous amount of petitions related to involvement of the Jugendamt in cross-border family disputes. In the majority of cases, non-German parents denounce systematic discriminations and arbitrary measures, including the prohibition of the use of the parents’ mother tongue in contact with children. The national administrative system of non-German parents do not have a say in this process and in addition, the German competent authorities have failed to implement the recent recommendation of our Committee on Petitions. Clearly, the question of parental responsibility and child custody falls under the competence of the Jugendamt and, without it, there is no alternative way to solve these questions. Therefore, we must find new, effective solutions to all issues experienced by non-German parents. The European Commission needs to have a regular oversight of Jugendamt activities.

Petitions denouncing serious discrimination against non-German parents, discrimination perpetrated by the Jugendamt in transnational family disputes. All this is contrary to the rules and principles of EU law and seriously undermines the protection of the well-being of the children involved. The Committee on Petitions, over the last ten long years, has made recommendations to the German authorities, addressed to the European Commission, addressed to the Council, has carried out two fact-finding missions, has even set up a working group which has worked for a whole year, which I have had the honour of chairing, but all the recommendations made have remained a dead letter to date. This is both because of the german authorities' refusal to cooperate constructively, which have been called for several times in this respect, and also because of the unacceptable formalistic and superficial approach by the European Commission, which unfortunately persisted in denying the thorough investigations into the critical issues reported in the German system with regard to family law. I refer in particular to statistics. We have repeatedly called for statistical data to be collected, both as regards the judicial outcomes in family disputes concerning the custody of children in the presence of a non-German parent, and as regards the number of cases, again in the presence of a non-German parent, in which a judge deviated from the recommendation issued by the Jugendamt. We have also called for a light to be shed on discrimination linked to the use of language, which has been repeatedly denied during meetings between parents and children. I hope that this resolution will finally shed light on this issue, that concrete action will be taken not only by the European Commission, but also by the Member States. I hope that at least this issue can be examined and communicated in depth and that the practices that are actually adopted by the German family law system can be understood and communicated and precisely dealt with calmly, because that is how we will have to deal with this problem if we want this European Union, our common home, to be able to do so. , can be called such to protect, above all, future generations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 158, "date": "2018-11-15.json", "name": "Dobromir SOŚNIERZ", "mepid": "192298", "text": "   – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by I am pleased that we are finally dealing here, in our parliament, with real problems relating to the rule of law.

We see how human rights and children's rights are at stake in Germany. The Germans are trying to instruct Poland, for example, on the courts, and at home they have much more serious problems. However, this is not just a German matter. Similar practices exist in many countries. The problem is that we are building a total state. A total state is characterized by the fact that it does not recognize any power other than its own. That is why the total state is fighting the power of its parents. The total state believes that it knows better than parents what is good for children. He uses the child's well-being in the name of interfering with the life of the family. There must be no case where, in the name of the best interests of the child, officials may interfere with parental responsibility. Only the commission of a criminal act, a serious crime, can authorise the removal of children and not the best interests of the child, since the best interests of the child can be understood differently and have a sacred right to understand differently from the official.

Of these, 196 petitions, or 76%, concerned the children of German citizens. The remaining 62 petitions came from nationals of other countries. In the course of its work, the Committee on Petitions usually had only the relationship of the petitioner, and yet no institution can restrict the rights of a citizen without a court ruling, including in matters of childcare. Thus, judgments in each case had to be made. However, most petitions were not accompanied by a judgment, despite, or perhaps precisely because the court's judgment is the only full source of knowledge of the problem. It is based on the testimonies of both parents, children and witnesses. The Commission therefore necessarily based its opinions mainly on the account of the petitioner, the only party to the dispute. For this reason, I have asked the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights which of the 62 petitioners of non-German nationality has lodged a complaint with the Court. I have received a reply that only seventeen people have lodged such a complaint and that all these complaints have been declared inadmissible. Also in 2011, during a mission to Germany, members of the Committee on Petitions found no irregularities.

This text is a call to the law. If the Jugendamt really wants to defend the best interests of the child, as he claims, he must let him take full advantage of his mother and father. It is the very basis of his balance and emancipation. It is this multiple cultural richness that will make him a strong, open and loving adult, because that is what it is all about, love. How can one be so obtuse to prevent a parent from telling his child that he loves him, that he misses him, that he wants to hug him. How?

I am aware of a number of complaints which the Committee on Petitions has received and I have tried to find the legal way to get into the problem and to come up with some measures. But I have to fully respect the division of competences stipulated in the primary law. As I said before, family-law matters are highly sensitive, and the EU has very limited legal competence to act in this field, so everybody should act in accordance with the applicable legislation. For the Member States, this is clearly the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which are legally binding on them. They have to ensure that in all actions related to children, the child’s best interests are the primary consideration, and the national courts are best placed to assess the application of the principle of the best interests of the child in individual cases. Regarding the EU’s competence, I want to clarify once again the EU family law is limited to common rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of existing judgments in another Member State. The high sensitivity of family-law matters is also reflected in the requirement for unanimity in the Council for family-law matters. This is also the case for the Brussels 2A Regulation, and I hope we will be able to adopt the revision of this regulation in December. The revision of the Brussels 2A Regulation should make proceedings in cross-border cases easier and quicker. We are indeed considering the best interest of the child. We had to work extremely hard to get all the Member States on board for this process – the revision of the Brussels 2A Regulation – and I do hope that they will all vote for this in December. Let me thank you again for the support expressed in the Parliament opinion on the Brussels 2A Regulation.

The staff member of the office shall be entitled to place the child in foster care on the basis of imprecise provisions giving amputee room for abuse, which repeatedly results in the children being taken away from their parents without sufficient justification, without any appeal against the arbitrary decision. It is particularly scandalous that office workers openly discriminate against persons of a different origin from German origin. During supervised meetings, children are not allowed to communicate with their parents in a language other than German. Such action by the Office is contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 8, which guarantees respect for the right of the child 'to preserve his identity, including nationality, surname, family relations, lawful, excluding unlawful interference'. Furthermore, the activities of the Jugendamts and the legal framework governing their functioning infringe the provisions of a number of articles of the ECHR.
