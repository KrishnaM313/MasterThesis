My committee has received, during the past few years, 80-plus petitions on the use of fixed-term contracts, zero-hours contracts and temporary contracts from different Member States (actually10 different Member States) and therefore the committee decided in November to organise a hearing under the title ‘Protection of the rights of workers in temporary or precarious employment’. The hearing looked in detail at all the issues raised in these petitions. A study on temporary contracts was also commissioned by Policy department C, and was presented during the hearing. It focused on two broad areas: first, atypical forms of employment and franchising; and, second, recommendations on adopting a holistic, comprehensive approach to address these problems. In January of this year, the committee coordinators unanimously decided, as a follow-up to these two activities, to draft an oral question and a motion for a resolution responding to petitions. In May this year, we also adopted the oral question and the amended draft for a motion. So the oral question tabled by the committee focuses on the correct implementation of EU law regarding the protection of workers in the EU, and on the compatibility of some specific types of contract, such as the currently much-talked-of zero-hours contracts, with European legislation – i.e. whether there is compatibility or not. Thirdly, action is needed to address the abusive use of fixed-term contracts and precarious forms of employment. We want to ensure proper implementation of employment directives in the public and private sectors. We have also highlighted the legislation proposed by the Commission and the need to ensure the predictability and sustainability of employment. And, lastly, we want to ask the Commission about the state of play in current infringement procedures for violation of EU labour legislation. When you look at the text of the resolution, you should bear in mind the increase in the number of workers with fixed-term and part-time contracts and the significant increase in temporary employment contracts and atypical contracts, in both the public and private sectors. In the light of this large number of petitions that we have received, we consider there is a need for a debate on the situation of workers in the European Union. We would have liked to do this together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but it takes two to tango and we were simply turned down. Nevertheless, we, as the Petitions Committee, need to address all those citizens everywhere in the Member States who actually came to us pointing out their difficulties. We must not forget that petitions are a reflection of citizens and their situation, and are an important signalling mechanism to the legislative committees of this House and to the Commission. These petitions reveal gaps in the legislation, or in the implementation of legislation, and the petitions sent to my committee regarding precarious employment should therefore be taken extremely seriously. We would like – and I am talking here on behalf of all the political groups in the Committee – to invite the Commission not only to review the legal instrument but also to think of how, in future, to avoid the harmful situations of which all these people are victims. We should find ways to ease the life of EU citizens who are suffering from precariousness, and the oral question and the resolution have been put on the plenary agenda in order to draw attention to the concrete problems faced by European citizens. We are – and I personally am – now expecting the Commission not only to reply to the specific points in the oral question but also to commit to making all the necessary efforts to ensure the best possible protection of all workers in the European Union.

I referred to the debate which took place in July 2017 when Parliament adopted its resolution on working conditions and precarious employment. The Commission has provided comprehensive answers to your resolution and has also proposed new initiatives. Our priority now is to ensure that the prosperity generated by the recovering European economy benefits society fairly. We made huge efforts and the economy is growing again. But we are not done yet; we must ensure that no one is left behind. This is the essence of the European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed in November last year. Today’s debate is essentially about our ability to bring the Pillar agenda forward together – in the Commission, Parliament and the Council. On the Commission side, in recent years we have set milestones in the social area. Before the end of this mandate, we must show EU citizens, in a very tangible way, our determination to make the Union fairer and more inclusive. We should not ignore the fact that precarious work has a toll, not only on individuals but on our societies and economies as a whole. The Union has developed and extended its response to this issue over the years. It has done so through specific EU directives on non-standard forms of work and through enhanced cooperation and coordination with the Member States. This cooperation includes the European Platform on Undeclared Work. This year we issued country-specific recommendations in the European Semester on tackling the informal and shadow economy for Bulgaria and Italy. The European Social Fund provides financial support for disadvantaged youth or the long-term unemployed. Let me assure you that the Commission is strongly committed to ensuring compliance across the EU. Where necessary, we initiate infringement proceedings, which may ultimately lead the Commission to refer the matter to the Court. The work undertaken by the Committee on Petitions strongly supports and influences our efforts to ensure effective action is undertaken. Thank you so much for this support. We took concrete actions and put forward a comprehensive set of proposals: firstly, for a directive on predictable and transparent working conditions; secondly, for a Council Recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed; and thirdly, for a regulation establishing a European labour authority. Through these initiatives, we want to prevent EU workers from being subjected to unfair and precarious working conditions by guaranteeing basic standards for all workers, including workers subject to particularly flexible forms of employment, such as on-demand work or zero-hour contracts; by ensuring social protection coverage regardless of the employment status; and by supporting administrative cooperation and better information to enforce existing rules. All workers in non-standard forms of employment must benefit from these basic standards. Current EU rules often leave their scope to be determined by national law, which has left out too many workers from protection. It is essential for our initiatives on working conditions that all workers are covered. This legislative work must be pursued with utmost celerity so that we make these further steps towards fairness and inclusiveness in employment together before the elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-05-31.json", "name": "Jarosław WAŁĘSA", "mepid": "96774", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to start by underlining the importance of petitions.

We want to guarantee flexibility for employers but, at the same time, proper social security for all types of workers. Now, I need to point out a few facts about this resolution. First of all, I would like to remind you that the conversion of a fixed-term contract into an indefinite one is not an obligation for Member States, but an exclusive national competence. We should not mix EU and national competences regarding labour and social policies. Secondly, when we speak about different directives, we have to recall the fact that they are in place especially to prevent abuses. Thirdly, when we refer to specific cases, we have to take into account all the observations of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

But there’s a catch, because, in the North East, we are the capital for zero-hours contracts in the UK. One out of ten workers has a precarious job, most of them in the form of a zero-hours contract. Not only does a zero-hours contract come with job insecurity but precariousness at work also leads to inadequate access to social protection, such as benefits and protection from unfair dismissal. It impinges on career development and training and therefore results in precariousness in life more generally. We, as the Committee on Petitions in this Parliament, have received a large number of petitions calling for European action. In 2016, the Committee on Petitions received submissions from McDonald’s workers who testified that some of their most basic rights, such as the right to maternity leave, paid holidays and redundancy rights, were being withheld because of zero-hours contracts. We have taken this up in Parliament, and I’m proud to support McDonald’s workers – including those brave people who have taken industrial action in the struggle for their rights at work – as well as all the other precarious workers across Europe with the resolution that we’re putting on the table today. We now need the Commission to act. Commissioner, your representatives confirmed in our Committee on Petitions’ hearing that zero-hours contracts fall within the remit of the EU Part-Time Workers’ Directive, which guarantees the same employment protection for part-time workers as for full-time workers.

Mr President, austerity and violent fiscal adjustment have filled Europe with armies and millions of poor and unemployed. At the same time, they have led to lower wages and the breakdown of industrial relations. The famous objectives of post-war Europe for full employment have now become objectives and implementation in the field of part-time work, informal forms of work, precarious work, fixed-term work, zero-hours contracts. So we have a complete abuse of both Directive 1999/70/EC on fixed-term contracts and, overall, labour law in Europe. There is now a working jungle in Greece, as the troika and the memorial governments have broken up industrial relations and abolished collective labour agreements. We welcome yesterday's magnificent strike in Greece and the mobilizations of workers who sent a decisive message to the SYRIZA-ANEL government that it is no longer going to the issue of industrial relations. The armies of contract workers in Greece and the problem with the thousands of workers in stage programs demonstrate the huge problem that exists. In particular, Commissioner, the issue of the thousands of workers in stage programmes who have now been left out of work is a classic case of a breach of Community law. We call on you from this step to take concrete measures and to refer Greece, because it has violated European Union law and thus to vindicate the thousands of employees or former employees of the stage programmes. We in the Committee on Petitions, as the ECR Group and myself as coordinator, supported this initiative to question and discuss the case which concerns us.

They show the concerns of Europeans and reflect the situation on the ground. In this case they showed problems regarding precarious work.  During this mandate the Committee on Petitions has received over 80 petitions from 10 different Member States on precariousness and abusive use of fixed-term contracts. As a response, the Committee organised hearings on these issues and now we have an oral question and a resolution.  This resolution sends a powerful message. It sends a message to the petitioners that we have heard them. It sends a message to those who are in precarious employment that we care, and it sends a message to the Commission and Member States that we all need to act.  In the last few years the labour market has been changing. There is a trend to move away from traditional contracts and to move towards more flexibility – flexibility for the employer and the employee. But this shift was not foreseen in the current EU labour laws. Therefore, it sometimes happens that these more flexible workers are less protected. As the labour market changes, we need to adapt.  The gaps in current laws should be closed to guarantee inclusive labour standards. But it is not only the EU which needs to act. The Member States have the most important task: they need to implement the laws to protect the workers. Incorrect implementation leads to insecurity. Infringement proceedings started by the Commission take a long time, even years, and during that entire period the workers suffer.  There are also occasions when Member States can do more, by introducing, for example, better safeguards against abusive use of fixed-term contracts. Member States have the competence and power and should definitely use it. I am therefore happy to see that this resolution covers these issues.  People in precarious working conditions are always in the weaker position. They need us to stand up for them and ensure that they are protected.

Having a job is not having a life. Having a job now often means being poor. You've got work, you're poor. This is our reality. Europe's greatest job insecurity is in Spain, the state where precarious contracts are most worked, not by will, because it is already impossible to have an indefinite contract. 91.4% of the jobs in Spain are precarious. The origin is in the structure of the labor market. The possibility implies that having a job is in poverty. In Galicia, my country, one in four employees has a fixed-term contract, a precarious and temporary contract, with one of the highest rates in the European Union of 26.8 %. For youth, 3 out of 4 young people, or 73.3 %, have a temporary contract, followed by Slovenia, Poland, Portugal, Italy and Croatia. In addition, Spain also leads in precariousness.

It is clear that precarious jobs in the European Union have increased exponentially, and that this number has been aggravated by the obvious impact of austerity policies. It is also clear that there is a direct link between precarious working conditions and the absence of effective legislative measures to prevent and penalise discrimination and abuse of fixed-term contracts, as in the case of Italy. The European Commission has a direct responsibility for this because it has wasted time, accumulated delays and has therefore actuallyed the repeated and abusive use of fixed-term contracts in violation of workers' rights. For years, in fact, the European Court of Justice has ruled that EU legislation provides that permanent employment contracts must be the common form of employment relationships, and that fixed-term contracts are attributable only to the specific characteristics of certain sectors and to certain occupations and activities.

Mr President, the fight against precariousness and the misuse of fixed-term contracts is becoming one of the many sea snakes in this Parliament and yet another resolution will do nothing about it. This is the impossible challenge of social convergence, such as this much-talked-about tax harmonisation. Finally, we believe that we are talking about it and hope that this will never happen, as social dumping is one of the engines of the economies of both The East and the West, but for divergent interests. Let us remember the obvious here. The precariousness of jobs will cease when and only when our respective economies have regained real growth that will mechanically generate employment. It is essential to protect ourselves from globalization through intelligent protectionism, accompanied by economic patriotism. In the Union, we have to buy what the Union produces, first of all.  In addition, there is an urgent need to combat social dumping organised by our own directives. Unfortunately, the revision of the detached workers directive, voted on Tuesday, shows that we are a long way off. Far from these objectives, which should be a priority, your draft resolution becomes a catch-all, where we find the now inevitable notions of inclusive work, gender equality, atypical and non-standard jobs, and the worst...

You want to find solutions at European level when, in your recital B, you state, and I quote: 'EU social and labour policy is based on the principle of subsidiarity'. In Article 3, you want to promote safe and well-paying quality jobs and strengthen labour inspections, whereas in Article 6 you defend the right to seek additional employment, which is precisely precarious employment. What is really serious is the return of the vulnerability of the working poor, who can no longer afford housing, forced part-time cashiers, mini-contracts in endlessly renewed public services, zero-hours contracts with uncertain or even non-existent social protection. Worse, you are talking about the 1999/70/EC directive and you are hoping for action from the Commission, but the Commission itself is violating this text, with the temporary contracts of some of its agents, when they are permanent posts.

On the contrary, it threatens and punishes with an alleged obligation to permanentise anyone who does not regularly recycle more unemployed people. The vast majority of new hires are temporary.

Actually, working conditions are a combination of EU and national competences, and I think we should recognise that and that there are differences, but I also think the European Union can play a very strong role in this area – and has done. The transparent and predictable working conditions currently in Parliament ... We’ve had a hearing recently in the Employment Committee and the European Labour Authority recognises that workers across Europe need to be protected. In my own country, in Ireland, we recently introduced legislation to ban zero—hours contracts and to address insecure contracts and for those who are working variable hours in precarious situations. All of that is there to prevent the exploitation of workers.  I’d say to employers that it is in their interest to ensure that their workers are committed to their job and to their employment and that, in turn, will create loyalty. We know well that if you exploit workers, you will not get committed workers in that area. But I’d also say to all of us who are consumers as well, and I know a colleague here earlier in the chamber mentioned a particular fast food chain, we have a voice to speak with if we are not content with the way those workers have been treated with regard to the unpredictability of their hours. The fast food chains can certainly predict their hours. They know their hours of opening, so they can certainly give more certainty in that area. I think as consumers we should use our voices as well because the world of work is changing, but at the same time, as consumers we will race to the bottom of the lowest price, but yet we want the best of standards, and we’re willing to buy online and neglect local retailers. I think we all have to play a role in this, but the most important thing is that we do recognise that workers are being exploited and can be exploited, and we need to work together to ensure that adequate protection is put in place to prevent precarious work, particularly zero—hours contracts, which are really giving our workers across the EU no certainty in terms of social commitments or commitments to their families.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2018-05-31.json", "name": "Siôn SIMON", "mepid": "124948", "text": "   – Mr President, there are literally millions of workers in the United Kingdom on zero hours and other exploitative contracts, and the highest proportion of them is in my constituency in the West Midlands, which is the capital of zero-hours contracts in the United Kingdom.

We are dealing with citizens who trust the European Union and we are aware of the expectation that we will solve their problems, even against installed powers.  Commissioner, it is very serious that we receive numerous petitions from European citizens on situations of precariousness and misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, in violation of a European directive, which is the case both in the private sector and in the public sector. The numbers are scary. In Portugal, 82% of temporary workers are unintentionally affected by young people, which, according to a Commission assessment, shows a high labour segregation that needs to be corrected. These are situations in which, contrary to their expectations, workers are forced to accept part-time, seasonal work, with an indefinite or false independent work.  As regards the abuse of successive fixed-term contracts, the governments of the Member States themselves are the first to violate the European Directive, when they should be the first to set an example for the business sector. This is also the case in my country and in my region, especially in the teaching class. Meanwhile, the Commission ignores the heashes of complaints and arranges bureaucratic subterfuge to postpone or avoid responses that go against national governments.

Reforms have been demanded from here, measures have been required, but it has not been required that, at the same time, what the Labour Directive would require be guaranteed.  That is therefore what I ask the Commission to require such monitoring, compliance and to open the infringement files to be opened, and for those who are open to be concluded; but especially that the policies of the European Semester require compliance with labour standards.  I also ask you, in a very specific way, to take steps to eliminate and end, once and for all, the successive chaining of temporary contracts which are actually indefinite — this is happening throughout the European Union and must be terminated — and that zero-hour contracts be regulated.

The negative consequences of globalization have led to the emergence of the preariate, which is on track to replace the proletariat, even in some developed parts of the world. Young people, women and older workers have contributed greatly to redefining employment. The data shows that each generation is less represented in permanent employment than the previous one. Work and forced migration, as well as demographic changes, should be included in the analysis. For example, my homeland, the Republic of Croatia, is one of the countries with the highest percentage of the population over 60 years of age, and as many as 25% of workers work in precarious conditions.

This represents 60% of all confirmed executions in the Middle East and North Africa. Iran, as usual, comes second behind China in the number of death sentences imposed.

It is a prison notorious for its torture-like practices and where it has been reported that several prisoners have been tortured to death. For two years, Djalali has been away from his family and had little contact with the outside world. In January this year, he was sentenced to death on charges of espionage, to which many people with dual citizenship suffer. Djalali has lost upwards of 25 kilos in the last six months. His health has drastically deteriorated, but he is denied medical care, and I therefore appeal to the Persian authorities to guarantee Djalali the right to his lawyer and medical treatment – in addition to the death sentence must be lifted immediately and that he should be released and given the opportunity to go home to Sweden.

We call for their release on humanitarian grounds, we ask for appropriate legal counselling and for adequate medical care to be provided to those in need. Given that primary responsibility for consular protection of European Union citizens abroad lies with their Member State of origin, European Union action is always coordinated and done at the request of the Member States and/or the respective families. In this vein, we will continue to closely follow the situation on the ground and use every opportunity to discuss the issue of dual nationals with the Iranian authorities. When in April 2016 the European Union negotiated a joint statement with Iran on the future of our relations, the High Representative / Vice-President said very clearly that human rights had to be an integral part of our engagement. We have established a high-level dialogue with Iran, which is the framework in which all issues are discussed, including human rights. I wish to underline that the European Union has never refrained from raising human rights issues in our contacts with the Iranian authorities. We have constantly called for the respect of human rights, both in public statements and in particular in private conversations. In 2016, during the European Union-Iran High-Level Dialogue, the European Union had a first direct exchange with interlocutors from the Iranian judiciary on human rights in more than 10 years. The second meeting took place in Tehran in November 2017, and again, a number of issues were raised, including the death penalty, women’s rights and conditions in the Iranian prisons. Beyond our bilateral engagement, we have been active in multilateral for a, where we supported both the work of the UN Special Rapporteur and the UN Resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran. We have been carrying out démarches and issuing public statements whenever there were major violations in Iran. We will continue to do so, and we will also continue our informal discussion on human rights to progressively address our concerns through this channel.

Because, as the young king presents himself to the world showing Saudi Arabia as the locomotive of progress in the Middle East region, the human and civil rights situation follows tracks that lead in a different direction. The mentoring system regulates Saudi society, preventing women from carrying out the simplest actions themselves, and gender-based violence is not a recognised crime. A picture, therefore, in strong contradiction to the country dashed by the sovereign's promises, but also contradicts the role that this country plays as a member of the Committee on the Status of Women at the United Nations.

The European Union is both surprised and disappointed by these developments. These arrests take place as Saudi Arabia has embarked on a programme of socio-economic transformation and modernisation, and against the background of recent commitments by the Saudi leadership to women’s empowerment. These activists have, for many years, been promoting women’s rights and women’s empowerment in line with the Saudi leadership’s commitments under ‘Vision 2030’. Our delegation in Riyadh was in contact with some of them because, as usual, we support on the ground the cause and the effort of people who try actively to improve human-rights standards in our partner countries. Hence our surprise and disappointment, as these arrests are in direct contradiction with the messages we have heard – and have welcomed – from the Saudi leadership in recent times. Moreover, the arrests happened one month before the end of the female driving ban, expected to enter into effect on 24 June, a ban against which most of these women and men had campaigned. Adding to our surprise was the severity of the accusations brought against these human-rights defenders and the defamatory campaign conducted against them in the media – before any legal action had been started and therefore against the principle of presumption of innocence. The European Union immediately sought clarification from the authorities on the circumstances around the arrests and notably on the specific accusations brought. We are waiting for a reply from the authorities and we will persist in our diplomatic engagement in order to shed some light on these arrests. The situation is fluid and information is limited. We have noted with satisfaction the release of four of the women who had been arrested, including a 70-year-old, although we understand that new arrests of further human-rights defenders have taken place, after the first wave of arrests on 15 May – thus giving very mixed messages on the overall situation. Recent reforms in Saudi Arabia have allowed women to attend sports events, apply for government jobs, and enjoy the country’s first public cinema screening in 35 years. We are encouraged by these reforms and we hope they will indicate a new pattern in the Saudi commitments. The European Union wants to encourage the authorities to maintain that trajectory, and to continue improving the Saudi social fabric. Setbacks such as those just witnessed are therefore deplorable. The European Union stands ready to support and accompany modernisation efforts in Saudi Arabia, notably those that aim at strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The shrinking space for civil society organisations and restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly remain among the main areas of our concern. I personally raised this issue during my visit to Sudan last October, but the case of Noura Hussein, who has been sentenced to death at the tender age of 19 after being forced into marriage at the age of 16 and raped, brings to the forefront many of the country’s complex and interrelated human rights problems, ranging from sexual violence, child and forced marriage to the continuing use of capital punishment. Consequently, Noura’s story has caused public outcry not only internationally but, more importantly, also within Sudan. Criminal justice systems ought to offer prevention and protection for women and girls against all forms of violence. This is sadly not the case in Sudan. Rape, including by habitual or cohabiting partners, should never be tolerated under any circumstances. Moreover, Sudan’s Personal Status Law, allowing for child marriage without the consent of the intending spouses, needs urgent revision. As reiterated in the local statement issued by the EU on the case, the European Union is opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances and in all cases, with no exception, and aims at its universal abolition. The EU is also concerned at the recent news of attempts by the state security apparatus to intimidate Noura’s defence team, and it calls on Sudan to allow the lawyers to work without fear of reprisals. The EU will continue to make use of the various means at our disposal to promote and protect girls’ and women’s human rights in Sudan. This includes by enhancing the access of women and girls to good-quality education and healthcare services, raising awareness on girls’ and women’s rights among communities, in particular with a view to reducing harmful practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM), as well as supporting women’s economic empowerment through relevant training and micro-credit programmes. The EU also calls on the Government to take the necessary steps to accelerate the ratification and the full, effective and non-discriminatory implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in order to advance the equal recognition, enjoyment and exercise of all the human rights of women. In this regard, the EU welcomes the Sudanese Government’s intention to ratify the Convention, as announced by the Minister of Justice this week. I would like to assure you that the EU will continue closely to follow the case of Noura and to raise it with the relevant authorities. We will also continue to team up with women’s human-rights defenders and women’s organisations to tackle the underlying causes leading to cases such as that of Noura.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2018-05-31.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Thank you to the Commissioner, also for being with us most of the morning.

These are strong words, but I believe that the strategy being built for the next period must be much more consistent, much more effective, much more concrete and have the effect of improving the situation of young people on the market – not only in work, but also in the education system. It is also a response to opponents of Erasmus+. We have defended this programme, we have doubled the amount for the next perspective, but we can see how Europe's educational programmes are needed to improve the mobility of the youngest generation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 143, "date": "2018-05-31.json", "name": "Momchil NEKOV", "mepid": "125013", "text": "   – Mr President, I have given my support to the report on the implementation of the European Union Youth Strategy because I think it draws attention to several very important aspects.

Only through stable funding can we expect results in the long term.  Secondly, I believe that if young people are indeed a priority of the European Union, then programmes targeting them must be accessible not only to highly educated young people and those with financial means. Young people with low qualifications and those from disadvantaged backgrounds must have equal access to opportunities.

Through its external financial instruments and the European Development Fund, the EU provides billions of euros in assistance to third countries through international organisations among other channels. I therefore have a few questions for the High Representative on a response from the European Union.

Secondly, what is the response by the Commission and the High Representative to the abuse cases that have recently come to light? In order to combat and prevent sexual misconduct within international aid organisations, is there room for guidelines within the EU’s external financial instruments that would make funding strictly conditional upon respect for principles, oversight, guidelines accountability and regular reporting from beneficiaries on this issue?

Thank you so much for your questions. Let me respond also on behalf of High Representative / Vice—President Federica Mogherini and my dear colleagues, Commissioner Hahn and Commissioner Mimica. I welcome the opportunity to inform you of developments regarding our collective response and, most importantly, to reiterate our firm position on sexual misconduct. Through our humanitarian work we save lives and through our development aid work we empower people. Our partners play a vital role in our efforts to deliver this much—needed assistance. We expect them – UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs – to abide by the strictest ethical standards, and we do not accept any misconduct that compromises our vital work on the ground. When we became aware of allegations of sexual misconduct by individual staff members in certain organisations, our message was loud and clear: zero tolerance of any form of misconduct and zero tolerance towards any organisation receiving EU funding. We take allegations of misconduct very seriously. Whenever an allegation comes to our attention, we make sure that all procedures are activated. We have in place a number of measures to make sure that EU funding is used properly, according to the highest ethical principles, professional rules and codes of conduct. First, our zero tolerance policy for sexual exploitation and abuse is appended to our contracts with our humanitarian partners. We demand that they have in place effective and coordinated prevention, reporting and response mechanisms. For development funding, contracts include a number of obligations on human rights, labour standards, etc. We are currently working to further reinforce this ethical process, to explicitly address sexual abuse and exploitation. So this is a new effort in order to cover the state of play on the ground, as professional misconduct can lead to suspension and termination of contracts or exclusion from further funding. Our partners are obliged to share information with us on allegations or cases of misconduct in a proactive and fully transparent way. We may of course also refer a case to OLAF for allegations of misappropriation of EU funds. In response to the allegation of sexual misconduct, as soon as we were informed, we acted in a quick and decisive way. First, we reminded all of our partners of their duty to fully comply with the highest ethical and professional standards. This is more than two hundred organisations. We recalled their contractual, but also moral, obligations towards the European Union, and of course towards the people they serve. We asked them to inform us of the concrete measures and procedures they have in place to prevent, detect and address sexual exploitation and abuse. Nearly all partners have replied. Those who have not are informed that we will review our funding to them and even cease our funding and terminate our partnership if needed. So zero tolerance means we take action where needed. In fact, we have put on hold the signature of further contracts with certain organisations. Secondly, we support our partners’ efforts for increased accountability and more effective internal oversight mechanisms. We have strengthened our audits in this regard. The audit programme for humanitarian actions will include the assessment of mechanisms put in place by organisations to prevent, detect and handle cases of sexual abuse and exploitation. Thirdly, we rely on the EU presence in the field in our delegations and in our network of humanitarian offices worldwide – closest, of course, to the beneficiaries, where our humanitarian and development partners operate on a daily basis. Fourthly, we will continue raising awareness about the possibility to report sexual misconduct directly to us, anonymously and in full confidentiality. Finally, we want to address this issue in a comprehensive manner, having everybody on board. We are engaging – since you ask, this is our answer to the question about our collaboration with our Member States. We are engaged with our Member States and other international donors for a thorough review and harmonisation of policies and practices. We want to raise standards whenever and wherever this is required and appropriate. In this context, the Commission joined the safeguarding donor working group, and this issue will be discussed at the G7 ministerial meeting on development. There is no doubt that what has happened in a small number of organisations has tarnished the work of the aid community as a whole.

It was first reported three years ago by Danielle Spencer, a humanitarian adviser. Spencer was informed about the allegation by Syrian women in a refugee camp in Jordan. Women and girls need to be protected when they are trying to receive food and basic items to live. The last thing you need is a man who you were supposed to trust and supposed to be receiving aid from asking you to have sex with him and withholding aid from you. The ongoing abuse can no longer be ignored. It is horrible enough that these women have to rely on international aid for survival. But for them to fear this aid is unacceptable. Action must be taken to prevent the sexual exploitation of Syrian women and girls. In June 2015, the International Rescue Committee surveyed 190 women and girls from the area and found that 40% had experienced an act of sexual violence when seeking supplies at a distribution centre.

There have been cases in which aid workers have sexually exploited refugees – that is, the staff of the NGOs. It is about good people who have turned out to be the opposite of this. First and foremost, the protection orders that the aid workers have committed themselves to are affected. We deeply regret what has happened to the victims. I have confidence in the judiciary that the perpetrators will be held accountable and that justice will be done to the victims.  However, we must also draw political conclusions – including for the fundamental cooperation with NGOs. The NGOs must be imputed to the abusive behaviour of their employees. Oxfam must feel consequences for its failures in selecting and monitoring employees. Cooperation with Osfam must therefore not continue in the same way; the Commission is also called upon to do so.  Development aid policy also needs a change of direction. We know that of every euro of donation and development aid, only a fraction of the really needy are received. A large number of actors – bureaucrats, NGOs and development workers, and also a kleptocratic political class found in many African countries – have squeezed between the source of money and the recipients. Unfortunately, the wrong people are making their pockets full with development aid. The solution does not come from more money, nor is it to the state funding of NGOs. The right way is a new and better trade policy. We must stop subsidising our agricultural sector and instead open it up more to products from developing countries.

Mr President, today we are talking about the abuses of aid organisations such as Oxfam. In recent months, stories have surfaced of perverted sex parties in Haiti. Oxfam employees have been scandalously misbehaving there, including at the expense of the European taxpayer. Hundreds of millions of euros have been sent to Haiti since 2010. It is only since the beginning of this year that we have started to get a picture of how that money has been spent, and that image is not pretty, I can tell you.  Unfortunately, the scandal in Haiti does not appear to be isolated. For example, some Oxfam employees who misbehaved in Haiti appear to have engaged in the same practices in Chad a few years earlier. Scandalous and unacceptable.  Oxfam is certainly no exception, because scandals are also rife in other organisations. Take, for example, Greenpeace. Two days ago it was announced that no less than 44 former employees from South America have been kicked out of the school. There are alleged to have been several cases of unwanted behaviour and abuse in recent years. The complainants were dismissed, the perpetrators were held over their heads. Outrageous.  The list of examples of abuse is getting longer and longer. Pretty much every aid organization has to deal with it. Mr President, even then, the majority of this House is looking the other way and tough text is being put forward and so-called hefty measures are being announced. But when it comes down to it, everything stays the way it was.  Every year, more than €75 billion is spent from Europe on development aid and related issues. Of this, 10 billion will be given away by the European Parliament.  Mr President, it is time to stop blatantly transferring billions, transferring billions to corrupt, dictatorial regimes and so-called aid organisations. This is despite the fact that these expenditures are not or hardly controlled and therefore one has no idea of what the money is being spent on. This has to stop. Development aid and all kinds of related expenditure must once again become an exclusive competence of the Member States. Each country must be able to decide for itself whether, and if so, how much money should be transferred to the bottomless pit called development aid.  Mr President, as far as I and my party are concerned, it is clear: not a penny to corrupt dictatorial regimes and so-called aid organisations.

I completely agree with you about zero tolerance and, of course – above all – prevention. The recent cases of sexual misconduct reminded us firstly, that we need to continue to work towards a zero-tolerance culture against sexual exploitation and abuse. There is absolutely no room for relaxed efforts and lenient behaviour towards allegations of any kind of misconduct. Secondly, we need to live up to our ethical and legal responsibilities as a leading donor of humanitarian and development assistance across the world. We need to support all our partners in their efforts to prevent, to identify at an early stage, and to respond to cases of sexual misconduct. We also need more transparency and more accountability across the board. We need to safeguard our work. Our role is unique; saving lives and empowering people is a fair and upright duty. So our work is too important to be compromised. This is my very strict message to all our partners. I shall now answer some specific issues, and I would like to start with Oxfam. We have collectively suspended the conclusion of any new contracts – these amount to a total of more than EUR 90 million – until we are satisfied with the new mechanisms put in place to prevent, report and respond to sexual abuse. With regard to our support to António Guterres’s efforts, as the European Union we fully apply the UN standards of behaviour in its Common Security and Defence Policy missions, and this year the Council adopted revised standards of behaviour. Of course, as António Guterres has said many times, again, no zero tolerance for sexual abuse allegations. And as regards our monitoring of the use of our funding: first, we assess the financial, operational and administrative capacities of the NGOs that apply to receive funding. Secondly, we carry out regular on-site visits during the implementation of the project on the ground. Third, audits of management and control systems are performed during the implementation of the action, and this includes visits to the project sites, implementing partners and beneficiaries. And fourth, there are audits of legality and regularity of the operations once the projects are finished. By way of example, in the humanitarian field (in my field), last year 50 projects with a value of almost EUR 500 million were audited during their implementation and no issues relating to sexual misconduct were detected during these audits.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has We are now talking about my great question on the occasion of International Family Day. The Commissioners responsible for this policy, Mr Jourova and Mr Timmermans, are absent from this debate. Mr Timmermans may be recovering from Christopher Street Day in Brussels. Instead, the Selmayr Commission sends the Civil Protection Commissioner to read out an official's response. The EU has silenced the United Nations International Family Day. All people of good will recognise that the EU does not value the family based on marriage between a man and a woman, but on the mysterious International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, the rainbow flag of gender ideologues fluttered at the EU buildings. Brussels is thus devalues the sovereign symbols of the Member States. Human resources departments made a huge effort for transgender Eurocrats in the workplace. These are the EU's priorities in the management of values and standards. What the EU is doing for marriage and the family is to simplify the divorce of binational couples, to demand the boundless diversity of marriage for all, even where no one wants women to explicitly limit the value added by women only to the formalised labour market and to allow children to be raised gender-neutrally and unidentity-free in day-care. When do you think the Selmayr Commission declares surrogacy to be a cross-border service? This European Union implements all the communist recipes that Karl Marx has recommended for the destruction of functioning families. By the way, you cannot hope for any resistance from Christian-democratic parties. This is demonstrated by the results of our roll-call vote. I see this as a major cause of the Union's self-inflicted self-dismay.

You know that it is a United Nations initiative. As UN members, EU Member States may observe this day. However, as it is not an EU initiative, as such, it does not receive any specific support from the Commission. Family policy is primarily a Member State competence. The Commission supports Member States’ efforts on family and child policies through political guidance, including in the context of the European Semester. EU financial support is also available. The EU rules can affect family law in cross-border cases affecting, for example, divorce and separation, marriage, civil partnership and property issues like succession and wills, and in this area of civil law the Commission has proposed, in the recent period, rules to better protect children in cross-border family proceedings. The European Pillar of Social Rights, adopted on 26 April 2017, is our reference framework to screen the performance of our labour markets and social protection systems with respect to challenges and people’s needs. It puts forward a new generation of rights, in particular access to social protection, thus promoting universality of support for all in need, starting with children and their families. The Pillar constitute the EU’s main implementation tool for translating the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals into a European context. Concretely, the Commission put forward an initiative to support work/life balance for parents and carers. This package seeks to modernise work/life balance policies across the EU and to deliver measures that will improve the daily lives of many families. We hope that the Council will reach a political agreement on the text shortly, opening the way for constructive negotiations with the European Parliament. The role of families is also crucial for the successful integration of migrants. For example, evidence suggests that immigrant children and natives with immigrant parents typically have worse education and labour market outcomes than their peers with native parents. Migrant parents’ level of education and employment status has a significant impact on their children’s outcome. Investing in integration measures for family migrants, especially for women, is key for the future well-being, prosperity and cohesion of our societies – European societies – and, of course, labour markets. The Commission also provides important financial support to various NGOs, including Eurocarers, Eurochild and COFACE Families Europe. The action undertaken by these NGOs substantially contributes to EU policy-making in the social area and increases awareness-raising on the issues related to the work of family members.

We in Slovakia chose the motto \"We stand by each other\" for family day. The common denominator of these two perspectives is the mutual solidarity that arises in the family and from there spills over into the wider community. In the European Union, too, we talk a lot about inclusion. True inclusion is based on the ability and willingness of people to stand not side by side, but with each other. Strong with the weak, healthy for the sick, the rich for the poor, those who live in surplus, those who are in short supply. \"We stand by each other\" is an expression of proximity that allows you to shake hands, support, comfort, simply help each other whenever necessary. This close proximity, this solidarity, we're learning in the family. As regards the direct influence of social policy, including social protection, the European Union has very limited powers. Its role, as defined in the Treaties, is to support and complement the activities of the Member States in this area. However, any political decision at European Union level has an indirect impact on the family. The rules governing the Single European Market, foreign and security policy, the rights and obligations of european Union citizens, even the prohibition of discrimination, all affect family life.

I am convinced that, with time, everybody realises that the most important values, in life is family. No amount of money, clothes or even a good job can be compared with the family. Only relatives and loved ones, with a smile on their faces communicating with us, can bring us true joy and happiness. Only at home can we always show our true emotions and find moral support and practical advice. And the family is the main source of our inner soul power. In my opinion, every person’s success in life directly depends on the relations in his or her family. Unfortunately, there are problems which families face every day: for example, poverty, lack of social support, and an absence of equal rights among family members. In a special risk category are such vulnerable social groups as young families, migrants, ethnic minorities, and families with persons with disabilities. To resolve these issues, the European Union is developing an approach to family policies for inclusive societies. The main aim is to raise awareness of the role of families and family-oriented policies in achieving more inclusive societies. The primary emphasis is put on social inclusion and the protection of various types of families to facilitate their full inclusion in the mainstream of society. This can be achieved through implementing the following points: for example, firstly ensuring equal justice to all family members, especially women; secondly, providing universal birth registration and legal identity for all, especially targeting vulnerable families; and lastly, developing and promoting social protection. These are key points in order to save and support such things as cohesion, unity, empathy, integrity and solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 174, "date": "2018-05-31.json", "name": "Urszula KRUPA", "mepid": "28334", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab The fact that the UN declared 15 May international family day is of course important, but not in the celebrations or the flags proposed – even beautifully designed – is a problem, but in creating the right conditions for the development and functioning of a family that plays a huge role in educating young generations, being an environment in which children learn fundamental values, love, respect or selfless help. Children without good role models have difficulties in developing, in coexisting, difficulties in respecting moral values.  The problems of modern families are caused not only by financial scarcity as a result of the huge social stratification with unemployment and low wages, but also by the increase in the cost of education, which is sometimes the reason for neglecting educational responsibilities.

Let me quote: \"Family is a space in which a person's personality is formed. A space for the creation of human capital, the upbringing and growth of future generations. As such, it is undoubtedly the basic and most important unit of our company. Only stable and prosperous families guarantee a good environment for raising children, sustainable development and society, its functionality and cohesion. The role of families in society is irreplaceable\". Colleagues, this is not an archaic text. This is the concept of family policy of the Government of the Czech Republic from 2017, i.e. the text very contemporary. I'm glad I was able to read it, because that's really the way it is, we just need a family. But I ask: How do we take care of her? The European Union does not have direct competence in family policy, but in fact every decision we make here affects the families in their lives. We should support parents, we should appreciate their care, and we should also support parenting education. Unfortunately, for example today, we have instead approved recommendations on social education, on guarantees for children. Instead of families, it is supposed to guarantee the social standard of the European Union. I am a great supporter of the European Union, but I fear that if we question the family, our common ground, then we are also breaking the foundation of the European Community.

I think it is a very good one, but of course we perhaps have a different interpretation of family now than we might have had a number of years ago.  Ms Miranda is right that, regardless of their composition, given different situations, all families are very important, and the more stable they are, the more stable society is. This year’s theme was ‘family and inclusive society’. I think that was a very good theme, because we do need to do more in terms of being more inclusive and welcoming in modern society. You start with the family, and that is very important. As well as that, it is often the family that is the place that you go to for real care and compassion in times of true struggle and, without a stable family, it can be very difficult to deal with issues like that. I also think that the social, economic and demographic issues are to be considered, and I know that in my own country the emphasis would have to be on mental health and homelessness. These issues are being dealt with in relation to the family and, indeed, individuals. Finally, I just want to say that last year’s theme was finding a work-life balance. In some respects I suppose that we politicians are the worst people to talk about that, because being away from home, as MEPs, and spending weekends doing our work, without a supporting family behind us – an understanding family – we just couldn’t continue. So we can be very grateful for all our families, no matter what their composition is.

But the trend in modern life, as in all advancing economies, is that the families tend to be a smaller now. Thankfully, I have four children myself: two boys and two girls – a good balance.

I could also get out - father, grandfather, several children. I would like to see such a debate on the family lead to better airtime. That would be the first point. Because there is a lot to discuss, and there are also disadvantages. I also admit that in democracy this is sometimes the case: you must always strike a balance between the majority and interest in minorities. Sometimes this does not work out properly. In Germany, too, we have problems which speak demonstrably of the disadvantage of families, that is right. So the task for the relevant committees to look at the problem once again is also a matter for the relevant committees. Secondly, what annoyed me a little: I had to go through a socialist educational path, and it is likely that classics can be interpreted differently – as the previous speaker, Mr Meuthen, did. So, it was always said in socialism: the family is the smallest unit of society, which must be nurtured and nurtured. There were already contradictions.

When we argue here, we should argue politically, not too emotionally. There is a great deal of argument and much to be argued about here in Parliament, which makes life difficult for parents. This is not justice. And if we strengthen other sides and thereby weaken parents, then that is anti-family policy. I hope that in future politics we will always ensure that there is intergenerational justice – that is family policy – that the educational benefits of parents, especially mothers, are recognised. It is not acceptable for mothers of more and more children to receive an ever-lower pension. There is something wrong with the system. We really need an education salary, adjusted for the money that others get for the same benefit in kindergarten, in the nativity scene and other professions that are basically equivalent to parental benefit, for example in the children's home. We do not just need spousal splitting, we need family splitting where the children are counted. We need a family suffrage – a right, a human being, a voice. And if we want to eliminate the risk of poverty in children, we must also ensure that parents are repeatedly called upon. They are also penalised in the tax. They have to pay many times as much in taxes, because they always pay for the children at the value added tax and thereby also fill the tax bag of the corresponding state. Solidarity is needed here. And so thank you very much. One minute is not enough.
