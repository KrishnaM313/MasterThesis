Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which In September, thousands of people took to the streets in Egypt. And that was new: they have taken to the streets all over the country, they have fought against corruption, they have fought against corruption, they have lost the money that is being lent to the country and the citizens for the construction of roads, of schools, of hospitals, and that it is moving far too slowly. The regime violently crushed the protest, and 4,300 people were arrested, many of them children. Hundreds have disappeared, human rights activists are still being targeted, social media and messenger services are being monitored. The message is clear: Al-Sisi does not tolerate criticism of his rule, and unfortunately it arrives. Human rights activists today only dare to talk about violence in exile. And what does the EU do? She is silent. It transfers budget support to the government, and Member States continue to export surveillance technology and weapons. This week, for the first time, I was jointly responsible for a motion for a resolution, and I can tell you that the negotiations on this resolution were not easy, because we all agreed on really important consequences and thus got to the fore. And in the end, all those responsible agreed, and I am very proud of that. Because we say one thing very clearly: yes, Egypt is a partner of the European Union, but we no longer want to be accomplices of this regime. That means ending business as usual with Al-Sisi and freedom for the protesters. And, more specifically, no more espionage technology in the hands of this regime. It is not acceptable for us in Europe to make money from it. In other words, no more blank cheques for EU funds to the regime, but a review of budget support and the strengthening of civil society. And – and this goes to the Commission – it is finally clear in diplomatic negotiations and statements! Ladies and gentlemen, I have my suitcase outside and I am now flying straight to Egypt and I am telling you: I would really like to take this resolution with me, because I know that it gives hope to many people – and yes, some of them also headaches.

With European Union money, hospitals are being built there, the social system is being strengthened and we are really taking care of the neediest.

Furthermore, national and international mobilizations, including those of this Parliament, have not yet produced results, with the resolutions of 10 March 2016 and 13 December 2018. While promoting truth and justice is also the duty of the European Union, it is also a duty to guarantee and protect the rights of its citizens, outside the Schengen area. Was everything done for Giulio Regeni?  Let us remember that the European Union is Egypt's first economic partner and its main source of foreign investment, so much so that the European Union's bilateral assistance to Egypt, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument, amounts to around EUR 500 million for the period 2017-2020; that Egypt is an important interlocutor and a key country for stability in the Mediterranean area, given its geopolitical position and the presence of a long border in the desert, which makes it difficult to control flows, people and goods; - the confrontation between Egypt and the Eu ropean Union must promote respect for and protection of the rights and freedoms of the individual, because the stability of a country runs parallel to the protection of individual freedoms, respect for the value of life and the rule of law; that the wave of repression, the tense climate and international criticism could threaten the very stability of Egypt and therefore of the whole area of North Africa and could involve Europe, with disastrous consequences.  Also in the light of the recent resumption of dialogue between the Cairo and Rome prosecutors, Europe must encourage the government of al-Sisi to reassure the international community about respect for human rights in Egypt, so that this effort can also open a window of opportunity to reveal the truth about the atrocious death of the young Friulian.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2019-10-24.json", "name": "Nicola PROCACCINI", "mepid": "197820", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that this House should support the defence of civil rights in Egypt.

The European Union continuously recalls the need for Egypt to improve the situation of civil and political rights, including freedom of expression, both online and offline. The European Union emphasises the importance of respecting fundamental freedoms of peaceful assembly and association and the rights of human rights defenders. The European Union welcomes the passing of a new NGO law which replaces the much—criticised 2017 law. It is crucial that it is implemented in a way that allows civil society to work freely and that all restrictive measures for human rights defenders under the foreign funding case are lifted. Large numbers of arrests took place in the wake of the 20 September protests. Since then, arrests have been extended to those that did not take part in the protests. It is particularly concerning that arrests targeted politicians, human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists, most of whom are detained on terrorism-related charges.

There is a clear need for accountability for all forms of pressure, harassment and violence against human rights defenders and civilians seeking to exercise their right to protest peacefully.

The multicultural society is hard, fast, cruel and little in solidarity, it is marked by considerable social imbalances\" and \"has a tendency to move into a diversity of groups and communities and to lose its cohesion and the binding nature of its values\".

The European Union has monitored closely over the years the revision of the Criminal Code through regular engagement with Government, Parliament, civil society and international partners.

I appreciate it. Recently, it was announced that Mr Adam Farkas, Executive Director of the European Banking Authority (EBA), will become the CEO of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). It’s remarkable, right? It’s astonishing. It’s flabbergasting that the supervisor of that sector becomes the main lobbyist for that same sector.  The EBA is responsible for supervising the EU’s banking sector and for setting technical standards implementing key financial regulations. This makes the EBA of fundamental importance in supervising the financial sector. It also makes it a constant lobbying target for the industry. Especially AFME, with its technical expertise and focus on implementing measures drafted by the EBA, has permanent interaction with the European Banking Authority. You can just imagine my surprise when I learned that the EBA’s Executive Director will become AFME’s CEO.  Farkas’ move gives the banking lobby privileged insight into the EBA’s decision—making and private access to high—level staff. As such, banks will be able to excessively influence key pieces of legislation. What is worse, this move may give EU staff the wrong idea that if you are friendly towards the sector that you are meant to regulate then you will be awarded a well—paying job. In other words, this opens the door for very perverse incentives.  The EU rules need to prevent this and want to prevent this. Article 16 of the EU Staff Regulations states that EU officials are prohibited from lobbying staff of their former institutions for a period of one year. As CEO of AFME, maintaining contact with the EBA is the headline of one’s job description. Is it realistic to expect Farkas to sit in AFME’s tower, avoiding contact with his organisation’s main interlocutor?  The Staff Regulations also allow the blocking of professional moves if that leads to a conflict with the legitimate interests of the institution. Is good supervision of the banking sector no longer a legitimate interest of the European Banking Authority? Because that’s what’s severely undermined by Farkas’ move. Furthermore, if this case of revolving doors doesn’t lead to a conflict of interest sufficiently severe to block it, if Farkas is allowed to join AFME, any EU official will be allowed to join any organisation. In effect, it renders Article 16 meaningless.  Yesterday, we launched a petition with 58 NGOs against this case of revolving doors. Many people are disappointed, frustrated, or even outright angry. On behalf of the citizens of Europe, I therefore ask you: do you deem Farkas’ move to be in line with the Europeans institutions high ethical standards? Do you agree with Mr Farkas remaining in his position until the end of January? Will you exert pressure on the EBA to change its position and block Mr Farkas’ professional move? And what will you do to put our ethical standards into practice and prevent further cases of revolving doors from undermining citizens’ trust in our institutions?

This framework includes post-employment restrictions, which were strengthened by the 2014 Staff Regulations reform. The EBA Board of Supervisors is the decision-making body responsible for deciding on and enforcing post-employment restrictions. It decided on the requirements to be imposed on Mr Farkas for him to join the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME).  The European Commission representative does not vote in the Board of Supervisors. However, the Commission is a Board member and is thereby entitled to contribute to discussions at Board level. In this context, the Commission pleaded for the strictest possible approach towards Mr Farkas’ departure, taking into consideration the Staff Regulations.  The decision taken by the EBA Board of Supervisors includes restrictions on Mr Farkas both while in service at the EBA and after leaving the EBA. With regard to restrictions while in service at the EBA, the decision taken by the EBA Board of Supervisors includes measures to cover the notice period to which he is entitled under the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants. These measures include immediate cessation of any activities related to the preparation of EBA regulatory or supervisory policies, attendance at Board meetings, external representation of EBA and access to information outside the operations and accounting department. The restrictions also include three months’ ‘gardening leave’ in which he ceases to exercise his role as appointing authority under the Staff Regulations and authorising officer under the Financial Regulation. He may not be on the EBA premises except upon the request of the Chairperson and he ceases to have access to EBA systems.  With regard to restrictions after leaving the service, the EBA Board of Supervisors has ruled that Mr Farkas may not engage in lobbying or advocacy vis-à-vis the EBA nor have professional contact with EBA staff for a period of 24 months. He may not contribute to the work of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe on any topics treated by him in his last three years of service at the EBA for a period of 18 months.  Therefore, restrictions are in place to prevent conflicts of interest during the notice period until the effective departure of Mr Farkas, as well as after his leaving the EBA. It is the responsibility of the EBA to enforce these restrictions.

According to all surveys, we perceive that European citizens have less confidence in democratic institutions and that this lower confidence is being used by populismos and nationalisms to undermine not only the European project, but also the fundamental principles of liberal democracy.  And I must say that the news of the departure of the Executive Director of the European Banking Authority to one of the main European financial lobbies contributes to this perception of the lack of independence of the public institutions, to that perception that public servants, officials and politicians, in the minds of some, do not serve the true purposes that have brought us here.  And I believe that this occasion is a good opportunity to reflect on the system we have of control. For the Commission to defend a system in which the incumbents — the people who are working with those colleagues who are going to leave that institution to work elsewhere — are the most appropriate to assess whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it doesn't really make any sense.  I'm not going to discuss the application of regulation. What I do want to discuss is that this regulation makes no sense and that we need to have an independent institution, an independent European institution that assesses, on a case-by-case basis, these kinds of situations, because it will be impossible for people working with those who wish to leave the public institutions towards lobbies to be able to have an independent criterion.

Madam President, as my colleague has just said, collusion between private and public interests can no longer last. The mix of genders and slippers rightly undermines the confidence of citizens in the European institutions. In France, it is a national sport. Mr. Macron worked at Rothschild Bank before becoming minister, then president, the prime minister was a lobbyist for the nuclear group Areva, but we are told that all this is normal and that it has nothing to do with gifts made to the wealthy, nor with the strange craze for the financial abyss that represents nuclear today. Europe is not left behind in terms of slippers with a former President of the European Commission, Barroso, who was debauched by the goldman Sachs bank.  Today, we are faced with another case of bewildering slippers where a senior official, currently in charge of supervising banks and limiting the risks of a new financial crisis, will become, in a few weeks, the director of the main financial lobby, whose essential role , if needed to be recalled - is to curb all new banking regulations as much as possible. From February 2020, he is the Executive Director of the European Banking Authority, 'Dum Farkas', who will become the Director General of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), one of the leading financial sector lobbying groups. Some conditions have been put in place - and you have recalled them earlier - by the European Banking Authority, such as a 24-month ban on lobbying staff of its former institution or, even more unlikely, a 18-month ban on advising or working on matters directly related to its previous work. But who really believes in it? And most importantly, who can verify it? And even if he does not lobby, he is in possession of valuable and confidential documents and information that he will now be able to use in the name of private interests.  This situation is scandalous and should not be allowed. That's why the rules on slippers need to change. They must be stricter to preserve the integrity of our institutions and strengthen the confidence of citizens. They should leave no room for suspicions of conflict and collusion of interest. For example, there is a need to set much longer transition periods between two activities and potential conflicts of interest.  I would add that these rules must be common to all eu-government institutions and agencies to avoid conditions set on a case-by-case basis and according to the agency concerned. Finally, we need to create an independent European ethics authority. This authority would be responsible for overseeing the proper application of these common rules.  But in the meantime, ladies and gentlemen, we can already act at the level of our institution to preserve its integrity in the face of these scandalous practices. That is why I propose to you, as Parliament has already done for Monsanto's lobbyists, to refuse to grant Mr Farkas the right of access to the European Parliament. That would be a strong signal to affirm our commitment to combating conflicts of interest.

And we already know, Mr. Mimica, that Caesar's wife should not only be honest, but must also seem so.  So it is hardly understandable that, in this case, such favourable conditions have been applied to Mr Farkas, because, as has been said before, it is hard to believe that, by saying that he is prohibited from giving advice on one thing or another related to his previous activity, the problem is solved, because, as has been said — and colleagues who have raised it are absolutely right— , is practically unverifiable. That is, any of us sit at a table and start giving information about its previous stage, without any possibility of acting against it.  I welcome the fact that the Commission, with its voice — and I do not vote — on that Board — in that Council, I mean — of the European Banking Authority, has called for the strictest application of the rule, but it is clear that it has not been sufficient.

You mentioned the conditions placed upon Mr Farkas’ move. I’ve read them and, to be frank, they are simply inadequate. I already mentioned the impossibility of banning Mr Farkas from having professional contacts with the EBA. Will he really not interact with his organisation’s main interlocutor? Besides, is not the private context just as much of a problem as the professional context?  Indeed, the EBA also states that Mr Farkas can’t contribute to activities on topics directly linked to the work that he carried out in the last three years. Frankly, I find this laughable. I cannot think of a single topic that AFME covers that doesn’t fall within the remit of the EBA and doesn’t relate to the work of Mr Farkas. I ask again, will Mr Farkas sit in the AFME tower, working on nothing substantial? Will he simply be AFME’s poster-boy, and who will monitor whether afterwards Farkas abides by the EBA’s restrictions as also put forward by Jonás Fernández? Who makes sure that the restrictions are monitored? It’s even worse that Mr Farkas is allowed to stay at the EBA right up to his departure. His interests diverge from the EBA, his loyalty is fundamentally compromised, and still the EBA makes the European taxpayer feed the bill for Farkas’ luxurious transition period. It’s unacceptable.
