It is an unfortunate situation and many citizens and businesses continue to suffer from the uncertainty caused by Brexit.  In July, the UK got a new government and a new prime minister. Unfortunately, it is increasingly clear that this has not helped to clarify the situation or the UK’s negotiation position. When it comes to the most difficult questions such as the Irish border, the UK has not tabled any new concrete proposals yet. Furthermore, opinions in the parliament in London remain divided. Only the firm rejection of a no-deal Brexit has been able to attract the majority. Still, the UK Government is insisting on its red lines. As the deadline of 31 October is fast approaching, we are faced with more, rather than less, uncertainty.  This rather bleak situation should, however, not distract us from our priority, which remains an orderly withdrawal to put an end to the uncertainty caused by Brexit. I hope that we can still achieve an orderly Brexit. This is why we have asked the UK to put forward concrete details and operational ideas regarding what appears to be the main stumbling block, namely how to ensure the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland, while respecting the Good Friday Agreement and protecting the integrity of the single market.  The latest developments in Westminster and the call for a further extension make it very difficult to predict how things will unfold. We have to acknowledge that currently, a no-deal on 31 October is a quite likely outcome, not least because the UK Government... (Cheers from certain quarters) keeps on repeating they are ready to leave without a deal. Therefore, preparedness efforts have to be stepped up and measures finalised quickly at EU and national level in close cooperation among Member States and with the Commission, building on the last package of measures tabled by the Commission and on those already adopted. These new legislative activities at this early stage of the new institutional cycle will add to an already heavy agenda.  We are confident that by working together we can deliver. I’m encouraged in this respect by the speed at which our two institutions were able to reach agreement on the previous Brexit-related proposals. The Presidency, with your cooperation, is determined to facilitate the adoption of the last batch of contingency measures in good time.  While the point of departure for the future relationship will largely depend on whether the UK decides to leave with or without a deal, we will in any scenario need to address our fundamental priorities with the UK: safeguarding citizens’ rights, honouring the UK’s financial obligations resulting from its membership of the EU, and providing an insurance to preserve the integrity of the single market, the level playing field and the stability on the island of Ireland.  In the meantime, this uncertainty and the tensions it generates are further testing our unity and resolve. It is therefore all the more necessary, on the one hand, to resist the temptation of bilateral deals at sectoral or national level and, on the other hand, to reflect our common purpose in the swift adoption of the necessary contingency measures.  Let me conclude by noting the large degree of convergence that exists between your draft resolution and the priorities of the Council. This is a clear illustration of the commonality of purpose of our two institutions as regards Brexit. So thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to this discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your invitation, it is always a pleasure for me to be able to address you, to speak before Parliament and to speak with Parliament. Over the past five years, the European Commission has always been able to count on the foresight, cooperation and support of your assembly. This also applies to the work we have done together on the issue of withdrawal from the United Kingdom. This assembly remains, I know, open. She stays at work. Michel Barnier and I had lunch with Prime Minister Johnson on Monday. You will not be surprised to learn that the Prime Minister has told us that the United Kingdom continues to want an agreement, but also that in any event the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on 31 October, with or without agreement. Nihil novum sub sole. This means that the risk of a no deal remains very real. (Applause and cheers from certain quarters) These are my best friends and groupies - don't be surprised that they are shouting! This means, I said, that the risk of a no deal remains very real. It may be the choice of the UK government, but it will never be the choice of the European Union. That is why I prefer to focus on what we can do to reach an agreement - an agreement that I still believe is desirable and always possible.  (Addressing MPs who have demonstrated previously) You have to applaud, no? You won't be surprised that the main issue is the safety net, the backstop. Everyone has heard about it, but not everyone remembers why it was approved between the 27 and the UK government. The safety net, the backstop, is an operational solution to a practical problem, the problem caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland. This problem, moreover, would not arise if the UK government had not decided to leave the European Union. The backstop has three objectives: to avoid a physical border on the island of Ireland, to preserve the integrity of the single market and, above all, Ireland's place in that market, and to protect North-South cooperation and the island economy - the all-island economy - an essential element for peace and stability in Ireland, enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. I told Premier Johnson that I have no emotional attachment to the safety net. But I have made it clear that I remain deeply committed to the goals it serves. That is why I have invited the British Prime Minister to make concrete, operational and written proposals on the alternative paths that would enable us to achieve these objectives.  Until such proposals are presented, I cannot tell you with a clear eye that real progress has been made. But what I can say, taking the opposite side of many articles, especially in the British press, is that the interviews we had were friendly, constructive and partly positive. The Commission is ready to work every day, from morning to evening - with a few interruptions all the same - to find solutions at the technical and political level. I'm not sure we'll make it, we have very little time left, but I'm sure we have to try. I have asked the British Prime Minister to clarify the alternative arrangements he could consider and I have proposed to politicize, in the noble sense of the word, the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, by charging my friend Michel Barnier, the British Prime Minister and the Minister responsible for Brexit, to take charge of the negotiations themselves, so that they do not remain at the technical level alone. In July 2016, the 27 agreed that it would be a mistake to focus all our energy on Brexit. We agreed to forge a stronger Union of 27, focusing on ways to improve the daily lives of our citizens. Two months later, I addressed this Parliament to deliver my State of the Union address and present my ideas and proposals for the future. This speech, an exceptional thing, was welcomed by all the leaders of the European Union meeting in Bratislava and inspired the leaders' programme. That means the 27 members of the European Union have spent two-and-a-half years negotiating with the UK looking for ways to organise our divorce. During this time, the European Union has shown great unity of purpose and solidarity with the Member States most affected. This unity is our most precious resource and our greatest asset. It will continue to guide me over the next few weeks, and I'm sure it will continue to guide this House also in the Future.

Mr President, hello to each and every one of you, Madam Minister, thank you for allowing me to join President Juncker and to complement what he has said very clearly in this brief speech on the two key points of our current discussions with the British, the question of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and also that of the future relationship. , which is at least as important as it will have to rebuild in another way a partnership with this great friendly, allied and neighbouring country that the United Kingdom will remain.  President Juncker reiterated that the fundamental demand of the British government Johnson is the removal of the backstop, or at least its replacement. As you know, the United Kingdom and the European Union, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed in November 2018, almost a year ago, on this backstop. It has therefore been approved by the 28 heads of state and government and has received very strong support from your Parliament.  And why, ladies and gentlemen, is this subject so fundamental for all of us? Simply and seriously because it is in Ireland that Brexit creates the most problems. It is in Ireland that Brexit carries the greatest risk. It is the only place where the UK has a land border with the European Union.  There is a specific political situation that we know well, linked to an often tragic history, a specific situation today with the Good Friday Agreement, of which the United Kingdom and Ireland, in particular, are the guarantors. The reason for our insistence on this point, as Jean-Claude Juncker said, is not ideological, it has never been. It is totally pragmatic: through what is called the backstop, it is a question of having a safety net, a kind of assurance that allows us to preserve in all circumstances these three requirements recalled by the chairman of the committee. We do not want the return of a physical border in Ireland, we want to protect the Good Friday Agreement, the Belfast Agreement, in all its dimensions.  We must preserve the integrity of the single market, our single market, and finally, we want to maintain the all-island economy, North-South cooperation, framed in the Good Friday Agreement. I would also like to point out that the mapping exercise we have done with the British authorities shows how this North-South cooperation is governed by law, supported by European policies and budgets from the beginning.  The new government of the United Kingdom has therefore, and again on Monday in Luxembourg, explained the provisions of the backstop which it does not like. It's not enough to explain why we should remove the backstop. We, on the other hand, simply and seriously, need legally operational solutions in the withdrawal agreement to respond precisely to each of the problems, to prevent each of the risks that Brexit creates.  And it was on these objectives that we clearly agreed with Theresa May's government. I am just taking a concrete example, which I can know well enough to have been Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries a few years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, every live animal, any product, including any food, that arrives in Northern Ireland from Great Britain not only enters the island of Ireland, the Irish market, but enters the Polish, Luxembourg, German or Danish market, mechanically, immediately. And we must exercise control, to protect consumers, to preserve food security, to prevent any risk of animal disease. We do not have a short memory and it is also in the interest of the citizens and consumers of Northern Ireland, as well as those from all over the island, as well as consumers from the rest of the United Kingdom.  So there are behind this backstop, I say calmly and again, very concrete guarantees that we need and that all citizens, on the island of Ireland, need for peace and stability, for life and the daily economic relationship on the island and of course, I repeat, for the health and safety of the consumers of the 27 , product safety, protection of national budgets. This is also the purpose of the controls at each of the external borders of the single market and which we must ensure in any event.  I hear, we also hear the questions, the remarks of the British Prime Minister on the democratic or undemocratic nature of the backstop. It is, of course, up to the British Government itself to secure the support of the Northern Irish institutions on the withdrawal agreement it would sign on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom. We have already included several provisions in the withdrawal agreement, including on the the involvement of its institutions and the various committees in the implementation of the backstop should it ever be activated. On this issue as on the others, I repeat, after President Juncker, that we remain available to listen to any British proposal, to work on it day and night, as soon as this proposal brings progress.  The other key issue, and I conclude on this point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is our common ambition for the future relationship of what we have called the strategic partnership that we must build or rebuild with the United Kingdom after Brexit. This is the purpose of the second document alongside the Withdrawal Treaty, known as the Political Declaration, which was agreed with the United Kingdom last November and paves the way for this broad partnership in economic cooperation, sectoral cooperation, judicial and police cooperation, defence cooperation and foreign policy.  In its economic aspect, this partnership takes as its starting point a free trade agreement but it leaves in the current text the door open to more ambition if there is a common will. And of course we have this desire to be as ambitious as possible with the United Kingdom in our future economic relationship, for example through a customs union.  This economic relationship must, of course, be accompanied by level playing field guarantees. Again, ladies and gentlemen, I recognise that this is a rather technical expression than level playing field. Behind this expression are human, social and territorial realities and a choice of society that the United Kingdom will have to make on the necessary balance between the right level of regulation and the economic market.  However, the British Government, which is the point I want to stress, now wishes to reverse Theresa May's commitments in this area of the level playing field. Ladies and gentlemen, with a great country so close, important as the United Kingdom, which carries out just over half of its trade with us, with the single market, an ambitious economic partnership requires a common set of rules of the game.  Therefore, I want to say so that things are clear to everyone, ladies and gentlemen, for everyone, the level of ambition of a future free trade agreement that we will have to negotiate in all cases and conclude with the United Kingdom, this level of ambition will clearly depend on the guarantees that we have put together on paper in social matters. , in terms of competition or state aid.  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to talk about these two subjects which are currently under discussion with Boris Johnson's government. Having said that, we are not losing sight of the whole thing. I just want to point out why we wanted from the outset an orderly withdrawal from the United Kingdom, which is much better than a no deal, and we know what it is all about when we talk about no deal, and I recommend that everyone do not underestimate the consequences for the United Kingdom, obviously first, and also for us, of a lack of agreement.  We want this agreement to protect the rights of 4 and a half million EU citizens in the UK and Britons in each of our 27 Member States, and this plan to withdraw secures those rights, all those rights. We want to secure the future for project owners who benefit from European funds in the territories. That is why we have obtained with the United Kingdom that everything that has been decided at 28 is well paid to the end at 28. We want to guarantee, as I said, peace and stability in Ireland and, at the end of the road, a road that is quite long, as you can see, we want to create the conditions of trust necessary to build our future relationship as outlined in the political declaration.  If the United Kingdom goes out without a deal, ladies and gentlemen, I want to remind you that all these issues do not go away. We settled them in the withdrawal agreement, but if there is no withdrawal agreement, all of those issues are there. The issue of the security of citizens, of peace in Ireland, of the protection of the internal market in Ireland, as well as that of the budget, and we will have to deal with them in any event, before a future partnership with the United Kingdom.  The consequences of Brexit are not theoretical. You have often heard me say here in this Chamber that they are innumerable and often underestimated on a human and social level, financially and fiscally, legally and technically. They are considerable, and you have often pointed out, as you do again in your resolution today.  Near three years after the British referendum, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly not a matter of pretending to negotiate. It is our responsibility to continue this process with determination, with sincerity. We will continue to do so in constant consultation, in full transparency with the 27 governments on whose behalf we are negotiating, Madam Minister, and I thank the current Presidency. We will continue to do so in dialogue and transparency with your Brexit steering group, which I thank, and with all the groups and committees in your Parliament. It will always be, it has always been, it will remain our attitude in this extraordinary and complex negotiation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, after the Brexit referendum three years ago, the Brexiteers claimed, 'the EU is finished. The EU doesn't work'. Over three years later, the EU is strong, is alive, is united. It knows exactly what it wants. At the moment, it is not Britain that is leaving the EU, but jobs and business leaving the UK.  (Heckling) One—third of British businesses are planning to leave, or are already leaving, Britain. Everybody here regrets – well, not everyone, but mainly we regret here in the plenary – the Brexit outcome, but I must tell you, during the election campaign it was a powerful argument to tell the Europeans that it's stupid and it creates a lot of uncertainty if you call the European Union into question. That's why you helped us a lot to convince Europeans that this is a stupid approach.  (Applause) Monday's meeting with Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Juncker and Prime Minister Johnson was again a missed opportunity to clarify things, and to bring new proposals to the table. And the Parliament where we can discuss the current state of play is the European Parliament, not the Commons, unfortunately. Brexiteers claimed that Westminster would 'take back control', and now they've shut it down. Is this the idea of democracy, of tomorrow in Great Britain, I have to ask the Brexiteers?  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the ladies and gentlemen for their excellent work. A fundamental consideration goes through my mind, which moves me, and that is the idea that the people are represented by the Prime Minister and that the will of the people must be implemented. 51% – that is the majority, and that must be respected, but 51% in a referendum exit is not the whole people. The whole people are represented in a parliament, in a plenary of Parliament, where interests are balanced. That is where the people are represented. And when it is also said: 'I must enforce people's opinion against Parliament', questions are asked of whether this is the right approach to lead our societies in today's world. Leadership does not mean division, but leadership means bringing together in today's societies. That makes me very thoughtful, the development in the United Kingdom. For the European People's Party, it is clear that we will support today's resolution. I would like to thank Michel Barnier for his work, I would like to thank Guy Verhofstadt, all my colleagues in the Brexit Steering Group for their work. As a Parliament, we have once again shown that we stand united in our positions, that we accept the extension only if it is well-founded, that we stand by the agreements that are fixed in the previous Withdrawal Treaty, that there are good arguments behind it and that we are also open to new proposals. But I would like to warn you one thing: in all the discussions on new proposals that are now being discussed, it must be clear that the European Union must not allow dumping on our doorstep with The Standards of Europe – Social and Environmental Standards. We must not allow this to happen in all the discussions that are coming up. Brexit has become incalculable, and that is why we must prepare for the worst-case scenario. And one thing is clear: if British politics does not get out of its deadlock, then it is probably best to return the question to the people.

It's not just about our opinion. The recent publication of the Yellowhammer report by the British Government warns of the worst-case scenarios of an unmeaserved Brexit and collapses the utopia invented by Boris Johnson. Disruptions in the steps of the English Channel, significant increase in electricity prices, reduced food and medicine supplies with a serious impact on the most vulnerable populations and legal uncertainty for the hundreds of thousands of British citizens living in the European Union and for European citizens living in the UK. I am not going to want certain Members to change their attitude towards this situation. All I'm asking is respect. I'm not naive. I do not ask you to respect this House which you have not respected for a long time. I ask that you respect the people they claim to represent, because their laughter becomes anguish, uncertainties and concerns of millions of people who are attentive to this debate. (Applause) In this context, the main pro-European forces of this House express in this motion for a resolution our strong support for an extension of Article 50 to avoid a catastrophic scenario, without agreement, if the UK needs more time to hold general elections or a new referendum. You can count on our support. The person responsible for the current chaos has only one name. The current person responsible for the chaos has a name: Boris Johnson. \"A man's character is his destiny,\" the Greeks said. \"And I agree with them,\" the prime minister said in The Churchill Factor, his 2014 book on the British erdist. Following the latest episodes, fate seems to reserve Boris Johnson for the destruction of historic twinning between the UK and the rest of Europe. Our group has worked in a responsible way to mitigate the worst consequences of Brexit. From this House, the Social Democrats demand that Boris Johnson and his Government guarantee the acquired rights of european Union citizens residing in the United Kingdom. It's a fundamental issue for us. We are deeply concerned about the british Interior Minister's confusing, contradictory statements on the end of circulation after 31 October. Citizens should never pay the price for their representatives' mistakes. Let's be very clear. Our priority remains an orderly exit. And to do so, the Withdrawal Agreement is the best instrument. It protects citizens' rights, avoids a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, stipulates the UK's financial obligations and protects the integrity of the internal market. The Social Democrats have always seen Brexit as a historic mistake and we are willing to support the British people if they decide to reverse this decision. The British Prime Minister would well recall the words spoken in Brussels for which he was the hero of his childhood, Winston Churchill, before a joint session of the Belgian Parliament on 16 November 1945: \"I see no reason why the United States of Europe cannot emerge, which will unify this continent in a way never known since the fall of the Roman Empire and in which all its peoples can live together in prosperity and in peace.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, I think it’s important to recall that the British Parliament may be shut down but we are clearly showing today, with this debate, that the European Union is not. (Applause) It’s fantastic that the Brexit Party and Mr Farage are making so much noise because they can’t do it in Westminster anymore, so they have to do it here. (Applause) By the way, they are not even elected in Westminster. (Applause and heckling) As you know, colleagues, Eurosceptics like something: they like bashing Europe by saying that the European Union is undemocratic. And you can be sure that in a few moments they are going to repeat that. Well, I can tell you that Jean—Claude Juncker and President Tusk can do a lot of things, but at least they cannot close the doors of this House. That is not possible. So if the Eurosceptics, in the coming hours or the coming minutes, again want to make a ridiculous comparison with the Soviet Union, from now on they can point the finger at Westminster instead of at Strasbourg or Brussels. That seems to me to be a good way forward for them now. My hope is that, with the vote and the resolution today, we will reiterate our unity about Brexit: a unity that means Parliament, that means the Commission, that means the Council and that means the 27 Member States. There is no discussion about this. Brexit is bad. It’s a bad idea, but it has at least one positive effect, and that is to reunite Europeans and to make the European project, since Brexit, more popular again. That is what we have seen in all the public opinion inside the European Union. (Applause) In fact, the message of the people during the elections was very clear: reform Europe, don’t destroy Europe, don’t leave Europe. That was the case in all our Member States and it was also the case in Britain because nearly 40 of the 73 elected British MEPs are Remainers today. (Applause) That brings me to the main point, namely the outcome, the deal that I think is still possible. We, as Parliament, set three conditions in our resolution and I want to recall those three conditions. The first is to safeguard the rights of our citizens, for the Europeans and the British alike. Today I have to tell you that this has not been achieved. Every day in the British press there are examples of people who have already been living in Britain for a decade – even two decades – and who cannot have this so—called settled status. So I think we need a fundamental shift in the way the UK Government applies at least that part of the Withdrawal Agreement. What we don’t need is the bureaucratic application that we have now. What we need from the British Government is automatic registration of all our EU citizens. I know – and you know – that Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, very much likes to compare himself to movie characters. Well, concerning citizens’ rights, instead of playing the angry Hulk, I think he should be inspired by another character, the caring nanny in the film Mrs Doubtfire, with the late Robin Williams. Secondly, I want to come back to the other problem, the Irish backstop – or maybe, Michel, let’s call it something else: if they have a problem with ‘backstop’, we’ll call it a safety net. I think that is something we can certainly agree on. We need such a safety net and not only for economic reasons. The main reason why we need the safety net is to make sure that violence does not return on the island of Ireland. That is the main reason. (Applause) And I have to tell you that I find it completely irresponsible of a number of British MPs, especially hardline Tories, not to accept this. I have to say that, as we speak – and I ask Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker if they can confirm this during the debate – there has not been one legally feasible and practical alternative put on the table by the UK at this moment. So, clearly, I have to tell you that the idea in the British press today to limit the backstop to agricultural products is not enough because they represent only 30% or 35%, I think, of the total imports of goods and services across the border. Also, a backstop cannot be ended unilaterally by Stormont because that is not a safety net: it would be a permanent instrument for blackmail during the coming negotiations. A safety net needs to be a safety net in the hands of both parties, not only of Northern Ireland but also of the European Union. My final remark is on the future relationship. I think it’s good to repeat this because we are a new Parliament. More than 60% of our Members are new so it’s important that we recall this. It’s good to repeat that this Parliament will never accept an agreement with the UK whereby Britain can have all the advantages of free trade and zero tariffs and not be aligned with our ecological, health and social standards in the future. That will not happen. (Applause) I can tell you one thing. I know that there are some people in Britain who think that these Europeans, at the end of the negotiations, will give in. Well, that may be possible, but we are not stupid. That means that we will not kill our own companies. We will defend our own companies, we will defend our own economy, we will defend our single market and we will never accept what people call a ‘Singapore by the North Sea’. That will not happen. (Applause) Finally, we all know how Brexit started. It was an attempt by David Cameron to heal the divisions in the Conservative Party and the consequence has been enormous divisions in British society. What we will not allow, as Europeans, is for this Brexit to create turmoil and divisions in our European Union and in our European project.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not choose Brexit, but we respect the choice of a majority of British voters and the best proof of this is that we have, in good faith, negotiated an agreement that allows the separation - which we regret - between the United Kingdom and the European Union. But I would like to make it clear that the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union does not free it from the legally binding obligations it has incurred for 45 years as a member of the European Union and under the so-called Good Friday peace agreements, which have nevertheless put an end to a conflict that has claimed the lives of 3,000 people and ruined that of so many others. We regret that the British Prime Minister, as well as a significant number of representatives in the British Parliament, are unaware or pretending to ignore the existence of these obligations. The position affirmed by the British Prime Minister is, in short, to say to the Europeans: I ask you to open a 500-kilometre gap in the internal market. This while affirming the determined will to engage the European Union in a policy of intolerable fiscal, social and environmental dumping. You will understand that this attitude is not likely to create in the head of the 27 States of the Union and ourselves, here in the European Parliament, the confidence necessary to find a negotiated solution to the current impasse. That is to say whether the prospect of an exit without agreement remains a hot topic and is therefore far from being ruled out. I want to say to all those, particularly in the United Kingdom, which welcomes such a prospect or who imagine that, in the face of such a prospect, the 27 would bend the spine, I would simply like to say to them this: it is that between two evils, that which would undeniably constitute an exit without agreement and that, much worse, of an irreparable attack on the integrity of the internal market, the 27 will always choose the least of these evils. But I would not end on this note and the worst is never sure. I have the honour and happiness of having 11 British MEPs in my political group. They are among the millions of Britons who know where their country's interest lies, that is, at the heart of the European Union. I say this clearly here: if the United Kingdom, either through its Prime Minister or any other constituted authority, were to ask the European Union for an extension of the Article 50 deadline, we must accede to that request.

We allow one of the oldest democracies in the world, one of the oldest parliaments in the world, to be given lessons in democracy, when this Parliament and these institutions have shown, over the years and even recently, that they have an aversion to democratic principles, that they exclude minorities from representation or that they have a decision-making process that is very often not carried out by elected representatives of this House but by bureaucrats not elected by anyone. The mirror of this arrogance can be seen from the beginning of the resolution which the majority of the parliamentary groups in this House have written and which we are about to vote on. The beginning of this resolution reads: 'considers Brexit to be a deplorable event...'. For you, the democratic exercise, the greatest democratic exercise, the referendum, is a deplorable event. Allow you to give lessons in democracy to the British Parliament. What is extremely worrying is that this aversion is not just about what we are experiencing about Brexit. , who have said no to strong interference from Brussels but, unfortunately, we know that things have gone differently. Rather than worrying about the closure of the British Parliament, which is a practice under English law, I would be concerned about this Parliament's aversion to the election results and, above all, to referendums. Changed. I believe that the real point of Brexit is the fear that the European institutions have, the fear that someone might show another way and the fear that the United Kingdom outside the European Union may prove that perhaps this institution is not perfect, perhaps this institution has made mistakes and perhaps someone can freely decide to take another path and show that it is better off , or you can get better, even outside the European Union. This is the free choice of the British people and we have an obligation to respect it. Going to a fight and wanting to punish, as some in this House and in these institutions would like, the people of the United Kingdom just because they have freely decided to take another path does not do credit to the project you want to support. In these three years I have not yet seen a serious examination of conscience on the part of these institutions and by this House, an examination of conscience in order to understand the deep roots of why a Member State has decided to leave the European Union, why a Member State has said enough about this project which you consider infallible and inescapable but which has obvious flaws. Rather than looking at what is happening in the United Kingdom, I would be concerned about the serious institutional, economic and political crisis currently afflicting the European Union, an interinstitutional crisis between Parliament, the Council and the Member States, a crisis within Parliament too, with the extremely divided and divided political groups that have managed to elect and confirm the President of the Commission and a political future that is not yet seen.

The British Government wants a deal, not any old deal but one that is acceptable to the British Parliament and the British people, and we need to get it over with quickly. So we must leave on 31⁰October: we should have left on 29⁰March, then on 12⁰April, now on 31⁰October. What’s the point of further delay? Some of you may think that if we drag this out a bit more then there’ll be a change of regime in Britain, maybe a change of heart, but I believe this is total delusion. (Applause) What sort of relationship do you want to see with Britain in the future: a positive one based on friendship and goodwill and mutual interest, or one based on anger and bitterness and exclusion? Everyone engaged in the process who genuinely seeks agreement must redouble their efforts to get a deal. This requires goodwill and flexibility on both sides. Remember that, in the EU, nothing is possible and everything is possible if there is political will. On EU citizens, the British Government has been very clear, they are welcome to stay, and it is committed to protecting their rights. More than a million applicants have already been given settled status under the British scheme and there is lots of time for the rest to apply. The European Union needs to adopt a similarly generous approach towards British nationals. (Applause) The outstanding problem is, of course, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. No⁰one has a greater interest in peace than the people of Northern Ireland and the British Government. For all its failings, we are committed to the Belfast Agreement, the so-called Good Friday Agreement. This agreement, by the way, does not mention the border. It is, however, based on parity of esteem between the two communities, the two traditions in Northern Ireland. And please don’t forget that the majority of people in Northern Ireland are Unionists, they’re proud to be both Northern Irish and British and they wish to remain so. Some in this House seem to have forgotten this. So both the EU and the UK must apply some creative thinking to find alternative arrangements to the safety net, as I much prefer to call it. I don’t think the Verhofstadt resolution, by the way, contributes anything useful at this stage. We would like to see a Brexit steering group that is truly democratic, fully representative and a real source of wisdom and ideas, not just repeating tired mantras. (Applause) After all, the final deal needs the approval not only of the British Houses of Parliament but of our European Parliament as well. And colleagues, I say to all of you who represent parties of government: it’s time to get cracking. Pick up your phones, I know Mr⁰Barnier needs no instruction, but he needs to do a deal and the Council must urge him to get on with it before it meets on 17⁰October.

Mr President, I would like to thank the When I was new to Parliament, I heard a Brexiteer say: I have to destroy an empire. What he meant, of course, and what he was referring to, was the European Union, but the Brexiteers' policy only meant that the UK was in the biggest political crisis in decades. This is a crisis for which workers, pensioners and small and medium-sized enterprises will have to foot the bill. This policy is not in the interests of the British people or the european people. Boris Johnson's government knows this very well – Operation Yellowhammer. What sounds like a bad title of a James Bond film is a situational analysis by the British Government, which assumes that there are shortages of medicines, food shortages, social unrest, re-emergence of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the government seems to be pursuing precisely this political strategy. I say to you: this is an absolute aberration. Nor are we talking about abstract things here when we are talking about Brexit with or without a deal. We are talking about the fact that, for example, a German or a Polish nurse does not know whether he will still have a residence permit in the United Kingdom to work in the health system. The same applies to the work permit. We are talking about a British pensioner not knowing what will happen to her pension payments when she lives in the EU. And we are also talking about the fact that a family in Belfast who want to send their children to school in the morning may have to be afraid again in the future that something will happen on the streets, as it used to be in the years of the civil war, if you continue this policy. That is what we are talking about when we talk about a hard Brexit, and British politics must finally do something about it and show the will to do so. When I think of Britain, I think of many things, such as a defensive democracy that has resisted fascism. I am thinking of a colonial empire with all the downsides of colonial history. I am thinking of a country that has produced thinkers like Thomas Hobbes and John Maynard Keynes. And as a socialist, I remember that Karl Marx found asylum in London. But what I certainly don't think about – and I am similar to Mr Verhofstadt – is the comic book character Hulk. I say to you that a cartoon character will not preserve the peace process in Northern Ireland or protect the social and civil rights of citizens.

There are several attempts to obstruct the British referendum, the results of the British referendum. It's absolutely wrong. What is the logic of obstructing a British referendum? Repeat the referendum twice, three times, four times until the answer is different. Is that the logic of the referendum? It's about reducing democracy to absurdity. I would like to start by referring to a quote, that is, to paraphrase Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, somewhere from the beginning of The First World War, who said something like this: \"Relations, deals, words, it must be worth something. If it's not worth it, all we have left is a cannon, all we have left to do is pounce on each other.\" This referendum must be worth something. What the British people said, it has to be worth something and it has to be respected. It doesn't tell you, either, something about the will of the British people, which is here to me on the left of the 29 MPs from the Brexit party, the strongest party in this Parliament. Merkel's CDU is 23, Brexit has 29. It says something to me about the will of the British people. I'd also like to say that's what's past. However, let's look to the future. Some, a few weeks ago here, Ms. Von der Leyen spoke of a common foreign policy as something that has yet to be done, to be made by eavoting. I consider it very dangerous, von der Leyen cannot define to my Croatia what he will think, what attitude he will have towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Iran, usa, Malta or anyone else. It's the way to an even worse relationship breakdown. Enough integration and federalization. All of this strengthens Euroscepticism, some will say here is dangerous Euroscepticism. It could be, how for whom. I would like to say dangerous is Eurofundamentalism. It's either Merkel's way or no way. Redefiniting of relationships is not allowed, policy redefiniment is not allowed. And if redefiniting is not allowed, Brexit will only be the beginning.

What a paradox, one might say. Yes, I am convinced that most of us here continue to regret that Brexit takes place and we continue to be committed to Brexit in an orderly fashion.  The withdrawal agreement to which this House has contributed by working very closely with Michel Barnier – thank you, Michel – this agreement provides legal certainty to all those affected by Brexit, on both sides, but in particular citizens and small businesses and citizens’ rights remain the major concern of this House. This agreement facilitates this, the unprecedented – and I must say impossible to understand – withdrawal of a modern state from a preferential trade area and the disentanglement of links created during 45 years of British membership in the Union, with the least amount of disruption.  This agreement creates also a good foundation, also political, upon which to build future relations between the EU and the UK. Once it is finally approved, it will open the door for a status quo transition, giving time to negotiate alternative arrangements and a future relationship. The backstop, a temporary insurance policy tool, which is a measure of last resort, in principle never to be used, is an important part of this agreement.  I regret that the UK has not, so far, put forward legally viable and operative alternative arrangements that could replace the backstop, delivering on all its objectives. We are patiently waiting for this to be done. There is still a chance for agreement and I believe that we must be clear that a no-deal solution would be entirely the responsibility of the British Government. We know that even with the best preparedness, no deal is only a mitigating mechanism. No deal does not provide for a transition with a potential extension, it does not solve the issue of citizens’ rights, the Irish border, the budgetary settlement, and let me say that in spite of everything that was said by the Prime Minister, I still hope for a deep, broad and close relationship based on regulatory convergence and respect for a level playing field.

In fact, this European Parliament is the only fully operational parliament representing British citizens today. The joint resolution tabled by the Socialists, together with other major political groups, shows how united we are in asserting our position on this regrettable process of withdrawal of the UK from the EU. We fully respect the will of the British people. But if Brexit is to happen, it should be done in an orderly way, as no—deal is for sure the worst way to do it. Of course, we heard Mr Boris Johnson saying that he wants to reach an agreement with the EU without the Irish backstop. If not, the UK will leave the EU by the end of next month anyhow, even without a deal. But if Mr Johnson was really serious about the willingness to reach an agreement in the next few days, he would, by now, have made a very simple gesture: to put forward a written proposal on workable and legally operative alternative arrangements. He has failed to do so, and so he has failed to give evidence that he is serious about the willingness to avoid no—deal. So let me make it crystal clear: should the UK crash out of the EU without a deal, this would be entirely the responsibility of the UK Government, no one else. Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords approved an act obliging the UK Government to ask for an extension of Article 50 if an agreement has not been reached. There was never a mandate for no—deal given by the British people. There is now no mandate for no—deal given by the British Parliament. Therefore, we welcome the fact that this resolution makes clear that the European Parliament would support an extension of Article 50 to avoid a no—deal scenario. The way we see it, an extension of Article 50 is also important for the UK to find a political solution and, when the time comes, to give control back to the people so that people can have a final say on Brexit.

The EU responded by concocting the issue of the Irish backstop.  But who seriously believes that sporadic or electronic customs checks will lead to the resurgence of violent terror in Ireland. Not even Michel Barnier, who is trying to use the backstop to keep Britain in a permanent customs union or to force a referendum.

No matter how frustrated you are with the British Government and its Prime Minister, bear with the British people.  Public opinion is shifting on this.

The nationwide protests about the prorogation of Parliament, an outrageous usurpation of power unmatched since the 17th century, have meant the British Prime Minister is unable to appear in public anywhere in the UK, or even, as we see recently, in Luxembourg. We now know what ‘take back control’ really meant; it means taking control away from our representatives in Parliament, taking control away from the civil servants, taking power away from those who are upholding the rule of law. Brexit has not given control to the people, or to Parliament, but to wealthy oligarchs who want to avoid paying tax and to global corporations which want to tear up the laws that protect people and planet. This is why the commitment to an equal playing field on environmental standards, employment rights and consumer protections in Parliament’s resolution is so important. We cannot allow a race to the bottom, where the UK ends up as a tax haven, a sweatshop or goes back to being the ‘dirty man of Europe’.  Tragically, five million EU citizens have lost control of their lives and been shamefully turned into bargaining chips, as they struggle to keep their families together and their lives on track. I deeply regret that this Parliament has failed to suggest that their rights should be ring-fenced in our resolution.

On that historic day, a 51.89% majority chose to leave the European Union. There have been more than 1000 days since the referendum took place, and every single day since then political elitists – both in the UK and in the EU – have held the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland hostage. The decision of the UK voters to leave the European Union is binding, and those in power have a legal duty to give effect to the results of the referendum. Certain politicians may think they possess superior wisdom by preventing Brexit, but they should be reminded that even though the people may not be the ones who govern, legislate or interpret the law, they are the source of that power. This is something the political elitists of our time conveniently tend to forget. The EU is quick to preach to third countries about democracy and the rule of law, but in its own backyard democratic results are only respected when they correspond with the ideology of the EU federalists. The possibility to join the EU was always accompanied by the corresponding possibility to leave. However, what has become clear is that politicians are doing everything in their power to prevent the UK from leaving the EU. Even the Guy Verhofstadts of this world can be seen in a video drinking to the fact that they have succeeded in keeping the UK hostage for at least five years. Boris Johnson brought new hopes that Brexit might finally be delivered. However, the House of Commons constantly undermines him, most recently by voting in favour of rendering a no-deal Brexit unlawful and effectively taking away hope. The Council could block a third extension. Johnson could negotiate a different deal or leave without a deal. The people of Europe will not be silenced and will not be held hostage.

There’s a saying that ‘it takes two to tango’. But unfortunately, it seems that we are dancing pretty much alone.

I have always believed that this is in our interests and will work to achieve this end. However that withdrawal agreement must not damage the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland’s place within it. The agreement must also meet basic democratic tests. The backstop endangers these fundamental principles. This House has confirmed on a number of occasions its adherence to the Belfast Agreement. Indeed it was referenced this morning by President Juncker and Mr Barnier. One of the core principles of that agreement is parity of esteem between the two traditions in Northern Ireland, meaning that citizens from both the Unionist and nationalist traditions are treated and heard equally. Just last week the former Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, himself an architect of the Belfast Agreement, spoke out on the importance of parity of esteem, and is quoted as saying ‘any solution has to include the Unionist people, because parity of esteem in the Good Friday Agreement is both sides.’ Let’s be clear, the letter sent to the European Institutions and which gives rise to the statement in paragraph 5 of the resolution was not signed or supported by a single member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from the Unionist tradition. Every Unionist party which stood in the European elections did so on a platform of rejecting the backstop. A recent opinion poll says that 81% of Unionists are against the backstop.

It is because there is a lack of mutual trust and we see that today very clearly. Some British people fear that they will be bound to the EU forever and, at the same time, the EU wants guarantees that there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and that is exactly the point. It is not only about the UK. It is also about Ireland and we have every right to discuss this here because Ireland is going to stay in the European Union.  So what can we do?

It is first of all for us, as you have recalled, Mr Negotiator, to remain vigilant and focused on the essential: the protection of the interests of all citizens.

Cooperation with our British neighbours is an essential element for our intelligence forces, police forces and armed forces. Tomorrow, we may find ourselves less effective together to deal with the terrorist threat or to protect our strategic interests. Our economy, too, would be hard hit in an already difficult environment and I would like to draw your attention, in particular, to the significant cost of an unsealed exit for countries close to the British Isles. You will allow me to quote France, in particular, which would manage the burden of managing a restored land border with Great Britain in the event of a no deal.

Mr President, I can be brief, but nevertheless take a minute to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of President Juncker and on behalf of the entire negotiating team that I have had the honour of leading for the past three years. This debate is important. It is, we understand everyone, with our different opinions, sometimes, as a moment of truth. Three years after the referendum, we are in a moment of truth in this negotiation. This is a serious moment, when we must remain extremely calm and respectful of each other. I will continue to work like this. I would, however, like to thank you for your interventions. We have listened carefully to all those who have spoken, in particular parliamentarians from Ireland and Northern Ireland, on the most serious issue, the one where there are the most risks, as I said earlier, caused by Brexit and then the issue of citizens and the issue on which we will never compromise. , the integrity of the single market and the four freedoms that go together. Thank you for your interventions. I have also listened to all those who have spoken the other way. There is an accusation that I want to answer so that things are clear once again. I say this to Mr Zanni who is not here, Mr Farage, Mr Madison and others: no one is trying to circumvent the choice of a majority of British citizens to leave the Union. No one. No one is trying to steal Brexit. No one is trying to keep the UK against their will in the European Union, the customs union or the single market. It's your responsibility to leave. We regret it, it has been said dozens of times, many of us regret this choice - I have never seen the added value - but we respect it. It is necessary that things be clear and the mandate set out for me by the European Council with Parliament, and that I assume, on behalf of the Commission, with the confidence of President Juncker and soon that of Ursula von der Leyen, is to reach an agreement. But it requires two things, ladies and gentlemen. First, to tell the truth - here in Parliament, and to the citizens - about the consequences of Brexit. You have to tell the truth. You were talking about respect for British citizens: Both British citizens and other European citizens have a right to the truth about the consequences of Brexit. All the consequences, which are much more serious, much more numerous than you will say. You owe that truth and you will be held to account. After Brexit, you will be accountable to the citizens, as we will have to account for. So we are preparing to tell this truth, as we have always said, about the consequences of a Brexit with a deal - to which we are working - and, of course, with more serious consequences, of a Brexit without a deal. Nevertheless, I am responding in particular to the question of Mr Newton Dunn, as for others, we have prepared the hypothesis of a Brexit without agreement, including on issues of security and cooperation with Europol. Obviously the no deal is not a destination, it is a temporary state and then we will have to resume the discussion to build a partnership. So I have been working for three years with this first requirement: to tell, always and to everyone, the truth. The second requirement is very simple: it is to find legal solutions. Because we make a treaty, we do not make a speech, we do not make a statement, we make a treaty. We need to find serious legal answers to all the questions caused by the separation that you have chosen, which is Brexit, both in Ireland and in all other areas, fisheries and many others, that is and find concrete and operational solutions. Not intentions, nor wishes, but concrete and operational solutions. That is what we expect from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his team: alternative proposals, as President Juncker has said, so that if we challenge the backstop or other issues, we can answer the questions that Brexit causes. This is the second requirement I work with. We are ready to continue day and night, no one should doubt our availability.

One of the most crucial points in this resolution for me, as a UK health professional for over two decades, concerns the employment status and social entitlements of EU and UK citizens. The ability of staff from the EU to work for the UK health service – the NHS – remains severely threatened by Brexit. Three years ago, 11% of staff employed by the NHS were from other EU Member States. That figure has now halved to just over 5.5%.

We in the European People's Party, we want precisely this: to meet this demand of europeans. European researchers have already shown us what medical progress can achieve. Breast cancer, for example, now cures eight out of ten patients. Together with 15 leading cancer researchers, from Finland to Portugal, from France to Romania, we, as the EPP – and I also have a leading candidate – presented a master plan this spring that can make Europe more effective in the fight against cancer. Why Europe? Ladies and gentlemen, cancer is quite complex and occurs in countless forms. For example, in children, 40 000 cases of extremely rare cancers are diagnosed every year. In this area, if we work together, Europe can achieve much more scientific success if we cooperate and cooperate simply because of the sheer scale of the cases and the data behind them. 18 000 oncologists, 15 000 hospitals, 107 cancer research institutes in Europe, 179 universities dealing with it. If we succeed in tying this data together, if we succeed in developing a common plan in the fight against cancer, then we will be more successful. Professor Angelika Eggert of the Charité in Berlin, for example, wrote to me: With an ambitious European approach, we can successfully cure nine out of ten children's cancer patients in ten years. Professor Thierry Philip, from Paris, added: \"In the combination of prevention and early detection, with the help of personalized medicine, we could simply double the survival rates of patients with malignant tumours. That is feasible, and we must address it now.  What concrete action should be done? We need a common cancer prevention strategy first. Let's avoid cancer together in the first place! Secondly, we must finally bring together all our existing national cancer databases, create a European digital data centre for these cancer files, so that we can fight cancer earlier. We need a common early detection strategy: let us successfully cure cancer in time! Fourthly, we must not leave anyone behind. Especially in Central and Eastern European countries, cancer patients are now 30% less likely to be cured than in Western European countries. This state of affairs is unacceptable in Europe, and that is why modern forms of telemedicine can raise a great deal in standards in Central and Eastern Europe. Last but not least, let us also remember the relatives affected by these cancer cases. A cancer patient initiative that takes into consideration the concerns of relatives should be our common goal. It is important for us as the European People's Party to start now. We have been given a new mandate by the citizens of Europe, and now it is up to us to make progress. That is why we in the European People's Party are not just asking for the debate to take place today; not only do we request that we need further priorities in this master plan, based on the work done by the Commission to date, but we in the European People's Party also want there to be a special committee of the European Parliament in the future to deal with this cancer strategy as a committee. It's our concern - we want to take it up.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 130, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, it’s an honour to address this Assembly today to discuss the fight against cancer as part of this topical debate. It comes at the right point in time. Recently published research shows that cancer is already on course to become the leading cause of death in most EU countries, as mortality due to cardiovascular diseases is decreasing. The same research shows that for cancer the high mortality is not mainly related to risk factors but might be correlated to access to healthcare.  As we know, cancer is a disease that more often strikes older people. We Europeans who live longer than in other parts of the world are therefore more prone to get cancer. So how do we tackle the increasing challenge that cancer poses to our societies? Do we resign in the face of fate or do we fight back? I think we have chosen as the EU to fight back.  The Finnish Presidency firmly believes that the EU needs to put people at the centre of policymaking. We propose to start by embracing a new concept, the ‘economy of well-being’. The economy of well-being is a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that highlights the need to invest in people and their health. We think health and access to healthcare are fundamental for well-being and see health as an investment. We propose to invest in prevention and health promotion. All EU citizens should have the possibility to lead a healthy life and acquire good health habits as those are cornerstones in the prevention of cancer: They should also have equal access to healthcare, which is one of the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and supports the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. With such high goals set, there is a need for close collaboration between different institutions, stakeholders and sectors. More specifically, in the EU there seems to be agreement that cancer should be a priority. That requires action through different means such as research, access to treatment, and screening. In April this year, Parliament and the Council provisionally agreed to include a cancer mission in the future Horizon Europe, the next research and innovation framework programme. More research will allow us to better understand cancer, put in place better prevention and diagnostic methods, and allow for better treatment options, as well as allowing Member States to better tailor public health interventions. Many of you have on several occasions asked the Commission for strong actions against cancer in general, but also for actions targeted against specific types of cancer. You notably established a cancer group. Political groups have taken action and you have adopted resolutions asking the Commission and the Member States to intensify their efforts to fight cancer. On the Council side, Member States are also very concerned about cancer. The Council dedicated several sets of conclusions, as well as a Council recommendation on cancer screening, to this important challenge.  At Member State level, action was taken to strengthen the means of healthcare systems to face this challenge. The Commission has also reacted to our calls and cancer is one of the main priorities in the incoming Commission. The European plan to fight cancer that we expect the Commission to propose should have strong links to the Horizon Europe cancer mission.  We welcome efforts aiming at strengthening EU cooperation on cancer prevention. In our view, it is important that Member States learn from each other and that good practices are disseminated and promoted. This would contribute to ensuring that all EU citizens are given equal opportunities to lead a healthy life with minimal risk of developing cancer.  We are looking forward to the new plan to be proposed by the Commission. We count on the Commission to involve Member States, wherever appropriate, in the development of that plan. We also stand ready to cooperate with Parliament in raising awareness on cancer as one of the main killers in Europe. Thank you very much for this discussion and for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 2, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 2, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 131, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, this is probably my last speech before this Chamber, so allow me to be a little bit personal. Anyway, I believe I have full legitimacy to get personal when speaking about cancer. I know first—hand the emotional and physical consequences of this disease, having lost three beloved brothers. I know how it feels when you are face to face with a diagnosis and you know it is too late. Therefore, let me be clear. If we want to get serious about beating cancer, we need to start putting our money into the remedies that cannot be prescribed only by a doctor or health commissioner. It is a political question. I agree with you, Mr Weber: these remedies are in the hands of those who make policies on risk factors and determinants – commercial, social and political determinants – which facilitate risk factors. These remedies are in our own hands as well, when we smoke, eat junk food or abuse alcohol. And it is about the economy of well-being – I agree with Madam Minister. In 2014, when I took up my position as Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, I announced that one of my major priorities was the promotion and protection of health and the prevention of diseases. I preached for this but the paradigm shift is yet to come. However, we have worked hard and we have achieved some tangible results. Tobacco consumption fell, through legislation and anti—smoking campaigns. European Union legislation on chemicals, pesticides and exposure to carcinogens, including at work, was upgraded. We have spread the word on prevention, particularly thanks to the improvement of the European Code Against Cancer. The European Cancer Information System (ECIS) is now up and running and accessible – it monitors geographic patterns and cancer trends – along with national cancer plans to be adopted. In recent years we have seen continuous improvement in the coverage and quality of national screening programmes for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. As you know, October is a month dedicated to breast cancer and I have my ribbon especially for that occasion. Better vaccination coverage will impact on infections and cancers caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B. In this context, I am proud to inform you that last week the Commission, together with the World Health Organisation (WHO), organised the first global vaccination summit, where immunisation against HPV was placed high on the agenda. Also, since March 2017, we have established 24 European reference networks, of which four are dealing specifically with rare and complex cancers, especially in children. This is across the European Union. We took a major step forward in terms of alcohol nutrition labelling and finally came to a consensus. I have cooperated fully with the European Cancer Organisation to help increase awareness. The new Regulations on Medical Devices entered into force on 25 May 2017. Furthermore, we have taken the ambitious decision to evaluate jointly the EU Orphan Regulation and the EU Regulation on Medicines for Children because cancer treatment for children is a very challenging issue. This work is not finished: we will continue to add to it. I wish I could have done more, as we are facing important societal challenges, such as an aging population with multimorbidity. There is a growing cost of non-communicable diseases and new treatments, and unfortunately we are still only spending about three percent of our resources on prevention. This is a drop in the ocean. We need to increase this amount and make sure that what we spend is spent effectively. One way to achieve this is by sharing best practices between Member States. The European Union Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non—Communicable Diseases is very valuable in this respect as it identifies Member States’ priorities and highlights best practices that can be transferred, scaled up and implemented with European Union support. The Commission’s Best Practice Portal has proved to be a powerful tool as it picks up top-quality practices that can be adapted and reproduced across Europe. The interactive EU Health Policy Platform also helps civil society, including patients’ organisations and health professionals, to promote debate about public health concerns and especially concerns related to cancer. We also deliver the State of Health in the EU cycle that will help Member States to create better health care policies for those who suffer from cancer. Communicating risks to citizens and enabling healthy choices are vital parts of any prevention strategy. We have put a lot of effort, including in relation to healthy food, into the common agricultural policy, and so on. Technological and scientific developments offer immense potential when it comes to cancer prevention, treatment and care. For example, we can expect a future where we will have much more precise treatments based upon the genomic signature of the patient. I am very glad that we have already started the European ‘1+ Million Genomes’ Initiative. Investment in research and innovation has been a long-standing priority for the Commission. Through its Framework Programme for Research, the Commission has invested some EUR 2.8 billion since 2007 on prevention, diagnostics, therapeutics, cost—effectiveness and the quality of life of patients and cancer survivors. From 2021 onwards, Horizon Europe will promote open science and maximize the potential for innovation. In the proposal for Horizon Europe, the Commission has introduced the mission approach, which would help to build coalitions to address the most pressing global European challenges including cancer. One of the first mission areas identified for Horizon Europe is action on cancer to mobilise a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including citizens, patients and all those who care for them. I also believe that the work that began with the European reference networks for rare diseases can pave the way to a better ecosystem for patients, with big data, artificial intelligence, universities and industry working together building big ecosystems, or maybe some health ‘collider’, especially addressing cancer. I will be more than happy to see that in the future. I want to say a few words on an ongoing initiative that plays a key role in the discussions about innovation. The Commission’s proposal for a regulation to strengthen European Union cooperation on health technology assessment (HTL) aims to facilitate access to innovative health technology, and access to treatment is a major issue today. The proposal has already passed the European Parliament scrutiny process. I count on your continued support to make this initiative a success and I would like the Finnish Presidency to finalise the work on this issue. All these are important steps in the right direction, but it is essential that this progress, this innovation and these developments reach the patients who need them the most. I am pleased to see that the Commissioner—designate’s mission letter focuses on ways to help ensure that Europe has a supply of affordable medicines to meet its needs. I am also delighted that the Commission’s new President-elect has included the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan in her political priorities. This is a very important message. Cancer is a relentless disease. Let’s not give up. I thank this House for its support during my time in office. I also seize the opportunity to encourage the Council of the European Union and all the institutions to renew our common determination and political will in the fight against cancer, as was done back in the 1990s when François Mitterrand gave impetus to the Europe against Cancer initiative and it helped us very much for a long time. We must continue to work together to prevent cancer, promote health and improve treatment and care. I look forward to hearing your views.

So it's really an emergency and a priority. This means that the new European plan to fight cancer is expected: prevention - you mentioned this, Commissioner -, diagnosis, treatment, support and palliative care... We can and must improve things in every stage of the disease, that is obvious. But cancer is also an often multifactorial disease, which can take many faces. A European code against cancer has been in place since 1987 and since 2014 it has included twelve common-sense recommendations. It has been said: do not smoke, exercise, prefer a healthy diet, watch out for the sun, watch out for radon. Despite all these recommendations, cancers are still on the rise. What for? Maybe because we are not looking in the right direction. You really have to dare a multifactorial action plan. A plan that would say stop women's night work, which increases the risk of developing breast cancer by 30%. a plan that would ban the use of pesticides to prevent farmers and farm workers from being among those with the highest rates of prostate cancer. An exit plan, Commissioner, of endocrine disruptors and substances of concern to protect the health of consumers and reduce their overall exposure to these chemical residues that are piling up in our organs. A plan to get out of the air pollution we breathe and that makes us sick. We really need to increase prevention. Of course, there is access to medicines for all.

Unfortunately, especially with the President, it is not clear at what level she wants to combat this large-scale problem. Let us be honest, the current Commission has been very contradictory in its approach to the fight against cancer. On the one hand, it proclaimed the importance of prevention and, on the other hand, ostentatiously and unlawfully ignored its obligation to regulate the use of so-called endocrine disruptors, which are one of the reasons why cancer is currently so widespread in all its forms in society. The culmination of this effort by the European Commission was the re-authorization of glyphosate, which was protested by both the lay and professional medical public. Early recognition and screening of the population that the new president wants to strengthen are certainly commendable activities. However, if we do not start addressing the causes that are in the substances we receive in food and water, little will change and we will just pour resources that could help doctors, patient organisations, patients, into the throats of pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies. For my part, I see greater potential in strengthening work with patients and their families, because not only cancer patients suffer, but also their surroundings, family and friends.

She called for more courage to fight this scourge, the disease that kills the most children in Europe. Parliament, in the process, unanimously adopted my resolution to develop paediatric medicines, and in particular demanded that they be subject to a specific evaluation. For half of them, in fact, we limit ourselves to dividing the doses of adult drugs! Therefore, the evaluation of the paediatric drug regulations is expected to be evaluated this year, and there is an emergency. Did you know that since 2006, only six new treatments for childhood cancers have been introduced. My question is simple, Commissioner: what are we going to say to Mrs Heinen and the thousands of parents in Europe? What has been taken in terms of research, innovation, paediatric needs and side effects, survival in young people?

Each of us is concerned with this major priority cause, the fight against cancer. We therefore need a major European plan to strengthen and pool the resources dedicated to research and innovation. We also need to harmonize public health policies because together we will work effectively and move forward on cancer research and control.  In this regard, I would like to raise the issue of supply and shortage of medicines in different Member States. These shortages include certain drugs for the treatment of severe diseases such as cancers. The causes of these shortages need to be known and analysed. We must also make all stakeholders accountable, harmonize regulations at European level and facilitate the delivery of medicines between Member States. Access to care for all European citizens must be guaranteed, with genuine transparency in the availability of treatment within the European Union. Finally, of course, we must ensure a viable economic space for companies and laboratories, which is essential to maintain investment in research and innovation in Europe. At the same time, these actors must play the game, in the public interest.  Today, 60% of essential drug components are manufactured outside Europe, China or India to reduce labour costs and take advantage of less stringent regulations.

The differences in life expectancy between the younger and older EU countries need not necessarily be adjusted through bureaucratic work, but, for example, if we take care to prevent so many young doctors from going to the West from Eastern European countries.

This debate is very timely and it’s been quite sad in many respects to listen to colleagues who have spoken of their own experience of a loved one that has died from cancer. It’s timely because on Saturday of this week, I will be speaking at a conference in my own constituency organised by the North East Cancer Research and Education Trust (Necret), and this is the sixth annual gathering, giving information and support to families and individuals who are undergoing cancer treatment. This Necret, as it is called, is involved in fundraising and supporting the unit in the local hospital so that they will have the necessary facilities and equipment to treat people.  I think when it comes to cancer we know that many Member States run checks, breast checks, checks for colon cancer, for cervical cancer, and we need to make sure that best practice prevails in all Member States.

I am grateful for your valuable insights and engagement. I am very happy to hear so many of you using the words solidarity, fairness, justice and social equality. These are important remedies for all of us. Also, prevention is better than cure, and it will be good to know that we need to do more at EU level and it will be good to see more pan-European flags and fewer national flags in this room because we need solidarity, unity and understanding.  I would like to thank Ms Ries and Ms McGuinness for their kind words. The pleasure was mine. As I mentioned, we are evaluating the Orphan Regulation and the EU Regulation on Medicines for Children. We are aiming for publication at the beginning of 2020. Mr González mentioned e—cigarettes and vaping. We see this story in the United States. I remember our discussions when we discussed issues about tobacco product directives and we proposed to regulate e—cigarettes much more strongly. Now we see evidence and of course it is clear that these products are a threat to citizens’ health. We will need to work on it.  I have heard the words endocrine disruptors, pesticides and carcinogens. These are all part of the solution and I am happy to see them in both the mission letters for the Health and the Environment Commissioners. This means that the next Commission will do more in this field. Finally, even the Brexit Party seems to understand the damage that can be done to patients if we do not fight disease together, uniting our forces, which means that Brexit really creates damage. Thank you very much indeed for understanding. Don’t leave your patients in limbo! There was a comment on breast cancer. The European Breast Cancer Guidelines and a Quality Assurance Scheme for Breast Cancer Services are part of a European initiative. This initiative is person-centred and provides various recommendations, and of course genomic and epigenomic research, as Ms Bunting mentioned, is indeed very important. I am a medical doctor and I could not agree more. As I mentioned in my introduction, we are working on 1+ Million Genomes and of course we need to do more. Europe is committed to implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This includes reducing premature mortality from chronic diseases such as cancer by one third by 2030. To do that we need prevention measures which are common to all the EU countries. They can impact on individual citizens and society in a way that isolated national initiatives could not achieve. Many cancers are challenging the medical community with their complexity and many cancers are rare diseases for which pooling data at EU level has a clear benefit and the European Reference Network now shows very positive results. This is a good way and we are going in the right direction.  I believe that the EU is best placed to disseminate knowledge and to identify and scale up best practices across Member States. The proposal for new cancer plans for the EU, as envisaged by the new President, Ursula von der Leyen, offers a major opportunity to take the next big step forward towards beating cancer in Europe. Therefore, I have no doubt that the Commission will continue its efforts in cancer prevention and control, of course assessing the situation based on what was done by the previous Commission. I am very happy to hear that we have a lot of like—minded friends around. Together our work will benefit patients, their families and health services across Europe and that is a worthy goal.

That is why it is so important to implement a comprehensive EU policy aimed primarily at raising public awareness, reducing exposure to cancer risk factors, promoting preventive research and ensuring that people have access to the information and support they need to lead a healthy lifestyle.  Another issue is to close the gap between Member States in terms of access to modern medicines. There are many problems, e.g. reimbursing old medicines means that there is a lack of money for newer ones. In addition, statistics show that some Member States' expenditure on research and cancer drugs remains very low.

The cancer incidence in Poland reaches 45% and deviates from the EU average. Cancer treatment in Poland is in a state of collapse. I watch it up close because I'm just battling breast cancer. Specialists emphasize that every stage of patient care requires improvement: both prevention, diagnostics at the level of doctors of first contact, availability of tests, out-of-doctor care during treatment, as well as the availability of appropriate medications. Prevention in the form of education in the field of healthy lifestyles is also important. Poland needs support at the level of doctors' education, expanding the offer of research, building a network of treatment facilities across the country, so that as many patients as possible can take them at home, without completely abandoning their working lives and family.

In recent decades, however, important scientific advances have occurred with regard to the ability to cure a significant part of neoplastic diseases and the possibility of treating the majority of patients, minimizing the impact of cancer and promoting the improvement of quality of life and survival time.  At the same time, treatments were made available to relieve suffering and recognition of the importance of palliative care was generalised, allowing those who are affected by more aggressive and extreme forms of cancer to live the disease with dignity. In view of the impact of the disease and the increased possibilities for response, European citizens have reason to expect more from the European Union.  There are three priorities that must be pursued. Firstly, combating the preventable causes of cancer, at the head of which tobacco smoke continues to appear.

I would like to start by underlining that this Council position was adopted with the overwhelming support of the Member States. After careful reflection and analysis, the Council proposes for next year a budget of EUR 167 billion in commitment appropriations. This is an increase of 0.6% compared to the budget voted in 2019. In the Council’s view, next year’s budget is about continuity. Next year is the last year of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014—2020, the year when many important European programmes will gradually come to their completion.  The Council wants the EU budget to continue to focus on our common priorities: strengthening the European economy, boosting its competitiveness, ensuring sufficient funding for migration and the protection of our external borders, and tackling environmental challenges and climate change. In these turbulent times we are fully aware of our responsibility as a budgetary authority. Europe has to fight battles on many fronts to safeguard its achievements and competitiveness. With the Union, we are faced with no lesser challenges: the complex discussion on the UK’s withdrawal, defining clear priorities for the next programming period, as well as ensuring this year’s smooth institutional transition, which will have a direct impact on our work in the autumn.  In this overall context, we must remember that the budget is not just about numbers and figures. It is a powerful tool that sets the direction in which EU policies will evolve. That is why we must ensure that it is focused on European added value and delivers tangible results for our citizens. At the same time, as co—legislator, we need to be very careful how EU taxpayers’ contributions are spent. That is why the Council acted, as always, with prudence and financial discipline in full consciousness of the budgetary constraints we face. We need to have sufficient leeway to meet the yet—unknown challenges and risks that await us next year.  Now let me go into more detail on the Council position. The Council proposes an adjustment of the commitment appropriations as presented by the Commission in a draft budget for 2020 of EUR 1.5 billion. This is not a cut in the budget but a reduction in the increase. Compared to 2019, the EU budget will increase by EUR 1 billion. On payments, no significant adjustments were considered necessary or appropriate. The Council continues to support the reinforcement of the programmes under the competitiveness for growth and jobs sub—heading, which will receive EUR 24 billion or +2.72% compared to this year. In addition, the resources dedicated to economic, social and territorial cohesion will increase by 2.23% in 2020, totalling EUR 58.5 billion. In the field of migration and security, the EU budget will continue to support Member States and the EU measures that were put in place in the last few years. Additional resources are foreseen for Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency – more than 30% compared to this year – in order to set up the standing corps of 10 000 border guards by 2027. I would like to stress the fact that a great number of key programmes across all headings have been accepted at the level of the Commission’s draft budget. Those are Europe’s satellite navigation systems, EGNOS and Galileo, the energy strand of the Connecting Europe Facility, the European defence industrial development programme, the large infrastructure projects, Copernicus and ITER, Erasmus Plus – which I know is one of the programmes we all cherish most – The LIFE Programme for the Environment and Climate Action, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, for example.  I also want to underline the Council position on some specific issues. First, the Council rejects the proposal from the Commission to use Article 15.3 of the Financial Regulation. Moreover, the Council has also chosen to transfer in the reserve a certain amount of appropriations in the area of migration in order for the budgetary authority to be able to tailor its response to the actual needs on the ground in the coming year.  As regards administration expenditure, the Council’s approach is based on prudent budgeting and follows the line applied in Member States’ national civil services. Following a thorough assessment of real and justified needs in each institution and per budget line, the Council has reduced this heading by EUR 55 million. In addition, in a statement attached to the Council’s position, we have asked the Commission, like last year, to take into account the level of assigned revenues in heading 5 in view of our negotiations in November.  Let me conclude by saying that today’s debate, in my view, will mark the beginning of a series of constructive and open exchanges, which will allow us to reach a balanced and meaningful compromise. Without deviating from our common goals, we will have to prioritise and demonstrate our strong commitment to Europe. I am convinced we will be able to find a common position with an equally acceptable outcome within the agreed timeframe.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. With the council's position and today's deliberations, we remain on schedule. All those responsible – Parliament, the Council, the Commission – are concerned about getting the 2020 budget adopted in a difficult time by mid-November, thus providing clarity for programmes, projects and people for next year. We in the Commission assume that we too will be able to maintain continuity and that my possible successor, Commissioner Johannes Hahn, will be able to carry out the task here as a service provider for you as of 1 November. In addition to the normal issues and questions, there is the extraordinary and open development of the Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. If there is an exit, an exit at the end of October and there is no regulation, then next year we will have a gap that we will have to talk about in a collegial way here in due regard. We still assume that the Kingdom will accept all the rights and obligations of the budgetary framework, which runs until the end of 2020, in the last year of the budget framework for the 2020 budget. Just think ahead: if there is no agreement and the kingdom were to leave automatically, without an extension, then a net gap of around EUR 11 billion will be created next year. And since the European Union, unlike all the other institutions – Member States, regions, municipalities – has a comprehensive debt ban, we would have to close the gap together immediately. The Commission would then make a proposal for this before the conciliation phase, which begins at the end of October. This could be that the eleven billion are being made through cuts. It could be that the eleven billion are comprehensively paid through higher deposits. Presumably, a balance between justifiable cuts that do us no great harm and slightly higher deposits will be the wise way. We will come back to this in three weeks if necessary. We consider it important that the Council and Parliament and the Commission share the priorities in principle: employment, stabilisation of growth, strengthening our competitiveness, innovation, the possible measures for climate protection at European level, which, in addition to emission reduction paths, also mean investment, in addition to standard setting, and strengthening our internal and external security. For some successful programmes, the Council shares the Commission's proposal: Erasmus+, Copernicus and other infrastructure projects; on the project on industrial development in the field of defence, we see ourselves very well in the Council proposal and in the Council's position. We are concerned about some of the cuts, and I will also want to talk to you in depth in the discussions about the concerns or the damage that cuts would cause. For many, many years we have been talking about 30% of our GDP for research, at 20%. Horizon 2020 is only part of the research investment, but an important part because in the digital age we do the best European research in many areas. That is why we consider the 4100 million cut to be unjustifiable. And I believe that the Council is also difficult to represent in public, because they are concrete examples. We would have to cut key technologies of the future by 200% for key technologies of the future, such as nano, micro, laser, and biotech – in areas where we can no longer follow America and China sufficiently. Is this really wise, I ask. On the subject of artificial intelligence, on technologies for the digitisation of the European economy, significant cuts would have to be made, or 1180 million less for the European Research Council. In concrete terms, this means that 800 research projects are cancelled and are not being carried out, even though we cannot co-finance an excessive number of meaningful research projects, because our resources are limited. We believe that there are also good reasons for every euro at European level in health research, in the digital transformation of health and care, in the development of artificial intelligence in health care. We have joint undertakings in the field of transport research, and they are now to be cut by 800%: Shift2Rail, Single European Sky, Air Traffic Management Research and others. And this would in part lead to us simply having to end programmes and projects. We should talk about this openly in the coming weeks. All projects make sense – better European than in 28 fragmented silos – and all projects would be at risk if the cuts had to be implemented as proposed by the Council. Connecting Europe, the cross-border Infrastructure: 2000million cuts. In concrete terms, this means that we will not be able to tackle some projects next year, including Safe Action – Austria, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands. Here we want to introduce the free emergency call service e-call. This would have to be eliminated. Or the Seine-Schelde project, a waterway project to connect the French inland waterway network with the Belgian, Dutch and German – a viable alternative to road and freight transport by road. Or the Eastern Baltic Hub – improving port connectivity and hinterland connections to Hamina-Kotka port in the Scan-Med corridor. And it is clear that if we do not tackle these programmes that do not implement projects, this will not be a saving – we will start a year later – but a postponement, a shift in meaningful investment. I will fight for every project in the Council and I ask both budgetary authorities – the Council and Parliament – to end up with these good arguments. In the case of CEF, as I said, these are measures for competitiveness and environmentally friendly transport, and I believe that everything would be a game-changer if it can be started next year. The same applies to COSME measures for small and medium-sized enterprises. The cuts would mean that Europe will not be able to become a point of contact and a support partner for many start-ups and small businesses. The cut of 25 million in the fight against cross-border organised crime, terrorism and cybercrime – here we have good arguments to avoid supporting the cuts, and the citizens are behind us on the issues. Europe and the world - heading four: a reduction of 2000 million is proposed; 70 relate to development aid cooperation and 50 to humanitarian aid. Even now, if we take it quite honestly, Europe is not doing enough to live up to its obligations to its neighbours and to the world. We must do more to ensure that human dignity is created in these regions – in the Sahel, Maghreb and Sub-Saharan Regions – so that disaster relief can be provided. With the cuts, Europe will not be the partner for human dignity and civil protection in many areas. The agencies are proposing cuts – Frontex, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, the Medicines Agency, the Office for Asylum. The cuts mean that our service is getting worse. Here, too, I would like to tell you the concerns here openly and then come back to them in the deliberations. And despite the difficult time with the kingdom's departure, we should do everything we can to avoid increasing the rituals that we always perform. With the goodwill of all three parties, an agreement should actually be possible within a few days before the end of the conciliation phase. As the Commission, we want to do everything we can to achieve this. In difficult times, good governance for a budget would send a clear message that Europe is capable of action and wants to remain a service provider for our fellow citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 181, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I warmly welcome you, Minister and the Presidency of the Council, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to begin by thanking my shadow rapporteurs, for those with whom I have already been able to speak intensively in person, but also for those who are willing to accompany me again tomorrow through the whole budget and over the course of the next few weeks, so that we as a Parliament can give as a whole as possible and clearly in one direction also an answer to the Council decision. , what this looks like from Parliament's point of view. First of all, Commissioner, I would like to thank you most warmly for simply not wanting to repeat what the Commissioner has just said. I couldn't put it more accurately. It is not a question of a traditional division of roles, that we, Parliament, simply want a lot and that the Council is cutting back in principle, but that the Council has set itself future issues, which it sees as priorities, but then gives exactly the opposite answer in its response in the context of finances.  If we want to focus on the fact that we want to focus on climate issues, on issues of digitisation, artificial intelligence, cancer prevention, the fight against cancer, the fight against serious diseases and the like, if we want to focus on this, then the answer cannot really be: we will then cut the Commission's proposal. Then there should at least be support for the Commission's proposal. When I see that you are making more than 50% of the cuts in science and research in area 1a, which accounts for 15% of the EU budget, i find that incomprehensible to me, given the priorities you have set yourself. If we want to be at the forefront, if we want not only to be a role model, but also to show that we can bring jobs and climate together in a meaningful way, economic competitiveness, and at the same time provide answers to climate issues, then innovation and research are the answer, then the focus in this area is the answer. You say that you still have 0.6% increase in the whole budget; That is not even inflation, to be honest, that is actually minus, if I am quite honest now – nothing comes out of it. In terms of innovation and research, there is actually a nominal increase, but when I see the projects that are under way, I can do almost nothing new. Those who submit projects to us – and excellently prepared, very well then analysed and evaluated, have the best evidence – there are areas where we have to reject 90%, 93%, simply because there is no money. These are areas that are promising for the future – nanotechnologies are addressed, biotechnologies, futures and emerging technologies – these are a wide range of areas. That is why I have a plea to you: let us, as rapporteurs, not run up to the last day and be proud that you are not actually talking to us about the content! I am prepared, as the Commissioner said, to resolve as much as possible with you in advance, not because we are stubborn, but because we believe that we want more for the future of the European Union and what is European Added Value, in the area of climate, in the field of development aid, in the area of future technologies; and, Commissioner, we will go much further than this last year, because last year we no longer need the huge administrative margins – we do not want to spend more on this, all right.

We were talking about fighting climate change and it was a priority, but we didn't have that sense of urgency. We didn't even know we were going to have to deal with a refugee crisis, nor the final impact that the economic crisis was going to have on our lives, nor did Brexit exist, for example. So the situation has changed a lot. But we launched, for example, a Youth Guarantee to fight unemployment. We pledge to invest 20%, to spend 20% of the budget in the fight against climate change. We even accepted a budget lower than what this Parliament wanted, always with a commitment to implement it 100 per cent, and it was a commitment from this Parliament, the Commission and also the Council. So, actually, what we're asking for, or what we have left by 2020, is simply to comply with what we're committed to at the time. And it can be done. It can be done because we have enough room for the youth unemployment programme to be back in the budget by 2020. It can be done because we have funds available to further increase Erasmus scholarships. Because we have — and they have been said a lot here and detailed by Commissioner Oettinger - excellent research projects for which we are only looking forward to more money to be able to carry them forward. We need to continue to help countries that continue to receive refugees financially, and of course we have not only the possibility, but also the obligation to at least fulfil that 20% in the fight against climate change, 20% that is already obviously out of hand. That is why it is so important that we be ambitious in the 2020 draft budget and, above all, because it has to serve as a transition for the next financial framework. Because if we want to make a leap on the social pillar, on environmental policy, if we don't want to miss the digitalisation train or if we want to make a fair transition so that the usual ones don't pay, we have to start now. We just had a debate about cancer; everyone has demanded more funds from the European budget. We have to keep it. And it is also that the President-elect, Mrs von der Leyen, in her speech to this House made a kind of priority roadmap for the next five years, and the budget we approve by 2020 is going to be decisive in knowing whether or not we are on the right track. And it will depend on us whether there are resources or not so that all these policies can be put in place. From us, Parliament, but also from the Council. And what does the Council propose? Well, he proposes, as always, more cuts. It doesn't matter the commitments, the emergencies, the needs; it doesn't matter that the situation has changed radically: in the end we only have cuts. Cuts that go against policies, which go against their own discourse and commitments, and that even go against sound financial management, because they even refuse to provide necessary resources to institutions that have to implement those policies— which have to implement them, that have to control them — or institutions that defend citizens' rights : Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, the Ombudsman or the Committee of the Regions or the Economic and Social Committee.

Mr President, earlier this year, in March, the previous Parliament adopted the guidelines for the 2020 budget. It also listed the priorities and framed the 2020 budget as a bridge to the future Europe. Four major emphasis: investing in innovation, sustainable development, the protection of citizens and security. Parliament also pointed out the special role of the new budget. 2020 is the last year of the current programming period and the negotiations for the 2020 budget coincide with the start of the talks on the new MFK. We believe that a strong, responsible and forward-looking budget 2020 will facilitate an agreement and transition to the next MFK. It is crucial for Parliament to make full use of the existing flexibility and other provisions of the MFK Regulation and the Financial Regulation. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee on Budgets has discussed the Council's position on the 2020 budget, raising a number of concerns, which have also been raised by previous speakers, but which I would like to reiterate because they are so important. For example, the Council claims to rely on absorption capacity and implementation rates to reduce expenditure on some programmes. But in many cases the pruning seems rather arbitrary and unsubstantiated. What about, for example, the proposed cuts in Horizon 2020 and Cosme? It is also noteworthy that the 2020 budget proposed by the Council contradicts what the Finnish Presidency is prioritising. I am thinking of digitisation, innovation, technological development, integration of climate policy in all sectors and special attention to the improvement of the digital skills of young people. We don't really find much of this. This automatically brings me to the next point. Now that both Parliament and the Commission have been renewed, I think it would be an excellent opportunity to give a new impetus to cooperation between the institutions during the negotiations of the forthcoming budget talks and the talks on the next MFK. I am convinced that there is scope to improve the quality of meetings between the two budgetary authorities and the Commission. I think this starts by listening better to each other and formulating arguments better. I would also like to say that it is not very productive that agreements concluded afterwards are interpreted differently by different parties, whether or not willfully.

In Europe too, now, climate change is causing thousands of families every year who are crying and have had their lives shattered. On Monday, we were all very moved. But beyond emotion, the question is whether we are able to take action. If we want to avoid climate chaos, we know what needs to be done: we must isolate all our homes, all our factories, we must develop public transport, renewables, change our agricultural model. To finance this gigantic project, the European Court of Auditors says that it takes 1,100 billion euros a year. Private and public sectors combined, we need to find 1,100 billion euros each year, the European Court of Auditors tells us. Alas! The budget proposed to us today only increases the climate budget by $0.6 billion. When inflation is taken into account, the climate budget is down by 1.3%. I find it sinister to say, but the climate budget will fall by 1.3%. At least the message is clear: the Amazon that burns, we don't care. The future of our children, we don't care. But our children will be on the streets on Saturday and will ask us to act forcefully for the common good. But the money is there, if you like. The European Central Bank has just announced that it will create 240 billion euros in one year. 240 billion euros. We all know how many houses could be isolated, how many jobs could be created in all our territories, with EUR 240 billion in one year. And we all know that in the last four years, 90% of the money created by the European Central Bank has gone to speculation. Can someone explain to me today why we are not putting all of that $240 billion into isolating our homes, transforming our agriculture, investing in renewables and creating millions of jobs in all of our territories? Who can explain it to me? Who can explain to these children why this $240 billion will not be used for the common good? We are facing an unprecedented crisis, a new crisis by its magnitude, by its gravity. We must, please, provide new answers. That's why we really need to strengthen our ambition. Eider said, the Social Democratic Group refuses all the cuts made by the Council. There is no consistency in these cuts. The Social Democratic Group wants to use all available means to strengthen our action. There is about $3.4 billion to strengthen our efforts for integration, for youth employment, for welcoming refugees, for the climate. All of this is important, but it will be quite insufficient. That is why, beyond this 3.4 billion, the Social Democratic Group will only vote on the budget if we have guarantees from the Commission and the Council to move very quickly on new resources. It is not enough, for example, to say that we want a climate bank. Everyone now agrees with the climate bank. All right, that was one of the demands of our group. But we have to say how much billions of equity we put in so that, in all our territories, we know that money is really going to come in to create jobs. Similarly, if new resources can be found and air flying is limited, the kerosene tax exemption must be ended. All of these resources will be ready to feed the next multi-year budget. My friends, it's time to declare war on climate change, it's time to stop the small steps. It's the only war that won't cause any casualties and will prevent millions of deaths. It is the only war that will bring people together and it is up to Europe to declare war.

Before the start of a new financial framework, it is necessary to take stock of European commitments, the effectiveness of budgetary action, to mark as a newly elected parliament the guidelines that we want for the next seven years. I want to use all the financial margins that we have to demonstrate that Europe has a strategy in areas of interest to European citizens.  It is time to understand the concerns of the Europeans who have chosen us and to signal that we can offer a vision of society. Europeans are increasingly concerned with protecting the environment and expect further action in this regard. In this direction, we must engage the European economy, but always be careful to keep the economy competitive, to prepare the energy transition, and to the criteria for allocating funds.  We cannot accept an urgent action and, at the same time, limit programmes mainly to a criterion of excellence. Projects that have, for example, in Romania, the criterion of excellence may be counted on their fingers. However, in terms of the environment, there are great emergencies in Romania. We have an economic fracture in the middle of the continent, coupled with an ecological fracture that we need to correct. It is important for the prosperity of the whole of Europe. We need to build financial devices responsibly, generating continental balance and not risking new imbalances.  I insist on this occasion to strengthen the technical assistance budget lines, which have proven their effectiveness, for which we have tabled amendments. We must note that the expertise is mostly located in the big European centres, that we have a brain drain phenomenon from east to west, and we must make up for the inability to implement projects in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe at European level.

Although they are growing by 5.1 billion compared to this year, as the 2020 budget is the last year of implementation of the financial framework, it is likely to speed up the implementation of projects, both under cohesion policy and rural development. On the other hand, the draft budget was based on conservative assumptions, in particular as regards the pace of implementation of projects under both funds, all the more bizarre since the margin of free payment appropriations is as high as EUR 20 billion. This may lead to a repeat of the backlog of payments that we experienced in 2012-2015, with a peak in 2014, when the backlog amounted to EUR 30 billion. On the other hand, it is a good idea to support the draft budget with a draft agreement for the UK's exit from the Union.

It is there purely for economic patronage so the Commission can grant leniency to countries which they see as EU favourites, which is why France can act with impunity and Italy cannot. Mario Draghi was right in his plea for fiscal stimulus, but it’s all in vain when the euro area remains in the suffocating straitjacket of the Stability and Growth Pact and locked into the euro, which was designed as an instrument of convergence but, as we saw in the last financial crisis, ruined the lives of Greeks, Italians and Spaniards at the altar of European integration.

The authoritarian and totalitarian regimes across Europe in the last century remain a dark chapter in our continent’s history. Remembrance is not just remembering. Remembrance is about keeping a memory alive so as not to allow ourselves to overlook horrors that have happened in the past. If we are fully to understand the present and shape a better future, an awareness and understanding of the past is crucial. To quote the Spanish philosopher George Santayana, ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’ The European Union is based on our common values: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are the cornerstone of democratic societies and the very foundation of our European project. Our common value base has enabled the longest period of peace in Europe. Fortunately, younger generations have not suffered under totalitarian regimes, yet there is now a risk that we are taking these common values and principles for granted. As you know, nurturing and strengthening our common values, and the rule of law in particular, is among the top priorities of our Presidency. The respect for democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law has a strong symbolic value. It is also crucial for the proper functioning of our societies and the policies of the Union. These common values belong to everybody and benefit us all.  My feeling is that we should better involve citizens and civil society to create a union of values for all. Here I think of a garden: beautiful flowers and trees in perfect shape. As an American historian, Robert Kagan writes, ‘an organized society, based on rule of law, is like a garden’. The natural order, according to him, is the jungle. And, like a garden, the rule of law needs constant care and protection, otherwise the jungle grows back. A lack of knowledge about the origins of the Union and about its core principles increases the risk of disinformation and manipulation. It also prevents citizens from developing informed opinions on the actions that the Union takes. On the other hand, knowledge about the diversity, heritage and traditions within the Union and its Member States promotes respect, understanding and cooperation, which in turn strengthens the common sense of belonging.  Last week the Presidency organised in Helsinki a conference on how to ensure the resilience of our societies in a changing European landscape – the interaction between democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. And there was a broad consensus among the participants that shortcomings in respecting our common values make our societies and the Union more vulnerable, both internally and externally. Today we face a number of challenges that put our open societies at risk, be it through xenophobia, nationalism, disinformation or violent radicalisation, to name just a few. We must remember – in order not to get caught in the catchy and attractive-sounding populist voices which promise simple solutions for complex issues. Not only can these promises not be fulfilled, they also discredit our democratic institutions and authorities. The damage of populism to our societies can grow when populists follow the ‘divide and rule’ strategy. They divide our societies into good and bad citizens, us and them, friends and enemies. This undermines a democratic and open political debate, and radicalisation and extremism gain ground. We all need to step up our efforts in preventing intolerance, racism and xenophobia. Europe has already paid a heavy price for this phenomenon in the past. The experience of the two World Wars taught us not to focus on differences but to create a common space in which to live, study and work.  Our societies have now been learning over several generations the value of inclusiveness and tolerance. And of course we should not forget the important role of education and the need to teach our children democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance, critical thinking and conflict-resolution skills.  I’d like to conclude by stressing that Europeans need to remember their own history in order to learn from the past and not repeat our mistakes when shaping tomorrow’s Europe. By playing our part in a joint effort of protecting the common value base, we are protecting the foundations of our societies and of European integration, peace, security, stability, democracy and prosperity. At the same time we are contributing to a more resilient and sustainable Union. As our Presidency motto puts it, ‘Sustainable Europe – Sustainable Future’. This is the kind of Union that we want to leave for future generations.  Thank you very much for this topical discussion and for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 234, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I’m very glad that this debate has been scheduled because there is no better time to discuss the importance of our collective history in order to build our shared future. In the run-up to, and in the aftermath of, the European elections there has been a lot of debate about what the European Union is and what this concept means to our citizens. The thing is, the European Union is not just a concept. It is the largest and most tangible political, legal, economic and social project that defines our lives on a daily basis. If you can travel freely today across borders, if you can call abroad for the same price as at home, if you study at a university in another Member State and have those credentials recognised, that is because the European Union makes this happen. In order truly to appreciate these freedoms and these opportunities, we need to understand where they come from. We need to keep remembering. You see, these accomplishments did not fall from the sky. They were hard fought and hard earned. This year, we commemorate 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and more than 60 years since the establishment of the very foundations of our Common Market and Union. This Union was built on the ashes that fell over our continent in the aftermath of what happened 80 years ago, and which opened a dark chapter in European history: the signature of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union on 23 August 1939, dividing our continent and creating suffering for so many Europeans under totalitarian regimes. Today we enjoy many different freedoms: to travel without barriers, to speak, to write, to protest, to follow any profession and to live or visit wherever we desire. These rights and freedoms were earned and imparted to us by the huge endeavours of a generation that witnessed at first hand the ravages of two catastrophic wars and suffered their dreadful consequences. We should not forget that we, living and growing up in the European Union as we know it today, are the only generation that has not experienced a war. We need to continue paying tribute to the struggles of our predecessors. It is vital to appreciate fully the meaning of the fundamental values on which the European Union and European democracy are built, and never to take these for granted. In recent years, several challenges have cast a shadow over Europe: the financial crisis, migration, terrorism, disinformation campaigns against our elections, Brexit, to name just a few. Our citizens are rightly worried. Unfortunately, these challenges become a pretext for populists and nationalists to gain more ground, claiming that it is by closing ourselves off that we can overcome them. What a naive, irresponsible, dangerous approach! If we have learned one thing from the past – both the distant and the near past – it is that we can only face them together, in trust. The European Union was not built on adulation, on us against them or on the idea of the survival of the fittest. It was built on the basis of solidarity, of working together, of sharing responsibilities and of caring for and protecting the more vulnerable and weaker. More than ever, we need to remember these lessons from the past because if we ignore history we are at risk of repeating past mistakes. This is why we need to stimulate activities that keep the memories of the past alive as a means of moving beyond the past and towards building the future together. This should never come at the cost of one’s own country or community: we can be both the Europeans and patriots at the same time. That is why we should always strive to reach out to others and make diversity an asset. It is only through collective European actions that we can address citizens’ concerns and meet current challenges and, most importantly, maintain, uphold and strengthen our common European house. This should not necessarily always come from the governments: we want to empower our citizens and civil society too to get involved. The Commission has been in the vanguard with its Europe for Citizens programme, which promotes peace, EU values and the well—being of all. It was set up in the year 2004 with the aim of bringing citizens closer to the European Union. It offers funding for projects on the ground, in which the citizens can reflect on the past, participate in shaping the future and engage. Remembrance, as one of the strands of the programme, supports initiatives to reflect on the causes of totalitarian regimes and to commemorate reference points in Europe’s modern history. Raising awareness of remembrance, the common history and our own EU values is critical. Projects encourage tolerance, mutual understanding, intercultural dialogue and reconciliation as a means of moving beyond the past and building the future. Around 100 000 citizens are directly involved every year in European remembrance projects. In the year 2019, 45 European remembrance projects were selected for financial support for a total amount of EUR 3 million. The selected projects will address priorities such as civil society and civic participation under totalitarian regimes, anti—Semitism, anti—Gypsyism, xenophobia, homophobia and other forms of intolerance, as well as democratic transition and accession to the European Union. They will also commemorate major historical turning points in recent European history, such as the 1919 Peace Treaties, bringing the First World War to an end. An example is the Mémorial de la Shoah, a project from 2018. Thanks to a Europe for Citizens grant it has evolved into a truly European reference network on the Holocaust and other genocides. The Mémorial receives more than 250 000 visitors per year. The essence of our programme is to connect citizens. For instance, in early April this year we held, under my auspices, the high—level event ‘Europe for Citizens – History Defines our Future’. More than 300 participants from both the general public and the programme attended. Together with my colleagues Commissioners Jourová and Crețu, we debated with them a range of topics that are crucial for citizens in engaging with Europe. One of them was the diversity of memories in the European Union. Some countries have gone through specific experiences with colonialism or totalitarian regimes: while there are the facts, there is no single truth in the experience of an individual or a community. The question is: how can we reconcile differing memories, how can we build on this diversity and make it an asset for strengthening the European Union? I have trust that supporting remembrance will remain a priority for the new Commission. In May 2018, the Commission proposed a new instrument – the Justice, Rights and Values Fund. This fund will include the Justice programme and a new Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme whereby funding is made available to continue supporting work on remembrance. The new programme will guarantee the continuation of the activities of the current Europe for Citizens programme. I will also increase the European Union’s potential to promote and protect rights in the European Union and the European values by encouraging the engagement of all citizens in all aspects of their lives, enabling them to participate in the construction and consolidation of an even closer Europe and union. We, the Commission and I personally, remain consistently committed to a policy of values and historical responsibility. This is the only way for all Europeans, leaders, political parties and citizens, in the future for our common future.

There is, indeed, no future for Europe without remembering and being aware of our darkest hours. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with its secret protocols is definitely one of those darkest hours. It may indeed have been the single most brutal and cynical act that Europe has ever witnessed, concluded by two of the most repressive totalitarian regimes in our history. Obviously, we must never forget the victims and we must never forget the heroes who fought and stood up to tyranny. But we must also never forget that the Europe of today came about as a response to the Europe of 1939, and that this union of peace, democracy and shared sovereignty was built as a direct counterpoint to totalitarian atrocities and the partitioning of countries by the raw power of tyrants. This very contrast speaks to the core of our identity and who we are as citizens of the EU, because the EU is perhaps the only political body that defines itself not in opposition to other countries, cultures or organisations but in opposition to its own tragic past. What is crucial here is that this is a common history, because the painful experiences of totalitarianism are shared by both Western and Eastern Europeans and by both new and old Member States, and this provides a crucial common reference despite the 40 years of division in the Cold War. So this is why the European Day of Remembrance on 23 August is so important for pan—European solidarity. Obviously, the main message of that declaration and the resolution we will adopt tomorrow is one of solemn remembrance, but it’s also a message of vigilance against the return of past demons, because what we see today is a dangerous rise in xenophobia and extremism in our societies and Member States. This includes anti-Semitism and the scapegoating of sexual and other minorities as well as migrants, and the silencing of journalists and critics.

Never again – these words are to be uttered in memory of the Molotov-Ribentrop Pact signed by Communist Russia and Nazi Germany on the twenty-third day of August 80 years ago. The representatives of the two criminal ideologies then decided what the future of sovereign states would be and opened the way for mass murder, genocide, deportation. Finally, for some European countries, this meant a decades-long occupation. It is not just memory that needs to prevent the story from happening again. It is necessary to actively act and denounce the efforts to dominate, to win over the free will of others, to restrict freedoms. The European Union has long been a guarantor of stability. I hope that's what it's like. Peace has been achieved through close cooperation and the possibility of participation in the decision-making process on an equivalent basis for each Member State.

Nevertheless, we regret that in a united Europe there is disproportionately little talk of the actions of communism.

But they couldn't take away one thing from them: the support, the all-surviving faith in the future. This is what makes the nations of Central and Eastern Europe really strong. It is necessary to know this period of central and eastern European history and to keep its memory alive in order to understand the present reality of post-communist nations. For Europe's unity to truly be achieved, the reality of the crimes of communism must be recognised and condemned at the same level. This empathy is still lacking in the luckier half of Europe, where the tyranny of communism did not have to be suffered.

As you know, every year the Commission marks 23 August as the day when we honour the memory of the millions of victims of all totalitarian regimes. Totalitarianism is not about ideology or colour – it is about authoritarian mentality, practice and methodology. Totalitarianism is an enemy of democracy, freedom and human dignity. Our duty is to keep those memories alive to inspire and guide new generations in defending fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy. We firmly stand together against whatever threatens the values of our European democracy. I see here in this House a collective and democratic commitment to defend, uphold and safeguard the European project.  This European project was started in the aftermath of the Second World War, when wise and determined leaders – although it was very fresh in their memories what they had experienced just some years ago – took the historical decision to lay the foundations and to create a wider space of liberty, peace, democracy and stability. It is exactly what we Europeans are enjoying today.  However, we should never take this for granted. It is our duty to take this project forward. Today we know that certain challenges are putting the European Union into question. Now is the moment to show leadership towards our citizens. We must never forget both the privilege and the responsibility that we have inherited from our founding fathers and the previous generations. This is why it is paramount not only to remember, but also to ensure that history is not repeated.  If we ignore, or fail to understand or read history, we cannot draw lessons from the past. This is the biggest threat to our future that we are facing. This was the consequence in the past, when history was indeed ignored.  Today’s debate gives me hope, because I know how committed this institution is, together with the European Commission. Together we must uphold our duties towards our citizens. While some may try to make us believe that our citizens are losing faith or the connection with the European Union, we know that the opposite is true. In fact, we have data telling us that, on average, more than 70% of the citizens of Europe feel that they are EU citizens, while at the same time being attached to their homelands, to their nations. This figure has been steadily increasing, even since 2012, when it was at the level of 61%. We need to continue working together towards making all citizens of this Union feel like European citizens. By working together, I mean involving the whole society from all corners and strata.  Cooperation is in our European spirit, and synthesis is at the core of our democracy, because being European is not just a nice pleasant motto, it is the essence of tolerance, pluralism and solidarity. It is the recognition of our common values and humanity, as well as our common will and determination to live in a fair, free and peaceful world.  It is the embracement of diversity, multilingualism and respect for different cultures, identities and traditions. It is to care for each other, to love our own nation, to respect our neighbours, to share the feelings of belonging in our European family.  I hope that these efforts will be sustained with your support for a Union that remembers its past, draws lessons from it and does not revert to it – a Union that shatters silence, empowers unity and shines as a global beacon and as a unique paradigm of solidarity among citizens, communities and nations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 285, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, we need to learn a lot from our history in these times where our common values are fragile and need to be upheld.

The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a key topic during the Finnish Presidency and is an area to which the Council is strongly committed. Over the last years, we have – the Parliament, the Council and the Commission – worked closely with the aim of establishing an effective regime to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We particularly strengthened the EU rules in 2019 with the adoption of the latest amendments to the Anti—Money Laundering Directive. The Member States are due to transpose it into national law by January 2020. Once in effect, the fifth Anti—Money Laundering Directive will improve the powers of financial intelligence units, increase the transparency around beneficial ownership information, and regulate virtual currencies and prepaid cards to better prevent terrorism financing. As you know, on the previous fourth Anti—Money Laundering Directive, the Member States transposition is facing some delays. On this, the Commission will be better placed to update you, but I understand that some of the infringement procedures have already been closed. Through the review of the European System of Financial Supervision, on which we agreed just before the parliamentary recess, we progressed further and reinforced the role of the European Banking Authority as regards risks posed to the financial sector by money laundering. Lawyer linguists are now finalising the legal texts in order for it to enter into force in January. They have also included strengthened rules on anti—money laundering in the banking package, namely with the revision of the Capital Requirements Directive. With the fifth Anti—Money Laundering Directive, we streamlined the cooperation between prudential supervisors and anti—money laundering authorities. The prudential supervisors should now have better abilities to intervene in cases where activities endanger financial stability. These rules already entered into force, and Member States are currently transposing them into national law. This is due to be completed by December 2020. On anti—money laundering, we also have the EU list of high—risk third countries, with strategic deficiencies. As you know, in March the Council objected to the Commission’s related delegated act. This decision does not mean that the listing is not an important element of the ongoing work – on the contrary – but in order to achieve the full impact of this instrument and to ensure its quality, we need to introduce the list in an orderly process. We believe that in order to establish a strong and effective instrument, the Commission proposal needs to be established in a transparent manner and needs to incentivise affected countries to take action. I know the Commission has been working intensively on the new methodology, which it will present to ministers in October. The criminal law framework in the area of money laundering has also recently been strengthened through the adoption of a directive on combating money laundering by criminal law. This directive is currently being implemented in Member States, and the transposition deadline is December 2020. Honourable Members, the Council is advancing on other fronts as well. It agreed, in December 2018, on a dedicated anti—money laundering action plan to further improve the current system, and the Council is regularly monitoring the delivery of the various actions. We have also asked the Commission to deliver a post—mortem review of recent alleged money laundering cases involving EU banks, with a view to better informing possible additional actions in the medium to long term. The Commission published its report in July and will present it to the Council in October. On the basis of this important input and other recent reports we are inviting the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) to adopt the Council conclusions by December on an anti—money laundering strategic agenda that will guide the Commission going forward. Ladies and gentlemen, much is being done to tackle this important problem and, overall, our joint work in the area of anti—money laundering stands as a very good example of good cooperation. It is our priority as the Presidency to fight tax fraud, tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. I look forward to hearing your views on the matter. Thank you very much for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 290, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, money laundering hit the headlines in recent years and is at the centre of several key challenges Europe is facing today. The Commission is fully committed to safeguarding the EU financial system and its citizens from the harmful effects of the laundering of proceeds from criminal activities. Protecting citizens from terrorism also requires a robust system to counter the financing of terrorism. It is vital that our anti-money laundering policy retains the trust of citizens and also the trust of our international partners. In the past five years, together with the European Parliament, we worked hard to strengthen EU rules in this area. The revision of the anti-money laundering rules, the directive on criminal sanctions for money laundering, the directive on cooperation between financial intelligence units and law-enforcement authorities, as well as the strengthening of the role of the European Banking Authority, are all very important steps. But what matters now is the effective implementation of these rules, and Parliament is right to highlight this subject at the beginning of this term. I would insist on the importance of Member States’ implementing both the Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives. The latter will become applicable as of January 2020. And the Commission has watched Member States closely on effective implementation of the rules. Infringement proceedings have been opened against Member States for incomplete transposition of the Fourth Directive and some of them are still ongoing. We are closely checking both the conformity of the legislation and the way these rules are implemented in practice. While many shortcomings could be remedied through the implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive, it seems that some structural issues will remain. We addressed some of them in the report that the Commission adopted on 24 July on the state of implementation of the EU’s anti-money laundering framework. I believe these reports are a good basis for assessing what needs to be done in the future. The way in which anti-money laundering rules are applied in practice by all economic operators is of critical importance to the good functioning of the whole system. For instance, national banking supervisors must act decisively. Weak supervision was an issue in some of the large-scale money-laundering scandals we saw. Here a harmonised, directly applicable Union regulatory anti-money laundering framework could help. In addition, we could consider conferring specific anti-money laundering supervisory tasks on a Union body. We also found cases where supervisors were critically understaffed, failing to carry out on-site inspections as frequently as they should have done, or not taking appropriate measures when they found violations. Group supervision was also largely deficient. Prudential supervisors did not sufficiently take into account money-laundering concerns in their supervision of banks or in their suitability assessment of managers. We are aware that such programme problems are not limited to the banking sector only. They exist also in other parts of the financial sector, as well as the non-financial sector. This is another area that should not be overlooked. With regard to the report on financial intelligence units, the assessment confirmed that cooperation between financial intelligence units needs to be improved further, including through a stronger mechanism at EU level, to coordinate and support national financial intelligence units. It will be for the next Commission to decide on the next steps, but the policy guidelines of the President-designate are clear on this matter. We have to strengthen supervision and close loopholes. Finally, allow me to update you on the list of high-risk third countries. The Commission remains committed to delivering an updated list, in line with the requirement of the directive. Following the rejection of the delegated regulation by the Council, and the Parliament resolution in March, we have made strong efforts to take into account the views expressed by both Parliament and the Council. Our aim is to ensure consensus between all institutions on the process in order to avoid either Parliament or the Council rejecting the list. I would like to reiterate that the Commission will continue to carry out an autonomous assessment. We will, in principle, list countries which are listed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). At the same time, the listing criteria of the directive also go beyond the FATF criteria, in particular on transparency of beneficial ownership. This means that we will also list third countries with strategic deficiencies, even if they are not on the FATF list. Within this framework, we are working to refine the methodology of June 2018. Firstly, we aim at clarifying the interaction between the EU list and the one at international level by the FATF. Secondly, we proposed to detail further the engagement with third countries prior to a listing. Here we proposed to engage with third countries on the basis of our preliminary assessments and to seek commitments from third countries to implement mitigating measures within one year. This will help ensure that deficiencies are effectively addressed. We will also consider listing immediately those countries which present an overriding level of risks. We hope that this new approach will allow both co-legislators to reach a common understanding with a view to adopting the EU list on high-risk third countries. The Commission will maintain a regular political dialogue with Parliament and the Council in implementing the methodology. I intend to address the matter with finance ministers at the October ECOFIN Council. I would like to assure you that we will continue sharing the same goal of protecting the EU financial system from risks of money laundering posed by third countries.  I also want to thank the European Parliament for its continued support for this challenging but necessary process in the interest of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 291, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Markus FERBER", "mepid": "1917", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. If you listen to you like that, you really get the impression that everything is wonderful. Everything under control; the Council is committed and fighting money laundering day after day, hour after hour, and the Commission is examining all countries – all wonderfully. The truth is: nothing is wonderful. If we look closely at the Commission's audit report, two things have become obvious. Firstly, in 28 Member States, the Money Laundering Directive is implemented 28 times differently. We do not have uniform implementation in Europe. Secondly, cooperation between the judicial authorities and financial supervision does not work with the national authorities, and nothing works at all in cross-border cases. When I look at these two problems, there are actually two solutions. The number one solution is no longer a directive, but a regulation. If we want uniform law in Europe, we must go down the path of regulation. Secondly, if cooperation does not work and – do not be nasty to me – even though we have just negotiated that the European Banking Authority, as the supervisory supervisor, has to check whether everything is being done right: you are not fighting money laundering, but you are only creating forms between supervisory authorities. We need a structure that can be energised. We have OLAF in the Commission, we have the European Public Prosecutor in cases against the financial interests of the European Union, and we should really consider, Commissioner for Justice, whether we are not proposing that we also give the European Public Prosecutor or a similar structure the right to intervene, so that it can also be reacted to criminally quickly and it does not remain in the hands of the Member States.

But what are the point of the strictest laws if they are not implemented, if they are not properly implemented, if they are not subject to strict supervision? The supervision of the Money Laundering Directive is strongly national. This must stop! We are in agreement on this. We must also recognise that, in the long term, the problem can be solved with a European anti-money laundering authority. Until then, a European anti-money laundering unit must take on this task. Every new money laundering scandal is bigger than the previous one. We cannot wait for the next scandal to burst. And the second point is the problem of golden visas – a lucrative source of income for some states. Rich people can buy citizenship or a residence permit like a luxury goods, such as a car, like a villa, like a yacht, like an expensive handbag, without questioning the origin of the funds.

It just doesn’t work. We hear about a lack of resources. We had a hearing with the Commission and with the European Banking Authority and we hear about a lack of resources, legislation that cannot be implemented, legislation that is different in every country, lack of personnel, three to eight people. It is really, really not fit for purpose and we all agree, and citizens have to agree. They are worried because combating money laundering is basic to fighting against every possible crime, from drug trafficking to people trafficking. Fighting against money laundering is fighting those terrible crimes. Why does the system not work? The system doesn’t work because states don’t have the incentive to have a system that works: states have an incentive to get capital when they need capital. So, at the end of the day, if the capital includes proceeds from places which are not very clear, we turn a blind eye. And the problem is that the system is as strong as the weakest link. If only one state has a bad system, we’re going to have a problem in all the other states. We heard about the Danske Bank scandal – EUR 200 billion of money laundering! What is really scandalous about this problem is not just that no action was taken, and not just that the Estonian and Danish regulators let it happen, because for each it was the problem of the other: it is that, when it came to the EBA, the states said that, because there was no European legislation involved, there was nothing to be done. We believe that this Parliament is united. I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues to have a resolution together. Parliament believes that the Commission needs to do its work, the Council needs to do its work and Parliament needs to do its work so that these agencies are well resourced, so that we have the resources to fight against money laundering, so that we have legislation that can be applicable everywhere in the European Union, and so that we have a system that is European and that works for all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 294, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Sven GIEGOLD", "mepid": "96730", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which There is a security risk in Europe that governments are notoriously neglected, and that is the issue of money laundering. We have billions of dollars in money laundering every year. Criminals, with the worst forms of economic efficiency, earn billions and billions, so to speak. This money is laundered and then reinvested in criminal economics – in terrorism, but increasingly it is also buying houses, and in the real estate centers, prices are being pushed up accordingly. And as we talk about it, we see that we actually have the legal options. Europe offers the legal means for Member States to take action against it. However, we still have a widespread failure on the part of the Member States in the prosecution of money laundering. The ten biggest money laundering scandals that the European Commission has dealt with clearly demonstrate this failure. We do not have to go to some notorious tax havens such as Cyprus, Malta and so on, but let us start in Germany, the largest Member State. About 100 billion euros are made each year in money laundering in Germany. The Financial Intelligence Unit has 20,000 suspected money laundering charges largely unprocessed. The Authority is not working, although it has been a European requirement to equip it properly since the third money laundering directive, which has been in need of implementation for more than ten years. For months, I have been arguing with the services of the European Commission as to whether infringement proceedings are finally being initiated here. And it is precisely such infringement procedures that would be appropriate not only for Germany, but for a whole range of Member States, which simply have to implement the draft law accordingly, but also finally have to implement this bill in reality. That is why I am calling on you in the European Commission to open a new chapter here. Do not, above all, see whether the letter of the law is the same, but whether European money laundering law is actually being implemented! And for all those who do not, you are finally launching infringement proceedings that really relate to implementation! Ultimately, we must resolve this through European common institutions – as several speakers have said here – which can actually act and take action throughout Europe.

And we are still talking about money laundering activities related to corruption, arms trafficking, human trafficking, drug trafficking and tax evasion. It involves hundreds of billions of euros, so it is really a very important subject. What do the text we are discussing today and the Commission's assessments show us? It is that today there are inadequacies, unbearable failures. Firstly, the transposition of the directives has not really been followed up, and this is the case in the majority of Member States. So, at some point, we're still going to have to look at the offences. On the other hand, we have not talked about it since the beginning, but the European Banking Authority's capacity for impetus and decision-making seems to have reached certain limits - limits set out by the President himself. Finally, we parliamentarians remember the Council's refusal to approve the list of 23 countries whose actions are notoriously lacking in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

As a delegation of the 5 Star Movement we have considered the fight against this phenomenon to be a priority in our national and European programme. We have made an important contribution in this direction with the directive on combating money laundering through criminal law, for example by prohibiting those convicted of this crime from concluding contracts with the public administration, accessing public funding or applying for elected office. Furthermore, in the own-initiative report on combating corruption and organised crime, for which I was rapporteur, another step was taken towards the extension at European level of effective anti-Mafia legislation through common minimum standards, stronger police and judicial cooperation and better exchange of information. Those involved in money laundering are exploiting all legislative loopholes to ensure impunity, and it is therefore essential to have a European law enforcement framework that requires not only continuous updates, in order to keep pace with new developments in this phenomenon, but also transposition and rapid, coordinated and uniform implementation among the Member States, which is still lacking.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 298, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "   – Sinjura President, il-ħasil ta' flus, kif nafu, huwa konsegwenza ta' atti crimes – għandna diversi eżempji ta' political, non-zika, frodists, li kollha jaraw kif jagħmlu biex jaħbu dawn il-flejjes illi jkunu ġabu b'mod illegali.

In the framework of the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive, a number of corrective measures have been taken to address the existing shortcomings. It is important that, in transposing the directive into national legislation, Member States work together on critical points which have been identified, including poor information sharing at both supervisory level and the level of financial institutions themselves. Information sharing is key and we should make better use of new technologies in this regard, with the aim of improving the interconnectivity of relevant databases so as to increase access to data and facilitate cross—border cooperation. Also, as new challenges arise, such as broader use of crypto-assets, we need to adapt our approach to make sure these are covered by our AML framework.

I see the following main problems: national Financial Intelligence Units do not exchange the information needed, Member States do not fully implement the necessary legislation and undermine the cooperation required, while many banks do not equally apply EU rules. The problem is real. As was already mentioned, according to Europol about one percent of the EU’s GDP is detected as being involved in suspect financial activities. The lack of coordinated actions on anti-money laundering (AML) legislation deepens the already fragmented capital markets, which we want to integrate.

We did a lot of useful things both in legislation and in supervision and we pushed on implementation, but I would never say that the situation is ideal, or that there is nothing to improve. It will be a priority in this term of office for this Commission and this Parliament to take further action, and I agree that it should be, or could be, the regulation so that Member States will not be able to deviate from the purpose of why we are doing all this legislation against money laundering. We are not talking here about money, we are talking about serious organised crime. We are talking about the money which enables the serious organised crime, and we are also talking about people’s trust – trust that we will do something together which will change the situation and which will finally be efficient. We want to have a healthy financial system in Europe, which is the important element of European prosperity, so we have to filter out the risks and address them through properly functioning rules to be implemented by all. And to those of you who said that our system is only as strong as the weakest element of the system – exactly! This system must be taken seriously by all the Member States. I heard here that the Member States should be motivated. Well, the motivation should be the same everywhere – that the laws must be implemented – and that is the crucial task of the Member States. But we have negative motivation, we have infringements. I can give you a picture of what we are doing to enforce the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive. The process of supervision led to the opening of infringement proceedings against all – all – Member States, and at this moment the proceedings have been closed for five Member States only. For all the other Member States, the Commission has issued letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions and the procedure is ongoing. On the Fifth AML Directive, to be transposed in January next year, up to now we have received the following notifications: three Member States notified complete transposition, and another five notified transposition measures. For the rest, we are monitoring the situation, and we will act very soon after the implementation date. I shared with you my view that the regulation will be needed: it will be the right step forward. Of course, I am leaving this sector, so it is just my personal view after working on this topic. As to why we adopted the Fourth and Fifth AML Directives: well, the Fifth Directive, which was adopted in my term of office, was a clear and very quick reaction to the Panama Papers scandal and to terrorist attacks, which it was not easy to predict or uncover early enough because there were anonymous payments involved. We had to react to that. We also had to react to a very clear request for full transparency of beneficial ownership, and here I want to respond to Mr Kolakušić, or Mr Peksa. It was my personal very strong desire to make the beneficial ownership register fully open, fully transparent for the public, without differentiation between who has a legally proven interest and who does not, including journalists. And that will be the case. We will have fully public registers. For trust funds, the situation was more difficult, because some trust funds have a purely private foundation. So we are addressing, especially, commercial trusts, but for other trusts too there will be the possibility of getting information about the owners. Other steps forward could include full implementation of the regulation on financial intelligence units’ cooperation. Mr Radev has left, and I had wanted to thank him for his efforts because he was the rapporteur on this piece of legislation. He could give me his confirmation that it was a very tough exercise to convince the Member States to take the necessary measures so that financial intelligence units cooperate and share information with the law-enforcement authorities within their country, and even more difficult to convince them that there should be an exchange of information cross-border. So, to those who mentioned cross-border cooperation: it’s very weak, you are right, and we tried to improve it through this new piece of legislation, but it was not tough enough and we had to make compromises. Here too I expect some progress in this parliamentary term. On the question of having one Union body for better supervision, while we have taken the first step, the European Banking Authority should have strengthened competences, and it is in the legislation that there should be better data collection and the possibility to act when a Member State seems to be failing to act – which was, by the way, the case of the Danske Estonian bank. I still cannot imagine how it is possible, over five or seven years, for the laundering of up to EUR 200 billion to go unnoticed. Who failed? The investigations are still ongoing and we will know for sure who is failing, or who was the failure in the system. Denmark, in the meantime, has changed its legislation. So there are reactions, but I certainly agree that there should be one strong Union body which should supervise this. There was also a question from Ms Tomc: who will act at European level when the Member States fail in the field of criminal law? Well, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) will start functioning from November next year, and this will be the body having specialised prosecutors on financial crime. It would be worth considering whether the EPPO could not be the body which takes cases over if Member States fail. I know I am speaking for too long, but there were many questions. Just to conclude, Mr Casa mentioned the Whistle-blowers Directive, and this might also bring some benefits. Thank you very much for your patience. I felt the need and obligation to react to your comments and questions because this is a priority topic, which needs to be well mastered on a political level, at European Union level, in the next term of office.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 315, "date": "2019-09-18.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  Thank you, Commissioner.
